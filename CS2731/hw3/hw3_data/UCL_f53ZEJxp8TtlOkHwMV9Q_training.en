hi everyone welcome to the October
version of the QA hopefully all my
technology will work it's amazing that
it ever does QA Oh apparently it is good
so let me catch you up to date on some
news first that would be fun as far as
I'm concerned so the first thing I want
to do is share something with you and
that's this so I got this in the mail
yesterday from penguin UK from an editor
Nick Skidmore who I've been working with
for several months and so this is the
50th anniversary version of Alexander
Solzhenitsyn 's Gulag Archipelago in its
abridged form one volume of bridged form
which he approved it's also published on
the sent in their centenary of his birth
and I was invited to write a foreword to
it which I completed and which seemed to
meet with the satisfaction of the
editors and also Solzhenitsyn's family
it's about 500 pages long which is much
shorter than the original book which was
about eighteen hundred pages and
Solzhenitsyn approved the abridgement I
think I might have said that so it's a
remarkable piece of literature and
history and arguably the most
influential historical document of the
20th century you could make that case
and so it was really unbelievably it was
an unbelievable privilege to be asked to
write the foreword and I hope that I did
a credible job we'll see about that it's
on sale as of November 1st now I've also
prepared a youtube video for it where
I've read the foreword and some of the
content of the book to provide people
with an introduction and I'm hoping that
this will be something approximating a
literary event so I invite you to pick
up the book if you'd like to and and
prepare to be
shock to your core I suppose is the
proper way of thinking about it so there
you go
so that's that next thing I was in New
York the other day yesterday literally
finalizing what I hope is a deal for my
second book and perhaps books after that
but certainly for the second book which
is tentatively entitled 12 more rules
for life there you go
originally there were 42 rules and I
haven't used them all up so there's
plenty of reason for continuing as far
as I'm concerned and I've written a fair
bit of it and it seems to be going well
and I'm hoping that I can do a better
job of the second book that's the goal
and that's what I discussed with the
editorial team is that I want the next
book to be substantially better than the
last one was hopefully I can manage that
so that's well and good as well I'm
hoping that I'd have that book done by
next September something approximating
that maybe for publication the following
January now I've got a year after that
if I need it depending on what happens
this year but that's the plan and then
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
what's happening with me over the next I
suppose year really I might as well tell
you that maybe you're you'd be
interested in knowing so the first thing
is is that tonight I'm going with Tammy
my wife who's been traveling me with me
this whole time we've we've finished 85
cities in the tour so far and they've
gone really well I would say so we
spoken to about 250,000 people I've been
travelling with Dave Rubin of the Rubin
report and that's been entertaining he's
very comical and has been a good adjunct
to add a bit of levity and also a
certain degree of seriousness so that's
good so on Sunday I'm speaking in Dublin
and on the 23rd that's Tuesday on Oslo
I'll just go through the cities you can
look up the dates at Jordan P Peterson
comm forward slash events if you want
Manchester Oxford Glasgow
Edinboro Amsterdam Cambridge Helsinki
Stockholm Copenhagen Birmingham Oslo
Stockholm and Helsinki so that ends
November 11th then I'm off with Tami to
Spain and Portugal to talk to book
publishers there and then I'm going to
speak to the trilateral commission in
Slovenia and Lubyanka and then we're
going to Hawaii I have a talk in Hawaii
and that's at the end of November then
to New York maybe I'm going to talk to
dr. oz again that's not finalized but it
seems probable then I'm going to
Washington to talk to some people there
and then to Florida for a bit of a break
from Canadian winter even though I won't
have experienced any of that so far this
year and I have a speaking engagement
there as well and then in January
possibly I'll be in California we've
applied for a tech incubator in
California to further the development of
our educational software which is
already at the prototype stage I don't
know for sure that will be accepted into
the incubator and I don't know for sure
if we are accepted if that's that's the
route we're going to take because there
are other options we're also working
with a private school consortium to test
the software as we develop it because
when you're developing a product this is
a good thing to know if you ever do
build something you want to build a
product test it with your potential
customers build it again because you've
made all sorts of mistakes test it with
your customers and so on so and then
after that I'm going to Australia and
New Zealand probably to talk in about a
dozen places there and then back to
Europe in March and April and then I'm
going to write non-stop I hope from May
to September and then with any luck I'm
going to start the biblical series again
with Exodus and so that's that that's
the plan
so it's exciting and daunting and all of
those things so now you're up to date
and hopefully that was interesting
I really am thrilled about this this is
really something man it's really
something so and I'm the solzhenitsyn
family was happy with the forward so
that was really
positive and hopefully it'll bring a
whole new audience to the book that
would be a good thing this is not
something that we should ever forget
ever okay so let's say let's go to some
questions here any advice for a young
counselor soon to finish his degree what
do you wish you knew as a young
therapist well let's start with advice
well one thing I would say is you could
go to my book list and read the books
that are there there's at on my website
there is a list of recommended books
fiction nonfiction and the nonfiction is
categorized in different ways there's a
psychotherapy section I would say read
those books that's that would be helpful
those people young Freud Rogers I think
there's something by Adler unreel and
bur J some of the existentialists from
the 1950s a lot of neuroscientists
types very very smart people very very
useful to know what they had to say so
then the next thing I would suggest and
you've heard this from me before perhaps
is that it's almost impossible to
overestimate the degree to which merely
listening is helpful if you're a
counselor lots of people have no one to
listen to have no one that will listen
to them and that's a real problem
because people actually think by talking
and so for many people who are isolated
they have no one to talk to so that
means they don't think and that means
that their their thoughts aren't
straight and organized and you might
think well why does that matter but the
reason it matters is because the best
analogy I would say to do thoughts is
that the best way of conceptualizing the
structure of your thoughts is to
consider it in the same manner that you
might consider a map and your map should
be organized and things should be in the
right place because otherwise when you
use the map to navigate in the world you
don't end up where you want to be and
you run into things that you don't want
to encounter
and so it's actually extraordinarily
necessary to get your thoughts in order
since they help you simulate the world
before you act in it and so don't
underestimate how important it is just
to listen and then you think let's think
about listening to so someone comes to
you and they and they come to you
because they have a problem now you
don't know what their problem is and
neither do they all you know is that
they have enough of a problem to come
and talk to you so then they might have
a problem because really terrible things
have happened to them and anyone with
any sense would have a problem and so
then they have problems in lives in life
say or they have existential problems
don't really psychological problems even
though it might be psychologically
demanding to adapt to the real problems
you want to listen and you want to find
out well what exactly is the problem
space and how much of that is practical
and how much of it is psychological so
the first issue is you don't know what
the problem is and you want to ask a lot
of questions to find out what it is and
and and also what it isn't because often
people will come in and they're upset
and they don't exactly know why they're
upset and they might be upset about a
whole bunch of things and it isn't until
after they talk through all the things
they might be upset about that they find
out what they're upset about and what
they're not so another reason to listen
especially at the stage of problem
formulation is to help people decide
what their problems aren't well then the
next thing you have to do to listen is
like okay well now we we know what the
problem is
well what would your client view as a
potential solution so assuming that this
could be made better in some manner what
would better look like so you need to
develop Co develop a philosophy of
what's better and so that's a goal or a
name and it's almost like a personalized
definition of mental health but it might
be better to think about it as a
personalized definition of of a good
life and so that's the next thing you
have to listen about and then the last
thing you have to listen about and
negotiate as well is okay well now we
know what your problem is and we know
hypothetically what the destination is
with regards to solving that problem is
what are the strategies that
necessary to implement in order to make
that positive outcome occur and then
that's something that you negotiate by
listening every week it's like okay well
here's the goal what steps could we take
that you would implement that would move
you towards that goal can you take those
steps in the world will you do that this
week and then watch whether or not you
do it and come back and report and also
tell me and yourself whether or not
implementing that actually worked and
then we can come back and we can have a
discussion about whether you did it or
not and if you didn't then how we could
modify that and if you did how we could
continue and expand it and if you did do
it whether it worked and if it if it and
what unexpected things occurred and what
if any implications there are for
understanding your problem and for your
goal and so you know you you need it's a
map
you have a starting point you have to
figure out what that is you have a
destination point the desired future you
have to figure out what that is you have
to implement and design strategies that
will move the person forward and then
you have to test all those strategies
very strategic thinking very practical
thinking and so that's that's an outline
of how to do effective psychotherapy I
would say effective careful
psychotherapy another bit of advice is
people often who are young counsellors
are afraid and don't know how they can
not take their clients problems home and
I've got a couple of things to say about
that the first is they're not your
problems and it's very important to
remember that it's partly you don't want
to steal your clients problems I mean
you might think well if I could take my
clients problems on myself and lift the
burden from them all wouldn't that be
better and the answer is well no because
someone's problems are not that
distinguishable from their life and what
you're there to do is facilitate their
ability to learn to grapple successfully
with the existential vagaries of their
own existence and you don't want to leap
in there and steal it like let's say you
give us a spectacular piece of advice
and you're going to give advice now in
that but it's it's not that advisable
then let's say you advise someone to
solve a problem in a Sur
way and they go do it and the problem
solved it's like well the problems
disappeared but they didn't learn how to
generate the solution to the problem and
so they're in worse shape with future
problems and it's your victory in some
sense instead of theirs and so you don't
want to you don't want to steal from
your clients destiny and so and that
also frees you up to some degree because
it also means that you're not morally
obligated to take on those problems and
carry them home and the other thing is
is that it doesn't do your client any
good for their problems to sink you you
have a moral obligation an ethical
obligation a professional obligation to
remain sufficiently detached from the
situation so that your head is clear and
you remain healthy and and your practice
remains viable for the long run and so
don't forget to protect yourself it's
very very important let let your clients
sort out their lives you're there to
help you're there as a sounding board
you're there is a strategic and you're
there to offer strategic advice you're
there to shed light on the
symptomatology and to lay out potential
strategies for treatment all of that and
so and that's good enough you don't take
on any more than that so ok
procrastination and instant
gratification rule me nothing seems to
motivate me nothing seems to motivate me
what do I do
well I'm gonna give you some practical
advice I would say you need a plan like
you need a plan and not just a plan you
need a reason to implement the plan you
need both of those so something
motivates you you already said instant
gratification motivates you so you'll do
things for instant gratification
now look instant gratification is a
particular form of reward it's called
incentive reward and it's mediated by
dopaminergic circuitry the same
circuitry that mediates reward as a
consequence of using drugs like cocaine
or any of the drugs that people abuse
and so there are certain short-term
activities that are pleasurable enough
so they produce an intrinsic they
intrinsically produce a dopamine kick
and a lot of that's instantaneous
gratification like say eating when
you're hungry
at least the taste and flavor of the
food because there's also a satiation
element that comes along with food and
so there's those those pleasures that
speak for themselves
when you're looking at the long-run
things that are rewards that are delayed
don't produce as much of a dopamine kick
so they're not as immediately gratifying
and they're not as gripping in the
present and the way that you have to
overcome that is to generate a vision of
it's really it's not a it's not a plan
or a strategy it's a philosophical
vision that that that that justifies
your life in some way that you deeply
believe it has to be that and it can't
be trivial because otherwise
procrastination and instant
gratification are going to rule you so
we developed this program called the
future authoring program and it's part
of the self authoring suite and I'll run
through it very rapidly because even if
you don't use that program although you
could because that's what it's designed
for and I think it makes it easier it
outlines what's necessary in order to
overcome the problem that you're
describing so the first question you
might ask yourself is well what would
you need to gain and you have to have a
real dialogue with yourself to
understand this you have to take
yourself warts-and-all your useless
procrastinating instant gratification
seeking self and you have to sit down
and say alright you know you're talking
to your inner badly behaved six-year-old
it's like okay what is it that you would
have to have in order to commit to
something in the long run what what kind
of vision of the future would would
justify sacrifices for you and you might
say well you don't know it's like okay
fine that's why you have to break it
down so let me ask you some questions so
you might think well here's some things
that people need in their life because
your life is not going to be solid
grounded gratifying acceptable
meaningful relevant and devoid of
earth-shaking anxiety
without managing some of these things
most people need an intimate
relationship a long-term intimate
relationship because otherwise they get
lonesome and bored and crazy crazy in a
different way than you get if you have a
long-term relationship worse crazy they
need friends they need family so that
could be your your birth family your
parents your extended family your
siblings but also children so you need
to know well where does that fit in your
life what's your vision for that you
want to get along with your parents you
want to get along with your siblings do
you have a strategy for that do you want
to have kids at some point you want to
build yourself a family okay you need a
job or a career now a career is
intrinsically meaningful and and and and
usually very demanding in terms of
commitment and hours whereas a job at
least can be engaging in worthwhile I'm
it's usually more time limited maybe you
have more freedom outside of it but you
need a job because you need something to
do and you need some some routine and
you need some financial support and if
you can have a career and that's what
you want so much the better but at least
at least you could have a trade
something worthwhile not that a trade
can't be a career and believe me I've
got nothing against trades um you need
to take care of yourself mentally and
physically like how do you want to
present yourself in the world don't you
you want to be healthy mentally and
physically so that you're like a light
among men let's put it that way that
would be a good goal how are you gonna
handle the temptations of drugs and
alcohol and whatever procrastination and
instant gratification are tilting you in
the wrong direction so those are you
know seven things that you might
consider sit down here's the question
you're taking care of yourself like
you're someone you care about you can
design a future that would be good for
you if you were taking care of yourself
right for 20 minutes you can have what
you want it's three years down the road
you can have whatever you want but you
have to aim for it and work for it and
you have to specify it what is it what
do you want what would make your life
worthwhile what would be good enough so
that instant gratification would be an
obstacle instead of a means for
proceeding like I can give you an
example to some degree
when I was kid in my early 20s I did I
did quite a bit of drinking and partying
I came from a hard drinking background
up in northern Alberta and you know I
was out three times a week even when I
was in graduate school and I was
beginning to write seriously scientific
papers and also the work that became
maps of meaning and eventually twelve
if you don't have a goal you suffer and
then you get cruel and bitter and
resentful and then you start to actively
try to make the world a worse place and
so so because you can't suffer
pointlessly without becoming bitter and
you can't become bitter without becoming
cruel so you need a name the question is
then the question bitter what you should
name yeah a dream that's for sure so
then the question is what should your
aim be welcome everyone back to the
school of greenness podcast we've got
the legendary Jordan Peterson in the
house good to see you sir
good to see you very excited about this
you've got a book out called twelve
rules for life make sure you guys check
this out you've probably already got it
but if you don't I'm telling you to go
pick it up right now an antidote to
chaos you've had so much attention over
this last couple of years and I've been
digging into the research and just been
fascinated by everything you've been up
to and I just love your stance on the
vision you have for humanity in terms of
how we can all live better lives and I
think you simplify a lot of things in
this book which some things people don't
like to simplify
they like to complicate and I think
that's what's gotten you a lot of
attention is that you try to really
simplify a lot of these well I try to
make everything concrete so that it's
actually implementable right I mean
there's a lot of high-level abstractions
in the book because it ranges up into
the theological and the philosophical
but it's always grounded in what you can
actually do in your life practically you
want to bridge that gap from the highest
abstraction down to the lowest level of
behavior so that it becomes
implementable that's how philosophical
concepts take on their meaning right
because they have to they have to have
some impact on the way you see the world
and the way you act in the world or
they're not fully realized they're not
understood because partly what we mean I
would say when we say that we understand
something it's kind of a state strange
phrase to understand something but it
means to be able to embody it in a shift
of view and a shift of action
and then you've got it it's graspable
it's in your hand embody something in a
shift of view mother they say well
there's the same thing because your
perceptions are very tightly linked to
your actions because of course when
you're acting you're aiming at something
you have to be devoted towards some some
some aim some target would we play that
out in sports all the time yeah that's
why sports are so entertaining for
people is because they dramatize the
idea of aim right and then and not only
of aim but of the pursuit of excellence
in pursuit of that aim that's the game
and the reason it's a spectacle and the
reason that people participate in it is
because it dramatizes something
absolutely essential about life and so
you want to take philosophical
abstraction and you want to use them to
to structure your aim and then your
perceptions organize around that aim and
then you act it out and then you've got
it that's then it's it's become part of
your life it's not just in it's just
it's not just a philosophical
abstraction that floats free in space
why is there so much conflict in in the
world is it because there's so many
different perceptions that people have
well they think should be right or well
sure well part of it is part of it of
course there's conflict because we have
real problems and so life is actually
difficult independent of the of
psychological foolishness let's say
independent of the obstacles that we put
in our own path like this knowledge it's
already it's already fatally challenging
right life is the ultimate challenge
we will die yes yes there is well a
challenge yes well do fear pain although
yes all the things all everything that
goes along with suffering is a challenge
and it's it's it's the full challenge
because it takes everything you have and
so part of the reason we disagree is
because there are complex problems to
solve and then we also disagree because
we're willfully blind and because we're
more ignorant than we should be and
we're not everything we should be and we
tilt towards malevolence from time to
time and we betray each other and
ourselves and so we take a bad law to in
many ways and make it worse no not
always obviously and we don't have to
but that's sort of the baseline that
we're working against I think people are
most disappointed in life when they're
disappointed in themselves you know they
see that they've made things worse than
they had to be
even though the baseline can be pretty
brutal so yeah so the book and all my
lectures I suppose are put forward in an
attempt to take the high level
philosophical abstractions and to make
them into something that's actionable
and to take the next best action in your
life improve your life hmm
so we don't have to suffer as much
mm-hmm well and hopefully also so that
people around you don't have to either
so one of the things I've been talking
to my audiences about is the
relationship between responsibility and
meaning which is and what would you say
it's a it's a constant refrain in the
book it's one of its underlying messages
let's say or themes is a better way of
thinking about it you know if you start
with the presumption that there's a
baseline of suffering in life and that
that can be exaggerated by as a
consequence of human failing as a
consequence of malevolence and betrayal
and self betrayal and deceit and all
those things that we do to each other
and ourselves that we know that aren't
good that amplifies the suffering that's
sort of the baseline against which you
have to work and and and it's
contemplation of that often that makes
people hopeless and depressed and
anxious and overwhelmed and all of that
it and and they have the reasons but you
need something to put up against that
and what you put up against that is
meaning meaning is actually the instinct
that helps you guide yourself through
that catastrophe and most of that
meaning is to be found in the adoption
of responsibility so if you think for
example if you think about the people
that you admire well you think about
when you have a clear conscience first
because that's a good thing to aim at
which is something different than
happiness right a clear conscience is
different than happiness yeah that's
better
yeah that's better guilting yourself
you're not feeling bad about your sister
right you feel that you've just
acclaimed you've justified your
existence right and so you're not waking
up at 3 in the morning in a cold sweat
thinking about all the terrible things
that you've involved yourself in what
you said to someone they shouldn't have
said I you acted or what opportunity you
lost or or yeah or or the things that
you've that you've let go that you
should have capitalized on all of
that and so if you think about the times
when you're at peace with yourself with
regards to how you're conducting
yourself in the world it's almost always
conditions under which you've adopted
responsibility right at least the most
the most guilt I think that you can
experience perhaps is the sure knowledge
that you're not even taking care of
yourself so that you're leaving that
responsibility to other people because
that's pretty pathetic and I unless
you're psychopathic and you know and
you're living a parasitical life and
that that characterizes a very small
minority of people and an even smaller
minority think that's justifiable but
most of the time you're in guilt and
shame because you're not you're you're
not not only are you not taking care of
yourself let's say so someone else has
to but you're not living up to your full
potential and so there's an existential
weight that goes along with that Souls
you suffer even more hmm when you don't
take care of yourself or take the best
actions or do the work that you know you
can do you rely on someone else to
support you financially emotionally and
physically whatever it mean a home
whatever it may be
yeah well because you're not only you're
not only not being what you could be
you're interfering with someone else
being what they could be right so you're
you're you're not only a void you're a
drain Jesus that's a catastrophe and but
we usually don't even know I wearing
that when we're in that situation
because we're in a depressed state or
we're or we don't want to see it you
know you wake up at 3 in the morning and
you know and so and then you think of
the people that you so you admire
yourself or perhaps you can at least
live with yourself when you're taking
responsibility at least for yourself and
so that settles your conscience but then
if you look at the people that you
spontaneously admire and so the act of
spontaneously admiring someone is the
manifestation of the instinct for
meaning right and this is partly why
people are so enamored of sports figures
because the sports figures are playing
out the drama of attaining the goal of
attaining a certain kind of let's say
psychological and physical perfection in
pursuit of the goal that's the drama and
to spontaneously admire that is to have
that instinct for meaning latch onto
something that can be used as a model
and then that model should be
transcribed into
something that's applicable in life you
know when you really like to see in an
athletic performance you really like to
see someone who's extremely disciplined
and in shape
do something physically remarkable but
and and to stretch themselves even
beyond their previous exploits because
you really like to see a brilliant move
in an athletic match but you also like
to see that person ensconced in a
broader moral framework so that not only
are they trying to win and disciplining
themselves in pursuit of that victory
and then stretching themselves so
they're continually getting better but
they're doing it in a way that helps
develop their whole team and that's good
for the sport in general and that
reflects well on the broader culture a
great leader and their team they're
positive they're good sportsmen who
against the competitors yeah I'm
negative towards the other people
they're lifting them up too yeah like
the ultimate that's right so human
that's right so that they can they can
work for their own improvement in a way
that simultaneously works for the
improvement of their team and that and
and for the sport and while I meant to
the degree that that spills over into
the broader culture so much the better
so that's all being dramatized in a in
an athletic event and it's really it's
not philosophical it's concrete right
it's dramatized in the world and that's
what the games represent and so well and
it's partly because well in some sense
life is a game it is in that you're
always the analogy is that in in life
like in sports you're you're you're
setting forth a name and then arranging
your perceptions and your actions in
pursuit of that it and that you also we
generally do it well cooperating and
competing with other people that's also
the game-like element as well all of
that's dramatized in athletics yeah
that's like philosophy for people who
aren't philosophical and I'm not being
smart about that yeah it's like it
really is philosophy for people who
aren't being philosophical because it's
played out you know and you can see it
too you can see the spontaneous
appreciation for the human spirit
manifest itself when you see people rise
to their feet spontaneously in a sports
arena when they see someone do something
particularly remarkable see an athlete
who's extremely trained stretched
themselves beyond what you'd think is a
normative human limit and everyone
celebrates that
spontaneously so it's quite something to
ya to behold and so took me back to a
responsibility and meaning when we're
watching sports or someone and do this
act what does this do for us with in
terms of responsibility and meaning well
it it helps us figure out what we can
imitate give us a model yes it's a model
there's a model of something that I
respect
well even what philosophy is or even
theology for that matter is an abstract
model like it's laid out in words now
the problem often is is it becomes so
abstract that people don't know how to
bring it back down to the total
embodiment yes whereas something like
like the drama of a sports event is sort
of midway between philosophy and action
right and so it's it's not entirely
abstracted because it's not only coded
in words it's acted out visually you can
see an example of what just happens and
you can try to reverse-engineer how they
yes exactly well Italy at least you the
fact that you admire the person means
that you might start to try to act like
them now it's not easy and maybe that
would mean maybe that would mean that
you start to discipline yourself with
regards to a particular sport but it
might also be that you start to mimic or
at least affected in some way by their
their sportsmen sportsmen like behavior
right which is the ground of a certain
kind of ethic because if you can play
well with others
which is sort of the hallmark of a good
sport then that actually means that
you're a reasonably sophisticated and
civilized person it's really important
to learn to play well with others
there isn't that's the ground of ethics
and you can do it there and that's
setting that hopefully you could
translate it into like well well right
that's exactly right that's what goal
well that's what you hope for yeah
that's the goal of this so if the if the
goal of the game is to put the ball
through the ball into the net then the
goal of having games is to produce
people who can take proper aim no matter
where they are right that's exactly what
we're trying to do with with with with
athletics so on so I've been talking to
my audiences a lot about that about and
well and there's more to it too because
if the background of life is is there's
a there's an inner Attica Bellona of
suffering and that's complicated by
let's say malevolence and the proclivity
of people to betrayed themselves and now
which complicates it makes it worse then
the if you don't have a noble aim and
and and if that isn't in viewing your
life with sustainable meaning then you
fall prey to all the catastrophe the
pain and the anxiety and the anger that
that suffering generates and that makes
you bitter because what I'm here to say
is that and correct me if I'm wrong we
must have an aim in our life no matter
what stage of life we're in and if we
don't have some type of aim even if for
a few months of an aim of going
somewhere direction we're gonna the
suffering is gonna be even more
suffering pointless because we're
already gonna face the greatest
challenges that's right
you start already struggling that's
right there's no way adversity is coming
no matter what x range we have big goals
or small little goal or whatever may be
but it's gonna be less suffering if we
have an aim yeah well in not only that
it's worse than that even because the
suffering is zero meaning
well the suffering is pain and the
suffering is anxiety and uncertainty and
the suffering is hopelessness but the
consequence of all that is that you get
bitter and when you get bitter you get
mean and you get cruel and you start to
hurt yourself and other people so it's
not only that if you don't have a goal
you suffer it's that you if you don't
have a goal you suffer and then you get
cruel and bitter and resentful and then
you start to actively try to make the
world a worse place mm-hm and so so
because you can't suffer pointlessly
without becoming bitter and you can't
become bitter without becoming cruel so
you need a name the question is then the
question of course is what you should
name yeah that's for sure so then the
question is what should your aim be now
we have a program it's one of the things
I wanted to talk to you about that day I
I have this website called self
authoring com and that program helps
people write about their life and so
there's a past authoring program to
establish your aim you have to know
where you are it's like you're trying to
orient yourself on a map you can't
orient yourself on a map unless you know
where you are you also have to know
where you're going right so those are
the two relevant things the past
authoring program helps people write
about their life so it's a guided order
by our
we ask people to break their life up
into six epochs six sections and then to
write about the emotionally important
events in those in those epochs and to
detail out why why the positive things
happen and why more of that could
conceivably happen in the future and to
detail out why the negative things
happen and to try to understand why with
an aim to not replicating them in the
future because the purpose of memory
isn't to remember the past the purpose
of memory is so that you you figure out
what went wrong when something went
wrong so you don't duplicate it in the
future that's the purpose of memory and
the past authoring program can help
people catch up and you know you have to
catch up if you have memories that are
older than about a year and a half that
still cause you emotional pain when you
think about them or if you dwell on them
they come spontaneously back to mind
means you haven't it means that there's
part of your life that you haven't
mapped out properly and it still has
emotional valence that's gripping you
you're still holding on to that story or
it's still holding on to you right you
ever got to go
yeah yeah well you haven't been able to
navigate your way through it you there's
a pitfall there that you fell in and you
don't know how to avoid similar pitfalls
in the future and that's why your brain
won't let it go because it's saying
that's what the anxiety systems do it's
like this happened to you it wasn't good
this happened to you it wasn't good this
happened to you it wasn't good fix fix
fix fix it that will never go away
unless you fix it how do you fix it well
you have to figure out why it happened
right that's the first thing is like how
did you how was it that that situation
arose to pull you down and that's not
simple
that's why well that's why we have the
writing program because it's complicated
to think it through
but you but if you face it and you and
you meditate on it let's say and send
you do this voluntarily there's a pretty
high probability that you'll be able to
decrease the probability that will be
repeated in the future so oh well well
we that the second part of the program
helps people do an analysis of their
virtues and their faults the same sort
of idea what's good about you that you
could capitalize on what's weak about
you that you need to fix so that it
doesn't bring you down right and that's
I got a video yesterday from a group in
California that are trying to refocus
the Democrats and I want to tell you a
little bit about it today and take it
apart and analyze it if we're all in
luck given the importance of a stable
intelligent functional two-party
political system in the US and in
consequence everywhere else in the world
the video will make a reasonable case
for something approximating a return to
normad of political debate an image and
word I'll show you the whole thing first
and then we'll take it apart
we stand for the working men and women
always have and always will and we
define ourselves by what we've done to
help them get their shot at the American
dream Social Security the GI Bill the
Civil Rights Act Medicare saving an auto
industry 23 million people with health
insurance for the first time in their
lives and all along it was American
workers farmers and factory workers
immigrants and engineers of every color
speaking every language who are building
the highest standard of living the world
had ever seen
whose innovations were changing history
whose courage made America a beacon of
hope and freedom for those living in
tyranny around the world working people
made America work then something
happened some people in Washington took
the side of the powerful against
American workers the game got fixed for
an entire generation income flatlined
big donors made sure lawmakers cared
more about Wall Street than your street
back in the 80s a CEO made 30 times what
his workers made now they make 300 times
since the Great Recession almost all of
the income gains have gone to the top
point
Oh 1% not 1% point but 1% instead of
raising your salary they buy back stock
to increase their own bonuses they merge
companies and reduce competition so they
can make even more money
all while your cable bill gets bigger
your cell phone bill gets higher your
internet gets slower the seat on your
flight gets smaller their taxes get
lower and your health bills get raised
who's looking out for you
the people in power are so busy giving
tax breaks to the wealthiest that they
blow up the deficit and leave nothing
for roads and bridges nothing for
veterans or Medicare
nothing for job training something has
to change
and we're going to change it a new
generation of leaders who know what
needs to be done and who have the will
to stand up to those who would hold us
back
we want our America back the land of
decency and fairness of generous hearts
and big dreams and the freedom for
anyone who wants to work hard to make
those dreams come true I don't care what
your politics are I don't care what God
you pray to Oh what color your skin is I
don't care if you ride a tractor and run
a business and I hope your business is a
big success as long as everybody plays
by the same rules the same rules the
same rules because this is America this
is America this is America and this is
our generations great calling to rise to
the challenge like those who had the
courage before us to build a future for
all Americans not just the few to fight
for the higher pay working people have
more than earned to fight to make health
care available to everyone who needs it
to stop those who would try to cut the
Social Security and Medicare benefits
that are rightfully yours
to protect the environment instead of
selling it to the highest bidder to
fight for a government free of
corruption where your representatives
work only for you to build a future that
is just and free full of hope an
opportunity a future our children thank
us for leaving them
because democracy is built not bought by
the strong and the free
[Music]
you
so that's the statement the story the
appeal to voters and the establishment
of direction we want to take a look at
the images assess the text determine
what's in the video and equally
importantly determine what is not so
I'll give you some background first this
is about the group that's created it
after the election in 2016 we created a
political organization to work on the
important issue of expanding the reach
of Democrats and focusing on shared core
values future majority that's the name
of the organization under the leadership
of mark riddle continues to work on a
vast scale to rebrand and define the
party particularly in red and purple
states and districts in an effort to
shore up our base speak to swing voters
and turnout those voters who we lost in
the last election built not bought
created by Marshall Hershkovitz Greg
Hurwitz and Kelly curry is the
cornerstone of a new initiative that
answers the question what do Democrats
stand for the four minute film
celebrates the singular importance of
working people in the creation of modern
America while calling out the big donor
influences that have eroded our
democratic institutions over the past
few decades it is a patriotic optimistic
solutions-oriented affirmation of core
American values decency Fairplay the
belief in a boundless future that seemed
too often forgotten in our partisan era
it's a call to action to build a future
that is just and free full of hope and
opportunity first is the name of the
video itself built not bought this is
obviously a direct appeal to the idea of
Labor as opposed to capital and is in
keeping with the traditional Democrat
emphasis on the contribution of the
working class
I think it skews a little left in an
unfortunate manner strategically because
the amazing infrastructure around us was
built and
since people need to be paid for their
labor and because capital contributes
just like labor but perhaps that's a
forgivable rhetorical flourish let's
turn from that to the opening shot
[Music]
we stand for the working men and women
we open moving forward to a Sun dappled
mountain Vista that indicates the
possibility of upward movement progress
then we switch to an image of a typical
American nuclear family I like the
choice of that image a lot to open the
opening scene of a film is particularly
important and the fact that these
filmmakers chose to highlight a typical
American nuclear family strikes me as a
reasonable intelligent cautious and
somewhat traditional initial choice and
we define ourselves by what we've done
to help them get their shot at the
American dream
Social Security the GI Bill a civil
rights act Medicare saving an auto
industry 23 million people with health
insurance for the first time in their
lives this is followed by a 20-second
section detailing the Democrats
contribution to the higher standards of
living currently enjoyed by
working-class people in the United
States this seems to me to be handled
with reasonable credibility and all
along it was American workers farmers
and factory workers immigrants and
engineers of every color speaking every
language who are building the highest
standard of living the world had ever
seen
whose innovations were changing history
whose courage made America a beacon of
hope and freedom for those living in
tyranny around the world
working people made America work I like
this section quite a bit and found it
surprising it was surprising because of
the unabashed appreciation shown by the
film makers for the effort put in by
American working-class people to produce
a higher standard of living there's some
genuine appreciation for the fact that
this occurred and I see this as standing
it quite marked contrast to the altie
typical dialog on the radical left
concentrating on the pernicious effects
of modern culture by image and word the
filmmakers in this section testified the
utility of the efforts of people in the
working class to producing the
productive and relatively wealthy
society that exists in the United States
and elsewhere today so I thought that
was really good I also think it's
important not to miss the positively
radical inclusion of a young boy playing
an army helmet with an airplane that's a
bit of respect shown both to the way
boys typically play and the military all
simultaneously so that's quite something
then something happened some people in
Washington took the site of the powerful
against American workers the game got
fixed for an entire generation income
flatlined big donors made sure lawmakers
cared more about Wall Street than your
street back in the 80s a CEO made 30
times what his workers made now they
make 300 times since the Great Recession
almost all the income gains have gone to
the top point zero one percent not one
percent point but one percent instead of
raising your salary they buy back stock
to increase their own bonuses they merge
companies and reduce competition so they
can make even more money
all while your cable bill gets bigger
your cell phone bill gets higher your
internet gets slower the seat on your
flight gets smaller their taxes get
lower and your health bills get raised
who's looking out for you I think that
the section we just watched is the
weakest part of the film and I think
it's inclusion was an error although
there are reasons to decry excess
inequality
I thought the emphasis on the unnamed
they and the images of wealth as
unearned luxury were unsophisticated
cliched and unnecessarily divisive it is
absolutely necessary for the Democrats
and for all those who wish for a return
to politics as usual to distinguish
between the majority of wealthy
individuals in the u.s. who earned their
money honestly
and through benefit to society freely
chosen by consumers and the minority who
gathered their position through unsavory
or counterproductive means there is
almost nothing more important than
distinguishing between the successful
who earned their success and those who
managed it through exploitation and
conflating the two is an assault on the
ideas of competence aspiration and
accomplishment as such I truly believe
that all this section was a regressive
mistake a call to resentment as a reason
for civic engagement and an insult to
the hard-working people of the US whose
accomplishments were celebrated just
prior to the deliverance of this darker
message the people in power are so busy
giving tax breaks to the wealthiest that
they blow up the deficit and leave
nothing for roads and bridges nothing
for veterans or Medicare nothing for job
training something has to change
now I found this section problematic to
the people in power well for a lot of
the last while those people were also
Democrats and the tone in this section
of the film we just watched implies that
it was someone other than the people who
are addressing you her responsible for
the current mess I think this part of
the film would have been a lot stronger
had the Democrats taken some
responsibility for the corruption that
they're decrying instead of attributing
its existence to unnamed others lurking
somehow in the background this was a
great opportunity in the course of the
film for the Democrats to note their own
contributions to the current state of
affairs and to promise to do better and
we're going to change it a new
generation of leaders who know what
needs to be done and who have the will
to stand up to those who would hold us
back they're that invisible enemy made
its appearance again it's not good to
look for the cause of trouble outside
it's an ethical error it's another place
where the film makers missed an
opportunity to take responsibility on
the part of the Democrats for what's
happening around us today so that's an
ethical mistake we want our America back
the land of decency and fairness of
generous parts and big dreams and the
freedom for anyone who wants to work
hard to make those dreams come true I
don't care what your politics are I
don't care what God you pray to Oh what
color your skin is I don't care if you
ride a tractor and running business and
I hope your business is a big success as
long as everybody plays by the same
rules the same rules the same rules
because this is America this is America
this is America
I like this section a lot and again
found its inclusion quite surprising
there's even a bit of nostalgia for the
past
something never seen on the progressive
landscape there's emphasis on generosity
certainly but also real consideration
given to aspirations big dreams
something that has been woefully lacking
in the discourse generated by the left
this is reiterated in the statement and
the freedom for anyone who wants to work
hard to make those dreams come true
which is again remarkable for its
unabashed insistence
there's a relationship between hard work
and success and that success in itself
is desirable admirable and worth
pursuing then there's a positive
disavowal in my opinion of identity
politics with each speaker alone and
identified visually as an individual an
insistence on Fairplay an analogue of
equality of opportunity not outcome and
this direct statement from a policeman
no less and I hope that your business is
successful very radical in the time
where success is all too often
reflexively equated with privilege and
oppression
I think the ethos in this section stands
in powerful contradiction to that
presented earlier where wealth and
success was negatively portrayed which
attitude is going to prevail it's
obvious to me that the latter message is
most desirable and also most likely to
generate a favorable majority response
people vote their dreams not the
realities and it is perfectly reasonable
for the Democrats to reconstitute
themselves as the party that can make
the dreams of individuals come true even
if those individuals occupy a lower rung
on the economic ladder and to do so by
insisting upon a fair playing field the
same rules and to note finally that this
characterizes America this borders on
stating that a shared value structure is
a necessary precondition for social
harmony and for the possibility of
progress and upward mobility much more
of this on the part of the Democrats is
necessary and would be widely applauded
and welcomed and this is our generations
great calling to rise to the challenge
like those who had the courage before us
to build a future for all Americans not
just the few
to fight for the higher pay working
people have more than earned to fight to
make health care available to everyone
who needs it to stop those who would try
to cut the Social Security and Medicare
benefits that are rightfully yours to
protect the environment instead of
selling it to the highest bidder to
fight for a government free of
corruption where your representatives
work only for you to build a future that
is just and free full of hope and
opportunity a future our children thank
us for leaving them because democracy is
built not bought by the strong and the
free the film ends positively with a
call to the future to build something
promising it smart once again in my
opinion by the reference to those who
had cut benefits and sell the
environment to the highest bidder more
politics of resentment but uses positive
imagery of infrastructure productive
work and aspirational engagement
presents a promise to fight corruption
and closes with something positive about
both strength and freedom it could have
been better for the reasons I outlined
but it could have been a lot worse
there's much less of the radical leftist
tilt towards identity politics that has
characterized so much as the recent
democratic conversation there's a strong
sense of shared American society and
values there's tremendous emphasis on a
fair playing field and the importance
and promise of hard work not something
typical of those who insist for example
on equity or equality of outcome and who
claim that our whole societies of
patriarchal tyranny in my estimation
this film is a welcome move towards
classical liberal values and away from
the divisive politics of political
correctness and naive but dangerous
utopianism
so i'm here today with author greg
lucianov and jonathan hype
greg is president of fire the foundation
for individual rights and education and
jonathan height is a
an eminent social psychologist and
professor of ethical leadership at new
york university's stern school of
business
they have co-authored a new book called
the coddling of the american mind which
is an elaborated version of a famous
atlantic monthly essay they published a
while back and so today we're here to
talk about their new book and about the
state of the universities and i suppose
society at large so
thanks guys very much for joining me
today
so i thought maybe we'd start talking
about the book so do you guys want to
provide some background
uh maybe you could talk about the
atlantic monthly essay and what led up
to the book and then we'll get into the
details
sure sure about that over to greg
well um so it all started in 2007 when i
was lucky enough to have a full-on
medical level depression
um really really bad i talk about it in
some sort of detail in the uh in the
book i realize it's actually at a level
which i don't even i realize i wrote
about it with details that my wife
doesn't know my family doesn't um
there's a weird privacy thing that
sometimes happens when you're talking
you know dictating into a computer that
you kind of like this just between me
and the computer and now i realize it's
probably the most public thing
i'll ever write
but the thing that saved me the thing
that ultimately helped me deal with my
depressions in general was cognitive
behavioral therapy um in a sense it's
sort of like applied stoicism you just
look at your own uh thoughts you talk
back to the really exaggerated ones you
label them as cognitive distortions
these include things like generalization
catastrophizing binary thinking thinking
everything has to be they're all good or
all bad i'm actually particularly guilty
of these and amazingly if you just
actually learn what these distortions
are and practice every day to sort of
talk back to sort of the more anxious or
depressed voices in your own head it's
an incredibly effective treatment for
depression anxiety and it changed
absolutely changed my life
meanwhile as this is changing my life i
i'm still work i'm still the president
of fire which means i defend free speech
and uh due process and academic freedom
on campus
and um
i was what and while i was learning all
of these
intellectual habits all these ways to
sort of talk yourself down i was looking
around at what administrators were doing
and asked and saying to myself wow it's
actually kind of like the administrators
are saying oh by the way do engage in
cognitive distortions do engage in
binary thinking do over-generalize and
most of all catastrophize all the time
and i remember thinking something with
the effect of well thank goodness the
students don't seem to really be buying
it
and that's what changed in 2013 2014 um
prior to 2013 2014 since i started in
2001
the worst constituency for free speech
on campus was actually administrators
the best most reliable fans of free
speech you could run into on campus were
generally the students themselves and
then sometime around 2013 2014 we saw uh
you know suddenly they were demanding
you know everything from trigger
warnings to microaggression policies to
disinvitations for even people but both
on the left and the right on the
spectrum and it seemed like we said it
seemed to happen almost overnight and
this uh
and when i i went to talk to uh uh john
about it uh we we'd become friends
through a mutual friend and i said it's
almost i talked about my whole theory
that we're teaching a generation the the
habits of anxious and depressed people
from cognitive behavioral therapy john
got really excited about the idea and
asked if i wanted to write about it and
i was already a fan of john's work so i
was like absolutely
yeah so i thought that his insight
into what had changed was absolutely
brilliant i had just begun to notice
this in my own teaching i've been
teaching since 1995 at the university of
virginia originally um and it was it was
seemingly overnight right around 2014
these new ideas you know students of
course are political they protest they
object to things but what was new greg
put his finger on it what was new was
the idea that these words are going to
harm me not just offend me not just be
unjust
harm me we have to protect it was this
idea that students are fragile and need
protection and
the protection should come from
administrators from adults that's what
was new and disturbing and when you guys
talked in the book about concept creep
you know and the and the over
generalization of the idea of trauma
and you know one of the things that's
really struck me as interesting about
the safe space movements and the
microaggression policies and all of that
is that it does run so contrary to what
every clinician worth his or her salt
knows about treating anxiety or
depression
and
it's
one of so so that's kind of a remarkable
uh phenomenon in itself is that
what we know clinically has been
absolutely inverted by people who are
hypothetically agitating on the part of
students mental health and it's not as
if the mental health community has
stood up on mass and denounced this
so and i also don't i don't understand
that i also don't understand how we got
here you guys talk in the book a little
bit about
your
little bit of you hypothesize a little
bit about the internet generation right
and those are the kids born after 1995.
you don't put the finger on the
millennials but
but let's talk a little bit about why
you think things changed in 2013 and
2014. yeah sure let me just first say
your point about um about how this is
not this whole
these these new ideas are not clinically
supported uh something that we suggest
in the book we don't know we don't know
the degree to which this is going on
to what extent is this a sincere desire
for protection and a sincere belief that
students are fragile and to what extent
is it the pursuing of a of a political
agenda and and making political points
and using mental health as a cover i i
think both are operative and so and it
may depend on the context um so why do
you um why do you think the first one is
operative like i because this runs so
contrary to everything that's known
about the actual protection of mental
health i'm very skeptical about
attributing
um positive motivation to it like it
seems to me that it's fundamentally
driven by resentment well it's
so uh so you're absolutely right that
the psychological community does not
support this but yet has not stood up
very vocally to condemn it so i i we are
hopeful that psychologists and
psychiatrists everyone we spoke to
agreed that and strongly yeah that's
right that
exactly the worst thing to do for
someone who suffers from ptsd is to
sweep clean their daily life of
reminders thereby denying them the
chance to to deal to habituate to
de-decondition
the uh the power of these quote triggers
in the real world yeah well it's worse
in some sense too because one of the
things you do
when you expose people who have anxiety
disorders to the things they're anxious
about is not make them less anxious but
make them more courageous
right and that's why it generalizes
because the psychoanalysts thought that
exposure would just mean the fears would
pop up somewhere else but they don't and
it's because people learn that there's
more to them than they thought and then
when you protect them not only do you
not expose them which is a big problem
but you also teach them to generalize
the idea of their weakness which is a
really terrible thing to do to people so
you couldn't invent a more
counterproductive mental health movement
and instituted on campuses if you set
out to design it and that that's
something that we always try to
emphasize and one of the things that
made it so interesting uh for for for us
to look at was uh the one thing because
you know there are anti-free speech
movements coming from students uh in the
relatively recent past the late 80s and
early 90s for example um but the thing
that was so striking was that they were
medicalizing all of these claims and i
was like you know of course i'm sitting
there going like that doesn't sound
right i talked to john he was like that
doesn't sound right and we interviewed
for the original article maybe seven
different uh clinical psychologists cbt
experts uh you know for example and the
thing i keep on trying though i i keep
on explaining it is it's as if we're
turning up what could be a minor
aversion into something more like a
phobia because we're giving it so much
more power and the worst thing of all
that we're doing uh so much of our
campuses we're turning into a schema
we're turning the idea that i'm fragile
and that i'm broken into um uh into a a
a permanent sort of self-definition so
that's why i do think that there's
there's sort of a mixed motive thing
going on here i think that we have a
self-fulfilling prophecy going on to
some degree because i do think that that
some of this kind of hopeless ideology
is actually genuinely harming students
actually making them more
anxious and depressed and of course it's
really incompatible with how you have a
free open economy you also cite
statistics to that end so one of the
things you guys concentrate on in the
book is is statistics indicating that
there has in fact been there is evidence
of a decline in mental health over the
last what is it about the last decade
uh since around 20 uh 2009 to 2012 is
when things that's the elbow that's
where things begin to to arc up and then
they go steadily up uh um to about 2015
2016 we don't know if they're still
going up or if they're plateauing uh but
this is worth going into a little bit of
detail because it was just an article in
the new york times um richard friedman
psychiatrist wrote an article something
about how oh the idea of a waving of an
increase in anxiety is a myth he said
he said it's just based on one or two
you know there's been some a couple of
self-report studies in which students
say that they're more anxious and he
dismissed that and said don't worry
america your kids aren't becoming more
anxious
so we thought we we dug into this in
detail we did not want to catastrophize
we did not want to moment a moral panic
so we didn't want to say you know oh my
god the sky is falling kids are are
depressed and anxious so we looked into
this in great detail
and we were here so we were looking for
this data in our atlantic article and it
wasn't there uh that is that there were
anecdotes everywhere people were saying
the mental health centers are swamped so
there were plenty reports from mental
health centers but isn't this just
because
kids these days are more comfortable
seeking treatment that's why the mental
health centers are swapped maybe there's
no real increase
so in our atlantic article we could not
make a strong case we left it very
speculative
but just two years later when gene
tweggy's book came out igen and she
brought in data from four national uh
nationally representative surveys
showing that it really is an increase
now again those were almost all
self-report
what convinced us what convinced us that
it's real uh is that there was a there
was a major study done published in
journal of american medical association
looking at hospital admission data so
they broke it down by gender and you
always have to look male female separate
um they broke it down by sex and by age
group within teenagers and for all of
the age groups for
of the girls teenage girls hospital
admissions for self-harm for cutting
yourself taking poison this is non-fatal
um it's flat flat flat and then right
around 2011 2012 2013 it starts going up
and up and up and of course the rate is
lowest for 11 to 13 year old girls
they're less likely to do this but the
increase was the largest
and twenty says that
social media all the social comparison
seems to be hardest on the youngest
girls
so the self-harm data confirms this is
behavioral data this is not self-report
and then the real kicker unfortunately
is suicide if you look at the suicide
statistics they show the same pattern as
the self-reported depression data which
is um if you look at the first decade of
the century so 2001 to 2010 take the
average uh number of kids who killed
themselves successfully commit suicide
the rate for boys from that decade uh
through 2015 2016 those two years of
data goes up and up and up up 25
which is gigantic there's been an
enormous increase in boys suicide the
increase for girls is 70
7-0
so boys the rate is higher for boys
because girls make many more attempts
but boys
methods so so the increase is actually
fairly parallel but as a percentage it's
much higher for girls social media at
least this is twenty's argument and we
think there's some some validity to it
twangy's argument is that the spread of
uh of iphones and social media has
brought boys in to play video games they
play a lot of video games but those
aren't actually that harmful
it's the social comparison sites it's uh
um
instagram and and other things where
girls are comparing their lives to other
girls
and feeling left out that we think we
don't know for sure but that we think is
the most powerful reason why the girls
rates have increased so much
oh sorry john's been very
dated too because even since 2007 if you
just pick 2007 we're talking about a
doubling in terms of suicide for growth
yeah but but the 2007 that was the that
was the lowest year okay so if you just
so it's that's why it's best to not take
2007. it's best to just take the average
it just bounces around there's no trend
in the first decade
okay so we could hypothesize perhaps
that there's something approximating a
positive feedback loop going on here so
imagine because i'm i'm trying to figure
out why things have got out of control
say since 2013 it's like there's been a
tipping point and so i'm going to offer
a few ideas and you guys can tell me
what you think okay so
let's think of four or five reasons
so i think there's an increase in
political perceived political
polarization and maybe real political
polarization because the mainstream
media
mainstream media is dying and as it dies
it gets it gets more attracted to
click-bait journalism and exaggerates
the degree of extremism on both sides
and that's a consequence of a
technological revolution that the threat
that they're under from
from
from internet media sources so that's
one
the next one would be
the
un
opposed rise of the post-modern marxist
doctrines that characterize disciplines
particularly like women's studies now
you guys talked about um
a woman who
generated um
intersectionality theory kimberly
crenshaw and i've been looking into kate
millet who established patriarchy theory
or one of the people who established it
and she was a radical lesbian for
political reasons and had an alcoholic
and abusive father so i think that's
quite interesting and i think that these
theories fransha and and and millet's
theories were basically ignored by
serious scholars in the in the act
academic world but they've spread and
have had a disproportionate effect on
the universities and they're combined
with a kind of marxist viewpoint that
divides the world into victimizer and
victim
and then maybe we have the what you just
added go ahead you've already given us
two big theories let's talk about that
but it's on the political polarization
absolutely we have a whole chapter
on that the way to think about this is
universities are complicated
institutions nested within a broader
society
and they're changing and the broader
society is changing and so we document
how the rise in political polarization
and here the thing to focus on is not
polarization of attitudes about abortion
or things like that
it's how much do you hate the other side
that has been going up steadily since
the 1990s and so if you have a
left-right battle it's getting more and
more intense at the same time as the
professoria is going from leaning left
to being much further on the left so we
document this in the book
that the overall left right ratio for a
variety of reasons went from uh two to
one overall including everybody two to
one in the early nineties to five to one
left right ratio by 2010 so if you have
a more politically purified institution
at a time when the electromagnetic
forces of cross-partisan hatred are
ginning up then yes you have a more
politicized institution so there's a lot
going on there it's not unique to the
left it just so happens that
universities have been polarizing left
other institutions polarized right if
you believe in diversity if you believe
that diversity makes people think better
because it challenges thoughts then a
loss of political diversity is harmful
and it's a contributor and it's not just
the uh echo chambers that we create on
the internet although although social
media does sort of pat you on the back
for having the stick of an echo chamber
as possible i'm definitely you know a
big proponent of sort of the big sort
hypothesis um and certainly lived this
experience that um we increasingly live
in in more politically homogeneous
communities now big sword of course
talks about us living in more
politically homogenous counties but
charles murray and others have done
research about how we actually live in
even more politically homogeneous city
blocks that actually we are sort of
Well, good evening, London
Two weeks ago Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson
Met in person for the first time on stage in Vancouver
Two nights ago the three of us got together for the first time in Dublin and it's a huge thrill for all of us
To now be here with you in the o2
As I said to Travis when these events were planned I'm not moderate enough to be a moderator
But I'm going to do a little bit of
fielding to begin with
so
Let me start by saying a little of some of the ground. We are going to be trying to cover here tonight
We're going to be dealing with the conflict between science and reason
We're going to be addressing the legitimacy did I say science and reason
We're not addressing that
We're going to be looking at the legitimacy of holding on to religion in any form and
We are also going to be addressing the fact that we need to hide in a sports stadium
to address serious issues
But I think to begin with I'm going to hand over to Sam and he's going to kick us off properly
Thank you. And first thank you all for coming out. I you really can't imagine how humbling this is
Be here with you
You really just should just take a moment to appreciate this from our side because
Justin Bieber is not coming out to sing and in the middle of this as amusing as that would be
and you know though we
Put a date like this on the calendar with apparent confidence
There's really no guarantee that you guys are going to show up and we will never take this for granted
So it's really an immense privilege to be here with you. So
I thought I could start by
first acknowledging how fun this has been to have this these series of dialogues
With Jordan now, this is the fourth event. We've done and the second with Douglas and
We clearly share a common project we are trying to figure out how to live the best lives possible
both individually and collectively and we're trying to figure out how to
build societies
that safeguard that opportunity for as many people as possible and I think we each have a sense that
Ideas are really the prime movers here
That is it's not that the world is filled with bad people doing bad things because that's what bad people do
Oh, there's some of that it it is mostly that
So much of humanity is living under the sway of bad ideas
And it's bad ideas that can cause good people or at least totally normal people like ourselves
to do bad things all the while trying to to
Live the best possible lives and that really is the tragedy of our circumstance that we can be that confused
So this is where the difference between Jordan and and me in particular opens up
Which is how do you view religion in this in this contest of between good ideas and bad ideas and for me religion?
emphatically
gets placed on the side of bad and old and and
worth retiring ideas or ideas worth retiring and
I
Guess I but by analogy I would I would
Ask you to consider astrology right now Hannah. Maybe I can just get a sense of what I'm talking to
What percentage of you I want to know believe in astrology which is to say but who among you and you can signal this by?
by applause or howls of
Enthusiasm what what percentage of you let me just spell it out. So I know you know what you're committing to
And you know how crazy your neighbor is in fact
What percentage do you believe that human personalities and human events and the difference between good and bad luck and a human life is the
result of
What the planets are doing against the background of stars?
Let's hear it somebody out there
Okay, so then you should know that something like 25% of your your neighbors believe that
There you go, so the
I'm here. Wait, wait wait, I'm hearing I'm hearing a heckler among the astrologers is that
Is the FIR the first?
Astrological heckler I've heard haha
You must be an aries, sir
So it won't surprise you I have a related question which is
What
what percentage of you I want to know our
religious which is say well who among you believe in God a
Personal God a God that can hear prayers a God that can take an interest in the lives of human beings and occasionally
Enforce good outcomes versus bad outcomes
What who among you and now again, I want to hear applause or silence believe in it that sort of God
Okay, so this is my concern is my concern with with what Jordan has been saying and right in
lo these many months
I
Feel that you're in danger of misleading these the second group of people that the way you talk about God
has convinced and will continue to convince some percentage of humanity that
It's it's fine to hold on to this old sword of God this God that can hear prayers and they can intervene or not in
the lives of human beings
And you know as we've begun to explore that I think there are a lot of problems with that kind of belief
If nothing else there are many such gods on offer and there and and devotion to them it becomes irreconcilable among the true believers and
My concern is it you could do
Exactly what you do with religion with astrology, right? It would be it would be no more legitimate to to
Obfuscate the boundary between clear thinking and and
superstition there because
the
This traditional God and the and the doctrines that support him or are no firmer ground
Than astrology is now today an astrology
Almost everything you say about religion
It's the fact that his organized human thinking for thousands of years that it's a cultural Universal
that every every group of people has has given rise to some form of it that it has archetypal significance that it
has powerful stories all of that can be said about astrology and it and in fact some additional things can be said about
astrology that are would argue in its favor for instance astrology is
Profoundly egalitarian, you know, there's there's no bad zodiac sign every whoever you are. Everyone's got a great zodiac sign and
You know, it's just a inconvenient fact of the discipline that if I read you Charles Manson's horoscope
you know 95% of the audience would find it relevant and
and that's just that's how easily falsifiable stralla g is but
My concern is that we could live in a world
Where societies are shattered over things like, you know different zodiac
Interpretations and we don't live in that world for good reason because we have beaten
Astrology into submission and I would say that religion in terms of revealed religion and belief in a personal God
is over the centuries getting the same treatment by science and rationality and should be and it is a a
Preferred circumstance that we live in a world that is that is shattered by religion
So, I think what I'll do first is adopt the
Exceptionally difficult and likely counterproductive position of saying something
Not so much in defense of religion, but in defense of astrology
knowing
knowing full well that that's fundamentally a fool's errand but there's something I want to point out is that
First of all
Astrology
was astronomy in its nascent form and
astrology was also science in its nascent form just like alchemy was chemistry in its nascent form and
so sometimes
You have to dream a crazy dream
with all of the error that that crazy dream entails
Because you have an intuition that there's something there
To motivate you to develop the intuition to the point where it actually becomes of genuine practical utility
now when we look back on the astrologers and
we view their contributions to the history of the world with
contempt we should also remember that the people who built Stonehenge for example, and the first people who decided
determined that our fates were in part written in the stars were people whose
Astrological beliefs were indistinguishable from their astronomical beliefs and you might think well in what sense is your fate?
written in the Stars and I would say
It's certainly the case insofar as there are such things as cosmic regularities
so it was the dream of
astrology that there was some relationship between the movement of the planetary bodies and the fixed stars and
Human destiny and that's what drove us to build the first
astronomical
observatories and to also determine that there was a proper time for planting and a proper time for
Harvesting and a way of orienting yourself in the world for example by using the north
It's also the poetic
ground that enabled us to identify the notion that you could look up and orient yourself towards the heavens and that there was a
Metaphorical relationship between that and positioning yourself properly in life and at a deeper level
The the the cosmos was the place that the human imaginative drama was
Externalized and draped itself out into the world as something that was essentially observable so that we could derive great
orienting fictions from the observation of our imagination and so
Part of the problem that that Sam is pointing to is the difficulty of distinguishing
Valid poetic impulse from invalid poetic impulse and that really is a tremendous problem
You you see that arise also in people who have religious delusions attendant upon manic depressive disorder or schizophrenia
but so much of what eventually
Manifests itself is hard core pragmatic scientific belief has its origin in wild flights of poetic
Fantasy and it's also the case by the way that that's actually how your brain is organized
As far as I can tell that when you and and it isn't just me. I actually it's it's there's a very large
What would you call it research literature?
Outlining the relative functions of the right and left hemisphere and it certainly appears to be the case that when we encounter something. Absolutely
unknowable or unknown
What we do is drape that unknown thing in fantasy as a first pass
approximation to the truth and then refine that fantasy as a consequence of
Iterative critical analysis and so Sam believes that what should happen
Is that the the poetic and fictional domain should be some planted by the rational domain?
Well, let me just close the loop there
it's not quite I think we we need poetry and fiction and then there's there's more to engage in with reality than being a
Scientist in a white lab coat, but we need to be able to clearly distinguish
fact from fantasy or fact from mere merely fertile flights of the imagination and
we want to be rigorous there and rational there and it's not that it's not that there's no place or
Mere creativity. That's not well, I guess well
then the rails of rationality look fair enough then but I mean then then partly what we are disputing is the the relevant the
What the relative import and the of those two domains?
Let's say the heretic and the fictional and the rational and status of religion now in that
Well, I have a hard time reconciling that to some degree with your with your more
What would you say formal statements about the problem?
because your mechanism the mechanism that you put forth above all outside of truth is
Rationality and it isn't clear to me if you're willing to allow the utility of spiritual experience
which you do and and and if you're willing to make
What would you say allowances for the necessity of the poetic imagination?
exactly how it is that that is also
Encapsulated under the rubric of pure rationality see
Let's see and here's something you can tell me what you think about this
And I've been thinking a lot about what Sam and I have been talking about by the way, you know
So I'm making the case in my writing that the democratic institutions not only grew out of the judeo-christian substrate
but that their that that they're properly ensconced within that substrate, but I'm also perfectly aware that
not every religious or poetic system gives rise to democratic institutions first and also that there are
Christian
Sub structures may be the most obviously in the case of the Russian Orthodox Church. Where the same
metaphysical principles apply but out of which a democracy did not emerge and so it does seem to me that
what we have in the West is the consequence of the interplay between the
fantasy predicated poetic
judeo-christian tradition and the
rational critique that was aimed at that by the
Enlightenment figures and that seems to me to mirror something like the proper balance between the right hemisphere and its poetic imagination
and the left hemisphere and it's critical capacity and
Then I would say that part of the way so one of the questions you brought up was. How do we
Decide which let's say religious in
Intuitions are valid and I think we do that in part through
negotiated agreement, you know because people have
Look even even among the Catholics say in the medieval time. There was an absolute horror of heresy
So if you were some mendicant monk
And you had a profound religious vision?
the probability that you were going to be tried as a heretic and burnt at the stake was extremely high because even the
gatekeepers of the religious tradition realized that
religious revelation untrammeled by
Something like community dialogue something like that was something extraordinary
Danger and so I would agree with you that
The poetic imagination and the ground of religious revelation is something that can lead people dangerously astray
But I would say at the same time that it constitutes the grounds of our initial exploration and that it's actually in a radically necessary
Okay, well briefly address that and I want to ask a question that brings Douglas directly in here
I I think this is an instance of what's called the genetic fallacy the idea that because
Something emerged the way it did historically
As a matter of historical contingency, it is the the the the origin is in fact good and worth maintaining
or that it was in fact necessary that we couldn't get these good things like democracy any other way or were unlikely to and I
Would say that that there's no Abrahamic religion
That is the best conceivable womb of democracy or anything else
We like science that were a great place to get Douglass involved so it but but I would just add one other category of
Thinking here we have what we think is factual and
Methods by which we derive facts and I would put rationality there and an empirical engagement with with reality
then we have
other good things in life like
Fiction and and flights of fancy that are pleasing for one reason or another and could be generative
toward the first category, but then we also have
I know I would acknowledge we've spoken about this before
Useful fictions and cases I would you know, hope rare cases where where fiction is
more adaptive or more useful than the truth right that there's a
Sometimes the truth can can be not worth knowing and I would argue that they you know, there are those cases
Okay
But they're not so they're few and far between but we should focus on that but some degree of so
I wanted to point to Douglas here and focus on that because I think your fear Douglas is that
my style or you know, Richard Dawkins or style or Christopher Hitchens a style of
Anti theism, you know, just let's let's just throw the vicar's from the rooftops now because it's time to end this thing
Literally get off Twitter now. But yeah
That's a hashtag. Yeah. Yes
Your concern has been that
And I think what Jordan shares this that that so much of what is good in our Western developed societies?
is
The very least maintained by mayn't maintaining
so-called
Judeo-christian values or the or the remnants of our past religiosity and that you know
there is a baby in the bath water that can be difficult to discern and
We can to empty the tub all at once because and this is very much of because there's a zero-sum
Contest with the the religious enthusiasm. We see coming from the Muslim world
And of course the Muslim world is all over the world at the moment
So in that contest between a very an older style of religiosity and the theocracy
really and modernity
You are not as eager as I have been to to pull up
Western religiosity by the roots
Or chocolate vicars. Yes
Yes, I think that's fair. I think I sit
metaphorically as well as literally between the two of you I
Realized from our conversation in Dublin some of
what your concerns are about what Jordan has been saying and what he is saying and I share some of the concern I
said to you then that I used the
analogy of water
And Eric Weinstein recently described to me as Jesus smuggling
But it was a consequence of a discussion about biologists. What do you do if you're discussing?
design intelligent design
You can be okay as long as your own
Bandwidth on this on the issue as long as your own depth of knowledge on the issue is very considerable. You can be okay
discussing that biology with somebody even a fundamentalist Christian
So long as you can follow every step of the way
But the fear will always be at the moment. You're not looking they're gonna smuggle Jesus in
Or they'll wait till the moment that you're not comfortable
anymore with the argument the bit when you're at the very end of your cognitive ability, and then they'll
Trust me. There's Jesus. There's Jesus
and
one of the things I realized from Dublin was
Although I think you may not think that Jordan himself is going to try Jesus smuggling on you
You fear that?
Somewhere down the line from what he's saying. Somebody else will do that trick. Yes, it's worse than that
I actually know the people the people who were clapping are doing that
I hear from those people on a daily basis
right so that the segment of Jordan's audience that is that is
Very happy to be told they can stay on the riverbanks of their traditional
Christianity for the most part and they don't have to get into the stream of
totally monitor and rigorous rational thinking about everything from first principles right that there's something that that the Iron Age
Scribes got right and it's right for all time
those are
those are the applause I'm hearing and and and
However, consciously or not Jordan is telling them it's okay to stay stick right there with a with a shard of the cross
Actually tried a little conscious Jesus smuggling on Sam to see how that would in a discussion we had about
The central archetype of superheroes, but I'm gonna try something a little different tonight
I'm gonna try a little direct God smuggling we won't bother with Jesus. Let's go right to God. Why not?
So one of the things I've really tried to do when I've been analyzing
Religious texts is to take them as to take them
seriously in the sense that I don't presume that I understand them and I presume that they're a
Mystery of sorts and at least the Bible for example is a mystery because we don't really understand the processes by which it was
constructed and we don't understand the processes by which we all agreed collectively over several thousand years to
Organize the book the way it
Is organized or to edit it the way that it's edited or the and to keep what's in it and to and to discard
what's not in it and why it's
Lasted and why it's had such a huge impact why I don't want to
Derail you but we do understand that the first part of the process all too
well
We know that the this there was a political and all-too-human
process of voting certain texts in for inclusion and some were in for centuries and then got jettisoned and
and sure a revelation came in far later than
whole
Generations of Christians who lived and died under the banner of the Bible and it was a different Bible at the time
They had the wrong Bible so well
But it's the same
It's the same issue that that we really don't just we really don't understand fair enough Sam and I'm not saying that political etcetera
Considerations didn't enter into it
I'm sure all human considerations entered into it
But there was some collective process of winnowing and you can attempt to reduce that to economic or political causes
Which is generally what secular?
Assessors like Freud and Marx both did and with a fair degree of success. I might add but there's still some mysterious
assessment of what it is that will be remembered that entered into it, but
It's a separate point to some degree. I'm just saying that my point my
My point of departure when looking at these texts is one of an essential radical ignorance. I don't
that I understand the mechanisms by which they were generated or edited or collected or kept or remembered or
Why they had the impact they had now
I've been thinking a lot about the idea of let's say God the Father because that's a very common archetypal
representation of God God the Father so I'm going to tell you an
Experience that I had that I've never really told any audience about I had a vision at one point
That and the vision had to do with a dialogue that I was having with my father and you know
You have a father right and when you're a little kid you
act out your father when you pretend to be a father and what you're doing when you're acting out your father isn't
imitating your father because you don't
Duplicate precisely the actions that your father ever took in his life
what you do is you you watch your father across multiple contexts and you abstract out something like a
spirit of the Father and then when you're a child you
implement that spirit of the father in your pretend play and you come to embody that
Deeply so the notion is that people can abstract out something like a spirit of the Father and that that's part of our min
Pneumatic tendency, which is a very powerful human cognitive tendency
and in this vision I
first started to talk with my father and I would say more with the spirit of my father because he wasn't actually there and
I would say it was the wisest part of him and then that sort of
transformed into a discussion that I had with a series of ancestral spirits and then that
transformed itself into a vision of God himself with whom I had a conversation and this was a visionary experience and
then that all went away and I spent months and months thinking about it and I thought
So you guys can tell me what you think about this and this sort of stretches my cognitive ability to to its utmost
Limit to contemplate such things but here's a biological argument
I already made the case that a child can extract out the spirit of the father and embody it and that's
Necessary insofar as you're going to be a father in the wise one
But we can also extract out the spirit of the father over much longer periods of time
Because my father was a father because he imitated his fall
Who imitated his father who imitated his father as far back in time as you can go and there's a cumulative
development of the Spirit of the Father across time
now then the question might be does this spirit of the father have any reality other than the
Metaphorical and I would say damn right?
It has a reality and I can describe a biological reality and and and I don't know what this says about any background metaphysics
But here's our hypothesis
We know
that human beings
Separated from chimpanzees over the course of the last 7 million years at least in large part because of human female sexual
selectivity so it was the spirit of
Femininity collectively that helped elevate us to the degree that we have been elevated above our chimpanzee Co ancestor
But here's in something interesting to contemplate
What is it precisely that makes men what makes men desirable to women and so I have a bit of a hypothesis about that
So here's what men do
They get together in productive groups and the orient themselves toward a certain task and they produce a hierarchy
around that task because whenever you implement a task you produce a hierarchy and
They vote up the most
Competent men to the top of the hierarchy and then the women select the competent men from the top of the hierarchy
But the vote that determines who the competent men are that are more likely to reproduce as a consequence of male
Evaluation of men and that's occurred over millennia
And so there's a spirit of the father that's embedded in the patriarchal hierarchy that acts as the primary selection mechanism
that offers men up to women and plays a
cardinal role in human evolution and it looks like we've we've
Personified that spirit of the father in our religious imagery and and that's that's how it looks to me
But then there's something that's even more mysterious and deep about that. That's worth considering is that
apparently the entire course of
evolutionary history has conspired to produce human beings and we could argue that it could have been different but it certainly hasn't been different and
That means that that selective spirit of the Father has been part of the process. That's
Generated our very being and it's certainly possible that that collective spirit of the Father
We fly something metaphysically fundamental about the structure of reality itself
Yes, well
Insofar as I
Agree with with virtually all of that. I should say that none of that
Should give comfort to people who want to hold on to this notion that
Certain of our books might have been revealed by the creator of the universe
Well, it depends on what you mean by the creator like well, you know
I'm just saying that that that the world we're living in now is one in which we have whole societies
Shattered over this notion that some books weren't written by human beings, right? There's a different class of book, right?
there's a different shelf in the library where the the products of
almost certainly merely human brains are
Venerated for all time and and considered uneditable and unag nora Bulai by the majority of human beings
yeah, it's it's clear clear that revelation can devolve into but
Unbelievers are real. But any
There's a risk in all this always is is it often made critique
But that when you're talking about religion you're talking about the Inquisition you're talking about the jihadists. You're not talking about
Somebody who wants to go to their local Anglican Church once a year
Maybe get the children to school and maybe when they're at some desolate moment of their lives
returns to this as the place that stores meaning
I mean the thing that I think Jordan and I are in agreement on in this is is that thing?
Quote from shop and how and the dialogue on religion when he says, you know
The truth may be like water and needs vessels to carry it and when we were talking about this the other night
You know you admitted that one of the consequences perhaps of the you know
The parents sort of going through the belief structures. They may not believe in anymore
But they keep doing it as a demonstration of what you said was the the you know
the non embarrassing options that atheists have come up with but it may also be that
That since we don't have very many vessels
that cracked and
damaged and sometimes transparent as they are what vessels you have might be worth holding on to
well, no, I think I think the challenge here is
I mean it feels that well, first of all, we should first notice that these comments very often take the form of
You and I don't need this stuff
But most other people do right and that is it can't do it. Yes
I mean that's inevitably and if it is it's sort of to took that format one moment the other night
whereas where you acknowledge that that people of low intelligence are best placed in a
Conservative paradigm like traditionally conservative paradigm because there's less to think through right now
Obviously, you don't want your your view on religion summarized by it's good for stupid people
well, I do I do want to summarize to some degree that way because for
The opportunity again to put a foot in your mouth I
Would say not not only I mean the thing is is that we're all stupid and and some of us are far stupider than others
But we're not we're not that stupid
Well, but there's another problem Sam I think and and and this is obviously a contentious one one of the things I I don't go
to church
But there is one thing I admire about the church and that is that it's managed to serve as a repository
for these
Fundamental underlying fictions for two millennia, and that's really something bloody. Unbelievable. I mean the great
What would you say is bloody? Unbelievable? Look Sam there. Everything's everything's everything's soaked in blood
We have no disagreement about that
but the secular
Alternatives that we produced in the 20th century were certainly no less blood sword and they produced nothing of any program within it whatsoever
We did not do it now, but we have to put to bed that secular canard what we are using
well, it's just it's just not so that
Stalinism was the product of secularism or atheism. And nor was that product
It wasn't an inevitable project or is our product
Well, it wasn't Bey and please anyone who has this meme in in your head
Please just allow the next sentences I speak to just push it out because it's I'm so sick of hearing this
This this idea that the greatest crimes of the 20th century were somehow the product of atheism, right?
They say when you look at what actually engineered these atrocities
It was something that looked very much like a religion
It was a religion in every way apart from an explicit commitment to other worldliness
It was based on that's a bit different dis dogmatism through and through it was based on a personality
cults that that grew up around figures like Stalin and Hitler and now
It's these were it was not the ideas of Bertrand Russell and David Hume
That brought us to the gulag or to Auschwitz, but then you say it's the thoughts of Jesus Christ. I very well know
It's true. No, I can say that I can say it was the thought of st
Augustine and I can say it was the thought of st. Thomas Aquinas
Explicitly that gave us the Inquisition. This is the fact
It can I make a suggestion? Yeah, I mean, this is a general one as well as one for tonight
but the whole discussion
I mean I said the other night in Dublin that to a great accessory
books are written about the period we're living in they'll probably be described as the
Post Holocaust period in history the post-world War two ERA in Europe. It's still going on
they were still we're still going through this try to work out what happened and
I
Have to say one thing that I had any rated equally tired of is the claim that this has got to be a tennis game
between the religious and the non-religious but people say
That the 20th century's crimes were committed by atheists
Sometimes true often wrong or that the 20th century's crimes were committed by people who are religious sometimes true often wrong
Why do you think nobody you're not observing a crucial distinction here because I would never be tempted to hold religion accountable
For the bad things that religious people do that have no connection to religion, right?
So if a Muslim Rob's a liquor store, I'm not gonna blame Islam for that
There's no job
Not a us
There's no doctrine that makes sense of that behavior what I blame religion for and likewise
There's no doctrine in the mere loss of religion a ie atheism that gets you the gulag, right? Oh, there is
No, there's not there's not I just let me just flesh out this point for one more a second
The only thing I blame religion for are the things that it becomes
rational to do by the light of these beliefs if you accept these doctrines a
rational and good person
can be tempted to join Isis
That's my concern a rational and good person can be tempted to support the Inquisition. But of the many things they had in common
This is the point that David Berlinski made in his book
What did the nkvd have in common with everyone who oversaw the gulag the SS
People who guarded the camps of people who put people on trains. What did they all have in common?
What are they have in common with MAO?
Among other things they had in common the fact that none of them thought that God was watching them
None of them thought that they were being observed and would be held it
You dick God is on your side
We have just as many examples where people do it because they think God is on their side, right?
Sure, cuz I think watching and clapping. I'm not denying that I'm saying that the attempt to make this at a tennis match
Over the 20th century's mistake. We we're still trying to work out what caused it religion had a role a fizz amader role
But that the perpetual tennis match of it
I think well and there is something to be said at a more sophisticated
level I would say for the idea that you have an obligation to a
Transcendent ethic now you make that claim in the moral landscape you lay out a transcendent ethic in my estimation
that's one that puts the
onus of the of
responsibility on the individual to act in a way that at
minimum
minimizes suffering and so and you think of that as a statement of fact that that's
The proper way of being and I think about it as an axiomatic statement of faith, and that's one of our differences
but I have
been very careful in my analysis of the relationship between the idea of sovereignty and the idea of
Religious belief and one of the things that I have worked out
I think partly from reading such people as le atta and Jung was that
the there is an emergent idea of sovereignty that does involve being accountable to a god and
Here's how he would justify that and I would think about this essentially from a practical and biological perspective
independent of any metaphysical reality that it might have so the ancient Mesopotamians for example believed that their
emperor was the incarnation or the representative of a god named Marduk and
That actually bestowed certain ethical responsibilities on the ruler
And so the ruler had to be a good Marduk in order to be a sovereign to be regarded as sovereign he had to be
the embodiment of these divine principles and it took the Mesopotamians a very very long period of time
perhaps several tens of thousands of years
they weren't Mesopotamian during that whole time obviously to work out what those principles of sovereignty should be and
The Mesopotamians encoded this in their fictions and their religious fictions
Making essentially the proposition that the proper ruler had to have eyes all the way around his head
because that was one of the attributes of Marduk, so he was someone who was genuinely paying attention who was capable of
Coming into voluntary contact with with the great
chaotic sub structure of being and cutting it into pieces and making the habitable world and also speaking words that were
truthful that that had the power the magic power of truth and
The the the ruler had to act that out if he was
going to be the sort of ruler that his people weren't entitled to slay and
Sacrifice and then once a year at the new year's festival
he would go outside the city the walled city and he would act out his role of Marduk and
The priests would humiliate him and ask him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been
good Marduk, so that he could remember that he had a
responsibility to undertake this this to embody this
Relationship with these divine principles and the thing that's so important about this
so absolutely crucially important is that it established the principle that even if you were at the top of a hierarchy
You weren't absolute
there was something above you that you were subordinate to and one of the extraordinarily useful ideas about the abstraction of
Even God as a personified spirit. Let's say is that it allows every leader to be subordinate to something
That's beyond him. Now. That doesn't mean it can't be misused
but it's a very very very
important idea except you can also you can get there the other way around you can realize that you
Even if you're at the top of the hierarchy
you are radically dependent on everyone else, but the
Tip of a hierarchy doesn't believe that sometimes they believe what they quote whatever the hell they want
But I'm saying if you if you're going to believe something that's compatible with with rationality
globally, and has the least conceivable downside I would put in that place not a
superstitious attachment to a notion of an invisible
[Music]
okay
[Applause]
thank you all for coming out
well good evening Dublin as you've just
heard
Jordan pizza and Sam Harris met the
first time in person two weeks ago now
in Vancouver they covered an enormous
amount of ground and there is I think an
enormous amount of ground still to cover
but I've asked them if they would start
this evening in the following way you're
all familiar with straw Manning anyone
who follows politics knows straw Manning
but I've asked them to do the opposite
tonight to start by Steele Manning the
arguments of each other to present in
the best possible most fair most
rigorous light what they understand to
be the others argument on all of the
major issues were about to discuss
I'm gonna ask Sam Harris to go first and
we're gonna go from there right thank
you so first thank you all for coming
it's really it's an immense privilege
for us to do this and I should say many
of you have sacrificed a lot to come
here people have come from other
countries I'm told you all dealt with a
ticketing system that seems like it was
run from a cave in Afghanistan it's so
again thank you all because it's you
know it's it's one thing for us to put
this date on the calendar and say we're
gonna speak here it's another for all of
you to show up and this is a privilege
we certainly don't take for granted so
and it's an immense one so short and and
I should say that though much of our
conversation together will often sound
like we're debating it will definitely
there none of us are in the in the habit
of pulling our punches there's an
immense amount of goodwill here and it's
it's true on stage it's true off stage
and we're all trying to refine our
beliefs together in conversation so this
wooden none of us view this as a debate
though we might stridently disagree
about one thing or another what so what
Jordan I think disagrees with me about I
think he's worried that I we clearly
have a common project we are both
concerned to understand how to live
lives worth living how can we do this
individually and how can we build
societies that safeguard this project
for millions of people attempting to do
this in in their diverse ways and so so
many questions immediately come online
when you try to do that but what is the
relationship between facts and values
for instance or science and spiritual
experience or our ethical lives and we
have you know as for the moment
different answers to those questions
Jordan is concerned
I in my allergy to religion
insufficiently value the power of
stories in general and religious stories
in particular that there's there's
something more than just naked ly
engaging with facts as they are but we
don't simply come into contact with
reality we have to interpret reality we
interpret it through our senses and and
with our brains obviously but you need
frameworks and as jordan would say
stories with which to do that you don't
get facts in the raw and jordan believes
that i because my purpose so often is to
counter what i view as the dangerous
dogmas within religion i ignore the the
power and even the necessity of certain
kinds of stories and certain ways of
thinking about the world and our
situation in the world that that not
only bring many many millions and even
billions of people immense value are in
fact necessary for anyone however
rational to build a society where all of
our our well-being can can be conserved
so i think if in brief that's that's
jordan's concerned about me
so Sam is concerned I would say above
all with the minimization of unnecessary
suffering which seems to me to be a
pretty good place to start
and he's concerned that he's concerned
that in order to do that we need to
develop an ethic and that ethic should
be grounded in that realization that
unnecessary suffering is worth
contending with and dealing with and
that and that if we make too much of the
divide between facts and values then we
end up in a situation where our value
structure has no super subordinate
foundational grounding and this is a big
problem so generally in the
philosophical community it's accepted
although not universally that it's
difficult if not impossible to derive
values from facts but the problem with
that proposition is that you end up in a
situation where either you lose all your
values because they're just arbitrary or
you or you have to ground them in
something that isn't that that's what's
revelatory and Sam is concerned that one
of the negative consequences of
grounding your fundamental ethic in
something that's revealed is the
emergent consequence of irrational
fundamentalism and so obviously that's
worth contending with and so he's taking
issue with the philosophical idea that
facts and values have to be separate and
formulating the proposition that we can
in fact ground a universal system of
values in the facts and that we can
mediate between the facts and the system
of values using using our facility for
truth but even more specifically our
facility for rationality and that
rationality can be the mediator between
the world of facts and the world and the
world of values and so the problem I
have with that I guess if if we can skip
briefly to problems is that it isn't
obvious to me how to produce an ethos
with sufficient motivating power
to to ground that conception of the
minimization of suffering say and the
promotion of well-being in a way that's
that grips people and unites the society
and so I think that's that's part of
what we're discussing and trying to sort
out with regards to the potential role
of narrative and religious belief as an
underpinning to this ethos we seem to
agree on the necessity for the universal
ethos we even seem to agree I would say
on what that is because certainly the
minimization of suffering seems to me to
be a very good place to start we share
our concern with and a belief that the
pathway to that ethos is in some manner
related to our ability to speak the
truth but we disagree on what that has
to be grounded in and how it has to be
grounded my sense especially after
thinking about our discussion is that
Sam makes what rationality is do too
much work and I'm hoping that not that
rationality is irrelevant or unimportant
because it clearly is neither of those
but maybe the Devils in the details and
hopefully we can get down to the details
tonight and we we for me we brought
Douglas into the conversation he's here
to serve as much more than a mere
moderator and partly we've determined
that as Sam alluded to that what we're
actually trying to figure out is what
are the minimal necessary preconditions
for the construction of engaged
productive individuals with meaningful
responsible lives in a society that's
stable enough to sustain itself and
dynamic enough to change what are the
minimal preconditions for that what are
the and and and how do we ground those
presuppositions those preconditions and
what price do we pay for for having them
because you never get something without
a cost and we thought that Douglass
would be very interesting addition to
this conversation because of course he's
concentrated on such things as borders
and when you set up preconditions for
social order you also automatically
produce such things as hierarchies and
borders and they don't come without a
cost and so we hope
expand the conversation to include a
discussion of those issues as well yeah
before Douglass chimes in I just want to
reiterate the fact that he has not been
cast here as our moderator though if
Jordan and I run off the rails I expect
Douglas to put us back on in the King's
English
I'm not moderate enough to be a moderate
no but you're more moderate than either
of us are but so I want I want you to
reset the part of your brain that is
poised to begrudge the moderator taking
up too much time because every moderator
has felt that and Fred Weinstein was
brilliantly aloof and uninvolved in much
of our exchange together but but Douglas
really is a third participant here and
and he stands between Jordan and I on
some issues in an interesting way so
that there say we have a three-way
conversation here where none of us is
really sitting in the same spot so can I
make a quick observation about some of
this some of the progress that you've
already made in Vancouver some of the
progress I hope we can make tonight
seems to be I see one thing that hampers
it and let me go straight to it with Sam
which is I discovered the terrific
phrase the other day that our mutual
friend Eric Weinstein came up with we're
talking about the manner in which you
can discuss within the sciences certain
scientific problems and he said look if
you've got a scientist who you know is
also basically a very literalist
Christian you will listen to their
argument a whole long part of the way
and there's some where at the end of it
you know you're going to be worried
about it and he came up with this phrase
I've I love this face he says Jesus
smuggling right
Jesus smuggling is you're gonna follow
all the way yes yes and then the worry
is that when you get to the bit that
you're not so good on that's when
they're gonna smuggle in Jesus yeah my
suspicion is that you have a reservation
about some of what Jordan is saying
substructures on stories are much more
because you're worried but at some point
either on this stage or off it at some
point when you're not looking
no no yes or when I am looking it's
going to Jesus smuggle yeah yeah just
carry him in on a cross well that is an
all too apt analogy because it's it is
what worries me and it's but it's it's
more subtle than that because it's not
just to think that you're consciously
doing it is is a different claim like
you there's I don't think there's
anything insincere about your argument
for the for the importance of religion
but it's it's also possible we've all
met the people who we believe are making
insincere arguments and are really
they're they're consciously putting the
rabbit in the Hat and then pretending to
be surprised when it pops out right and
and in the analogy of magic is actually
interesting here because we be in a we
had over dinner we're talking about the
the the difference between real and fake
art and we were talking about this
parrot is paradox that art seems to be
incredibly valuable and yet the value
isn't located in the object itself or
can't be obviously located there because
a forgery
that is the materially the exact copy of
some masterpiece is essentially
worthless and the real masterpiece even
if it suffered some damage would be
incredibly valuable and so where is the
value to be located but what worries me
about your enterprise Jordan and the way
in which your you seem to be linking our
national project in our scientific
project where the religion is is right
here there's there's a difference
between and magic as a decent analogy
there's a difference between
paradoxically real magic is fake magic
and fake magic is real magic the only
the only real magic in the world the
produced by magicians is the fake magic
where the magician like someone like
Darren Brown will tell you actually no I
can't read minds and I did put the
rabbit in the Hat and this is fake but
but the the surprise is that even
knowing it's fake you can't understand
how this effect is being achieved
whereas the fake magicians are the ones
who are pretending to be real who are
who are hiding who are not acknowledging
the mechanics the real mechanics behind
what is in fact effective you know the
illusion of the rabbit pops out of the
Hat and what I worry with with some of
you or the way in which you discuss the
power of story the power of metaphor and
the religious anchor in there is that
the the leverage and the utility can be
had even while acknowledging the real
mechanics of it you know the fake the
fakeness of the magic right and you seem
to suspect that it can - that takes all
of them wind out of the sails I'm not so
sure I'm not so sure what if it's fake
and what if it isn't well like what so I
would say that I do consciously
participate in the process that you
described and but but you see I would
also make the case and this is certainly
one of the things that we've been we've
been discussing that you do it
unconsciously and let me make the case
for that Freeman because I'd really I've
been thinking about it a lot and I'd
like to see your response so here's here
what I really read the moral landscape a
lot and I thought about it a lot you
know and so this is what it looks like
to me so you you you make the
proposition that we have to breach the
gap between facts and values because
otherwise our values are left hanging
unmoored and that certainly brings about
the danger of nihilism but also a
potential danger of swings that hotel
the tourism something will you bring
about right Rudy
believe that and then you perform an
operation conceptual operation and you
say surely we can all agree that and
then you outline a story about this
woman who lives in this horrible country
and who's basically just being starved
and disease ridden and tortured her
whole life and having just a hell of a
time of it to put it in a phrase and
then you say well surely we can all
agree that that's not good and then you
contrast that with at least in principle
the sort of life that we would all like
to have if we could choose the life that
we have and then you say well we could
start with the proposition that we
should move away from this this terrible
hellish circumstance and we should move
towards this more ideal perspective and
you say if we could only agree on that
then and so and so like so far so good
but this is this is there's there's a
couple of things that go along with that
that are quite interesting and so the
first is that actually what you're
claiming is that the highest moral good
isn't existing in that better space the
highest moral good is acting in the
manner that moves us from the hellish
domain to the desirable domain it seems
to me to be implicit in your argument so
there's a pattern of behavior that
constitutes the ethic well I would say
that existing and that's in that better
space is good enough as well as I mean
that there's the there's the question of
what it takes to move from where you are
to someplace better and then there's
just the someplace that's better
both of yes well but but we perhaps we
could say look what's the ultimate hell
it might be existing in the hell that
you describe but it also might be this
is something worse I think I think that
participating in the process that brings
about that hell is actually a hell
that's even deeper than the hell
so it's an analogous argument there's
the state of being in a good state but
there's also the state of being that
brings you to that good state and then
there's the state of being that's in a
that's a terrible state and the process
that brings you to that terrible state
and one of the things that I've learned
from the archetypal and religious texts
that I've studied as well as the
philosophical texts is that the process
that transforms society into
thing approximating hell is a lower hell
no well the reason well let me just
close the loop on that because I'm
pretty sure I disagree one you can
imagine to counter examples one is you
can imagine a sadistic being a you might
even call him God who would create a
circumstance of Hell and populate it
with innocent souls right now that's
presumably that action it need not be
attended by a lot of suffering or you
could imagine some no but it's still
it's still wrong wrong yes no you could
even imagine someone who enjoys generate
exactly yes it could yes so that would
even be more wrong than not enjoying it
right okay so we want to separate out
two things we want to separate out these
states of being and the process that
brings them into being and I do believe
you do that in your work because
basically what you suggest is that the
appropriate way to act ethically is to
act in a manner that moves us away from
hell and moves us towards a desirable
state now the thing is is that as far as
I'm concerned there's a couple of things
about that the first thing is that I
wouldn't say that that mode of acting is
a fact I would say it's a personality
and that what you're suggesting is that
people embody the personality that moves
Society away from Hell towards heaven
for lack of a better term and the reason
terms and the reason I make that
argument is because I think that you
recapitulate the essential Christian
message precisely by doing that because
symbolically speaking at least as far as
I can understand stripped of its
religious quality of its metaphysical
context let's say that the purpose of
positing the the the the vision of the
ideal human being which independent of
the metaphysical context it's certainly
what the symbol of Christ represents is
the mode of being that moves us most
effectively from something approximating
hell to something approximating heaven
and then part of that part of that
message is and this is also something
that's dead along the lines of what
you're arguing is that the best way to
embody that is actually to live in truth
I mean so because I would say that the
fundamental Christian ethic metaphysics
accepted once again is to act in love
which is to assume that being is
acceptable and can be perfected and to
person
do that with truth and that you should
embody that and then I would say that
the purpose of the representation we
could call the meta fictions or our
archetypal representations is to show
that is in embodied format so that it
can be imitated rather than to transform
it into something that's diluted in some
sense to to an abstract rationality
because I don't think the abstract
rationality in itself has enough flesh
on it so to speak which is partly why in
the Christian ethic there's an emphasis
that the word which is something roughly
akin to rationality has two main has to
be made flesh it has to be enacted but
is the is the flesh made of dogmatism
and superstition and other worldliness
is that part of what gives it its shape
and necessity I think traditionally
historically it has been and that's been
the problem with religion if you if you
dilute it of everything that is
unjustifiable in the light of 21st
century science and rationality I think
you what you have to get down to is
something quite a bit more Universal and
less provincial than any specific
religion Christianity per se
well it's interesting too though that
you know one of the one of the things
one of the points that you do make is
that you do appeal to or assume the
existence of a transcendental internal
ethics something like that which I would
say by the way since we're going down
this direction seems to me to be
something very akin to the idea of the
holy spirit which is something like the
give him a warm welcome dr. Jordan B
Peterson
thank you thank you very much it's very
nice to be here and to see you all come
out to spend a couple of hours thinking
about difficult things there seems to be
an appetite for that which is really
something
so let's exploit it so I started working
on the ideas that I outlined in 12 rules
for life well a long time ago and really
started when I was about 13 I was a
junior high school student and I met
this librarian who's kind of an
eccentric person very well-educated
person and she we I used to hang around
with my delinquent friends in the
library which tells you how eccentric
the librarian was because that's not
normally the place where the delinquent
kids hang out you know but she talked to
us like we were adults and that was a
word what would you call it a refreshing
that was a refreshing experience and she
knew that I'd like to read and she
started giving me real books she gave me
one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich
which was the first book published by
Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the Soviet
Union it's a story about the day of a
political prisoner in a in a work camp
and brave new world and 1984 an animal
farm and in rands books which was quite
interesting because she was the wife of
our Member of Parliament who was the
only member of the Opposition in our
province and he was a socialist an NDP
new democratic party leader as a matter
of fact and but despite that she gave me
an rands books because she thought that
I should be exposed to the other side of
the argument so I read Atlas Shrugged
and
The Fountainhead and well she was the
first person who helped me discover
literature let's say and well at the
same time I got interested in what had
happened in Nazi Germany and I wrote an
essay about that when I was about 13 or
14 about Auschwitz and what had happened
there and I never read that really never
left my mind I would say I think I read
Victor Frankel's man's search for
meaning at that point which is a book I
would highly recommend I have a reading
list on my website by the way at Jordan
B Peterson com and so there was a
variety of books there that have really
influenced me and and I put them up for
other people's use anyways I never what
what I learned about our Woodson about
Nazi Germany never really left my mind
and because I couldn't understand how
people could act that way how they could
not only be possessed by an ideology to
the degree that the Germans were a very
civilized country Germany you know so
was I suppose even a more spectacular
shock that something so catastrophic
happened there there wasn't just the
ideological possession it was the
cruelty and the gratuitous cruelty in
the service of that ideological
possession that I couldn't understand it
didn't
I couldn't establish a relationship
between my own being and and those
patterns of action and as I got older
that concern transformed itself into an
obsession I would say not so much with
what had happened in Nazi Germany but
with I think what happened what was
happening as a consequence of the
collectivist philosophy per se which you
might think of something that manifested
itself both on the right in Nazi Germany
and then on the left in all the
multitudinous and catastrophic communist
regimes that characterized the bulk of
the 20th century and they're insane
murderous Ness and that probably
culminated for me in the 1970s when I
read Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's Gulag
Archipelago
go which is another book that everyone
should read because in some sense it
might be the defining document of the
20th century and the fact that everyone
in the West isn't familiar with that
book is actually a signal of our
catastrophic moral failing I would say I
started writing this book called maps of
meaning in about 1985 although I had
been working on variants of it before
that and what I was trying to understand
was maybe the psychological motivations
for the Cold War something like that
many of you are old enough to remember
what it was like in the 1980s we just
went and visited the house in in wreck
javac where Gorbachev and Reagan met
which was quite something to see and
when they decided they were going to
bring at least some of the insanity to a
relative halt
thank God the eighties were a very
contentious time you know the Cold War
sort of peeked into at two times the
peaked in 1962 during the Cuban Missile
Crisis I don't know if you know this but
I was visited a nuclear missile site in
in Arizona about ten years ago it was a
decommissioned missile site
intercontinental ballistic missile
intercontinental ballistic missile is a
very large rockets and can go halfway
around the world and it's ballistic
which means it has the same function as
a bullet and the bullet is ballistic
because once you fire it it's gone you
don't control it after it it leaves so
once you launch a ballistic missile it's
launched there's no calling it back and
they told us they did a simulation
launch which is very eerie thing and so
to launch a nuclear missile is a big
console that sort of looks like the Star
Trek control control module let's say
and one person stands here and one
person stands about 20 feet away each
have a key around their neck and they
put the key in the lock simultaneously
and then turn it for ten seconds and at
the end of ten seconds the missile is
gone and that's that
and they both have their keys in the
lock in 1962 so and we came close again
in 1984 when I don't know if you know
this but a Soviet missile detection
system signaled the launch of four or
five missiles from North America and a
single Russian soldier decided that it
was a false alarm and refused to push
the button that would have resulted in
major retaliation he just died about a
year ago you can read about him on
Wikipedia anyways I read Solzhenitsyn in
1970s and and that made me me even I
would say more obsessed with what was
happening in in on the world stage I was
trying to understand why it was that the
systems of belief that we inhabited
let's say one typifying the Soviet Union
and in similar States Maoist China North
Korea wonderful places like that versus
the West we each had our own way of
construing the world the ways of
construing the world were set at odds
with one another and the fact that they
were set at odds with one another
appeared to be so significant that we'd
armed ourselves with 50,000 Hydra
hydrogen bombs on each side something
like that I don't know how much you know
about a hydrogen bomb you know you know
about atomic bombs you know that a
hydrogen bomb has an atomic bomb for the
trigger right so so like the atom bomb
that was dropped on Hiroshima that was
something that was a fission bomb not
standard atomic bomb the first
generation but hydrogen bomb is
incontestably more powerful than that
and we were producing them in the tens
of thousands it's not like we don't have
any now but it was really some insanity
in the 1980s and people seem to have a
very itchy trigger finger so I was very
confused about this in two ways one and
from a psychological perspective because
by that time I did study just
to study psychology instead of political
science which was my original major I I
get I got disenchanted with political
science because I didn't believe that
people were fundamentally motivated by
economic issues I still don't believe
that that's true they're motivated by
whatever they're motivated by it can't
be captured by economics not precisely
it's very curious about what it was that
was so important about a belief system
that people would risk putting the
entire planet to the torch to ensure
that their particular mode of construing
the world prevailed was an interesting
psychological problem what was so
important about belief system that would
justify destroying everything that's
here risking destroying everything
because that was certainly the situation
we put ourselves in and more to the
point I guess or equally to the point I
was interested in two other things one
was were these differences in belief
systems just arbitrary and that's
actually a postmodern question I didn't
know that at the time no because you
might say the post modernists do say
there's a very large number of ways of
interpreting the world and it isn't
obvious how you determine which of those
ways are correct and so perhaps you
can't determine that any of them are
correct and then as a consequence of
your inability to determine if any of
them are correct then you have to turn
to something like power dispute to
establish which interpretation is going
to take precedence I would say in a
nutshell that's a post modernist theory
now that's tainted to some degree with
Marxist preconceptions but we won't get
into that but that's basically the idea
and it's an idea with a certain amount
of justification there is a very large
number of ways of interpreting the world
and it isn't obvious which way or ways
are right or why they're right so it's a
complicated problem and so I was curious
is like was this merely a difference of
opinion the West had a certain set of
axioms that it was acting out in the
world and there
Soviet bloc and the rest of the
communist countries had another set of
axioms and they were both arbitrary and
it was a matter of power or was there
something deeper at stake so that was
question number two question number
three was was there an alternative to
brutal combat was there an alternative
way of solving the dispute to brutal
group combat something like that and so
because I always believed that if you
understood a problem that you could
solve it in fact that if yes if when you
analyze the problem a solution didn't
emerge from the analysis then you
actually didn't understand the problem
and so I thought if I delved into the
problem deeply enough then maybe I could
figure out what might constitute a
solution assuming there was such a thing
because I couldn't I knew after writing
a fair bit of it that we were that there
was a real problem because you can get
belief systems that are locked in combat
and then obviously the terrible
consequence of that is the combat but
then I also knew and this was probably
more from reading Nietzsche than
anything else that if your belief system
collapses you might say well I don't
want to fight with you about whose
belief system is correct I'll just let
my mind go but the problem is if you let
your belief system go then you're
swamped by nihilism and hopelessness and
and that's not helpful first of all it's
very it's not helpful psychologically
because it produces motional pain and
anxiety and maybe at unbearable levels
you can't have a pointless life it's
it's it's it's a suffering a pointless
life is pointless suffering and people
can't sustain that without becoming
demoralized that's only where they start
demoralized bitter cruel resentful angry
hostile murderous genocide alike all
those things follow one from another if
if things are sufficiently hopeless you
can't just let your belief system go but
if you're locked into it and there's
another one that you're competing with
then the the consequence is war it's
like so what is it nihilism on the one
hand in war
on the other that didn't seem like
especially given the outcome of like say
the third world war that neither of
those seemed like acceptable
alternatives but I couldn't see any
other I couldn't see that there was
anything else other than those two
alternatives and so that's what I tried
to lay out in in this book maps of
meaning and most of the thoughts that I
expressed in 12 rules for life not all
of them and in the lectures that I've
done that have become popular on YouTube
were all developed during the 15 year
period that I worked on that book and I
worked on it I would say obsessively
really I wrote about three hours a day
and I thought about it for pretty much
12 other hours and so I was thinking
constantly it was it's not obvious why
but well I told you why for some reason
all that manifested itself to me as a
cardinal problem but I concluded and
tried to lay out the rationale for this
that the the fight between these two
belief systems but let's let's look at
the belief systems it's not communism
versus the West it's not communism
versus the free market it's it's
different than that it's collectivism in
its far right form let's say the far
right form of the Nazis and the far left
form of the radical leftists the
Communists that's collectivism versus
individualism that's the fundamental
conflict and there are variants of the
collectivist viewpoint but it doesn't
matter they can be grouped under the
rubric of collectivism there's important
differences but we don't have to get
into that the Western take wasn't
collectivist it was individualist
and the central idea of the West was
that although people are obviously
obviously aggregate into groups and many
different groups because all of you are
members of very of many different groups
ethnicities genders sexes races family
groups community groups you can be
grouped a very large number of ways and
and you tend towards the adoption of
something approximating a group identity
because you know you take care of your
family and you're a member of your
community and you have a certain amount
of justifiable pay tree
him in relationship to your state the
group identity is definitely part of who
you are the question is what's the
fundamental defining characteristic of
who you are and the collectivist
definition is that you are the avatar of
a collective and that's fundamentally
who you are but the Western perspective
is not that the Western perspective is
that despite the fact that people have
an individual level and a collective
level the individual level is to be
regarded as paramount you're to be
treated above all L above all as an
individual now and I looked into that
very deeply and I thought that isn't
arbitrary it's actually correct that's
the right way of looking at the world
and then you might say well what do you
mean the right way and of course that's
the right question because that is the
question
if something's the right way of looking
at something why is it the right way of
looking at it but I want to put a little
spin on that too because usually when we
talk about individualism in the West at
least in the modern world maybe let's
say for the last 50 years or something
like that maybe it's after World War 2 I
don't know exactly the parameters it
doesn't matter certainly since the 1960s
when we think about the tradition of
individuality in the West we think about
the tradition of individual rights and
there's a problem with that because the
fundamental individual tradition of the
West is not individual rights and rights
have a problem rights are sort of like
your privilege compared to other people
I have these rights and don't tread on
them that that walls me off and makes me
privileged in some sense it means that I
have the right to do things I have the
right to pursue my own interests I have
the right to pursue happiness for
example that's explicitly laid out in
the American system the rights are what
is special about me and so when you look
at individuality or individualism from
that perspective you can think about it
as a selfish idea and it's often
criticized by collectivists precisely
for that selfishness
but the fundamental idea of the
individual in the West isn't predicated
on rights even though that's important
it's predicated on responsibility right
so your role as an individual in the
West isn't to be the bearer of Rights of
intrinsic rights even though those are
important your responsibility as an
individual in the West is to bear the
responsibility of an individual and it's
in bearing that responsibility that you
set yourself right and your family right
and you keep the state on track it's not
from expressing your rights
it's from shouldering your
responsibility and I would say that the
reason that you have rights in the West
is so that you can shoulder your
responsibilities it's not the other way
around
it's so that you can do what's best on
your behalf and in that manner do what's
best on your family's behalf and in that
manner contribute to the degree that you
can to the community and that if you do
all those things simultaneously which
means to accept the responsibility for
that then things move ahead as well as
they can move ahead which doesn't
necessarily mean well because life is
very difficult and there's no sure way
through it there's only less bad
approaches that might be a way of
thinking about it and the least bad
approach you can manage is to shoulder
your responsibilities as an individual
and that's the and I would say that one
of the things that drives the
collectivist ethos which is often
formulated in terms of compassion for
the oppressed which is something we'll
talk about a little bit later is
actually a deep desire to at all costs
avoid that responsibility and it's no
wonder because the responsibility is
overwhelming say the world fundamentally
is a tragic place right it's a place in
which each of us is broken and it's
contaminated by the ever-present reality
of
trail and malevolence and to shoulder
the responsibility first for even
admitting to that and second for
assuming that you are duty-bound let's
say to do something about that well
that's a task that anyone who has his or
her eyes open should be leery of
accepting and I would say well perhaps
there's no credible reason for accepting
it except that every other alternative
is worse and so that's a brutal fact so
the antidote to collectivism is
individualism but it's not the
individualism of the privileged person
with rights it's the terrible burden of
the individual who determines that he or
she will shoulder their responsibility
to that most so I developed that idea in
maps of meaning that and I made a lot of
lectures about that look many of which
are on YouTube some of which have become
widely viewed I would say by hundreds of
thousands of people now and so that's
and that course always had a dramatic
effect on my students and their most
typical comment there's two classes of
typical comments that I got from
students about my maps of meaning
courses it's the same comments that I
get from people now when they come and
talk to me about my lectures the first
comment is and this is about maybe a
quarter of the people is that watching
the lectures are taking the course
enabled them to put words to things they
knew they knew but didn't know how to
say and so and that's fine because that
was an explicit purpose of the writing
and the course and the second is that it
helped people straighten out their lives
and that's also not that surprising to
me because a lot of what I integrated
[Music]
hello Vancouver thank you hello all
right so we have an interesting
situation here obviously this is part
two and a few of you were here for what
took place last night
we are going to find a way to catch you
all up pretty quick on what took place
but before we do that I thought it might
make sense to talk to you about where we
are in this discussion and why it
matters and it matters not just for
those of us on stage but it matters very
much for you all in the audience the
point is basically this we've arrived at
a place in history where the sense
making apparatus that usually helps us
figure out what to think about things
has obviously begun to come apart
the political parties the the
universities journalism all of these
things have stopped making sense an
alternative sense making networks have
begun to rise and the one that we end up
being a part of seems to be beating the
odds with respect to staying alive and
being a vibrant part of the conversation
but that depends on something it depends
on our ability to upgrade what we can
discuss and navigate and Sam and Jordan
have run afoul of each other in the past
as you all know and so our ability to
upgrade the conversations such that
they're able to to find common ground
and for us to move forward together is
potentially very important a very
important upgrade now that upgrade in
the modern era includes you all because
our conversation and your conversations
are all now linked through the internet
so the ground rules for tonight involve
you not filming what takes place on
stage tonight and the reason for that is
because what takes place on stage
tonight has consequences and the freer
that Sam and Jordan feel to use new
tools to try out positions that maybe
they haven't explored before the more
likely we are to succeed so please don't
film but that does not mean that we
don't
you talking about what was discussed
here tonight in fact we're very excited
to see what you all make of this
conversation and where it heads so in an
effort to to get you up to speed on
where we got yesterday and I think the
evidence is strong we all felt and the
discussion online suggests that we
actually accomplished quite a bit
yesterday that we made headway in an
effort to attempt to keep that momentum
going but we are going to do is we are
going to have Sam and Jordan Steelman
each other's points from last night so
that you can hear what that sounds like
now for those of you who have ever tried
steel Manning somebody's point with whom
you have a severe disagreement you know
just how hard this is so let's give them
some leeway Sam would you be willing to
start sure sure yeah thank you okay well
first let me just make the the obvious
point that that probably isn't so
obvious unless you take the time to put
yourself in our shoes but just imagine
how surreal it is for us to be who we
are simply having a conversation about
ideas and to be able to put a date on
the calendar and have all of you show up
for this it's just an amazing privilege
and thank you for coming out
so so here is what I think Jordan things
I'm getting wrong I think that was
grammatically correct maybe there's
another note in there but clearly I
don't understand how valuable stories
are how deep they go the degree to which
stories encode not only the wisdom of
our ancestors but quite possibly the
wisdom born of the hard knocks of
evolution of the species right so
there's no telling how deep the
significance of the information encoded
in stories goes and there's a class of
stories that are religious stories and
they're religious for a reason because
they're dealing with the the deepest
questions in human life they're
questions about what constitutes a good
life what's worth living for what's
worth dying for these are things that if
each individual just thrust from on to
the stage of his own life
not knowing where he is and tasked with
figuring out how to live all on his own
or even in a in a collection of others
who are similarly unguided by ancient
wisdom that this is not knowledge we can
we can recapitulate for ourselves easily
and so we we edit or ignore the these
ancient stories at our peril at some
minimum at some considerable risk
because we don't know how much we don't
really know what baby is in the bath
water and so we should have immense
respect for these traditions and the
this is well this is have to be
discovered tonight I'm still not quite
clear about how this links up with with
more metaphysical propositions about the
origins of these of certain of these
stories but at minimum
my criticism of religion because it
tends to focus on the the most obvious
case of zero-sum contest between
religious dogmatism and you know
scientific open-ended discussion is
doesn't address this core issue of the
significance of religious thinking and
religious narrative because I am for the
most part just shooting fish in a barrel
criticizing fundamentalists and the kind
of God that the fundamentalists believe
in the God who's an invisible person who
hates homosexuals obviously that's not
the the deep the deepest version of
these religious this or this what is a
narrative technology for orient in human
life in the cosmos so maybe I'll leave
it there but that's I think what Jordan
things
before you steal man Sam's point how did
you feel about his encapsulation of
yours know what I mean well I got a
couple of things to say about it it's
like first of all I think it was
accurate concise fair I also think that
this is a more technical note in some
sense is that if if you ever want to
think about something that's exactly
what you have to do right you want to
take arguments that are against your
perspective and you want to make them as
strong as you possibly can so that you
can fortify your arguments against them
you don't want to make them weak because
that just makes you weak and so you know
Sam and I are both scientists and it
really is the case that what scientists
are trying to do and I think what we're
actually trying to do in this
conversation genuinely is to try to find
out if there's something that we're
thinking that's stupid you know because
when when I'm laying out the arguments
that Sam just summarized so well I've
tried to generate a bunch of opposition
to them in my own imagination and their
arguments I put forward are ones I can't
undermine but that doesn't mean they're
right it doesn't mean that at all and so
if someone comes along who's and this is
certainly the case if you're a scientist
who's worth his or her salt if someone
comes along and says hey look you've
made a mistake in this fundamental
proposition it's like yes great that
means I can make progress towards a more
solid theory of being so and that's what
we're trying to do and I do think it's
working and so I thought that was just
fine
exactly dead-on and I hope I can do
justice to your position as well so okay
so I'm gonna summarize Sam's argument
briefly and then I'm gonna tell them
late late let you guys know why he
thinks I'm things of what things I'm not
taking into account so Sam believes that
there are two fundamental dangers to
psychological and social stability
religious fundamentalism essentially on
the right and moral relativism and
nihilism on the left and so the danger
of the right wing position is that it
enables people to arbitrarily establish
certain revealed axioms as indisputable
truths and then
to tyrannize themselves and other people
with the claims that those are divine
revelations and he sees that as part of
the danger of religious fundamentalism
and maybe religious thinking in general
but also is something that characterizes
secular totalitarian states that also
has a religious aspect so that's on the
right and then on the left well the
problem with the with the moral
relativism nihilism position is that it
leaves us with no orientation and it
also flies in the face of common sense
observations that there are ways to live
that are bad and that there are ways to
live that are good that people can
generally agree on and that statements
about those general agreements about how
to live can be considered factual now so
and and then the next part of Sam's
argument is that we require a value
system that allows us to escape these
twin dangers one stultified us and the
other leaves us hopeless let's say and
that value system has to be grounded in
something real and the only thing that
he can see that actually constitutes
real in any provable sense and there's a
certain amount of historical and
conceptual weight behind this claim is
the domain of empirical facts as they've
been manifested in the sciences and
technologies that have made us
incredibly powerful and increasingly
able to flourish in the world and so we
need to ground our value propositions in
something that we've been able to
determine has genuine solidity to so
that we can so that we can orient
ourselves properly so that we can make
moral claims and that we can avoid these
to in dangers we can begin with some
basic facts that we can identify as I
mentioned breathe briefly what
constitutes a bad life endless pain
suffering anxiety tremendous amount of
negative emotions short term lifespan
all the things that no one would choose
voluntarily for themselves if if we
would all agree that they were thinking
in a healthy manner and we can contrast
that sort of domain of horror with the
good life which might involve while
certainly freedom from privation and
want and undue threat and anxiety and
hope for the future and all of that and
that we can agree that those are poles
good bad and good and that that's a
factual claim so he Sam also claims that
we can define the good life this is an
extension of it with reference to
flourishing and well-being and that that
can actually be measured
we should and can't inform the idea of
flourishing and well-being with
empirical data having said all that he
also leaves
what would a domain of inquiry open that
would be centered on the possibility
that some of the ideas that have been
encapsulated in religious phenomenology
if not in religious dogma might be worth
pursuing as well that there might be
wisdom that can practically be applied
in terms of perception to to spiritual
practices although those become danger
when dangerous increasingly dangerous as
they become ensconced in dogma and so
that's Sam's position and then his
criticism of my ideas he would say that
it's facts not stories that constitute
the ground for the proper science of
well-being and that we don't need to be
connected to stories ancient stories in
particular to thrive and the reason for
that are that these ancient stories are
pathological in certain details
especially in the specific claims they
make up which which look outrageous in
some sense from a modern moral
perspective and he believes that it's
hand-waving to ignore those specific
topics and with a you know with of what
would you call it an optimistic overview
of the entire context that they're
they're dangerously outdated now if they
ever were useful that they're subject to
too many potential interpretations for
any modern usage to be reliably derived
and so he believes that attempts to
interpret these stories let's say are
rife with so many potential errors of
bias and interpretation and subjectivity
that all the interpretations in some
sense are unreliable and perhaps equally
unreliable that they're dated that worse
than that not only are they unreliable
but they're dangerous insofar as the
claims they lay out are pose a threat to
scientific and enlightenment values
which are the true saviors of humanity
as evidenced by our progress let's say
over the last two or three hundred years
and that they're also susceptible to the
totalitarian interpretation
which I described earlier which confer
upon the interpreter a sense of and then
a claim to revealed truth and so I would
say that Sam's argument and his and his
criticisms of my position so ok so you
write my next book I'll write yours
Sam how do you feel about that
characterization of your position
certainly close enough to get the
conversation started I mean there's a
few the grounding stuff where we have
yet to talk about and I'm not as I'm not
as much a stickler for materialistic
scientific empiricism as I heard implied
there but we can we can come okay so
hold on yep I think from the point of
view of the audience this is a this is a
good barometer of where we got to last
night and I think actually the gains are
really impressive which I have to say is
spooking me because of something called
regression to the mean now if I catch
either one of you regressing to the mean
tonight I will hunt you down and I will
ridicule you on Twitter tomorrow so you
have been warned okay all right so do
either one of you want to now talk about
what was missing from the other
characterization or how do you want to
move I think we should touch this issue
of metaphorical truth because I think it
still gets that the distance between us
sure and say and it's and happily yeah
this is your phrase that you have you
might want to do you want to prop up
this phrase why not so the idea of
metaphorical truth which I think
actually is the reconciliation between
at least the points that you guys each
started out with is the idea that there
are concepts which are literally false
that we can falsify in a scientific
rational sense but that if you behave as
if they were true you come out ahead of
where you were if you behave according
to the fact that they are false and so
to call these things simply false is an
error in effect the universe has left
them true in some sense other than a
purely literal one and so
religions would then according to
actually what you heard from both Sam
and Jordan religions would fall into
this class of things these are
encapsulations of stories and
prescriptions that if you follow them
irrespective of whether they literally
describe the universe you end up with
advantages that you may not know why
they are there but nonetheless you you
are ahead of your you you're ahead of
your position if you were to navigate
just simply on your your perceptions
that's the concept yes I think there's a
good analogy that you and I stumbled
onto after we did a podcast together you
had a an analogy about a porcupine that
could shoot its quills which many people
balked at but a listener gave us a
better one which was the idea that
anyone has worked with guns at all must
have heard this admonishment to treat
every gun as if it is loaded right and
you actually when I last night when I
allege that you believed in God you
corrected me said no you live as if God
exists right and so this seems like
there's a connection here so if you're
if you know if I had a gun here that I
wanted to show Brett if I know anything
about guns I'm going to make damn sure
that it's unloaded right I'm going to
pull back the slide I'm going to drop
the magazine pull back the slide check
the chamber and do this in a redundant
fashion that that really looks like I'm
suffering from obsessive-compulsive
disorder maybe it is truly redundant and
then I'll hand it to Brad and if Brett
knows anything about guns he will do the
same thing having just seen me do it and
if he hands it back to me again I will
do the same thing even though there may
be no ammunition around right so it
really is crazy at the level of our
explicit knowledge of a situation and
yet absolutely necessary to do and it's
it's not merely its it runs very deep I
mean I would have bent that whole time
you you're careful not to point the
barrel of the gun at anything you would
be afraid to shoot and when people fail
to live this way around guns they with
some unnerving frequency actually shoot
themselves or people close to them by
accident so it is really the only proper
hedge against just the the odds of being
in proximity to loaded weapons and yet
if someone in the middle of this
operation came up to us and said you
know actually there's a casino that just
opened across the street that will take
your bets about whether or not guns are
loaded would you like to bet a million
dollars as to whether or not this gun is
loaded well of course I would bet those
million dollars every time that it's not
loaded because I know it's not loaded
right so there's there's a there's a
literal truth and a a metaphorical truth
well you know otherwise known as a very
useful fiction which in this case is
actually more useful than the truth
right but the only way I can understand
its utility is and and even utter the
phrase metaphorical truth in a way
that's comprehensible is in the context
of distinguishing it from literal truth
and yep
this is fascinating Sam actually this is
this is I think next Jason I'm a little
worried by how excited you are about
this so I have a little story that might
be helpful about that and so on you
could you could tell me what what you
think about okay think about this okay
so so one of the things that I've been
reconsidering since we talked last night
is is the nature of our dispute about
the relationship between facts and
values because I I think I can make a
case that what I've been trying to do
especially in my first book was to
ground values in facts but I'm not doing
it the same way that you are exactly so
so I don't want to make that a point of
contention so and I'll get to that in a
moment but with regards to this metaphor
truth let me tell you something you tell
me what you think about this so one of
the things that's been observed by
anthropologists worldwide is that human
beings tend to make sacrifices so I'm
gonna spend two minutes three minutes
laying out a sacrificial story and the
reason I want to do it is because see
what I think happened with regards to
the origin of these profound stories is
that people first started to behave in
certain ways that had survival
significance and that was selected for
and as a consequence of the standard
selection practices and so that was
instantiated in behavior and then
because we can observe ourselves because
we're self-conscious creatures that we
started to make representations of those
patterns and dramatize them and then
encapsulate them in stories so it's a
bottom up from from me so it would be
sort of like chimpanzees or wolves
become aware of their dominance
hierarchy structures and the strategies
that they use so a wolf for example if
two wolves are having a dominance
dispute one the wolf that gives up first
lays down puts his neck open so the
other wolf can tear it out and then the
other wolf doesn't and you could say
well it's as if a wolf is following a
rule about not killing a weaker member
of the pack of course wolves don't have
rules they have behavioral patterns but
a self-conscious wolf would watch what
the Wolves were doing and then say well
it's as if we're acting out the idea
[Music]
[Applause]
you
[Applause]
I guess we're in Vancouver Wow all right
that is daunting so I hope you'll
indulge me here for a second
Jordan and Sam have given me the honor
of moderating this debate or discussion
depending on how you view it and I think
that actually creates a certain kind of
responsibility and I want to talk to you
about my responsibilities and how I see
it
and my respite sense of how you all have
responsibilities in this as well
I suspect that what's gonna happen
tonight is actually historical which
doesn't necessarily make it good there's
lots of bad history it could be good
though and that's what I'm hoping will
happen so the reason I say I think it's
historical is that we are existing in a
moment where all of the systems that
have helped us make sense are breaking
down the university systems are breaking
down journalism is breaking down and at
that same moment we have a network of
people who are trying to make sense in
an alternative way and I have to say I
think beating the odds for the moment so
here's the problem that network is not
entirely in agreement with itself about
some significant issues and Sam and
Jordan have some differences that have
proved very difficult
so what could happen tonight is we could
have some sort of a failure where things
get even more muddled we could tread
water where nothing gets clear maybe it
would be entertaining maybe it wouldn't
but best-case scenario is that we figure
out how to make sense of things that
have gotten in our way before and if
that happens then you all will leave
here and as you talk in your various
networks you will have something to say
about in what way we upgraded our
software so that we could talk more
deeply about difficult issues so to that
end we would ask the King not film
tonight's discussion and broadcast it
online
it's not that we want to hide this in
fact we encourage you to discuss it but
we would like to have all of us feel
maximally free to speak here to try out
positions that we haven't tried out
before in the hopes that we can get
somewhere new all right so
I think with that we will just put Sam
and Jordan to it and see if we can head
towards some of the discussions that
have proved difficult in the past I
think I'll just start by saying that
when we first had the idea to do this
now some months ago I'm getting a little
reverb here so if you can dial down
there's little feedback when Jordan and
I first decided to do an event together
it was after we did those somewhat
ill-fated podcasts and I joked that we
would probably need a safe word for this
event so that safe word as will come as
no surprise is lobster
so you'll know things are dire when one
of us says that but you know I just want
to express my motive for for helping to
stage these events and because I you
know I I reached out to Jordan and it
really was born of seeing him in
conversation with people other than
myself I saw him do a podcast with Joe
Rogan I saw him speak to Dave Rubin as
I'm speak with Brett on on Rogen's
podcast and I had so much admiration for
him in those conversations it's 90
percent of what he said in those
conversations struck me as really wise
and useful and well-intentioned and 10
percent didn't and but I noticed that it
was close
clear to me that that you've seen these
successful conversations with other
people who I respect I began to wonder
that you know I might be the problem and
I think I I think I am the problem I
think
well before you applaud maybe I didn't
mean that quite the way you took it I
think it's I think it's a good sort of
problem for Jordan to have because it's
what happens on those 10% moments and
and what doesn't happen that I think
made our conversation so hard and and I
think we there is stuff to clarify
between us so I look forward to doing
that and thank you Jordan for agreeing
to do this it's an honor to share the
stage with you and needless to say
having Brett as a moderator as a almost
obscene underestimation of the role he
should be playing on any stage because
he as you know he's been on my podcast
and that was one of the best
conversations I've ever had so thank you
for doing this
[Music]
all right so I'm gonna jump right into
it I think here so look this is I put up
a poll a couple of days ago to find out
what people broadly speaking might want
us to discuss and I've been taking a
look at that and I took a lot of notes
which is why I have my computer here by
the way on my phone it's not to check my
email well the debates going on the
discussion I thought what I might do is
just lay out some places that I think
Sam and I agree and because there's lots
of places we agree and so and then I
want to figure out where we disagree
which I've been trying to sort out and
then I want to see if we can hash it out
a little bit and and move forward on
that a bit so I'm going to lay out see
one of the things that Carl Rogers said
this psychic psychologist was that one
good way to have a discussion with
someone is to tell them what you think
they think until they think that what
you said reflects what they said but
look this is a really useful thing to
know if you're ever having a discussion
with an intimate partner for example is
that you have to put their argument back
to them in terms they agree with it's
very difficult so I'm going to try to do
that and so so the first thing is I
think I think that partly what's driving
you if this is accurate is that you want
to ground a structure of ethics in
something solid and and and there's two
there's two things you want to avoid two
catastrophes let's say one is the
catastrophe that you identified with
religious fundamentalism and the other
is the catastrophe that's associated
with moral relativism that is that
reasonable yeah that's good
okay good good okay well
okay so it's crucially it's crucially
important that we get this right now so
be and that's something that I think we
really agree on because I've
conceptualized that slightly different
than you and that might be relevant but
I think of that as a pathology of order
and a pathology of chaos so the
terminology is slightly different but I
think we're working on the same axis so
so so that's the first thing and then in
order to do that it seems to me that's
your first priority then maybe your
second priority is something like you
know you see undo suffering in the world
plenty of it and you would think that
things would be better if that wasn't
the case and that this morality whatever
it's going to be is at least going to
part ground itself in part on the
presupposition that the less undo
suffering in the world the better so is
that also reasonable yeah I would just
add to that the the positive side of the
continuum as well so as you know the
phrase I use though the word I use for
this is well-being yeah
and I know from having I don't think we
spoke about this on my podcast but from
having seen you in other interviews I I
think you think that phrase doesn't
capture everything one could reasonably
want but I think it does a mattress I've
you know it's an elastic suitcase term
for a reason and it's it's actually in
reading your book I realize there's a
point of contact here because you use
the word beam capital B beam with as
though it were imbued with significant
gravitas and so for me and I agree with
you that's an appropriate use of being
and for me well-being is simply just the
positive side of being you know there's
the negative side the suffering we want
to mitigate but I think I think however
good consciousness can be in this
universe that the well-being for me
subsumes all of those possibilities okay
well so what so I focused on the
suffering element I think as I've done
in my own work because I actually think
it's easier to zero in on in some sense
like I think it's easier for people and
I think you lay out the argument in the
moral landscape kind of like this I
think
it's easier perhaps to gain initial
agreement between people on what might
constitute a generalized ethic to
concentrate on what we don't want yeah
I'm not saying that what we do want is
unimportant but it seems to me to be
harder to get a grip on we don't want
our swift's we don't want the Gulag
Archipelago
so and and there are those and I would
add to just closing the door to moral
relativism here those who do want
outwits are wrong to want auschwitz
obviously it's only happened because
some people did want now it's not the
victims side but the perpetrator side
and so crucially for me is the claim
that I'm a realist I'm a moral realist
and what realism means is that it's
there that there are right and wrong
answers to questions of this kind and
and and you can not know what you're
missing in fact we almost certainly
don't know what we're missing on
questions of human value and that and
our job is to discover just how good
life can be and just what variables are
making it needlessly horrible and to to
mitigate all of that and live in a in a
better and better world ok ok ok so
that's a that's a that's a lot of points
of agreement so I also believe that
there is a catastrophe of of arbitrary
moral injunction and that there's a
catastrophe of moral relativism and that
that that has to be dealt with and that
there are genuine differences between
the proper way of behaving more lien and
the improper way of behaving morally and
I think that they are grounded in human
universals even though there's a wide
amount of variation so that that's a lot
of points of agreement right so we know
that there's two things we want to avoid
we conceptually speaking which is the
moral relativism and this kind of moral
absolutism that's grounded in an
arbitrary statement of facts that you
identify with religious fundamentalism I
would identify that with fundal it
fundamentalism more generally not not
with religious fundamentalism per se
because I see it also having happening
in secular states let's say like not too
many or so it doesn't seem to be
religious fundamentalism per se that's
crucial to your
argument no it's not it's a so that just
to close the loop on that the only
reason why I would focus on religion in
particular there is that religion is the
only language game where in
fundamentalism and of dogmatism where
dogmatism is not a pejorative concept
the dogma is a good word in specifically
within Catholicism and the notion that
you must believe things on faith that is
in the absence of compelling evidence it
would otherwise cause a rational person
to believe it that you know religious
context is considered a feature not a
bug
elsewhere we recognize it to be a bug
and that's that's why so it all right so
is it reasonable to assume that the
associate we've already established at
least in principle that there's an
association between the totalitarian
regimes let's say and dogmatism yeah and
the dogmatism that characterizes
religious belief what do you think
although at least in principle the the
secularists totalitarian states and the
religious fundamentalist totalitarian
states do differ in one important regard
which is that the religious types ground
their axioms in God and the secular
totalitarian types don't and so there's
got to be something about
totalitarianism per se that's
independent of that's associated with
religious belief in the matter that you
just described but that's not
particularly associated with the belief
in God there's something that makes them
that's a commonality between them and so
do you have any sense of what that might
be well I would I think one has to
acknowledge that there's something
uniquely pernicious at least potentially
about religious beliefs because they
they have the the otherworldly variable
the supernatural variable the you're
going to get everything you want after
you die so this life doesn't matter
issue that right that allows for kind of
misbehavior that is especially okay so
so it seems that so that the claim would
be that if you if you
put forward axiomatically your claim
that God exists then you can use that
claim to justify whatever arbitrary
atrocities your system might throw off
yeah but the only point I was making
there is that not all dogmas are created
equal but some dogmas are on their face
more dangerous and more devices right
but what I'm curious about specifically
is because it seems to me that the
dogmas of the USSR and the dogmas of
Nazi Germany were as pernicious as any
religious dogmas and and they may also
share important features with your
Nicias religious lives but it isn't
clear to me from your perspective what
those commonalities would be well so I
mean in some ways your recapitulated in
an argument I've made and this is an
argument that I would make against you
were you to claim as you've had you have
elsewhere that that atheism is
responsible for the greatest atrocities
of the 20th century the idea that
Stalinism and Nazism and fascism were
expressions of atheism simply doesn't
make any sense maybe in the case of
fascism and Nazism it doesn't make any
sense because the fascists and the Nazis
by and large were not even atheist emiru
Hitler wasn't it a theist and he was
talking about executing a divine plan
and he got lots of support from the
churches and the Vatican did nothing to
stop them and fascism as you know
coexisted quite happily with Catholicism
in Croatia and Portugal and Spain and
Italy so but even in the case of Stalin
what was so wrong with that
situation was where all the ways in
which it's so resembled a religion you
had a personality cult you had dogmatism
that held sway to a point where apostasy
and blasphemy were killing offenses you
know the people who didn't toe the line
were eradicated and you know so and
North Oh to take a more modern example
North Korea is a religious cult it just
doesn't happen to be a one that is
focused on the next life or you know
supernatural claims so what we magic the
folk okay so what would be the defining
characteristics of a religious total
pterri movement that would make it
different from a non-religious
totalitarian movement because there's
aspects that are similar yeah they may
be they're very similar but the problem
is dogmatism the overarching problem is
believing things strongly on bad
evidence and B and the reason why
dogmatism is so dangerous is that it is
it doesn't allow us to revise our bad
ideas in real time through conversation
it is it that dog must have to be
enforced by force or the threat of force
because the moment someone has a better
idea you have to shut it down in order
to preserve your dog okay okay so so the
commonality seems to be something like
claims of absolute truth at some level
that can't be that you're no longer
allowed to discuss yeah okay and so okay
so that's another point of agreement
then I would say because part of the
reason that I've been let's say a free
speech advocate although I don't think
that's the right way of thinking about
it is because I think of free discourse
like the discourse that we're engaged in
as the mechanism that corrects
totalitarian excess or dogmatic excess
and so I also think that systems of
governance that are laying themselves
out properly have to eval it have to
elevate the process by which dogmatic
errors are corrected over the dogmas
themselves which is why I think the
Americans are right say with regard to
their first amendment is the process of
free speech is the process by which
dogmatic errors are rectified and so it
has to be put at the pinnacle of the
hierarchy of values I think you and I
totally agree about the primacy of free
speech okay okay good okay so that's
another fine
[Applause]
okay so then we could think there's one
point that we should just lock in our
games here it sounds like what you're
saying is that the reason to fear
religious dogma is really on the dogma
side and not the religion side which at
least leaves open the possibility that
something could exist over on the
religion side that doesn't have that
characteristic right that often they
travel in tandem but the thing to fear
is not the religious belief it is the
dogmatic nature of the way it is yeah
well the other way to say that is the
only thing that's wrong with the
religion is the dogmatism if you get rid
of the door I've got no problem with the
buildings and the music and the and the
paintings and wait wait no that wait a
minute wait a minute wait a minute
that's not a trivial that's not a
trivial point and it's not just a joke
because the buildings and the music are
very important parts of the religious
process and so I know I know there's a
humorous element to that but it's not
like Sam is throwing out the baby with
the bathwater there and to go further
than that I've got no problem in fact
I'm deeply interested in the
phenomenology of spiritual experience so
so whatever experience someone like
Jesus had whoever he was historically or
any of the other major arts and
patriarchs of the world's religions
though that that phenomenology is is
subjectively real I mean that it's
diverse I'm not saying everyone's had
the same experience but there are
changes in consciousness that explain
both how religions have gotten founded
by their their founders and the
experiences people have had in the
presence of those people or by continued
following their methodologies that seem
to be confirming of the dogmas that got
that grew up around those traditions and
my issue is that whatever is true about
us spiritually whatever opportunity
being born to this universe actually
presents as a matter of consciousness
spiritually that truth has to be deeper
than accidents of culture and just mere
historical contingency is the fact that
somebody was born and
in Mesopotamia and not in China and got
a different language game and so
whatever is true there has to be
understood in universal terms about the
nature human psychology and and the
human mind okay so so another thing that
that I wanted to just point out
obliquely and then I want to return to
outlining maybe where we agree is that
one of the things that was really
shocking to me I would say was the the
my reading of what was originally Jane
Goodall's discovery about chimp behavior
you know because there is this idea that
was really rooted in Rousseau Ian's
thinking that the reason that people
committed atrocities in the service of
their group identity let's say their
tribal identity was because culture had
corrupted us so it was this uniquely
human thing but then of course Goodall
hi everyone welcome to the September
version of my q and A's and thank you
very much for tuning in again hopefully
we'll have an interesting discussion
tonight I want to stop start that is
with demonstration of some new newly
managed technical wizardry I have a
program that I developed with my
colleagues that I want to talk to you
guys about for just a few seconds some
of you already know about this called
self authoring and self authoring helps
people write about their past to guide
it autobiography that's the past
authoring program and to write about
their virtues and their faults that's
theirs to present authoring programs and
a future authoring program that helps
people write out a vision and a
destination let's say an ethical
destination for their lives as well as
formulate a plan to put that vision into
to make that vision into reality and our
experimental investigations have
indicated for example that university
students who complete this program even
if they do it badly and I would
recommend at least doing it badly
increase their probability of staying at
university by about 30% and it has a
positive effect on their grade point
average as well so there's a fair bit of
evidence that your personality is
organized at the highest level through
articulated speech some of that you can
formulate internally by thinking and
some of it you have to do you can do by
writing you also do that in discussion
with other people but these programs are
designed to break down the problem of
articulating your life in the past
present and future into a series of
steps that are at least in principle
manageable and thousands of people have
done them and I think there are very
helpful programs and we spent a lot of
time perfecting them I supposed to the
degree that they are perfected anyways I
want to here's the high tech part of
this you see that's the website self
authoring com and I put a coupon
together
the coupon name is September so that's
what you have to enter for the coupon
and that gives you a 20% discount at
self authoring so and now all this is
even more high-tech because this marker
is in a different color and this program
is a personality test based on the big5
aspect scale which is a scale that
calling the young one of my students
developed when he worked in my lab along
with Lena quilty and the big five aspect
scale offers you a five dimensional
readout of your personality extraversion
neuroticism agreeableness
conscientiousness and openness the
classic big five and then it breaks each
of the factors each of the traits into
two aspects so you get a high resolution
map of your personality that takes the
test takes about 100 question takes
about 15 minutes to do and you'll learn
about yourself I think you'll learn
interesting things I had my kids do
repeated iterations of the big five
aspect scale when they were teenagers
and I learned a lot about them even
though I thought I knew them quite well
I learned things that were very useful
so you can do that and maybe you'll
understand yourself a little bit better
and so this is the site and the coupon
is September just as it was for self
authoring and that's 20% as well and
you'll see that amazingly enough this
advertisement I suppose which is what it
is is in purple instead of blue and so
that's another technological miracle
brought to you by the internet and the
intelligence of modern human beings so
alright so we've dispensed with that so
that's self authoring and understand
myself and you might find those useful
and I hope you do so on to more fall on
two different things I guess I just got
back to Toronto yesterday I think it was
yesterday I was out in Western Canada
I went to a family reunion on Vancouver
Island and then a reunion of sorts as
well in Saskatchewan with my side of the
family and finished a talk in Regina and
when in Saskatoon as well which seem to
be relatively well received so hooray
for that I've really enjoyed all these
lectures that I've been giving Tammy and
I Tammy's my wife we've visited 65
cities now on this tour and we're
starting again on September 5th we're
gonna go down the eastern seaboard
there's 20 cities and in the
northeastern US and then we're off to
Europe for another 15 cities or so and
then in February I think we're going to
go to Australia and then in March and
April and back to Europe and then in May
I'm going to spend four months
diligently finishing up what I hope to
be my next book assuming that I can get
that done in that period of time and
also that other opportunities let's say
or distractions don't rear their head
either positively or negatively and who
knows right because life is a very
uncertain business I've really enjoyed
the lecture tour a lot you know I've
been speaking to audiences of about
2,500 to 3,000 people and mostly about
the I would say mostly about the Nexus
the relationship between meaning and
responsibility trying to make the case
that because life is difficult as
everyone with any sense knows and
because we can make that worse with our
own stupidity and malevolence that it's
necessary to find a sustaining meaning
in life and my sense is and I think
people tend to agree to this is that the
most sustaining meaning can be found a
and the adoption of voluntary
responsibilities so in attempts to
decrease the suffering in life and to do
things that are worthwhile and admirable
and to take care of yourself
individually and your family and to have
a little bit left over for your
community and to have goodwill across
all those dimensions if you can possibly
manage it despite the fact that there's
something in life to make people
relatively bitter and then as well the
necessity of conducting yourself in a
truthful manner
making also the case to my listeners I
suppose that that one of the most
ancient presuppositions that underlies
the structure of Western civilization
which is a very functional civilization
in my estimation is the idea derived
from Genesis that truthful speech if you
confront truthful speech if you confront
potential the chaos and potential that
is in front of you with truthful speech
that you engender the order that is good
and that's a fundamental ethical dictum
it's it's it's a presupposition in some
sense that the order that you bring into
existence in all the choices that you
make will be the best possible order in
proportion to the degree that you
conduct yourself in a truthful manner
and so those ideas seem to be falling on
very receptive ears and they are the
most resilient ideas that I think I've
ever come across I mean I always take an
ice pick and a hammer - any idea that I
encounter and I really do that
diligently because I don't want to rely
on ideas that can fall apart and break
especially when they're stressed and I
don't see I don't I haven't come across
ideas that are more solid than that I
mean the first proposition you know that
life is suffering and that we make it
worse with our malevolence I think
everyone understands that to be true but
the second is that the best way to
confront that is to shoulder
responsibility voluntarily and to live
in truth I think those are even more
powerful ideas because you could say
that the cure for a malaise or the
treatment for a disease is more powerful
than the malhae malaise or the disease
itself and if responsibility and truth
are antidotes to suffering and
malevolence then that means that they're
there they have a power that's
transcendent over suffering malevolence
and you know it so it's a very
pessimistic viewpoint on the one hand
because I'm stressing for everybody that
is coming to listen to me talk the fact
that life has an inalienable element of
difficulty and and travail and suffering
and all of that and you certainly see
that sort of thing when you go to a
family reunion you know like a lot of my
relatives my parents generation they're
getting old my parents are in their 80s
now and there
some of they have friends that are older
and everyone's starting to suffer from
the inevitable deterioration that's
associated with old age and it's very
very trying and very difficult for
people and it's it's in those situations
that you see more clearly the fragility
of life and also the importance of
having a having a family that's
functional and people around you that
love you and all those things that in
principle can help sustain you through
difficult times so anyways I'm here in
Toronto for about 10 days got a lot of
media interviews again partly to discuss
the upcoming talks my book 12 rules for
life still appears to be selling
extraordinarily well it's quite amazing
all things considered it's approaching 2
million sales and in in the English
version and there are foreign versions
coming out
all the time so and I've also I'm also
in the process of putting together the
final arrangements for my next book
which I talked about so the plan is to
write I'm writing that now I've got it
about half written maybe a little bit
more expanding on the themes that I
developed in 12 rules for life and also
extending them as much as I possibly can
and I hope to continue writing during
this period of touring as well so that I
can stay on top of my deadlines and then
from May to September to spend most of
that time finalizing and editing and
polishing and all of that and then
hopefully the book is due in September
and the current plan is to spend
September through December likely
concentrating on a return to the
biblical lectures starting with Exodus
which is something I'm really looking
forward to but haven't really been able
to turn my hand to the other thing I'm
really thinking hard about doing I'd
like to do a series of lectures and I
don't know if I could do them publicly
or not but I might be able to finagle
that in some manner I'd like to do a
series of lectures on the sacred icons
of the radical left so I'd like to do a
lecture series on Marx and Foucault and
Derrida and then some some
the famous feminists to like Betty Ford
an whose work I'm not a fan of for a
variety of reasons and Judith Butler as
well but I'd really like to concentrate
on Marx so one of the things I might do
tea for you guys tonight or to you yeah
one of the things I might do to you
tonight as I found a poem by Karl Marx
that is extraordinarily interesting and
that might be worth reading if I can I
just thought about doing that if I can
scrape it up in time so let me just
check very quickly and see if I can find
it and then I'll get to some questions
because after all this is a QA right
that's the theory so give me 30 seconds
if you can indulge me there it is yeah
so let me read this to you and then
we'll get to the Q&A I think this this
is the kind of thing that I'd like to
shed light on in any possible lecture
series on Marx so this is called
invocation
invocation of one in despair so a God
has snatched from me my all in the curse
and rack of Destiny all his worlds are
gone beyond recall nothing but revenge
is left to me on my self revenge all
proudly wreak on that being that
enthroned Lord make my strength a
patchwork of what's weak leave my better
self without reward I shall build my
throne high overhead cold tremendous
shell its summit be for its bulwark
superstitious dread for its Marshall
blackest agony who looks on it with a
healthy I shall turn back struck deathly
pale and dumb clutched by blind and
chill mortality made his happiness
prepare his tomb and the Almighty's
Lightning shall rebound from that
massive iron giant if he bring my walls
and towers down eternity shall raise
them up Defiant well so on that happy
note that's perhaps perhaps some insight
into the spirit that motivated our
friend mr. Karl Marx so I've really been
thinking a lot about the Marxist
critique of Western culture especially a
fundamental Marxist critique is
something a fundamental Marxist critique
is a criticism of the fact that in
capitalist societies a disproportionate
amount of the spoils let's say the
wealth goes to a disproportionately
small part of the community and this is
of course a truism by the way it is the
case that that occurs which is why the
richest dozen people in the world have
as much money as the bottom two billion
something like that it's also the case
it's part of a more generalized law
sometimes called prices law and
represented with the Pareto distribution
purrito is P AR eto showing that not
only do the
bulk of the Spoils let's say the wealth
go to a disproportionately small number
of people but the bulk of the productive
work is also done by a
disproportionately small number of
people not necessarily the same people
that have the wealth by the way although
in a functional society there's some
overlap now Marx was correct in
observing that that happened in
capitalist societies but incorrect in
assuming that there are any societies
that have ever been formulated or that
could ever be formulated that would
escape from that destiny because you see
that same tremendous Pareto distribution
that proclivity of wealth to to accrue
in the hands of small of a small number
of people you see that in every human
society that's ever been studied and if
it's not wealth its sexual access or
repre duck t'v well that's the same
thing rep reductive opportunity let's
say or or or material possessions which
is obviously a form of wealth etc so one
of the things that characterizes the
West is that all our so our societies
produce inequality like every other
society including animal societies by
the way and even among plants even
amongst ours a disproportionate number
of the heavenly bodies have most of the
mass by the way which is not something
that you can lay at the feet of Western
capitalism the thing that the West has
been able to do that other societies
haven't been able to do is to produce
wealth along with inequality and that
wealth is definitely a fair proportion
of that wealth is actually going to
benefit the people who are in the
diarist straits and that process has
been accelerating over the last 20 years
so from the year 2000 to the year 2012
the level of absolute poverty in the
world is halved which is the fastest
rate of economic development in the
history of the world and I think that
rate is accelerating at least in part
because the Soviet Union for example
isn't around anymore to agitate the
economic masters and leaders of
developing countries into the adoption
of counterproductive collectivist
economic strategies and so what appears
to be happening is that as we spread the
fundamental Western ethos of
individuality and private property and
free
markets and freedom in general for men
and for women around the world that the
poorest people are becoming well at
least they're not starving they're
becoming richer even though at the same
time we do pay a price for that in
inequality so there's a rule and I don't
know how to formulate it exactly or
there seems to be a rule which is a
given unit of wealth in a is produced at
the cost of certain production of the
inequality a certain number of units of
inequality and that seems to be
inalienable to some degree so anyways
that's part of a Marxist critique the
poem first which is like you want to
listen to that poem a couple of times I
would say but then more fundamentally a
critique of the Marxist critique of the
West yes the West produces inequality
but it's not something that you could
lay at the feet of capitalism it's a
much much deeper problem and what that
means to is that those people who
purport to be on the side of the poor
and dispossessed are not being friends
to them by any stretch of the
imagination at all by attempting to tear
down the very hierarchies that seem to
be leveraging the world's poorest people
out of poverty as rapidly as possible
there's evidence as well that people
start to become very concerned about the
environment if you can get their family
income I think are its GDP I think up
about of 40 above about 4,500 u.s. a
year they start to have a little bit of
spare time to be concerned with the
environment around them and so the right
way to to ecological balance in the
world seems to be to make people rich as
fast as we possibly can to make the poor
rich as fast as we possibly can and
wouldn't that be lovely if that was
really the way out so anyways you know
for that so let's let's try some
questions here so any advice on
effectively implementing what I learned
into my life i resonate with twelve
rules so much when reading but struggle
to remember it in my day to day life
well you're not alone that was Sam
you're not alone in that Sam I mean
first of all you got to figure out what
your time frame is you know one of the
truisms of clinical psychology is that
slow and incremental improvement is
first of all normative
in the best possible way in the most
optimistic situation but also very
powerful and so of course you struggle
to remember it in your day-to-day life
because life is difficult and it's
harder to do things than not to do them
and it's harder to do them well than to
do them badly you know and it's easy to
sit around and be hopeless I don't mean
it's emotionally easy because it's not
but it's procedurally easy to be useless
and to fall back into your old habits
and to not discipline yourself and it's
it's a matter of continual practice slow
continual practice and I think a good
example of that is something like weight
lifting you know if you start a
weightlifting program which I would
recommend by the way because it it's
tremendously advantageous physically and
cognitively you're not gonna really see
results for a number of weeks and then
the results are rather slow but you can
get pretty decent results over a six
month period and absolutely stellar
results over a couple of years and so
you have to make sure your timeframe is
right and not to be too hard on yourself
and I did mention the future authoring
program earlier and one of the things I
would recommend too is if you're having
a hard time implementing your your
decisions say your ethical decisions
that you spend a bit more time thinking
them through and writing them down and
the future authoring program is really
helpful thought that's why we designed
it and so get your goal straight and
continue to practice every day and if
you're not succeeding then make your
goals slightly smaller you want to you
want to make your goals large enough so
that they challenge you but small enough
so that you have a reasonable
probability of succeeding at them on a
day to day basis and then you have to
also understand that if you fail on a
given day like let's say you're trying
to quit smoking and you quit for two
weeks and then you have a cigarette and
you think oh my god now I've screwed it
up I'm not quitting anymore you smoke a
Thank you all very much, thank you Barbara,  and to everyone for
First inviting me in, second for attending. So I'm gonna try to do something
very difficult
This evening. I'm going to try to put the idea of
The rights, the right to free speech in the broadest possible
historical context. I
want to start with a comment though, you know, we have a an idea built into our
human rights legislation that all the rights are equal in some sense and
that can't be true because
rights conflict with one another and
when things conflict they have to be hierarchically organized and what that means is that there's there's an implication that
there is a hierarchy of rights as well as a hierarchy of responsibilities and that it's also
Incumbent on us to determine the nature of that hierarchy and to determine what constitutes the sovereign
let's say the sovereign right and I would say you might think of that as a modern conundrum that would only
be of interest to
Countries that have formalized Bills of Rights for example, but it's not a new problem
it's an extraordinarily old problem because there's no difference between
Determining the hierarchy of your rights and determining how to live together successfully
It is exactly the same problem one's only articulated in a legal form and the problem of how we should live together
in the most productive possible manner
Everything considered is as old as mankind itself. In fact, I would say far older than that because the same problem
Bedeviled social animals way down the phylogenetic chain. And so this is an unbelievably archaic problem now
years ago when I started
thinking I suppose in earnest I
was trying to address what I later recognized as a postmodern problem and
the problem was
This was in in the late 70s and early 80s when the Cold War was madly raging
Because it peaked in 1962 and it peaked again and in about 1984 thereabouts
and of course at that time people were very terrified about the potential outcome of the Cold War and for
very good reason and I was curious about very curious about this like insanely curious about it it was
Obsessing me I couldn't understand two things. I couldn't understand why the world had divided itself into two
opposing narratives
why that would happen at all and and also why these
Narratives were of such importance to people apparently that we were willing to arm ourselves
Far beyond the teeth and risk
massive mutual annihilation
to battle out the to battle out that conflict between these two ways of looking at the world and I was curious I mean
First the first question was were these merely two ways of looking at the world?
Because you might think well, there's there's no shortage of ways to live in the world
That's a moral morally
Relativistic stance and there's something to that obviously because people different people different
Occupations and they different outlook and and so forth a difficult different political belief
so there's obviously many ways that we can thrive in the world and so some degree of
flexibility with regards to what constitutes your fundamental axioms
Obviously is is necessary
But there's a deeper question and and it is a very deep question
I actually think it's a it's the question at the bottom of the postmodern conundrum, which is whether or not there are any
Reliable meta-narratives. Let's say overarching narratives that can unite people in some fundamental way. And so I was curious
Where were these just two arbitrary ways of looking at the world both?
potentially equally valid and
We're we battling that out because we didn't know when there was no other way to battle it out
Or was there something deeper at stake?
was it possible that one or the other system was correct in some deep manner and I believe I do truly believe that I
entered that
That universe of questions. Let's say with as open as a mind as possible because I actually wanted to find out the answer
you know because well it seemed to me the fundamental question that
Obviously, we fought a whole Cold War about it was the fundamental question. Who was this?
it was the question everyone's my should have been concentrated on and so I
Started to study deeply this this particular question. The first question was well, what were beliefs made out of like what exactly is it?
What is it? What are we talking about when we talk about a belief?
What does it mean that you have beliefs our beliefs structured?
and also that was a
psychological question rather than a political or economic question and that took me a long time to figure out because I didn't know if the
fundamental question was going to be
Sociological or political or or economic or psychological energy turned out to be psychological or perhaps it turned out to be spiritual
that's another way of thinking about it and
If if you could grasp belief
what would constitute a credible belief and what would it mean for a belief to be credible and
I can give you a little a hint about that. I learned this from Jean Piaget that developmental psychologists brilliant brilliant theorists
Genuine genius he was interested in how children organized games and he thought of games the
Organization of games by children as the precursor to adult interaction and he made some very interesting observations about games
You know
especially pretend games which are quite sophisticated because children will get together and play pretend games and what they'll do is
They act out a simulation of the world
maybe they play house they all get together and they cast each other in different roles and then they each act out those rules and
they do that and then in order to simulate something important that they're going to have to adapt to but
Piaget noted a couple of things the first thing, you know, that was that children playing games can play the games in a group
Thank you very much can play a game in a group
But if you take them out of the group and you ask them what the rules of the game are
They don't know they can't
Articulate the rules of the game yet
When you put them together in the group, they can play the game and I thought oh that's just like adults
You see because because well because we wouldn't need a psychology otherwise, right because we'd all be transparent to ourselves already
So what that means is when we all get together and play a game like the one that we're playing in this room, for example
We all can play the game when we're together
but if we brought us out and said well, what are the rules we wouldn't be able to articulate them and
Then I thought well that means that those rules evolved in a real sense
Like they've evolved in a behavioral
Competition and I thought well that's that's a lot like what's happening with animals if you look at how a chimpanzee troop is
Organized or a wolf pack any social animal for that matter going way down the phylogenetic chain
They have to interact with one another in a manner that
That sustains the group because otherwise they all die obviously and that sustains the individuals within the group and offers the individual some
some scope of action and so there's a set of implicit constraints on the manner in which
creatures interact or they don't live and
and
Piaget also came to the same conclusion with regards to children's games. And and this is where he made a distinction. That's so crucial because
Piaget was actually interested in bridging the gap between science and religion. That was his fundamental his fundamental motivation
although very few people know that and he was interested in bridging the gap between
Science and ethics and and he was interested in how ethics evolved as a as a concept and then as a practically applicable
As something that was practically applicable and he made some very interesting comments about games and said well look
What what constitutes a good game?
well one rule is
everybody plays voluntarily
That's a really good game. And then he made another claim which was quite cool
Which was imagine that you had a game a and E and B, and they were competing
against the target and in in game B people were being forced to play and a game eight people were playing voluntarily and
Then you tracked their track record with regards to competitive advantage over time
The game that people were playing voluntarily would win because the people who were playing wouldn't have to waste any effort and enforcement cost
Oh god, that's so smart
It's so smart because because you can see the idea of the emergence of an ethic theory and not an ethic that's rationally constructed
It's an ethic that's actually emerging from the bottom up
Now if the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche also pointed out that our that our ethic actually emerged from the bottom up it wasn't rational
It wasn't top down. It wasn't enlightenment oriented
Even though the Enlightenment might have codified it
as part of a process of a codification that took place over a very long period of time and so
And then I read other things some say about the way that animals organize the troops. This was later
but but but it's relevant to our talk today that
Primatologist friends to all for example has tried to find out what makes chimpanzee troops stable across time
You know you kind of have this idea that a chimpanzee troop is driven
Let's say by the most dominant powerful male the most aggressive cruel
tyrannical chimpanzee dominates and that isn't what friends do all found what he found was that
In order that those sorts of chimpanzee troops have leaders that meet very violent ends
Because no matter how tyrannical you are as top chimp two chimps 3/4 your size can take you out and they will and chimpanzees are
believably
Unbelievably brutal and very very strong and so tyrannical chimpanzee troops are unstable
It's like that's a major league
Discovery ma'am because it starts to it starts to open up the possibility that the ethic upon which functional states are predicated is far deeper
Than any mere story or any mere
Rationality and that's a really exciting possibility because what it means is that there might be something at the bottom of our ethic
That's really there. It's not just some arbitrary
constructed narrative
it's not just one set of ways to live in the world among many and I would say I would say and I tried to
Outline this partly in twelve rules for life and more in detail in maps of meaning that the evidence on that is already in
Is that there is a there is a convergent ethic that emerges from the bottom-up over
Evolutionary spans of time over millions of years over hundreds of thousands of years over tens of thousands of years as people learn
how to act in a manner that sustains them as
Individuals now and a week from now and a month from now in a year from now
So it has to be iterated that sustains them and their families
Simultaneously that sustains them and their families and their communities across all those time frames
Simultaneously and that's a very very tight set of constraints
And so there might be a very large number of ways to interpret the world as the postmodern set post
Modernists accurately have it but there are not a very large number of ways to exist
Successfully in the world. In fact, it's extraordinarily constrained
it's constrained by the neccessity of playing an
Iterative voluntary game and that's a tight constraint. As any of you who are married know, right?
well, I mean, I mean
I mean
there's absolutely definitively because you see the marriage is a very interesting balancing act because
It has to be good for you, and it has to be good for your wife
let's say but it also has to be good for the two of you and it has to and maybe that's
Superordinate to each of you as individuals and it has to be good for you in that in a way
That's good for your children
And that has to work in society and it has to be something that you can play out moment by moment an hour to hour
And day to day and month to month and week to week and you know
You know perfectly well that there isn't much deviation from the straight and narrow path if you're going to play that game
Because there's just too many ways of falling into trouble and there's way ways of falling into trouble than not falling into trouble
okay, so so that's the first thing so imagine this so this is the this is the idea so
The ethic emerges from the bottom up as we learn how to organize ourselves in ever more complex society sustainable societies
And we don't know what we're doing
Okay, but then what happens is because we're insanely curious and capable of self recognition
We start to tell stories about how it is that we're acting and the stories have two forms
one story is about the structures that we exist in and
That's the stories about other people and every stories about other people, right?
Because we live in a social world and you never see a story. You never go to a movie
You never read a novel that isn't about society and no wonder because that's our environment Society
So stories are about Society and they're about how societies succeed and fail and they're about how individuals within that society
Succeed or fail because what we're trying to do is to watch ourselves and I mean again over the mass of historical time frame
we're trying to watch how it is that we act when we act properly and figure out how to do it as
Individuals and the first way we do that is to code it in stories. That's what stories are for
That's what great literature is for
That's why there are great villains and great heroes and great literature because you want to know how to be a great hero
Unless you want to be a great villain and if you want to be a great hero
You can learn from great villains the opposite of how to act and so you get you get incredible
Incredibly sophisticated
Representations emerging out of that process so that the take on an archetypal form
So for example the the motif of the hostile brothers, which is developed into
Christianity into them between
adversaries of Christ and Satan or Cain and Abel are
The idea of the hero who thrives in the social world and brings renewal to the cosmos
So to speak against the deadly adversary and that's exactly what you need to know and again, it's not arbitrary
It's not an arbitrary set of propositions
It's predicated on the observation of successful and unsuccessful patterns of behavior over very very very very long stretches of time
so there's a behavioral platform and then there's a
narrative
representation of that platform then the two things start to interact because once you have drama and literature
You can learn from drama and literature and alter how you behave and the irr ethic becomes portable
and then what happens after that is that
What happens after that is that thinkers who now have both the behavioural strata and the
representational strata in front of them, right
The procedural ethic the behavioral ethic plus the story
Representation step one step back from that especially after it's written down
this is why white works like the Bible or such critical importance because the the pattern the dramatic patterns are then written down and then
You can step back from them with your consciousness and you can start to analyze them for their for the rule based content you see
That emerging to some degree in the story of Moses
that's actually what's laid out in part in the story of Moses because Moses is leading his people through the desert and
Watching how they fight and watching how they behave and then he has this so it's all very very dramatic. Then he has this tremendous
Revelation, which is this is how we already act
Right. And so what happens is the rules are codified on the basis of the observation of the patterns that are already extent that are
Functional that's a transformation of consciousness at that point
You have your ethic which is far deeper than anything that you can imagine
Start to be articulated out into the body of laws and that's the point at which you have
Let's say true philosophy at the beginning of the body of laws. It's called the body of laws for a reason and so
well, I thought that was all just amazing to have to have to have observed that to think about that bottom-up process and then I
Started reading a lot of religious mythology and I ran across this motif that was developed very in great detail by a Romanian
Murchie le a de who was a great scholar of religions
remarkable remarkable books including a history of religious ideas
which is
Highly recommended book and he talked about this
Interesting motif that I had run across and other writings on mythology and and and in religious stories
which was the Battle of the gods in heaven across time and one of the things Iliad I pointed out was that if you if
You looked at the development of religious system. So say the development of the religious system that came to dominate
Mesopotamia when the Mesopotamian tribes came together imagine each of those tribes had their own God right and then when they came together
That was terribly fractious because you know what happens when different people with different gods get to it's it's ugly
It's ugly and it's no wonder because you know
They all have an ethic and they they're living within the ethic and they're using it to structure their worlds
but the ethics apparently collide and so what happens that the
Civilizational level is that there's constant negotiation and cognitive transformation within the individual populations
But that's represented over the large span of time as a battle between the gods that represent the different tribes in heaven. And so
then what happens across time as all those gods organize themselves into a hierarchy and one God comes out on top and that God is
The supreme god and then this societies like Mesopotamia. Is that Mesopotamia that also happened in ancient Greece?
They assumed that their sovereign is that the person who acts out the sovereign God
Because you might say well where does the concept of sovereignty come from?
Right, if it's not just brute force and it's not his brute force doesn't work. It has to have some other basis
What's the basis of sovereignty? What's the basis of authority not power authority competence Authority, right?
well
How's that played out it's played out by the battle between ethics systems of ethics that are represented in religious language
across vast epochs of time and then the societies of gods
let's say organize themselves into a hierarchy and they have a God at the top and that's actually
Laid right out in the anime ilish for example, which is the oldest
Creation story that we have and out of which it's derived from the same
what would you say cultural substrate is the stories in Genesis, for example, although it represents a variant the the
Mesopotamians had all their gods aggregate themselves together because they were threatened by the unknown
That's what happens in me in the Mesopotamian creation. Myth the unknown gives rise to the gods
They become very fractious and compete and then the unknown decides to destroy them again like God destroying Noah Noah's people in the flood
It's the same basic idea. There's an idea there and the idea is that
We emerge out of the unknown and we're always threatened by it
Not only as individuals but as a group and that means that we need to figure out what it is
That should guide us in order to continually confront the unknown and prevail and so what happens in
Mesopotamia is the gods all get together in a congress and they basically they elect a new God and he new kind of God
His name is marek. By the way, he has eyes all the way around his head and so he pays attention
That's not the same as thinking. It's a different thing attention
It's the same thing the Egyptians
represented and worshiped with the eye of horus the idea that what you should do if you want to survive in this world if you
Want to play a voluntary game that everybody could participate in your bloody eyes better be open
because there are the things that will save you and that's attention and the other thing that mardik didn't he spoke magic words and
so when he spoke the night sky would appear the day sky would appear and so the
Mesopotamians figured out in their great religious story that the fundamental sovereign God was he who pays attention and speaks the truth and
that's something that's something that's
That's not something you punish people for
Right because there's this this is the deepest idea of mankind. It's developed in detail in Genesis in the Old Testament
It's the fundamental idea of Genesis that God uses the logos the word of God to cast
Potential which we all face. That's what we face potentials, right?
You know that you know that the future is unstructured
You have a you have a potential within you that can meet that and there's a potential that
Characterizes the future you meet it with eyes open and with truthful speech
And that's what happens in Genesis because God uses the logos
Which is truthful speech to cast the pre cosmogonic
Potential into habitable order and then he says it's good and there there's a hint there
right because you think well is
habitable order good because life is very difficult and it's a real question whether or not the order that we inhabit is good and the
hypothesis in the Old Testament, is that if
Truthful speech gives rise to the order then that order will be good
And that's really something that like that's really something to apprehend. It's a fundamental
theological
presupposition that the way that you take the potential upon which the cosmos is
Predicated and cast it into the order that allows everyone to thrive is by using
truthful speech
Wouldn't it be something if that was the case and the thing is, you know, it's the case
You know it you know it because you do not admire yourself
If you're deceitful you admire yourself when you have those rare moments in your life where you can actually stand up and say what's true
regardless of the cost and
If you if you give that respect to other people if you treat them as if they're the locale of the divine speech that casts
potential into habitable order
Then they like you maybe they even love you and they get along with you and you could work with them and you can cooperate
With them and you can compete with them. So not only is it the the fundamental axiom that regulates your relationship with yourself?
It's the fundamental axiom that regulates your interactions with other people
And if you do not give them that that honor which is the the presuppositions for their natural
right
Right because you're the idea that you have a natural right is the idea that you have some sort of intrinsic value
If you don't paint treat people as if they have that intrinsic rate, they are not happy with you
Even if they don't know why
because everyone wants to be treated as if
They have free will and as if they confront
potential and as if they're capable of making moral choices and that they should be rewarded when they do things right and perhaps
Punished when they do things wrong, everyone wants that and everyone knows it
And so well, so what does that all have to do with free? Speech well
Yes, everything that's exactly right. So
Free speech isn't free speech. You know people think of free speech is
Kind of like a decoration something like that in your life, and it's not that at all
It's not the ability to speak truth to power. Although it is also that it's not that it's way more than that
Free speech is how you think?
It's not thinking you know that the word that the Genesis relies on to create the cosmos
Let's say in the story
By the way, that's the image of God in which you're made male and female that gives you that fundamental value
That's at the core of our idea of natural right? It's not thinking it's speaking
And the reason for that is look first of all
You can hardly think
It's really hard to think you have to be trained like mad to think you have to be able to divide yourself
Internally into a couple of different
People and then you have to let those people have a war in your head and that means you have to develop
characters who have opinions in
Great detail opinions that might be contrary to your own and then you have to withstand
the tension of letting them have it out and you only see that
Thinking in great literature like you see that in Dostoyevsky
He's an absolute master of that and you know
You can think a little bit but mostly you're biased and you have confirmation
bias
And you see things the way you see them and you have massive blind spots and you're ignorant as hell you just you just you
Just can't think but you can talk and the thing is if you talk other people will correct you
that's the thing and that's
Thinking so if you get up and you have some something to say and you say it stupidly because of course you will because what?
Do you know then other people will tell you where you're wrong and then you can learn right?
And then everybody can think and so what that also means is that to be free to speak
Even to tell the truth means you have to be free to be stupid and ignorant and malevolent and bitter
Because that is who you are. That is what you are cuz you're flawed
So the idea that you know, you can't use your free speech if it's offensive, it's just it's an idea
That is so evident. You don't know if it's naivety. Oh does it's malevolence
It's a real battle which of the which of those two things are worse
I would go with malevolence because it detract some it attacks something. That's so absolutely fundamental
It's like well, of course people who are speaking freely are going to be offensive
I mean, have you ever had a serious discussion with anyone in your life and I mean a serious discussion?
I mean this sort of discussion you have when you're with your wife when you're wondering whether your marriage is going to survive or you
Or with your kids when they've done something that is really not in their best long-term interest
I mean a serious discussion. You can't even get off the ground without being offensive
You can't get off the ground without offending yourself in a conversation like that
You don't even want to admit how you feel or how you think to yourself if you think you can have a difficult conversation?
Without offending people all that means is you're not having a difficult conversation
Because for an easy conversation by definition, no one gets upset about that. There's no real problem. There's no real disagreement
There's and there's no real real world problem to be solved
It's just trivial it's like discussing, you know, last night's sports event
There's nothing to it
If you're going to have a conversation about something that matters
you know in the world made out of what matters that's a good thing to remember if you're going to have a
Discussion about what matters if you're really going to talk about it?
Everyone is going to be offended by that
Especially if there's something rotten in the state of Denmark and you happen to either one in Tripoli that is pointing it out
So then you think well your freedom of speech that's not about you being able to speak truth to power
That's about you being able to chart your destiny in the world and more than that
it's even more than that's important enough because you know life is hard and if you don't get to think
When you when you walk through your life, you will fall into a pit
There's no doubt about that because that's what thinking is for is to stop you from having anymore
Catastrophes that are absolutely necessary and it's a terribly difficult process
And so if if that's interfered with it, isn't that you don't get to speak truth to power
It's that you do not get to act in the world in a manner that allows you to to eliminate
Endless unnecessary hellish suffering and not just for you
But for you and your family and your community and so the enemies of free speech
They're the enemies of the process that turns potential into habitable order
They're our enemies of the Divine Principle and worse. They're their own enemies
right because this isn't well some of us believe in free speech and some of us don't
It's way deeper than that
If you don't believe in free speech you don't believe in the implicit divinity of mankind
You don't believe in the sovereignty of the individual you don't believe in sovereignty as such you're a totalitarian of some sort
Which means you attribute all the divine power to yourself. It's and then we know where that leads, right
It doesn't matter whether it's on the right or the left if we had any sense and we took a look at 20th century history
We know exactly where things go and we could easily choose not to go there
And so when we see someone like reiieve who's imprisoned by a reprehensible?
dictatorship that we have the gall to call our allies then what we see is a
System that's not only hell bent on the destruction of an innocent and good man, but but directly
antithetical to everything that all of us have and there are societies put forward as
necessary to the continual betterment of being itself and so
And I've been so absolutely appalled by the Western world's we need response to the attacks of
Totalitarians upon our freedom of speech the what was done with Salman Rushdie. That was a big big big big mistake, right?
Because it wasn't Rushdie
It was the free speaking artistic tradition of the West and not only of the West right the free speaking
Artistic creative tradition upon which the cosmos is properly established
That's what it was and we all bow down
We all bow down with no resistance whatsoever. It was a massive error
We're gonna pay for that for a very long time. We did the same thing with the Danish cartoons
And you don't want to think about these sorts of things as happening far away
Nothing happens far away when it happened somewhere else is happening right here, too
and that's why we're all here today because we recognize that at least on some level and
We have to stop we need to stop being so naive about our let's say our moral relativism
We need to take a look at history and biology in a very very fundamental way and we need to really understand what our culture
What our culture and and genuine cultures everywhere?
predicated on and that is the idea that the sovereign voice of the individual is the power that casts potential into habitable being and
Restructures tyrannical order when it needs to be restructured
right
And that's what each of us are that's the divine presence in each of us and I do believe that there is no more
Fundamental truth than that, I don't believe that you can date down underneath that. I think that's bedrock
That's the foundation stone of the house
That's the cornerstone of the house and it requires everyone to courageously confront the tyranny
that's them and the unknown that surrounds them and to work for their own benefit and for the benefit of their families and for the
Benefit of their communities and to do everything they can to benefit the world and to live with true speech as the highest value
That's how we sort out the world and we could sort it out
We are sorting it out at a very rapid rate and we could do that much much more effectively
If now I do believe that it's incumbent on us to understand the absolutely fundamental role that these processes take
I know we're here today because we all have at least an intimation of that, right?
We know that there's something about free speech
That's so central that we cannot allow attacks on it to go unchallenged no matter where they occur
But it's very useful to have it articulated and to know that this is bedrock
right
And it's not something arbitrary and it's not a mere game a mere game that we're only playing in the West none of that
It's something it's the most fundamental truth that the human race has ever discovered and we we lose it at our absolute
Peril, and it's not death
It's worse than that the peril
Because there are worse things than death and the worst things than death is hell and we saw plenty of that in the 20th century
And when we let freedom of speech go, that's where we're headed
And unless we want to go there then we should stop aiming for it
So well, thank you very much for the invitation good night.
[Music]
Jordan it's great to to interview you
again I interviewed you back in October
last year and then made I've now made
two documentaries about you and a big
focus for rebel wisdom is kind of making
sense of the cultural moment and making
sense of your success and what it
represents and I don't know if you
remember but the very first question I
asked you back in October in the
interview was firstly what do you make
of your success so far and are you ready
for it to continue because I had I had a
sense back then that what your message
represented was something the culture
desperately needed the sort of and what
that signifies to me is a kind of
reintegration of the sacred did you have
any sense back then the the exponential
success that you were going to have
between then and now well I mean the
most likely outcome at each of the what
would you say at each point where I
might notice what's going on around me
has been that this was stopped but it
isn't stopping so I've been thinking
about that pretty much non-stop I would
say and I have some some solutions let's
say or some ideas that I didn't present
in October so one of the things I've
realized is that part of what's pushing
part of what's accounting for this the
popularity of my ideas is actually a
secondary consequence of a technological
revolution and I've seen that more
clearly since October party because I
can see the mainstream media dying at a
faster and faster rate and the
alternative media expanding faster and
faster so television radio and the
classic print media had shared one thing
in common which was a extreme
restriction in bandwidth this was
especially true of television because
each minute of television given the
necessity to broadcast in the
that was unbelievably expensive and so
there just wasn't time to do anything on
television
there's no time and so if you had
something important to say or even
something unimportant for that matter
most of the time it had to be compressed
into something approximating 30 seconds
which wouldn't even be your words it
would be a journalist common commenting
on what you said and if you were really
pushing the envelope maybe you'd have 25
minutes on a talk show that was devoted
to your ideas but then even that would
be highly scripted and so television
made people look stupider than they were
even to the producers of television
because of this narrow bandwidth the the
rise of video online and audio as well
has blown the bandwidth limitation out
of our mass communication and it turns
out that people are smarter with longer
attention spans than we thought
what happened with me was that for one
reason or another I was an early adopter
of that technology and so there's this
massive technological transformation
which is a Gutenberg revolution in the
provision of video and audio no barrier
to production because it doesn't cost
anything anyone can do it people can
communicate with it you can cut up
YouTube videos you can make your
documentaries the entry point is easy
audio podcasts and that sort of thing
which can be of indefinite length allow
people to use found time to listen more
people can listen than can read like all
of these things add up to a massive
technological revolution and it's that
upswell in technology that in part has
propelled what I've been doing to to to
to to to to to this mass audience and so
that's been a relief to figure that out
because it depersonalized is it to some
degree right and so I used the metaphor
when I've been asked about this before
of being on a wave
I'm surfing on a giant wave but the wave
isn't something that I've done it's part
of this technological revolution so
that's a relief to know that and I'm
quite convinced that that's the case
because there are other people who are
occupying the same space essentially Joe
Rogan is a very good example of that and
the various commentators on on YouTube
who've become increasingly influential
and powerful same thing driven by the
technology they happen to be early
adopters and so and then there's a
secondary question which is well is
there anything specific in relationship
to my content let's say and I would say
also that is it the case and I think
what I've been able to do with
reasonable effectiveness is to draw a
conceptual equation equivalence between
the meaning that's necessary to sustain
you in life given its suffering and
malevolence and the necessity to adopt
responsibility and I think there's
something new about that
I mean I don't know how new I'm sure I
am NOT the first person who's discovered
that but I think I've done a reasonable
job of pointing out to people that that
the suffering that's intrinsic to life
in the absence of meaning is not
tolerable it it it destroys and corrupts
and that the proper pathway out of that
isn't rights or happiness or entitlement
or or anything that's associated with
with with individual ease let's say but
with the adoption of something
approximating maximum responsibility and
people get that like it's it's not that
hard to understand when it's laid out
like that and lots of people especially
young people especially people who are
young and also somewhat nihilistic in
their orientation perhaps because of an
excess of intellectual criticism are
they grab that immediately think oh
there's the missing piece I see it's
that the the antidote to this
meaninglessness this void that I'm for
isn't hedonism it's not right it's not
impulsive pleasure it's none of that
it's responsibility it's like oh yes
okay that everything snaps into place
and so that's been I think that's the
most essential part of the message to
the degree that what I'm doing has an
essential message that would be it and I
do think that's what accounts for a
large part of its impact and you
mentioned Joe Rogan before you and here
group together in this sort of new
constellation of the intellectual dark
web what do you see is the I mean what
you make of your kind of inclusion in
this and what do you see is its role
going forward in the culture well well
it's it's it's it's like a herd of cats
right because so I've thought about well
what what what unites us to the degree
that there's an us because that's not so
self-evident there's enough of an us so
that the name emerged and it's stuck so
so there's something in common because
otherwise the name wouldn't have stuck
right you can't name nothing it doesn't
work and I've talked a fair bit about
this with Dave Rubin because Dave Rubin
and I have been touring together right
he opens my my discussions and adds a
nice comedic touch to them and so what
do we have in common
everybody in the group is an independent
practitioner so an entrepreneur
essentially with their own media
enterprise that's autonomous none of us
are serving any master except the
audience so so and and we're all
somewhat independent financially as a
consequence of that and so that makes us
beholden to no master all of us are
engaged in these long-form discussions
right and one of the consequences of
being engaged in a long-form discussion
is that you can assume that your
intelligence that your audience is
intelligent and so that's another thing
that unites everybody in the group is we
all assume that our audience is
intelligent but I think that that's not
so much a consequence of any
particular moral virtue on our parts but
an observation that the technology has
made possible it's like oh when you can
see this I would say particularly with
Roman because in some sense he's a
trailblazer in this domain it's like Oh
turns out my audience will listen to the
three-hour discussion but he wouldn't
been able to discover that without the
technology right so now to his credit he
was smart enough to discover it and
smart enough to notice it when he
discovered it and so and I think that
also characterizes the rest of the
people in this group it's like oh look
at that the audience actually wants our
listeners let's say in viewers want
detailed in-depth unscripted spontaneous
meaningful conversation and then really
are willing to go in that direction
that's the risk-taking element like I
can give an example of that so I just
did for talks with Sam Harris who's
often grouped into this group as well on
the relationship between science and
religion say or facts and values that's
another way of thinking about it with a
bit of politics thrown in discussion of
left/right differences and so on
what's the willingness to take the risk
well I had no idea when I Ament Sam in
Vancouver which was where the first two
of the four talks were held I'd never
met him before we did a two podcast
together one of which was very we got
locked in the other one which was more
productive I would say but I had no idea
of he had I could talk but we we we were
willing to willing to I guess that's
right agreed to take the risk to see if
we could talk in a public forum and and
I think that's another thing that
characterizes the people in that group
is that they will take those sorts of
risks if you go into a television studio
a classic television studio all the
conversation is scripted and it's
actually quite frustrating because you
can't have a conversation with the
journalist because the journalist isn't
there
who's there is a frontispiece for the
organization and the organization has
scripted all there
and so it's not actually like talking to
a person it's really like talking to a
puppet so for better or for worse but in
these long unscripted long-form
conversations then you can take the risk
of having a conversation and that can go
spectacularly well but it can also fail
dismally so I would say those are the
things that unite us to the degree that
the group exists I mean I admit I was in
LA a week ago and about seven of us got
together for for dinner and that was the
first time we we met as anything
approximating a group and you know it
was interesting to watch everybody
interact because as I said it really is
a herd of cats there's tremendous
diversity of political opinion and a
tremendous diversity of personality like
Eric Weinstein and Joe Rogan like
they're not even members of the same
species in some ways you know so so it's
a very fractious group but I think those
things that I outlined are the elements
that basically unite it there's also
something that I sense watching some of
the discussions there's a kind of
intellectual curiosity and a sense of
people thinking in public and and
there's also a sense of maybe the
potential for people to change their
minds or to discover things during the
conversation well that's partly the
appreciation of the intelligence of the
audience it's like and I would say it is
actually the manifestation of the
process of thinking that's more
important than the conclusions that are
generated even in these discussions that
I've been having with Harris like we are
trying to to argue out to different
viewpoints because Harris believes that
values can be derived with with with
unerring precision in some sense using
the proper methodology from facts and I
I believe that it's more complicated
than that that there has to be
intermediating structures and those are
really narrative in in their nature so
there's a technical argument as well as
a variety of sub arguments of
the relative role of traditional
religion and so forth but the outcome of
the debate about those issues is partly
what people are coming to the talks to
see to to to determine what should the
conclusions be but a much larger part
perhaps is to in to observe and engage
at least by proxy in the process of
dialogue and that's more important
because dialogue is the process by which
complex problems are solved which is
what makes me a free speech advocate
fundamentally well it's not an advocate
it's like I realized that that the
protection for free speech is protection
of the mechanism whereby complex social
problems are solved and we're were the
people in this group and many other
people as well are acting out that
dialogical process and and people are
happy about that as they should be and I
read The Spectator review of your recent
conversation I think you've now come to
the end of your debates for sam harris
and they said that you expressed a
little bit of irritation at some of the
when sand and grass some of the points
that you were making or that you didn't
fully appreciate that he'd and
understood them I also think that Sam
Harris in particular like he's built a
whole kind of personality career several
books on this atheism position do you
think that he can argue in good faith
from that perspective could he turn
around and say well actually no you're
right Jordan this atheism thing is it no
I think he was I think he was I think he
was conducting the discussion in good
faith I actually think that what Sam is
doing is a good faith project you know
he I think there's conceptual muddiness
about it but you know his basic premise
is that we could come to an agreement
that working to reduce unnecessary
misery and suffering is a universal good
okay fair enough that seems like a
reasonable proposition I don't think
it's a proposition of fact and he claims
that it is but that doesn't matter still
it's fair enough then
and then you know that's what
proposition another proposition is it
would be really good if our systems of
value weren't founded on error and what
do we have that's not error well we have
facts we have objective facts I mean
look at the technology look at what
we've done with our science it's like
you don't want to underestimate the
utility of objective fact so maybe we
can ground the value structure in the
facts it's like well that would be good
if we could do it so and and so and then
his his ethic let's say is an amalgam of
those two propositions and I think that
his project is honorable and and and I
think he's committed to it he also
rightly is concerned with the dangers of
the Fundamentalist dangers of revealed
truth and so is very skeptical about
about the axiomatic claims of dogmatic
religion yeah fair enough but his the
mechanisms that he outlines to derive
values from facts are insufficient in my
estimation I don't think that his
argument is sufficiently sophisticated
even though I don't doubt it's I don't
think that Sam is any less committed to
an ethical good it's not obvious to me
that he is than I am you know and he's
argued and discussed fully in good faith
as far as I'm concerned you know with
the with the odd error because no one is
negotiating 100% all the time in good
faith I mean that's a standard that no
one can can this can achieve but I think
the discussions have been unbelievably
productive and and we'll see that
certainly the crowds are responding I
don't think the crowds would have been
engaged if Sam wouldn't be wouldn't been
discussing in good faith you know
because the engagement is actually an
indication that a good faith discussion
is is occurring otherwise it gets dull
very very rapidly we'll see what happens
when the videos are released
and that will be in August once there
the sound is edited and all of that and
people will have a public debate about
how it how the discussion proceeded I
also think that each discussion built on
the previous one and that we both ended
up I think we both ended that more
informed and more articulate than we
started out so that's a good that's a
really good thing I certainly understand
his arguments much better than I did
well a year ago let's say and I've heard
Eric Weinstein describe sort of the
cultural moment as a kind of civil war
within the left sort of extreme left and
then the sort of moderate soft left
which are probably sort of the at least
the dominating kind of paradigm in the
media I I'm I've got a lot of
progressive friends and what I see
happening recently maybe in the last
couple of weeks is a lot of them
starting to grapple with your ideas and
looking at lasting this question what
can the left learn from Jordan Peterson
which is which is a pretty new
development because I saw a lot of kind
of reactivity to it before how can you
personally contribute to that debate and
well debate you're interesting oh yeah
absolutely
no no doubt about it no doubt about it
what one thing that I've been doing in
my tour repeatedly when I talk about the
first chapter of my book which is stand
up straight with your shoulders back
it's a discussion of hierarchies and and
their eternal nature right because my
claim is it is not my claim I think it's
mere fact that organisms that have to
cooperate and compete with other
organisms of their type inevitably
arrange themselves into hierarchies and
that's been going on for so long which
is at least 300 million years that our
nervous systems have adapted to
hierarchies as if there are permanent
element of being right more permanent
than trees like seriously permanent at
the most fundamental neurochemical the
one that regulates the entire brain
serotonin is acutely sensitive to
hierarchical distinctions and so that's
part of the prop is it so the reason
I laid that proposition forward was to
say whatever pitfalls hierarchies might
produce you cannot lay them at the feet
of the West patriarchy or capitalism
it's like that's a non-starter you're
wrong and not just a little bit wrong
you're so seriously wrong that if you
insist upon doing that you won't even
achieve your own aims because you're
actually not grappling with the problem
the problem is if hierarchies are a
problem which they are the problem is
way more serious than mere capitalism
it's way deeper and if you're actually
interested in rectifying the constantly
the negative consequences of hierarchies
then you're going to have to get a lot
more sophisticated than they're then
you're idiot Marxism so so so part of
the elaboration of that argument as well
hierarchies are inevitable because we
have to solve complex problems and we
have to solve them socially and when you
implement a solution to a complex
problem socially you produce a hierarchy
because some people are better at the
implementation than others so there's a
hierarchy of competence and then there's
a hierarchy of distribution of the
Spoils and so and in both of those
hierarchies you get a disproportionate
clumping of resources at the top and
dispossession at the bottom in the
nature of hierarchies so what's the left
for the left is to remind those who are
benefiting from the hierarchies that the
hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost
is the clumping of people at the bottom
and that that's an eternal cost and it's
not trivial and so that's what the left
should be properly focused on the Left
should be providing the voice of those
who are dispossessed by hierarchies and
the right should be saying yeah but the
damn hierarchies are necessary and
they're not only necessary but they're
also productive than the left says yes
but they tilt towards tyranny and they
hi everybody i'm here today again with
greg hurwitz an old friend of mine a
former student from harvard um
we've talked before and we've got some
exciting things to talk about today i'll
give you some background on greg first
greg is a new york times number one
internationally best-selling author of
20 thrillers including out of the dark
coming out in 2019 and two award-winning
thriller novels for teens
his novels have won numerous literary
awards grace top 10 lists and have been
published in 30 languages
he's written screenplays for or sold
spec scripts to many of the major
studios including the book of henry and
written developed and produced tv for
various networks
he's also a new york times best-selling
comic book writer having penned stories
from marvel wolverine and punisher and
dc batman and penguin he's published
numerous academic articles on
shakespeare taught fiction writing in
the usc english department and guest
lectured for ucla and for harvard in the
united states and internationally
in the course of researching his
thrillers he sneaked onto demolition
ranges with navy seals swum with sharks
in the galapagos and gone undercover
into mind control cults
herwitz grew up in the bay area while
completing a ba from harvard and a
masters from trinity college oxford in
shakespearean tragedy he wrote his first
novel he was the undergraduate scholar
athlete of the year at harvard for his
pole vaulting exploits and played
college soccer in england where he was a
knox fellow
so that's
greg everybody
it's quite an intro i think i'm just
gonna have you follow me around
everywhere and read that before i enter
a room
dislikes me yeah like yeah exactly
that's right that's the sort of intro
that makes everyone hopes you're a real
son of a after reading an intro
like that so they can they can morally
dislike you yes the best thing yeah
there's a lot to morally dislike jordan
as you know yeah yeah so we're not going
to talk too much today about
greg's previous exploits uh instead
we're going to talk about some of the
work he's been doing in the political
realm recently and the reasons for doing
that so greg i'm going to let you take
that away
well so
look i write thrillers and i have the
shorthand that i always give is that
about half of my friends are born again
christian navy seal snipers and half my
friends are gay aclu lawyers
and i tour equally in the red and blue
states my readership is very very
diverse and i think because of that i
have a real ear for
the the buzzwords and phrases and
ideological shorthand that really shut
people down
um that just make them stop listening um
my own politics i'd say i'm a bit more
of a classical liberal um
and one of the things that i talk a lot
about is there's certain phrases that
we've grown up with from both sides that
just make people completely stop and
it's not dissimilar to what we're trying
to do when we're writing right if you
write and use buzzwords and catch
phrases and cliches it's less
interesting if you already know what you
think before you start writing and
there's no room for discovery along the
way then you're not it's not real
writing it's propaganda right it's
amrand you're never going to be
surprised by something in the third act
and so there's a real overlap for that
that i found and so one of the things
that i've been trying to do uh given how
polarized i have found discourse to be
and how i found myself moving between
vastly different worlds
is to try to commit myself to ending um
or contributing to ending polarizing
discourse uh and so part of that is i've
been focused on trying to rebrand the
the democratic party uh working with a
lot of different candidates and entities
in an effort to get away from from
gridlock and more towards solutions um i
have a view that's a lot like jonathan
height who you've interviewed at length
um who i think gives a great
description of the need and necessity
for both conservatives and liberals in
that
you know conservatives like walls around
things right they like walls around
gender they like walls around countries
uh build a wall as sort of a brilliant
republican slogan and the job of of
liberals is to say hang on a minute if
that wall is too impenetrable
you're not going to have new ideas and
people and then we'll stagnate and die
and so for me and you and i've talked
before about how it's also the case for
inventors and entrepreneurs
who kind of create things which tends to
be more of a liberal leaning but if you
want them run effectively often you need
conservative managers to come in
and so
i want there to be stronger parties on
both sides i mean i want there to be
better discourse i think if there's a
stronger republican party it makes the
democratic party have to raise their
game and come up with solutions and out
of the one thing i will say that has
been common of everyone who i talked to
is nobody is thrilled with the level of
political discourse right now
also there's a couple of things there
that are really interesting i mean you
talk about the necessity for
uh high quality representation on both
sides of the political uh
um political what do you call that
continuum let's say
right and and there are really powerful
temperamental and philosophical reasons
for that so you know you mentioned that
the liberal types tend to be
entrepreneurs and creators and uh
conservative types tend to be managers
and administrators so that's that's
pretty well documented in the
psychological literature but you see
echoes of that and you you mentioned the
border issue as well because of course
to categorize things we have to put
boundaries around them but boundaries
can artificially separate and and make
things stagnant as well so we have to
have a continual discussion about
exactly where the boundary should be
drawn without ever also presuming that
we should just do away with boundaries
all together because that does away with
category and then with regards to
hierarchies well
you know it seems to be the job of the
right wing to
put forward the proposition that
hierarchies are necessary from an
organizational perspective so
if a bunch of people decide to go do
something of value let's say it's of
collective value as well as individual
value then inevitably when they operate
cooperatively and competitively they're
going to produce a hierarchy and the
hierarchy is actually a tool to
accomplish that task in in the social
arena but the problem with that is that
a hierarchy can become over rigid and
corrupt and it can dispossess people
without without that dispossession being
a necessary function of the task that
the hierarchy is attempting to perform
right what's that it's always both right
i mean it's always that we needed to
organize and they're always our
inequities but a result of it that's
right and the thing that i have found is
that when people lock in the political
conversations from one side or the other
it becomes all or nothing and for me
nothing gets accomplished in all or
nothing and so to straw man
you know democrats that all of them just
want to tear down the whole system and
you know those are some of the loud
voices on twitter isn't helpful any more
than the claim that republicans have no
interest whatsoever in the people who
are dispossessed and so a lot of what's
important is to look at
you know
conservatives who are
you know thoughtful it's not like they
love the fact that people are
dispossessed so the question becomes how
do we all help that and how do we
actually have a discussion and how do we
how do we get away from the fact that
compromise
towards solutions is somehow a betrayal
that if you compromise anything from the
furthest extreme you're sort of
betraying your own ideology and your own
people yeah well i think partly you do
that by focusing on specific problems
instead of broader ideological solutions
and that's so part of what we're trying
to discuss today and to contribute to is
the the re-centralization let's say of
the political parties and also to make a
case for the necessity of intelligent
discourse knowing that people on both
sides of the political spectrum have
something intelligent to say
so the conservatives have every reason
to
put forward the proposition that
hierarchies are both inevitable and
useful
but also to keep firmly in mind that
they can become corrupt and that they do
tend to dispossess and the liberals have
any every reason to keep in mind that
hierarchies are absolutely necessary in
order to get things done but that
the dispossessed need of voice so that
the system remains both permeable and
fair
and it's really necessary for both sides
to have some uh respect for the position
of the alternative of the alternative
temperamental type let's say well that's
where we have to meet in in rational
sort of enlightenment discourse or else
we can't win you know right you talked a
lot about the big the big five
personality traits and the ways that it
orients differently in politics so it's
like liberals are higher in empathy
right in higher and openness that's why
a lot of artists you find are um tend to
be liberal you know at least the good
ones like we have bruce springsteen and
on the other side it's hard for for for
president trump to fill up an arena with
people who who are the artists of
a certain caliber
and
you know it doesn't mean that that
higher empathy is better and i think
often when liberals are talking they're
trying to push through only empathy and
higher empathy and they're trying to
educate people in the higher empathy
well it's a fixed psychological trait
and the other thing is you know
republicans or or conservatives tend to
be higher in conscientiousness and
conscientiousness codes for a bunch of
things that are really useful you know
codes for better health better finances
more stable marriages and longer
lifespan so one of the things when i'm
advising you know democrats is like you
can't if you you have to win an argument
on the merits you have to make a better
argument if you're losing people you
can't just go to them and say be more
empathetic that's not an argument right
it's it's like going to
president clinton and saying can't you
just be an introvert these are sort of
fixed traits and the other thing is is a
lot of conservatives are doing fine over
there with their stable marriages and
longer lives well and the empathy issue
is interesting as well because it's easy
for that to be regarded reflexively as a
virtue
but an excess of pity let's say can be
destructive there's a whole
psychoanalytic literature on the
negative consequences of of fostering
over dependence let's say and that's a
real problem and there is a managerial
literature too that suggests that less
agreeable managers do better as well as
less agreeable people in general having
higher incomes because they're better at
bargaining for themselves so it is
really necessary to give some
consideration to the fact that each of
these temperaments has it marked
advantages and disadvantages and a
proper niche where it can function and
and other places where it actually
constitutes a problem well that's where
we have to rise above ourselves and meet
like where do we meet we meet in freedom
of speech there's a reason it's the
first amendment you know if i was dumb
enough to be a single issue voter that
would be my single issue because part of
it is
as as a classical liberal i tend to
approach things i have a strong amount
of empathy but i also realize that
that's not a trait that i can map onto
everybody else when i'm having a
discussion that i have to actually meet
and make arguments
for people who who approach the world in
different ways and have different kinds
of successes to make higher
conscientious arguments in a way that
appeals more broadly and i mean that's
free marketplace of ideas we have to
meet and figure out and discuss these
matters and if we're not doing it in
words we're doing with fists
the other problem with agreeableness
let's say an empathy is that
the the the empathetic identification
tends to make the person who's
experiencing it feel immediately
virtuous because they're on the side of
the weaker party let's say and there's
obviously some utility in that but it's
not really it doesn't come
with a set of
solutions to complex problems
you know it seems to me that
agreeableness is a pretty good virtue
for small units like the family where
egalitarian distribution is of extreme
importance but it doesn't seem to work
very well at at higher levels of
complexity so for example it's
conscientiousness that predicts
workplace proficiency
you know it's the second best predictor
after iq agreeableness is actually
somewhat negatively correlated unless
unless the domain has to do with with
direct personal care and so i don't
think agreeableness scales very well
which is why conscientiousness has to
enter into the picture
yeah i view it as like a very helpful
motivator for myself i look at a problem
my approach tends to be empathy for
people who have been left out or have
been who don't have the right end of the
dominance hierarchy um and and for me
it's a motivator to look at actual
solutions and problems and issues and
there's a lot of real concrete things
that can be attacked but if you don't
attack them from a perspective that's
morally condescending you can actually
get done well it also
it's also very helpful to increase the
resolution of the problem right and and
to stop trying to solve every problem
with one with one brush stroke most
things are really complicated so
intelligent political discourse should
involve decomposing a problem like
poverty which isn't our problem but a
set of a thousand problems into each of
those thousand problems and then trying
to generate creative solutions to each
of them and then to test them and so
the resolution of the of the discussion
has to be increased and one of the
things that you and i had talked about
was the possibility that these
longer-form the longer-form discourse
um avenues that are available on the new
media like what we're doing right now
might enable us to identify and promote
politicians who are capable of high
resolution discussion who have real
solutions to real problems instead of
having to compress everything into a six
second sound bite well the other thing
that i'm finding really heartening is a
lot of the candidates that i am working
with interacting with and at this point
that's in the hundreds
are very focused on actual solutions and
i'm trying to get a handle on
you know the cultural conversation
whatever the hell that is
it benefits by blowing the extremes up
and it feels like that's almost all that
we're hearing about and when i'm dealing
with actual candidates a lot of them are
dealing with anti-corruption healthcare
jobs and education like they're aware
that that isn't the play and so there's
this amplifying effect and then we have
a lot of sort of like this cultural
conversation about the cultural
conversation that things become very
kind of meta and the level that
candidates are operating at and the
level that people are you know i'm
dealing a lot with candidates in
different states people are having a
hard time right now and they need
hardcore solutions and they actually
don't give a about everyone on
twitter and facebook who's you know
preaching everyone hasn't already
unfriended them they need solutions they
need a government that's functional they
need uh they want more transparency and
lack of corruption there's a very common
set of things that that govern people
but there's a sort of amplified effect
from the extremes of the party that are
are gathering the the attention and the
biggest tool that we have in a democracy
in some ways is our attention and where
we focus
and if that's being hijacked by
you know conversations and
straw men i mean i would love to engage
with
with reasonable
you know republicans a lot of whom are
my friends and are my colleagues to say
look i know we can go and push
everything to extremes and fight and
debate and score points but like you
don't like some of this anymore
than i do like what's an actual
conversation from our different
perspectives assuming i don't have all
the answers that we can come up with
certain solutions that's going to take
care of people who are not doing as well
you know who are not doing as well who
are not keeping up with the economy
because that's not good for anybody
that's not a game that is iterable
across multiple games and generations if
more and more people are struggling more
and more that ain't good for anybody
even the people at the top so how do we
seek to kind of balance that out for
people who don't have a fair shot and
don't have
even from a conservative perspective you
could say well how do we stabilize the
hierarchy so the tendency for or the
multiple hierarchies for the tendency so
that the tendency for people to stack up
at the bottom doesn't become so extreme
that the entire system starts to shake
and and tremble which obviously isn't
good for anyone at all we're seeing a
lot of shaking and trembling i mean i
think a lot of people in the last
election did not feel heard or seen or
represented in the choices of candidates
and a lot of people are like i don't
care what it is it's not going to be
business as usual right so the solution
isn't in my estimation to denigrate
people who chose to vote for president
trump i think
the solution is to talk about the fact
that we need to do better if we want to
promote a if the democrats want to
promote a viable alternative we have to
do better with what our messaging is we
have to do better on messages that are
anti-corruption we have to make a better
argument yeah well the thing is you know
i was on bill marshall a while back and
a lot of the panelists on his show were
hello everyone
so the first question that came up oh
there's something I want to say first
first thank you for tuning in to this
Q&A it's always much appreciated it's a
pleasure to do these and they seem to be
quite popular it's been a while since I
did one but I've been on the road a lot
and away from my computer and so that's
the reason or the excuse take your pick
hopefully it's a reason I wanted to let
you know to those of you who don't know
I have worked on two programs online
that are hypothetically helpful to
people one is self authoring calm and
that helps you write about your past and
your present and your future to catch
you up that's the past authoring program
to identify your faults and virtues
that's the present authoring program and
to make a vision and a counter vision
for your future and to make an
implementable plan there writing
exercises I produced a 20% discount for
all you QA people today so if you use
the discount code August at self
authoring com then you can purchase the
full set of programs for 20% off and you
have a to vie we have a two-for-one
offer so you can share that with a
friend as well so and then understand
myself tom is a personality test site
that enables you to get a big 5 read out
of your personality with each of the big
five traits extraversion neuroticism
agreeableness conscientiousness and
openness broken down into their two
aspects so you can get a pretty
comprehensive view of your personality
and that code is also August and that's
in the description of the video in case
you forget so if you're inclined you can
use those codes and you can try out
those programs we know the future
authoring program for example if
University students do it especially the
ones that are struggling it produces
quite a market increase in their
propensity to stay at university and to
get better grades so the program seemed
very very effective so if you're trying
to straighten out your life then I would
recommend the self authoring program and
if you're trying to understand yourself
better or someone that you know then you
could try understand myself calm
so that's that the other announcement I
suppose is that I've done the two are
now about sixty five cities with Tammy
somebody asked how she manages this
she's exceptionally good at traveling
and very low in neuroticism thank God
for that because it's been a stressful
time with lots of opportunity obviously
and she likes to travel and so she's
very good at helping me manage this
we're gonna hit about 40 more cities 40
or 50 more cities between now and the
end of April next year which is when I'm
going to bring all this touring to a
close in September and early October
we're doing 20 cities on the eastern
seaboard of the United States and then
in October near the end of October about
15 cities in the UK and northern Europe
and then in February Australia and New
Zealand and then in April March and
April then the rest of Europe that's the
plan anyways and perhaps there'll be
some side trips during those times to
other places and so you can find out
about that at Jordan B Peterson com
forward slash events you're more than
welcome to come to the talks they've
been very good events in my estimation
I've really enjoyed them I can tell you
I enjoy doing those talks and I find
them a lot less stressful than talking
to journalists the crowds are there the
individuals in the crowds are there to
come and listen to a serious discussion
about how life might be improved and
they're very very positive events so
I've been very happy to do them the Sam
Harris videos I did for talks with Sam
Harris those are in preparation we hope
we'll have them out in August
everybody's trying to come to an
agreement about how they should be
released it's rather complicated affair
given how many people are involved but I
think we're close to figuring that out
there'll be ten hours of taped talks for
or sessions two and a half hours each I
think the talks were very very
productive we'll see the audience's seem
to react positively to them and they
were very well attended we had 8,500
people in Dublin so and about 6500 in
London so those were very large crowds
so that's very cool
mmm 12 rules for life has sold about 2
million copies now and for those of you
who are mathematically geek inclined
that's 57 miles of bookshelf if the
books are stacked you know as you would
put books on a bookshelf so that's a lot
of books and maps of meaning I released
the audio version of that June 12 2008
een and it didn't it hit the New York
Times bestseller list for audiobooks in
July and August
so that was rather comical given that 12
rules for life was never put on the New
York Times bestseller list so I thought
that was an ironic little touch of fate
and I'm quite pleased to see how the
audiobook is doing if you like 12 rules
for life and you're looking for
something that delves more deeply into
the same themes then you could try maps
of meaning and I think the audiobook
which I read is more accessible than the
written book people seem to be
responding to it that way so I'm pretty
happy about all the positive things that
are happening so okay how am i that's
the first question how am i well pretty
good actually my health seems to have
stabilized substantially I'm feeling
pretty sharp
I have periods of some negative mood
although they're short and sweet so to
speak but I'm seemed to be sharp
cognitively and I can concentrate for
long periods of time and get lots done
I've been able to do quite a bit of
writing in the last couple of months
partly blog posts partly also I had the
privilege of being asked to write the
introduction to the 50th anniversary
version single volume abridged version
of Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago and
I finished that about a week and a half
ago that took me about two months to
write about 3,500 words if I remember
correctly it was a daunting task to
write an introduction to a book as
tremendously influential and and
important and
and also of exceedingly high literary
quality so it was a daunting task to
write that introduction and I really
wanted to get it right and I hope I did
I spoke by email with Solzhenitsyn's
family and they seemed pleased with it
and so did the editor and I've had a
couple of editors including Greg Hurwitz
my novelist friend from LA who's an
absolutely vicious editor and extremely
good at it so they were happy with the
final cut so to speak so was I so I seem
to be sharp enough to do the work that's
necessary to do I've been working hard
on the online university I've got three
people hired they're all very smart
young guys and we're about a year ahead
of where I thought we'd be at this point
we hope to have a minimally Viable
Product sometime in the late fall I'm
funding that entirely at the moment
courtesy primarily of my patreon support
so thank you to all my patreon
supporters for that hopefully your
monies being put to good use
we'll probably crowdfund in November see
if we can set up enough capital for the
next three or four years I could raise
money privately there's lots of people
are interested in investing but I think
that I'm gonna try crowdfunding because
well because I'd like this to be a
public enterprise from the beginning
Danah have lots of people involved and
we're thinking of all sorts of ways of
getting people involved how am i other
than that
well nonplussed and still feeling rather
surreal about my life I would say my
family's in good shape my daughter who
is very ill is doing extremely well
so that's miraculous as far as I'm
concerned my son's getting married in
September that's Julian and I like his
fiancee thank God for that
and so we're looking forward to that I'm
going on a bit of a vacation during
August which is the first time I've had
off for about two years with the
exception of one week last year and I'm
going to a family reunion in Vancouver
Island and then to Saskatchewan to see
my family I'm gonna do two talks in
Saskatchewan while I'm there one in
Saskatoon and one in Regina and I have a
lot of family coming to the one in
Saskatoon so that and then a little
reunion
after that so that should be cool so
that's how I am and I'm thinking hard
about the next book I have a new book
contract about to be finalized I think
in the next week I'm hoping to release
the next book which will be twelve more
rules probably and beyond mere order is
the tentative subtitle I'm hoping that
I'll have it done by spring early early
spring perhaps January of 2020 if not
one year later but I'm going to try hard
to hit it so that I'm done by next
September I'm gonna write non-stop from
May to September and then I plan to do
biblical lectures from September through
December so the plan is to tour from
January through May essentially then to
write for four months then to lecture to
prepare the biblical lectures and so
forth for four months and so that should
be next year so that's an update
hopefully that's all useful information
I'm very pleased about all the support
it's quite remarkable all this interest
in these complicated matters and
complicated discussions and it's so nice
to see people concentrating on
psychological and philosophical issues
and leaving the idiot
politics as far behind as possible
because it's certainly uh what would you
call it a distraction and a dangerous
one at that so it's so funny talking to
the mainstream media types because
everything they talk about has to be
viewed through a political lens and
although I continue to insist I did BBC
hard talk which was aired today and that
was a classic example of an interviewer
being entirely scripted and trying to
push everything that's happening around
me I suppose
into a political narrative and it isn't
political as far as I'm concerned not
everything is political despite the
insistence of people who feel that the
personal is always political it's like
no there's philosophical domain a
theological domain and a psychological
domain those should be kept the hell
Shepard from politics all right what can
a two agreeable young woman do to be
more disagreeable and assertive if that
isn't how she is temper mentally
inclined oh that's a good question and I
would say first of all that's a very
common question that people who go into
psychotherapy ask I think the most
common problem that psychotherapists
deal with apart from anxiety and
depression is probably assertiveness
training so the first thing I would say
is you really need to figure out what
you want and I would recommend doing the
self authoring program the future
authoring program in particular because
if you want to stand up for yourself you
have to have your goals and your vision
well laid out and well defined and then
you have to have a strategy that that is
matched to those goals so that you can
so that you know what you want so that
you know when you're not getting it
otherwise you're left with a vague sense
of dissatisfaction and resentment and
that's very very difficult thing to
articulate and if you can't articulate
it then you can't negotiate if you know
what you want and you know why then you
can make a case for yourself
okay so let's assume now that you've
laid out a vision and a counter vision
which the future authoring program also
helps you do so you know what kind of
hell you want to avoid that you might
drift into if you were to agreeable for
the rest of your life that would be a
hell that consisted mostly of people
taking advantage of you all the time and
you feeling resentful and bitter about
it not something I would recommend see I
think that women are agreeable because
it helps them deal with infants but it's
not a great temperamental strategy for
dealing with complex organizations in in
the adult world so I think it's a price
that women pay for also being adapted to
have plenty of patience for very young
children and then you have to overcome
that to some degree to put yourself
forward properly in more complex
hierarchies of accomplishment so I would
say once you have your vision
established your vision for the future
and your counter vision so you're afraid
of what will happen if you don't stand
up for yourself then
need to consult your resentment fit
because if you're resentful about
something as far as I can tell there's
generally only two reasons one is you
should grow the hell up and quit whining
so you got to find out first if you're
just feeling sorry for yourself and you
can think that through make a pro and
con case and you can talk to somebody
that you care about about that I'm not
assuming that that's the reason but
that's one potential reason if you're
not merely feeling sorry for yourself
then you probably have something to say
and something that you need and you need
to figure out what that is and then you
have to develop a strategy to to put
that forward I've seen lots of people in
my personal life and in my private
practice not get what they want because
well a they don't specify it and B they
don't ask for it and if you're
negotiating save for a raise or for a
promotion and so forth you have to put
yourself forward you need to tell your
the person you're working for why you
should be treated with more
consideration or respect or have more
resources devoted to you or more
authority
what's shifted to you and you have to
make a case for that a compelling case
so that they have a reason to attend to
you and that's not good they're not
going to notice because most managerial
types are so overloaded with work that
they never notice when anything's going
right
they just notice the things that are
going wrong so you need to make a plan
you have to have a strategy that goes
along with that plan you have to have
articulated arguments for why certain a
certain form of treatment is appropriate
to you and then you have to have the
courage to put that forward and I guess
you have to remember that you owe
yourself as much as you owe other people
you have to take care of yourself like
you take care of other people and and
that's a moral duty and if you practice
that you can do it and a lot of that a
lot of that's also associated with
telling the truth
you know you don't have a better friend
than the truth even though it can be
very harsh in the short term and so if
you're unhappy at work because you're
being taken advantage of then you have
to strategize yourself out of that you
have to learn to negotiate and a lot of
that also means that you have to
overcome your hesitancy to engage in
conflict and you got to think about it
this way negotiation
and conflict are somewhat
indistinguishable and it's easy
moment-to-moment to avoid negotiation
conflict but you pay a terrible price
for it in the medium to long term it's
better to face the conflict forthrightly
in the present and make peace for the
medium to long term and there's there's
courage in that so that's the other
thing I would say is gird up your loins
and and and and allow yourself to act
courageously courageously and truthfully
truth is your best bet if you're too
agreeable so you know you also might
find that you have a pretty good
critical intelligence but that you think
it's mean and so that you keep it hidden
some of the smartest women I knew who
were very very agreeable had
unbelievably good instincts with regards
to figuring out what other people's
motives were but they were ashamed of
their suspicions and really what that
meant was they ended up being ashamed of
their critical intelligence because they
were so agreeable so it may be that the
darker part of you the shadow part of
you knows things that you could know if
you were willing to admit that they were
true and so you have to give some
credence to your to your darker element
I would say
how do you know if you're communicating
with the actual person or a mask I
sometimes wonder if I can ever really
know someone well you can't ever
thoroughly know someone because people
are too complicated you can't even
really know yourself how do you know if
you're communicating with the actual
person or a mask well if you're
communicating with an actual person then
you're actually having a conversation
you know when the conversation
transforms as a consequence of
participating in it and it tends to be
engaging and meaningful if what's
happening is an exchange of ideological
platitudes or just platitudes themselves
for that matter then you're probably
engaging with the mask so if the
conversation is compelling and
meaningful and it transforms as it as it
progresses and and you can see that give
and take that dance like give and take
then you're communicating with an actual
person the other thing I would say is
that when you're communicating with an
actual person rather than a mask the
person that you're communicating with
tends to be quite interesting you know
if people talk about what they know
which means you're really communicating
with them if they talk about their own
personal experience instead of wandering
off into the domain of cliches and
ideological platitudes then people tend
to be extraordinarily interesting and so
that's another good tactic and a good
hint that you're that you're where you
should be when you're conversing one of
the rules I had when I was seeing
clients actively was that if the
conversation I was having wasn't
interesting and if my attention started
to wander then we weren't discussing
issues that were sufficiently vital
because if we were discussing vital
issues then the conversation basically
flew by and so I think that's a good
that's a good marker
what new wisdom have you acquired in the
past few months that you want to share
with us well I've got one I think I
thought thought up a bunch of new things
but this one I'm really happy with I
figured out why you know some of you
know that there's a mythological trope
that I discussed fairly frequently about
rescuing your father from the belly of
the Dragon or the belly of the beast
it's a motif that you see when you see
it in the Lion King you see it when
Simba is being initiated by the baboon
I don't remember fitnah feekiee I think
his name is
after nella humiliates him because he's
still a pathetic adolescent he follows
the baboon I think it's a mandrill
actually down underground essentially
through a long tunnel there's a lot of
kind of scary music in the background
and he ends up contemplating himself in
a dark pool and then his father appears
in the sky and so that's one example of
the reconstruction of the mythology of
encountering your father in the abyss
you look into the abyss and you see your
father and then in the Pinocchio story
Pinocchio of course when he's trying to
you know when I give the cash paid
Rosetta Thornton came from Tacoma I'm
gonna switch to English since we have
since Jordan hasn't had dr. Peterson
hasn't had time to learn enough
Icelandic yet so thank you all for
coming this has been amazing first when
I got the idea to book him to Iceland I
had no idea that others had been
watching him on YouTube so as it turns
out a lot of people have been and of
course he's exploded since then in in
popularity so we've sold out this venue
which is almost three times larger than
the first one we had and we've sold it
out two times so that's pretty good
so he's gonna come up here and he's
gonna speak for one hour and 15 minutes
just about then he's gonna take a four
minute break and go offstage before the
Q&A you can submit questions to the Q&A
and we're gonna use a similar system
that he's been using on his trips in
America with Dave Rubin so I'm gonna
serve as a surrogate Dave Rubin here or
slightly less gay Dave Rubin so and I'll
bring I'll ask him the questions and you
will put them online on a site called
slide oh so it's spelled SLI dot do
slide though I'll say it in Icelandic as
well as at a punter Dao Slater so it is
customary to introduce the speaker as if
you know me better than him but and and
usually when someone is being introduced
people tell things about him things that
are true about that speaker now of
course you've all come here because you
know who that guy is but so and I'm
gonna do a different thing because I
think it has tells you more deeply
something about what is going on with
this guy so I'm going to read you a few
things that are wrong about him so these
are actual things that have been said
about him in media mostly in hit pieces
and you know character assassination
attempts and there has been one each day
just about for a long time and some of
them in big big media so he's a he's a
far-right guy Hitler he wants to force
young women in Toomer
he's the stupid people's smart person
that's actually not that bad about him
but so and that's the reason they say
that they want you to become afraid to
admit that you like him or go to his
talks well-groomed all right
at least he's well-groomed a messiah
comes surrogate dad for gormless dimwits
so that's another one directed at you I
I'm one of you as well because I don't
know what gormless means so but I
suspect that having a gourmet is
preferable so just stay away from this
guy
Tim wits Jordan Peterson has nothing of
value to say he's a patriarchal
pseudoscientist he encourages young men
to see themselves as victims
he's a mash-up of he has he delivers a
mash-up of Cosmo tips and my first book
of myths he's the professor of piffle he
seems like a terrible therapist he's a
bad political and social thinker an
angry white guy and the line between
Peterson's authoritarianism and Richard
Spencer's Paley on Nazism is a blurry
one he's a Jewish shill and if you're
gonna be a shield you you you want to be
a Jew issue and he's a fascist miss mist
assist and this is just a small sample
of what has been going on and it's all
wrong perhaps you know depending on how
you define she'll-she'll can Sheila's
okay but it's all wrong and that tells
you something a new one every day too
miss inform people about that man and
you can demonstrate it it's demonstrably
false everything and there are some
people that see him as a risk to their
agenda and their world we
HBU for some reason but he's a he's a
reasonable balanced moderate truthful
man and I've never seen such a campaign
against any thinker ever in the world
not even someone that is untruthful or
as despicable as they make him sound
like so this tells you something this is
the reason I was reading this this tells
you something about the importance of
his message and I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna theorize about exactly what that
is because there are lots of theories
about exactly what it is in what he's
saying that is threatening and and to
whom it is threatening and and I think
actually many of them are correct but
let's just listen to him and let's hear
what he has to say
and we'll figure out why it's
threatening later so please give a warm
welcome to dr. Jordan B Peterson
[Applause]
well that's an introduction that I'm
going to have to live up to so I was mmm
thinking the other day about numbers you
know there are mathematicians who think
that there isn't anything more real than
numbers and that's an interesting
proposition I mean it's obviously the
case that once you invent or discover
numbers that that confers on you a
tremendous power and who knows the
limits of that power and the claim that
numbers are more real than anything else
is predicated in part on the fact that
when you discover them or invent them
and start to utilize them that your
ability to operate in the world expands
immensely and and so that's one of the
ways of judging whether or not something
is real is whether or not when you use
it that facilitates your means of
operating in the world interestingly
numbers are abstractions and so that
raises another question which is well
what's more real the thing that's being
abstracted from or the abstractions and
again that's not obvious and maybe the
question of more real isn't germane
maybe it's a question of equal reality
but it's not obvious that abstractions
aren't real and you can make a damn
strong case that they're more real than
anything else and so then you might ask
yourself well then what are the most
real abstractions and so that's what I'm
going to start to talk about tonight I'm
going to talk about it in relationship
to as many rules as I can
lay out simultaneously I'll go through
the rules first
so rule 1 is stand up straight with your
shoulders back and rule 2 is treat
yourself like you're someone responsible
for helping on number 3 which is very
tightly associated with number 2 they're
sort of variations on a theme is make
friends with those people who want the
best for you and by the way these last
two rules aren't injunctions designed to
make your life easier they're actually
injunctions designed to make your life
more difficult Kierkegaard said at one
point that his role in life given that
everything was proceeding to become
easier and easier in all possible ways
that there would come a time when people
would cry out for difficulty and so
that's partly how he envisioned his role
in the world interestingly enough as a
universal benefactor of mankind who
would strive to do nothing other than to
make life more difficult for everyone
right and so rule two and three are like
that because treat yourself as if you're
someone responsible for helping isn't
the same as be nice to yourself it's not
that and to associate with people who
want the best for you means that they
get to demand the best from you and
that's also not an easy thing rule 4 is
compare yourself to who you were
yesterday and not to who someone else is
today and that's an injunction about
envy right it's easy you need people who
you need things that are above you
because you need to do something
worthwhile with your life you need
something to aim at but one of the
consequences of that is that you can
become envious of people that you
believe have attained more in a deserve
adore undeserved manner and that can
make you bitter and so it's much better
to compare yourself to yourself and to
use yourself as the target for
improvement in comparison rule 5 is
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them and the rule of
thumb there is if you dislike them then
other people will and it's a bad idea
to allow your children to act in a way
that makes other children dislike them
or adults dislike them given that
they're going to have to deal with
children and they're going to have to
deal with adults so your primary
responsibility as a parent is to help
your child learn how to behave so that
the social world opens up its arms to
them and welcomes them at every level
and you've done your job if you can
manage that and it's not a simple thing
to do
rule six is put your house in perfect
order before you criticize the world and
that's not take no action for others
until you have your act together that
isn't what the rule means it means that
bind your ambition with humility and
work on what's right in front of you
that you will suffer for if you get
wrong before you engage in the
large-scale transformation of other
people rule seven is do what is
meaningful and not what is expedient and
I would say in some sense in some sense
that's the core ethos of the book not
exactly because rule eight which is tell
the truth or at least don't lie is a
necessary conjunction to that or a
necessary additional element because I
don't think that you can pursue what is
meaningful without telling the truth and
the reason for that is if you don't tell
the truth or let's say if you lie which
is an easier way to think about it you
corrupt the mechanisms the instinctual
mechanisms that that that manifest
themselves as meaning and then you can't
trust them and that's a very bad idea
so the fundamental reason to not lie is
because you corrupt your own perceptions
if you lie and when you corrupt your own
perceptions then you can't rely on
yourself and if you can't rely on
yourself then well good luck to you
because what are you going to rely on in
the absence of your own judgment here
you've got nothing if you if you lose
that rule rule eight is as I said tell
the truth they're doing
or at least don't lie rule 9 assume that
the person that you're listening to
knows something you don't
and that's not so much a mark of respect
for the person although it is that it's
a mark of recognition of your own
unbearable ignorance you know one of the
things you have to do in life is decide
whether you're more you have to make
friends more with let me see let me just
let me rephrase that properly you have
to decide what's more important what you
know or what you don't know first of all
there's a lot of what you don't know and
so if you make friends with that if you
decide that's important then well that's
a good thing because you're going to be
surrounded by what you don't know your
entire life and so if you're
appreciative of that then that's going
to make things go better for you but but
the other element of that is well why
should you be appreciative of what you
don't know and answer to that is well
you shouldn't if your life is absolutely
perfect in every way you have exactly
what you need and want you've put
everything in order around you then what
you know is sufficient but if you
believe that things could still be put
right around you in your own personal
life and with regard to the effect that
you have on other people then obviously
what you don't yet know is more
important than what you do know and you
should be paying attention to find out
what you don't know at every possible
moment and if you're fortunate when you
have a conversation with someone and
you're actually interested in what they
say then even if they're not very good
at communicating even if they're awkward
or even if they display a certain amount
of enmity towards you there's always the
possibility that they might tell you
something you don't know in which case
you can walk away from the conversation
less ignorant and corrupt than you were
when you started the conversation and if
your life isn't everything that you
would like it to be then being slightly
less ignorant and corrupt is probably a
good thing and so rule 10 is be precise
in your speech and that's that's an
observation I would say that that's a
variant
of a New Testament injunction which is
or maybe a description of the nature of
the world which is knock and the door
will open and ask and you will receive
which is a very strange theory let's say
but which I would say is far more in
accordance with what we know about the
psychology of perception let's say then
you might imagine because it is the case
that you don't get what you don't aim at
you might get what you do aim at and
your aim might get better as you aim as
well which is something to consider if
you specify the nature of the actually
if you specify the nature of the being
that you want to bring into being then
you radically increase the probability
that that's what will occur and of
course you all know that because you
regard yourself at least to some degree
as active creative agents right your
fundamental attitude towards yourself at
least in the manner that you act towards
yourself is that you wake up in the
morning and you have a landscape of
possibilities that lay themselves open
to you and you make choices between
those possibilities and determine in
consequence how the world is going to
manifest itself so you confront a field
of potential that's a good way of
thinking about it and through your
choices you determine which elements of
that potential are going to concretize
them selves into the real world and you
are very unhappy with yourself if you
don't do that properly and you're very
unhappy with other people if they don't
do that properly and you're very unhappy
with other people if they don't treat
you like that's what you're like because
part of what you demand from people
let's say in terms of sheer civility is
that they act towards you is if you're
the locus of voluntary choice in a world
of potential and you upbraid each other
for that as well if you have children
and parents your parents will say to you
if you're fortunate you're not living up
to your potential which is actually a
compliment in a sense even though it's
also
a judgment and the compliment is I know
perfectly well that you could be more
than you are and you'll hang your head
if you have any sense and you'll think
like you think in relationship to your
own conscience that yes I have a lot of
potential that I'm not fully realizing
and that actually constitutes a
transgression against the good and I
don't I don't think I've ever met anyone
who doesn't believe that if you if you
have a reasonable conversation with them
it just seems self-evident
I mean maybe now and then you meet
someone who's narcissistically
self-satisfied but then they're
narcissistic and that's not good that as
a medium to long term strategy that's a
catastrophe that ends in disaster you
know it's a short term it protects
people but long term it's it's not good
in the least and of course other people
don't appreciate it as well rule 11 is
don't bother children when they're
skateboarding and that's actually a
discussion of courage of encouragement
more specifically because I've I've been
trying to understand for example what
role parents play in the lives of their
children and I would say this is a role
that that that is of fundamental
importance as well as attempting to
guide your children so that they act in
a socially desirable manner so that the
world opens itself up to them you also
want to encourage them which is not the
same as sheltering them it's not the
same at all and to encourage someone is
to say something like or to act out
something like look kid as you the
world's already difficult because the
world isn't easy for children any more
than it's easy for adults that the
difficulties are they're not the same
they're child size difficulties but
they're still difficulties the world is
a very hard place and it's a bitter
place in many ways and it's not only a
hard and bitter place it's also touched
with betrayal and malevolence and that's
the fundamental bottom line but there's
something in you that is capable of
taking that full-on and transcending it
and that's encouragement you say well as
difficult as things are
you're up to the challenge and to
interfere with children when they're
skateboarding for example when they're
doing let's say in advisably dangerous
things which kids of course do if
they're skateboarding to interfere with
that is to interfere with the child's
willingness to voluntarily expose
themselves to the risks that they need
to expose themselves to in order to
develop the sort of competence that
allows them to thrive in a world they
cannot be sheltered from and so to
interfere with children when they're
taking necessary risks is not love or
empathy but cowardice on the part of
parents and it's deeply damaging to
children and I can tell you as a
clinical psychologist I've never had a
client come to my office in all the
hundreds in in in all the hundreds of
encounters I've had with people in my
office I've never had a client say my
parents made me too independent right
that hasn't happened once right now my
parents made me too dependent or I
conspired with my parents to perpetuate
my dependence that happened all the time
so there's a rule of thumb which I think
is a good one which I believe is often
applied in nursing homes by people who
work in nursing homes which is of course
a very difficult job and the rule is do
not do anything for anyone they can do
for themselves and the reason for that
is that it's a form of theft right you
don't first of all if you if you do
something for someone and it facilitates
their movement forward then they moved
forward because you helped them which is
something I was very careful about as a
therapist I don't want to give my
clients advice first it might fail in
which case they are going to pay for my
advice and second if it succeeds then I
get to be the successful one and I don't
want to steal the success from my
clients that's a bad idea I want to help
them figure out what it is that they
should aim at and then help plot out a
strat
for attaining that and but I want to
ensure that it's their destiny not
something I'm imposing and of course the
imposition of that sort of thing is the
hallmark of a bad I would say
therapeutic relationship but also a bad
relationship period right so one of the
things you want to do with your
partner's your spouse you say your
husband or wife and also with your
children is to listen to them so that
you can figure out what their problems
are and figure out with them because
they're gonna figure that out by
communicating and then perhaps aid them
in the development of a strategy but you
have to ensure very carefully that
you're not imposing your own structure
in a manner that's going to steal from
them what's rightfully theirs so well so
rule 11 is an injunction to courage as
the fundamental because you could say
well what's the antidote to the
catastrophe of life and one answer might
be safety it's like well you know look
everyone sensible enough to know that a
certain amount of provision for safety
is worthwhile you should probably wear
your seatbelts when you're driving
around in your car because why take
foolhardy risks but given that there is
no security in life in the final
analysis then encouragement is a much
Jordan thank you so much for giving us some time again. I'm in Sydney. You're in Kentucky. Yes, I am
I'm there as part of my 12 rules for life tour
Which is I think expanding to hit about maybe 80 cities something like that
Goodness. Well, that was very keen to have a follow-up chat after the conversation that you and I had together when you're in Sydney
And in particular to frame that for people who might be listening this conversation at that time
I had not seen you in front of a live audience
The evening of that conversation after that conversation. I had that opportunity at Chatswood one of the
seven talks that you gave in Australia put together by Sam McClelland from
From Melbourne every one of them are sellout
I have to say I don't know whether the biggest issue for me is what I learnt by watching that all the questions that arise
out of it
But the first thing I'd say is I was concerned at the time
That you and I had had a very long conversation that it might be too long for people when we put it on the website
And you said no John? It won't be young people especially are hungry for content. Put it all up there
They will listen to it. You're absolutely right young people looking for content
It's it is absolutely amazing. Yes. Well, I mean some of the big YouTube stars like Joe Rogan
They're they're constantly putting out three-hour podcasts and people listen to all of them long-haul truckers
listen to them and guys driving forklifts and and young people and and couples and
Like there's a massive hunger for real for ready for high-quality educational material
It shouldn't be underestimated
and I mean one of the things that seems to be the case with these people on YouTube that are making a
splash let's say in this alternate media format is that
they fully they have full respect for the or the intelligence of their audience and they don't pull any punches in terms of content or
length
Yeah, well, that's where they come back to that
but but as I say, you know
It's just extraordinary I pull up in a fuel station out in a country town near where I live
And somebody gets out of the car next to me father of about
35 I suppose he looks at me and he just says straight up before even says hello
he said I've just been listening to you and Jordan Peterson having a conversation and
Everywhere I go now. That's what people say. So thank you for the opportunity. You made the comment there though there for every youtube
Visit they'd be up to 11 podcasts. I think that's what you said
well
the podcast market is absolutely exploding and you're actually sitting seeing this start to affect book publishing because
audio books have become extraordinarily popular and people are discovering that they can use their found time when they're commuting or
Exercising or walking or doing dishes whatever to engage themselves in high quality. Um
well high quality educational material books and podcasts and so that's a real revolution it and it really is a
revolution
So these are the people young people too, you know instead of listening to music
Which is really something because musics being a predominant cultural force for a very long time
So it's an it's an amazing technological revolution and I really appreciate it or a conversation by the way
I think we had a great conversation
I enjoyed it immensely
And it seems to me that this is a sort of modern version and and I think this is terrific if I'm understanding it correctly
Or the old idea where people who have perhaps had another great formal education had access to good quality
Literature and so forth put together by whether it was penguin or what. Was it every man's book
So every everyday books whatever they were called even Reader's Digest
To make that education that learning the classics and so forth available widely
And now this is a modern version of it perhaps and I think what's happening with the mainstream mean?
that they underestimate the
Moral quality of their viewers, they underestimate their intelligence. They underestimate their persistence and
they've also become quite manipulative in their use of editing and and message
Massaging spin really and the other thing that's really good about these sorts of conversations
Is that what you see is what you get their bare bones
They're they're not high-tech while they are and their highest tech in some sense, but not on the production end or the editing end
So people can trust them and they're genuine conversations. They're not designed to craft the message or anything like that
They're not manipulative and and that's a big deal
YouTube YouTube
Particularly doesn't respond well to manipulation as far as I can tell. Well, I enjoyed that conversation enormously. I've been stunned by the response
It's gone very very widely as you know
Both on your site and on mine
But to come back to that day
later that day you gave one of the talks of the set one of the seven that you gave in Australia Chatswood and
I was very kindly
allowed to compare it for you and
One thing that 19 years in public life taught me is to have a bit of a look at your audience and summarize them
It was a pretty amazing experience. The first thing that happened was that you walked on before you said a word
You've got a standing ovation though that that's something unheard of in this country, but they did
90 minutes talk they gave you another standing ovation
you left came for a few minutes came back on took 30 minutes of questions and
Again, they responded in the same way. Let me just say a couple of things about that audience. I was
firstly I've got to say pretty heavily impacted as I looked out there and
Recognized that there was an enormous hunger to hear what you had to say
Even though your message was perhaps best described as tough. Love you weren't
Ginger in them up with a soft story. You were really pushing you were really challenging them
The second thing that struck me is that I've said many times since I reckon
50% of the people in that room that night were young Australian men under the age of probably 35
The third thing that struck me was that that was a was a cross section
I would say many of them were University students, but all university graduates
But many many were not and the fourth thing that just goes back to something. You said a moment ago
They knew what you were saying and you're a clinical psychologist and a highly educated
Person to suggest that they didn't understand would be very patronizing they got what you're on about. Oh, definitely
There's there's no doubt about that
I mean there those lectures aren't interesting unless you understand them and there's just no doubt that that's happening
you know, I think one of the most that
psychologists have made
Especially the more popular ones over the last three or four decades is to try to convince people that they're okay the way they are
It's like the self-esteem movement, you know, you should love yourself the way they you are
You should feel good about yourself the way you are and that's actually not a very optimistic
Message for people because people are generally sensible enough to not be particularly satisfied with the way that they are
They want to be who they could be
they want to have something noble to aim at and and and
So I I make that case very strong that you're you should more
but aligned and on board with who you can be then with who you are and
that who you can be isn't a person who has endless rights or
Or or as the member of a privileged or under privileged group
It should be who you should be should be an individual who's willing to take on full
responsibility for the for the catastrophe of existence and for the malevolence that's part of it and
See, I think people are responding to that
first of all because everyone who has any sense knows that life is a tragic business and that everyone is
Susceptible to betrayal and malevolence on their own part and and as a consequence of the actions of others, that's our existential
Predicament and I think people also know in a very deep sense that the antidote to that isn't security or safety
And it's not envy or bitterness. It's the willingness to
try to work to make the world a better place to start with yourself to take responsibility for yourself and then to take
responsibility for your family and then to take
responsibility for your community and everyone knows that the people they admire are exactly the people that do that and
We also all know that that's what gets you out of bed on a rough morning
It's that you've got something important and vital to do and it's not an easy thing
It isn't necessarily even something that makes you happy
It's something that's meaningful and necessary to fight back against the tragedy and the malevolence of the world and people know that
Deeply it's deeply rooted inside their their souls. I would say and a call to that is
very meaningful for people including me, you know, I include myself and my audience like I'm
Lecturing to them precisely. I'm having a conversation with them about how we can step the world
right
And we are setting it right things are getting better very rapidly around the world and we can really push that forward in the decades
To come if we if we made a conscious effort and so I think this is a very exciting message for people
One of the things that I'd say about Australians is as I got the world's best bulldust detectors. They
recognise authentic authenticity
Very quickly, and if you're not authentic, they won't listen
So I think in part they are responding if I can pay you a compliment by the fact that you weren't talking about you
You were talking about us
You were addressing
Where we are all together as human beings and in a way it was as though you were saying
To get to the good news
You've actually got to go through what might be called the valley of death. You've got to face yourself
You've got to be realistic about yourself in the world that you live in
And I saw those put young people
It was almost as though they were saying we're sick to death of a therapy cup a culture that offers us sort of
To relieve to everyone there's a there's a dictum
that Carl Jung derived from the great alchemists in the circle in this infinite or and it means
What you most want will be found where you least want to look?
What you most need will be found where you least want to look and that people know that you know
everyone knows they are tired of
naive
Optimism let's say and not optimism because optimism doesn't have to be naive and they know perfectly
well that the way to set themselves right is to take careful stock of themselves and to pay very
careful attention to the errors that they know they're making and to and to grow up and to mature and to and to
adopt the responsibilities of a forthright citizen and I think people are sick to death of too much discussion of rights and and
too much discussion of self-esteem and all that all that all
That discussion that goes along with what everyone owes you it's like
it's just not helpful to people because it isn't your rights that give you meaning in life and
You need a meaning to set against the tragedy and every knows that the way that you find that meaning. It's by adopting responsibility, obviously
For yourself, you gotta take care of yourself your family
I mean you want to be a good person to your parents. You want to be a good person to your siblings and your children
Clearly and you have to bear some responsibility for your community
And if you're really firing on all cylinders, you do all those things at the same time
You know and and I do believe and I tell people I do believe that the world is the tragic and malevolent place in many
many ways but that the way forward through that is is to
Do everything you can to put yourself on the side of what's good and to aim high and that that's where you get the dignity
That enables you to bear life without becoming corrupt and everyone knows this is true
Who's gonna argue with that?
having found yourself and having any of your like and being realistic about yourself and
Recognizing we were talking about this last time the dividing line between good and evil. It's not between black and white or whatever
captor and jailer
Or man and woman
It's somewhere across every human heart having recognized that you can then go on and help build a stronger fairer more just more humane
society rather than
what seems to be the way people approach it at the moment so
That somehow rather your society can fix your problems. Yes. Well, that's it
I mean for young people in particular, it's kits are actually a very depressing message for young people to hear that
It's time for them to get involved in political activism because any young person who has any sense knows perfectly
Well, if they're especially if they're 18, they're so 19 years old is they don't know a damn thing, you know
They haven't started a business. They haven't started a family. They don't have a permanent relationship. They're not educated
They don't have any experience and for someone to come and say well you're in a position to change the world is
nothing, but a way of
Disenchanting them with adult wisdom. It's like you're not ready to change the world
You've got a lot to learn but you can learn it and in learning it you'll become much more powerful and much more
Charismatic and much more articulate and much more wise and sensible and that's the way forward
to being much more than you are and
young people when you're 18 and you have 60 years of life ahead of you what you want to hear above all else is that
There's way more of you yet to come
Because what else has anything with those 60 years
so
It's it's a message. It's a harsh message because it says well
You're not everything you could be but it's a deeply optimistic message because it's because the idea is that you could be way more
Than you are
incomparably more than you are and I do believe that and what's so fun about this is that people keep telling me that people
Keep telling me that it's true. You know, I have people
Endless people I got one kid come up to me the other day. It was so fun
He said a year and a half ago. I had just got out of jail and I was homeless
And he said I started listening to your lectures and I just I got married this year
I have a child and I just bought my apartment. It's like wow man. Good work
You know you did that in a year and a half
And you know, I was in LA the other about a month ago and you know this I was in a rough part of LA
Downtown LA near the Apollo Theater, and I'd given a talk there my wife and I were walking down the street
This car pick pulled up and then his kid walked out. He was about 19 or so
Good-looking Hispanic kid ran over and asked me if I was dr. Peters and I said yes, and he was all excited
He said he'd been watching my videos for about a year and a half and they really helped him straighten out his life
He was just smiling away
He said wait a minute
wait a minute and he ran back to his car and he came back out with his dad and
His dad was standing there
you know and they had their arms around each other and
They were just grinning like mad and the kid said look
I've really put my relationship together with my father and we're really on board with this together
And they were just like so happy you couldn't believe it and that just happens over and over like it happens. I would say
four or five times a day in restaurants or in airports or while you've been
experiencing that to some degree in Australia you said and it's it's so good and
The mainstream media that's been covering what I've been doing, you know
they just missed this completely because everything it seems like everything that constitutes news in our society has to be
Political and group oriented this isn't political and it's not group oriented what I'm trying to do as a good clinical
Psychologist and perhaps a good educator and I mean good striving to be good in the moral sense is to help people
develop as individuals and they are and
it's really working and it's it's a thrill to be on this tour because that's all I hear and
no one talks to me about the political issues or very very rarely and it's all because I also think that the battle against
Collectivists and let's say the battle against identity politics isn't to be had in the political realm
maybe that's a secondary issue what the way that you that you
fight for the sovereignty of the individual is by getting your act together and and right locally right where you are and
starting to take advantage of everything that you have in front of you and
And then you do, you know harm our way. All you do is make yourself less bad. Who what's the harm?
Not that's a good thing to some extent
I think the battle here is almost one of statism or collectivism versus individual liberty who's going to shape who?
So you've got the whole that sort of pushed from the left identity politics victimhood policies
Approaches and what have you we owe these people? What have you?
So the state has control and shapes individuals and helps them forward on the other hand
You have the different view that says no the state should be shaped by the people that make up the state, you know
Australia is a sum total of individuals who are Australian and they ought to be
Shaping the public square not having the public square of your local the public sector shaping them
The whole argument is about what what what's the primary unit of analysis? That's everything
What's the primary unit of analysis and in the West the primary unit of the analysis has been the logos and that's something like Devine?
individual consciousness and it's on that ground that we developed our idea of individual sovereignty and citizenship and
you know, we don't talk about a citizen is someone who adopts the
Responsibilities of an ethical being that's a citizen. We don't talk about that even in schools
Tell people that look the meaning in your life is going to be found
It's gonna be proportionate to the degree that you take responsibility for
Positively shaping your experience and the experience of the people around you and this isn't like be good in some in some week
Be inoffensive and harmless sense. It's not that at all
It's like get your spine straight get your aggression
integrated pick a heavy goal like a heavy high goal something you can barely tolerate lifting and
struggle along with it and that's where you'll find yourself respect and and people know that it's it's fun to watch the
Working-class guys respond to this too, you know because they know this most of those guys work like mad, you know
and they know that there's nobility in that and and there is and so
It's it's well
I'm people also say well that they're happy to come to my lectures or even read the book because
I'm helping them find words to express things that they already knew to be true and
those things that they know to be true are the
Bedrock axioms of our culture and one of the things we got right in the West was the idea of the sovereign
Responsible individual not the person with rights and certainly not the person with rights granted to them by the state
That's not part of the English common law tradition. You're the locus of Rights
But but only in some sense because you're the locus of ultimate responsibility. I
Guess part of what I've been trying to tell people is that there's no difference between meaning and responsibility
They're the same thing. Yeah. No, I understand what you're saying. Now as I looked at that audience. I thought to myself
We're doing a lot of talking about the first world war in this country
60 thousand Australians died out of a very small population in that horrendous event and we celebrate their bravery those young
Anzacs we call them who went off to
Gallipoli and then to the Western Front and we're involved in some of the critical battles of the First World War
every year
Australians turn out in extraordinary numbers and more and more young Australians turn out to if you like pay tribute to their
Courage and as I looked out across that audience, I thought there's a lot of people here that I'd willingly
Or I would choose to be with in the trenches
They are essentially people who want to be to use the word. You did just a moment ago
Noble to the best of their ability
But they live in a culture somehow that says no that's all nonsense
that's not where you ought to go and
It seemed to me that they're deeply resenting and deeply keen to reject that approach. Look here's here's what it is
so there's this idea that
That's pushed very hard in the Universities by the postmodern neo-marxist types and before anybody objects
I know perfectly. Well that technically speaking post-modernism and neo-marxist neo Marxism aren't commensurate
But it doesn't stop people from from joining them together
Ideologically, but in any case the idea is that the West is fundamentally an oppressive patriarchy
which it isn't it's hardly an oppressive society because every society is partly oppressive and flawed, but
fundamentally, the West is not an oppressive patriarchy and but if you by that line then the next thing that comes along is that
Anything you do that?
contributes to that
Patriarchy is also oppressive and tyrannical and so that's extraordinarily
demoralizing for people who are trying to make their way in the world because they're trying to
Hoist their responsibilities up on their shoulders and become competent
Contributing adults and they're criticized to death for being oppressive tyrants
And so there's a conflation of competence with tyranny and you can't do anything to anyone that's more demoralizing that you know than that
Nietzsche said if you want to punish someone punish
Them for their virtues and so they're tired of that. It's so demoralizing
You know, like it appeals to the part of each man. Let's say and each woman for that matter who wants to avoid responsibility
because you can rationalize it and say well I'm not gonna take responsibility because that just makes me a
tyrant and an agent of the
Patriarchy, but that's a-- that sort of thing leads people down at toolpath and I've seen that my my friends and in my clinical practice
So instead we say look like our culture has problems every culture does and it needs everyone
Everyone has to be awake so that we don't slip at every level of our social being into some like a blind
authoritarianism, but the way that that happens is by waking up and taking responsibility once again for yourself and your family and
Your community and that that and that's Noble which is a word you never hear
It's like a human being has to be a noble creature to withstand the tragedy of existence without becoming corrupt
and so and that calls to the best in people and
Jordan just we should wrap up on that part of it that evening though, but there was one other thing
When we came to question time, there were four mics in the room. They lined up 20 deeper deets
We got to seven. I think the seventh question was from a lady who asked a very intelligent question about what?
Parents bring to their children and and in particular
were there things that mothers brought to their children that women do best and other things that
fathers bring to their children that are best you gave a very rousing answer the issue of fathering and as I say,
There are a lot of men there
I gather that your audiences of the demographics have broadened out now, but that was a very young man centric
group
And you hammered the importance as I heard it all fathering
Well, the the empirical literature on this is absolutely clear
I mean, you know, we have this idea that's being pushed forward that all families are equal. It's like
There's a there's a grain of truth in that in that people who are struggling
Mightily to raise their children properly are worthy of respect whether there are single or in couples
but the empirical literature is absolutely clear that that stable intact for the
families with fathers there produce children who do way better on almost every possible measure and even more than that that
in communities where
fathers tend to be at home
What you know as part of the stable family the communities themselves do better even those kids that don't have fathers at home
So the role of the father is unbelievably important and the question is what particular rold as a father plan
I just had a good conversation with Warren Farrell about that and part of no part of my research should indicated that
men are particularly useful in initiating
Rough-and-tumble play and play with their children in general and Farrell extended that by noting that men could use the opportunity
to play as a reward for delaying gratification
among their children
That's a really big deal because one of the things you have to do to help people mature is to teach them to delay gratification
and to sustain attention and it looks like
Men that the pleasure that children get in playing with their fathers
Rough and tumble play but other forms of play as well
Of primary reward that can be used to help children learn to make the proper sacrifices and regulate their impulses over the long term
so
So, you know and I think fathers now of course mothers can do this too, but I think fathers
Are because mothers are generally charged with the fundamental care of infants. There's a tension between that and
encouraging children to step forward out into the world as as
Courageous beings and you know mothers are very very attached to their infants and their infants are very fragile
it's often hard for them to make the transition from
primary
security provider and caregiver to
forthright encourage
er of adventure and that's certainly something that fathers can do is
It's better to construe life as an adventure rather than as an enterprise that's there to make you feel secure or happy
It's a great adventure and a dangerous one at that because everyone's life is at stake in this adventure
You know, we're unbelievably tough creatures if we if we put ourselves out fully
Okay, now you said something very interesting there and very important in my view you talked about empirical evidence in the relation to the importance
of fathering
empirical evidence
reason
evidence-based decision-making
calm
thoughtful deliberation rather than emotion in other words the difference between thinking and
Feeling seems to me to be incredibly important
We should follow the facts to where they take us, but we're confronted by it seems to be you mentioned
and you said they're not related but we tie them together there, you know sort of cultural Marxism and
post-modernism it seems to me the cultural Marxist will deliberately distort the truth be
because of their agendas or hide the truth because of their agendas the post modernists are fallen into this trap of
If you like moral relativity, so what's good for you is true for you
And what's good for me is true for me. Even if they're really painting black as white and white as black
Isn't that a problem?
It's worse than that in some sense because it's not even what's true for you
It's true for you. And what's true for me is true for me
It's what it's true for your group is only good for your group
And what's true for my group is only good for my group
And so that sets us off in in group conflict in a tribal sort of way. You know the the
the real radical types who are swallowed up by this ideology believe that science itself is nothing but a Eurocentric
Patriarchal construct. I mean they dispense completely with the fact that
Scientific discovery has given us this incredible
Technological power that's lifted the entire world out of abject poverty in a period of about a hundred and fifty years
For that for them for some reason that doesn't constitute evidence
and so when you bring up evidence
There's hand waving because the people who dispute this sort of thing rarely know the details of the literature
They just write it off and say well that whole scientific enterprise that's just part of the way that Eurocentric males
dominate and destroyed the planet
It's all power games for these people. There's no there's no reality at the bottom of it outside of the power game
And so that's a well
That that to me that that that's a that's a viewpoint that leads inevitably to tribal conflict
That's all that's all that's what it does know. You might be able to help me
I think was George Orwell who made a reference to an idea being so utterly stupid that only a member of the intelligentsia could believe
It no sensible person in the street would accept it for a moment
There was a bit of there that night I would have thought you actually made a comment
quite a I thought a very astute remark that about something that sound absolutely obvious and then you father finished it by saying you
Would have thought someone in a university somewhere might have noticed now if I'd been an academic at any university in Australia
I would have realized that I needed to wake up to myself because the audience lifted the roof the place with their applause they are
highly skeptical about what is happening now in our educational institutions
There is no other way to read that audience of a thousand decent Australians
They are very skeptical about the value for money. We're getting now out of our tertiary education sector
Yeah, well, it's the whole education sector to I would say increasingly from kindergarten all the way through University
Yeah
I think that I'm in very in creasing lis embarrassed to be a member of the Academy
Because of that like I was reading this book today by a by a Norwegian called progress. It's a really good book
I would highly recommend it very straightforward and all it is is a compendium of
empirical facts about how much better the world has been getting for the last
Hundred and fifty years in just every possible way three hundred thousand people a week are being hooked to the electrical power
Grid, right we've reduced we've almost eliminated
Starvation throughout the world except for political reasons and starvation was a big problem in places like Sweden and Italy
Less than a hundred years ago
Island
People our people have access to fresh water and the fastest growing economies in the world are in sub-saharan Africa
We're just making progress progress on every possible front and everything
that people learn in the education system seems to be associated with the idea that
human beings are a cancerous growth on the
planet that we're going to hell in a handbasket and that we're gonna burn ourselves out in the next 50 years and die and
It'll be our fault too. And you know, it's just not the case. It's simply not the case
I mean we have problems in front of us, but there's a deep anti human ethos that permeates that and you know
Maybe it's still a hangover from our pessimism from the Cold War
You know because everyone was truly terrified for about five decades that we were gonna put everything to the torch, you know
and maybe we still haven't really recovered from that and it's not surprising because it was brutal, but
Reading this book on progress just made me think again. How badly were
Educated because people just don't know how much things are getting better and why?
Free markets are a huge part of it private property is a huge part of it
And that's all associated with the idea of the sovereign individual. And so this really works
I mean, it's true that Europe got rich first, but that's only being a hundred and most at most one hundred and fifty years
It's not even that long. It's really since about 1895 and Europe first, but man China there's no one starving in China
There's no one starving in India
You know Southeast Asia
has enough food and and
Sub-saharan Africa is growing like mad
And then that we have these we have these we have our education system that trumpets that you know
we live in a corrupt patriarchy that we should all identify with our tribal groups and that the right way of
Interviewing history is victimizer group against victim group. It's like it's no wonder people are skeptical about it
It's a profoundly anti Western ethos. And the thing is about the West is we got the sovereign individual, right?
It's right and it's the responsibility part. That's right. Not the rights part. I mean the rights traits are necessary. But but only
The rights are there so that you couldn't express your responsibility. That's what that's the whole point
Okay, well let's come to this issue of our own almost loathing now of our own beliefs and values
here in Australia now, we're having an extraordinary debate going on a very wealthy and
Likable, I knew him well philanthropists called Paul Ramsey who was very active in the health center
Left a very large amount of money to be made available to set up
An academy for the study of Western civilization and he wanted it to be done in one of our major
universities now one of our most acclaimed universities
Entered into deep negotiations then the education union got involved and said no. No, this is going to be terrible. It'll be all about European
Ideas of European supremacy so that same university has centers for Islamic studies for Indigenous Studies
They are not particularly autonomous in the sense that the university or sorry. They're not particularly controlled
It seems by the university
They do pretty much their own thing, but I know you can't have a center for the study of Western civilization
It will fill us up with all sorts of racist ideas
Supremacist ideas. This is really worrying if we can't understand our own past
In fact as a very wise Asian said here the other day
If you wonder them that want to understand Asian cultures understand your your own first
Well, it means to me it's just first of all, you know in some sense
I'm less worried about what's happening with the universities than I was because I think that
They're going to destroy themselves
completely if they continue the way they are and that all that's going to happen is that people will take the genuine value in the
Wisdom of the past and presented in alternative forms, they'll just steal it out from underneath the universities
I would say to the philanthropist if the universities don't want the money then they should set up an institute on their own
That might very well be a good course
You can go directly to the people now, you know, like for now a social example for me if I want a lecture now
I can lecture on anything I want
Whenever I want with no bureaucratic restrictions
And I have an audience of people who are only listening because they want to listen
There that's where the university is
The University is where there's an audience to people who are only listening because they want to be educated
That is the University. The buildings are irrelevant
Let's let's build on that from I'm it because watching this debate unfold in Australia
We're listening your academic saying ah, no. No, we've got to preserve our academic integrity
And we've we're here to protect
policies of diversity and inclusiveness
And all of those sorts of things and somebody tartly pointed out
Actually, we thought they were there to teach our young people how to think for themselves
Primarily that isn't what they're there for because that's predicated on the idea that there are sovereign
Individuals and that they can actually think for themselves as individuals
The whole idea here is that you're not an individual. You're the member of a group that's it, and they're serious about this
This isn't a trivial objection. It's a fundamental objection, but I would also say look there's a New Testament
Statement don't cast pearls before swine and you know that usually has to do with words
Right don't waste words of wisdom on those who will not hear but you could also just look at it
literally if you have pearls and you're trying to give them to someone
and they won't take them then go find someone else to give the pearls to if you're trying to give money to a
University to do something great and they won't take it. It's obvious that they don't want to do anything great
So don't give them the money. It's the wrong people
Ok, well, let's taste this had a little bit more
wisdom, you've mentioned the difference between
if you like knowledge and
accumulated cleverness
and what have you and
wisdom
Surely there's a difference because to go back again to Chatswood
I would say a good chunk of the people there were not university educated
But they were smart and I would say they I'd say more they were wise
They were striving for wisdom. And that's where wisdom is wisdom is in the striving for wisdom and wisdom is building out
Wisdom isn't a collection of facts wisdom is knowledge of how to conduct yourself in the world
So it's a it's an action. It's an existential issue. It's an it's its truth as revealed in action. That's wisdom
wisdom also understands consequences
Well, it's it's sophisticated in its understanding of consequences because you think well
What are the consequences and the answer is well?
There's the consequences for you now and for you next week and next month and five years from now
So the consequences are you and future you so that's an iterated game
but the consequences are also for your family now and in the future transfer to your community now and in the future and
wisdom is the ability to consider all of those consequences as part of your as
part of what guides your vision and your and your and your operations in the world and that's character and
Then nobility of character is to take all of those things into account
simultaneously as I watch the debate
I thought to some extent one of the problems you've got here is see as Lewis might have pointed out is pride
Pride getting in the way of people having sufficient humility to recognize
That the nonsense they peddling is simply unconvincing in terms of what you might call the pub test
What would pass the pub test?
Out there where people have common sense and can see when people are being real and when they're not being real
Well, it's easy to dispense with that
You just develop sufficient contempt for the common person and then you don't have to worry about what they think
You know and then and that's and that's when you confuse being smart with being wise and they're not the same thing
I don't think there's any relationship between them
In fact, I mean intelligence is a great gift
But it can go terribly wrong and it can certainly turn into a kind of intellectual arrogance
that's for sure that blinds you to to your own ignorance and humility is the antidote to that and the
humility the element of humility there that's necessary is to understand that what you don't know is more important than what you know, and
So if you're an ideologue you you dispense with all doubt because you already know everything I was
gonna say I was reminded of that friend I
Chatswood as as you probably gathered it had the big impact on man. It was a powerful reminder to me that
For me, it seems very important to recognize it. There's a sense in which the more you learn the more you realizes
You don't know very much and there's a lot more to learn
Yeah, well
You know being with an audience can help with it out, too
Because if you're if you're talking to an audience, you can check to see if your message is being received, you know
And you might say well these people just can't understand what I have to say
It's like well, yeah
They probably can if you if you formulated it carefully
And you actually talk to them individual to individual which is what I try to do in my lectures
Like I'm not talking to the mob. I'm not talking to the group. I never talked to the group when I'm lecturing
I always pick people in the audience and speak right to them and they reflect the audit, you know, they reflect the entire group
But they only reflect it because the group is made up of individuals like them
So let's just go back to something. You said earlier that ask of me is very interesting
And that is that young people don't want to be involved in political activism
So I'm talking today with Nina paling who's a brilliant animator and
She's making a variety of short films which I guess are going to be joined together into a longer film
about that that feature Old Testament themes and she's the creator of the animated musical feature Sita sings the blues'
her adventures in our broken copyright system
led her to join questioned copyright or guest artist in residence in
2008 where she produced a series of animated shorts above intellectual freedom called minute memes
More recently she made this land is mine, which is absolutely brilliant
shocking
devastating
and also aesthetically impressive film
About Israel Palestine and Canaan the Levant and that's intended for her new feature film
Seder masochism and you can find a lot of Nina's
pieces of pieces of that film online and I would highly recommend
Watching them. We'll
Cut a couple of them into this interview so that you can see what she's up to
So I guess there's two things that we could really talk about
I think the most important one obviously is your work, but I guess the second one is your
Concern for intellectual freedom and your your feeling with regards to two copyrights
Copying is not that
Stealing a thing leaves one less left copying. It makes one thing more. That's what copies for
Copying is not set
Goodbye, copied yours who have it blue one for me and one for you. That's what copies can do
To take
I just copy it. There's one for each of us. We're making more up a thing
That is what we call copying sharing ideas with everyone. That's why copying is
But let's let's start let's start by talking about you first
Tell tell my listeners and tell me who you are and where you come from and and what you're about
You want to know about my identity I guess yeah, trust me to identify
Myself, I don't trust myself there. Well, okay. You're the best source we have today
actually, I'm
Not sure about that
I mean, I think most of us would agree that I'm an artist and
Currently an animator. I guess I've been doing animation since 1998
Before that I was a newspaper cartoonist. I still do comics from time to time not very often. I
Mean, I guess the thing is I've just been I just came back from a bike ride
And I've just been thinking about identity like all the time and how incredibly unreliable it is and how I don't respect it
including ways that I identify myself
Well, I guess that's part of being an artist, you know, because people who are artistic or high in trade openness
And that gives them a very fluid identity us
I mean, it's an advantage because people who are high in openness can think laterally and they're always coming coming up with creative ideas
But it does tend to make their identity rather pluralistic and and and sometimes unstable and that can also be a problem
Well, I guess I guess it's not even that it's fluid
It's not like oh, I don't identify this way one day in this way another day. It's just I don't really
Currently have much respect for the idea of identity at all
And I could you know, say all kinds of things about myself but you know, does that actually do me any good?
Well, let me ask you a couple of basic questions. Where do you live?
Good. I live in Urbana, Illinois. That's verifiable. All right, and where were you born?
I was born in Urbana, Illinois were so you've been there your whole life, essentially? No I left
I was twenty I moved to Santa Cruz California. I wanted to be a hippie I failed
But then, you know, I was already out on my own so I briefly moved to Austin Texas didn't work out
I moved to San Francisco in 1991. I lived there for 11 years in 2002. I followed my then-boyfriend
Actually, we were legally married. So my then-husband to India
which is the subject one of the subjects of Sita sings the blues' and
Then later in 2002
I moved to Brooklyn New York and lived in various places in New York for a total of about ten years
I moved back to her banner in 2012 right after my father died and
Here I am and so why did you move back to her van and after all that adventuring
First I was done with New York, even though I really loved New York, especially
You know my first five years there. I was fantastic. I kind of
achieved
more than I even expected I would be able to and
started to just get I don't know the love affair with New York kind of wore off and
I wanted a little more peace and quiet and I wanted cooler summers and I didn't want a small garbage everywhere all the time
I had an opportunity to move back here because my dad died. My mom was threatening to sell the house
I joined the Occupy movement
occupy mom's house
Trying to keep her from something the house, but so you actually have a specific demand
She sold the house anyway, but I'm living in her new house. Oh
yeah, I was I was dating somebody that lived here and
That has ended but I actually really like it. It's much more relaxed and
Inexpensive, I get lots of fresh air. I take lots of bike rides and I don't really care about
the
I'm just less stressed out
Yeah, good any less? Yes
Well, you have plenty of adventures obviously
so I guess and it must take a fair bit of I would think time of quiet and and
Some isolation in order to work on your animation
Yeah, well, I achieved that quite an isolation in New York actually by just living in New York and in a by myself
I would rather live in New York than visit New York because when you live there you can actually control
Your environment somewhat and you can shut everything out. Whereas when you're visiting usually have to be out all the time being overstimulated, right?
Yes, well, it's definitely an over stimulating place
Yeah, when did you start doing your animation? I?
Started animating as an adult in 1998 before that
I had done some animation when I was 13 years old using a borrowed super 8 camera and
I just completely stopped because I was in central Illinois and there was no
support for
Doing animation. There was no way I could have advanced beyond the neighbors super 8 camera
But then in 1998, I was burning out of my daily comic strip and
Wanted to do something and borrowed somebody else's super 8 camera and in 1998, it actually was easier
To advance, especially in San Francisco where a lot of people were doing independent film
And yeah, I just stick up where I left off. I did, you know plasticine clay
stuff on super 8 and
shared that film with a band called Nick Phelps and the sprocket ensemble that did live music to animation and
That was really fun. I was being gratified by audience feedback
and so I made another film on 16 millimeter and then my next film was drawing and scratching on 35 millimeter and then
My next film after that was drawing and scratching on
IMAX film which is 70 millimeter really big frames and then I got into flash
Macromedia flash and I've been digital ever since and
Are you using Macromedia flash now?
What's your primary technology a lot of those clips for sadomasochism or animated in Macromedia Flash?
Adobe bought flash and crippled it and ruined it in the opinion of many Flash animators
So I'm still using Macromedia flash from 1990, you know
2007 it's that one my copy of Flash's from iron Macromedia flash 8, it only runs on older computers actually
I think it might be 2006 or 2005 so I have this old
Mac here
running OS 10 point 6 because it won't run on any more recent machines and
You know, it's like impossible to integrate with a
modern video editing system, so I have a new Mac as well and
The newer parts those sadomasochism. I'm using a program called Moho Pro
12 which is
Kept up with runs on modern computers
Yeah, it's funny how sometimes software Peaks in terms of complexity and usability and then goes downhill
You know, I think we're seeing that not just with software but with computers altogether like personal computers, I think peaked
around 2007 maybe 2010 and they've been getting worse ever since like any sort of upgrade to operating systems just means
More surveillance and less user freedom at this point
Yes, as well as a steep learning curve
Yeah
Yeah, anyway, I don't know I don't know if I can keep animating digitally
Because you know like the software that I'm using now Moho I just found out that the person that created it and was an integral
part of its team this whole time just left the company so
You know, mohos fate is unclear and I'm like if I have to learn a whole other piece of software again
I just don't know if I can take this anymore
I mean, I'm so fluent with flash it took me years to become fluent at all. Whoa-ho
well, that's another thing is that I know it takes a long time to become an expert user of a complex software program and then
when it shifts the ground shifts from underneath you it's rather disheartening because all of that expertise is
Essentially disappears and I guess it's part of what we're experiencing as our technology advances
Fast enough so that our lifespans are too long really to keep up. You know, we get we get
outdated and
Superannuated on about a five-year rotation and the dust get exhausting. Yeah. Well, maybe I'll just die early and won't have to worry about
But then you won't film finish your film and that seems like a bad idea
Well, I'm gonna finish this film. I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel for sadomasochism good for you
So let me ask you some about that. So now you made this land is mine. When was that that
Was 2012 I think it was that's the first scene that I made
This love is mine
God gave this line to me
This ray
a nation line
To me
Reveals inflamed
Then I see where children can run free
This one and whoa
I will
Just a mile when you are my son
I know I can like these
Oh just uh
With the house
To make this land
So it's gonna be the last scene in the film
But it's the first one that I made I see and what what possessed you to make that?
so I knew I wanted to make a movie about Passover because I was raised observing Passover, although not much else and
So I was doing research I had never seen the movie Exodus you know that movie
Yeah, I'd never seen it. So I watched it as part of my research and I learned that the theme music
Had lyrics written to it by Pat Boone and that it was a really popular song in the 60s
Tons of artists did it I had never even heard it before
So I heard it and I just thought it was ridiculous, right this land is mine. God gave this land to me
I mean any everyone would say that right? Everybody every group feels that way about the land that they're on every single one
so the absurdity of it was just a parent in the song and
You know
There wasn't even really a process of of coming up with a concept for it
It was just that was what the song evoked for me
It was just showing how every single person or not every single person that every single
tribe
Has that attitude towards their land and so saying that this land is yours and God gave this land to me
gives you no authority at all because
That's every I mean, that's just what it is to be a tribe living on land
So what should what sort of reaction did you garner from? This land is mine
This land is mine is the most popular thing I have ever made. It's been viewed on various channels more than 10 million times
And
You know many people like it in terms of criticism. The criticism seems equally divided between
People that say that I'm a Zionist and people that say I'm an anti Zionist
So it's either a really anti Zionist film or it's a really Zionist film
I see so you can just add that criticism together in sum to zero and ignore it
Yeah, well, I'm really flattered by it. Right because of people that passionately, you know
Polar opposite sides are
Saying that then I feel like I've really done something right? Well, you've definitely done something, right?
I mean, I think that was the first film of yours that I saw and then I've watched many of them
I think every one I could get my hands on since then and
It struck me in a variety of ways. I mean the first thing that's let's say strange about your
Animation is that it's this?
At first of all you have great taste in music
The best
I don't
How's that how's that working out for you? Well, okay in the case of this land is mine
It's pretty clear-cut fair use because the Sun the film is parody
like I said, right, you know it it's literally a parody of those lyrics and you
Know that's various
Okay
I actually think most of my uses are fair use their transformative but a
lot of uses are not as clear-cut as
Parity, so that's actually a really interesting issue
With the film and how is this film going to be released?
And how is it going to be shown?
because there is no no way I am going to ask for permission to use this music particularly music that
Entered my head as a child
Which I did not consent to and I had no control over it or so
Nobody has any control over what goes into your head right like you go out in the world and music is playing it goes into
your head
And yet once it's there
that part of your head that it occupies belongs to a corporation and
I'm just done asking corporations for permission to
Use what's in my head which they put there. Mm-hmm. Okay, so you basically solve the problem by saying to hell with it
I'm gonna do this
I'm gonna do this no matter what and you're gonna iron out whatever difficulties there are with that as you move along
That's what it looks like. It's an illegal film. I mean in the case of Sita sings the blues' I
Made Sita sings the blues' when I was I was certainly questioning copyright
But I didn't really see it as a completely bankrupt institution
so
when that film was done, I
Cleared all the rights which was an incredibly difficult process and required hiring
Intermediaries because the rights holders don't talk to normal people. So if you do make a film and you don't have
Permission to use the music in it. You can't simply ask for permission
They won't talk to you. So you have to pay lawyers and intermediaries
Just for them to even listen to you to tell you how much money they're demanding which is inevitably an absurd amount that you can't
Afford but I ended up spending a mere seventy thousand dollars
To make Sita sings the blues' legal to show for free and legal to share for free
If I you know wanted some other model, it would have been more than that, right
seventy thousand dollars
To be able to give it away
But I'm not doing that with a new film the new film
I'm making an illegal film all of my music choices have to do not with their licenses but with
The content and meaning and resonance of the songs
Most songs have a kind of cultural resonance that is related to the point in time
they were
circulating
For example, this land is mine, you know refers directly to this period of the 60s
Yeah, it has a cultural resonance because of that which a new song if I like commissioned a new song
Sort of like that. It wouldn't have the same meaning at all. No, definitely not songs like that. They pick up
It's really interesting to watch what happens to a song across time because it picks up
It's embedded into context in that context grows and develops and transforms
This dassault a song is really a mutable entity. You know it transforms tremendously as it moves across time
Yeah, and that and that meaning comes from the audience it doesn't come from
Even the person that wrote it let alone the copyright holder right the value of it
Comes from us. Okay. So back to this land is mine
So when I watched that it produced a lot of mixed feelings. I mean the first was that
it was it's very black ly humorous and
You know you have this stirring
propagandistic
Anthem, like music in the background. It's it's sort of overblown
The singer, you know, he he he amplifies the emotional resonance of it. And then you have this just non-stop
carnage in the background to this to this stirring music and then
but what's really strange about it as far as I was concerned is that it's eerily beautiful and
Not something that's it seems to be a perverse and remarkable element of all of your films is that they deal with extremely harsh
Realities
metaphysical and and
Genuine, but you have this amazing capacity to generate these
complex beautiful images and to set them in a you know
and in an equally beautiful relationship to the music and so I mean I
Didn't know what and still don't know what to make of the film because you don't often see
What you might describe is stunningly beautiful satire stunningly beautiful artistic satire. I
Don't know Mad Magazine was pretty stunningly beautiful
Back back it had like the best artists working for it
Yeah, that's true. That's true. But your your there's an element to what you're doing
Especially with the juxtaposition of the music that seems to elevate it in my opinion to something like the level of high art
What high what slow well thank you, I thank you for the compliment. I can't really respond any with anything other than thanking you so
Your aesthetic sense and the style that you developed
Do you do you have sources for that? Do you have influences that helped you helped you?
Develop that particular style. I mean, I know it's a foolish question to ask to artists where they give their ideas
But I'm I'm wondering how it is that you came up with the concepts that you're working with
well
graphically
Some of the style is determined by the software that I use
so this land is mine and all the song scenes and sadomasochism are flash and
Flash the way I use it
It's what we call a cutout style where I'll draw shapes and I'll move them in relation to each other, but the shapes themselves
Don't bend or anything. They're just
cutout is an animation technique where people would literally cut out shapes from paper and
Move them around under a camera
So that's part of the style
With this land is mine in particular
I was looking at ancient Assyrian heart and ancient Egyptian art some of that is reflected
There's like a little border of flowers
Which comes from a Syrian art?
Yeah, those are the main things
Cutout style and the Syrian stuff and you know you you made this land is mine
did you have the
Sadomasochism film in mind or did that emerge afterwards? No
I knew I knew I wanted to make this film about Passover and that's why I watched Exodus and that's how
Sadomasochism. I mean that's how this land is mine came to be
So I I just knew I wanted to do a film about Passover
I didn't know what it was gonna be because I had never read the Old Testament before and
Reading Exodus was of course an eye-opener
And the film I don't I didn't imagine what the film was gonna be
like when I started it other than the
Topic I would work around but the way the film is actually shaping up is a surprise to me
So we should probably walk everyone who's listening through the film itself. So you've created a variety of
What appear at least to be at the moment to be animated shorts that detail out different episodes in in the biblical narrative surrounding?
essentially surrounding Moses there's more to it than that, but certainly surrounding Moses and so yeah does the film
Does the film essentially concentrate
Solely on Exodus are there other elements of Old Testament stories that are you that you're including?
It's really just Exodus but also, you know Leviticus and Deuteronomy
and numbers all
have bits of Exodus
Right, right. So it's basically the story of Moses. It's a story of Moses, right? It's the story of the Exodus and then the
establishment of the
You know the tabernacle and the priesthood and the religion, right?
That's sort of the I mean, it's regarded as the birth of the Jewish people, right?
Right. And so now you said that when you were growing up you observed Passover, but not much else
yeah, so but you're
It's not unreasonable. I think to observe that there appears to be something like a deep religious sensibility in your in your work
I mean you seem to be treating the stories with a tremendous amount of respect. And so
What what do you what do you think's welling up from inside of you to do that?
well, I'm glad you recognized the risk the respect any respect for this was like I
Approached these stories with an open mind and an open heart and was expecting to find some wisdom in them
When I began this project I
Thought I'm going to explore the religion of my father. My father came from a religious Jewish family
But he wasn't really religious
when I was growing up, although he had
He he wanted us to observe Passover
I guess as part of our he want us to have some Jewish identity. He wanted us to be in touch with our heritage as
Jews
But it was a bit muddled
Like we we were forbidden from
Observing any Christian holidays, there was no Christmas in our house. Whereas a lot of secular Jews do observe Christmas
There was like a really half-assed Hanukkah and there were no other high. Holy days, and my dad was an atheist. So
After
spending years
reading
as many different versions of
Exodus and
Commentary on it and things relating to it and trying to understand it and trying to find some way to connect to it
What happened was I realized that I had found the religion of my father and that was a theism
So I I became sort of a born-again a theist
Reading this stuff. My my neutrality towards the religion changed to a kind of
abhorrence
towards it
Which is which is not to take away from
Its importance, you know, it's a cultural foundation right? Like I live in Western culture and
these texts are stories that everybody knows to some extent and
You know, they're very important and I respect them for that reason that they're like a cultural touchstone for everyone, but I did not
emerge from
exodus
Was you know, I had like less connection to God than I had ever had in my life
I actually had like a spiritual crisis like
you know, it was really hard for me to have any kind of sense of a Power greater than myself after reading this and
And working with it
And that's also being the case as a consequence of doing the animation
Yeah, because you know animation is like a meditation when you made an old story
It's just a long drawn-out meditation on it and sometimes insights can pop up while you're working on it
I mean, it's just like in your face every day. I mean I have a
there are insights that I have one of them a lot of them are comparative religion insights because the previous film was Sita sings the
blues'
so in this film I included Aran a lot and Sita sings the blues' I left out, Lakshmana who is
roms brother and
I decided not to do that here
Even though with a lot of these stories when they're turned into films
Aran is made into this minor character and a lot of things that Aaron does in movies. They show Moses doing them like casting the
Staff down and it turns into a snake that was that was Aaron's business
But anyway, I showed Aaron in this and I thought about how both stories have these brothers
Have like the big important memorable brother and the other brother who?
Actually carries out quite a bit of the work
That's a similarity and of course both stories also have a
Really gruesome scene after what? We normally think of as the end like with Exodus especially growing up with Passover
I'd always thought a story was, you know, the Hebrews were slaves and then
You know
They were free. Right like the end is they're free. They crossed the Red Sea to get away from the Egyptians hooray
And of course what actually happens in the story after that is there's this Hebrew on Hebrew slaughter
Because of the golden calf and a whole bunch of those Hebrews who were liberated they die
Yeah, well liberation turns out to be a very complicated thing
Yeah, you know, it's funny when I when I watched the Americans go into Iraq
know with her initial optimism and
Then the absolute disintegration of the Iraqi state
I thought well and then the failure to produce something, you know stable as a consequence
I thought well a little bit of Exodus would have gone a long ways
It was quite funny in some sense because in a black way
because of course the people who
invaded Iraq who planned the invasion or
Were at least nominally
Committed Christians and I thought well
they took out the tyrant like
Just as the Hebrews escaped from the tyrant
let's say but no Exodus lays it out pretty clearly as you escaped from tyranny into the desert and
That's no joke and it's 40 years, right? It's three generations before the desert disappears and in the desert there's
nothing, but inter inter tribal warfare and
mmm D and the conflict
around new emerging values which is of course the conflict between the
idolization of the golden calf and and
the necessity for the new rules that Moses imposes
It's no picnic and then made a lot of the Old Testament is like that even I'd be doing a series of lectures
I don't know if you know about this, but I've done 12 lectures on the old
I've actually become quite popular. I think the first one has about three quarters of a million views and
I've been attempting to treat the stories with as much respect as I can because like you I believe that they're their
foundational stories and
um, I would say that my respect for them has actually grown and
my
relationship with whatever you might regard as transcendent has been improved by that but
Be that as it may
Even in the story of Abraham, you know, he's called forward by God to go out into the world
He's an old man by that time right? He's 75 years old
He should have left his family his father's house and and his
kinsmen long before but God calls him on an adventure to go out into the land of the stranger and to leave his home and
You know, it just goes terribly badly for Abraham
I mean the first thing he encounters is a
Famine and then he moves into the tyranny of Egypt and then you know the Pharaoh takes his wife. So it's
One of the things that you can say about the Old Testament is that it's not naively optimistic in any sense of the word
But the Passover story
kind of is as its as people observe it like when you read the Passover story, it's just this nice part and
That like I say that other part that later chapter, we never discussed that it Passover
Anyway, and you know, the closest we'll come is 40 years in the desert
Like I did know that the Jews wandered the desert for 40 years. I didn't know they killed each other
Right and and this is something similar to the Ramayana
Because the Ramayana is frequently told without the last chapter without the ohter. Akanda, which is the difficult part, right?
Which I think is the richest and most interesting part of the whole story
So I focused on it and see if this thing's the blues
but but yeah, I mean, I think that what
The most valuable parts of these stories are the most
Difficult and they're the parts that are left out and most people don't know about you have to actually read them. Yeah
well, they are the most useful parts because life is full of difficulty and
so with you over if you
Leap over the parts of the stories that are pessimistic and dark then
You missed part of what the stories are trying to teach you about how to prepare for catastrophe
I mean it says obviously in the Exodus story
the fact that the Hebrews escaped from tyranny is presented as a good thing and even as something that God wills
but it's by no means a straightforward passage from
Tyranny to the promised land. I mean and Moses doesn't make it to the promised land right? He he dies before he gets there
Yeah, and even the promised land
Is not nearly as much fun as it spin
As we have been led to believe
Right, like they're they're constantly the Jews are constantly falling short right there constantly angering God
They're never getting their shit together. You know God just keeps
You know God's ambivalence towards them
persists ya
Think that's very realistic because there are very few times in life where even if you're not
suffering from the tyranny of other people or or
Yourself that it's very difficult to walk the proper straight and narrow path and to keep everything organized and to keep things going properly
I mean, there's no there's never any shortage of severe challenges
Yeah, so enough, even if you're chosen by God, let's say there's no shortage of severe challenges
You also see that in all the other stories in the Old Testament. I mean, um
Even when God is walking with someone say like Abraham or Noah for that matter
It's pretty still pretty much non-stop carnage. Chubby. Noah. Noah has his family together and
His generations are perfect. Right and he walks with God, so he's properly oriented in the world, but he still has to
build the ark and and get through the damn storm and and
And and be humiliated by his children at the end and it's it's it's a very rough business
so in the in one of your
Shorts, and I don't know the name of it. It's the one
Where thee I guess it's the one that specifically deals with the Passover where the Egyptian firstborns are all killed. Yeah. Yeah
What's that one called death of the firstborn Egyptians? Terrible we go an appropriate title. I
Can't help but Harbor the suspicion that you had a fair bit of sympathy for the Egyptians
Yeah, well, you know
They had some great art
Yes. Yeah, and you do a wonderful job by the way of incorporating that into that film
It's that one is spectacularly beautiful. Well, thank you and they had religion and
I
Mean so doing visual research for this project
There's not a lot of really great ancient Hebrew art
possibly or probably because
It's against the religion to make art. You're not supposed to make graven images. So
in terms of coming up with a style that evoked this I had to
Yeah, I was looking at art from the region and I was like, oh, it's all Egyptian and Assyrian
those are the ones those are the people there that made the
Art fantastic art it breaks my heart that
That's supposed to be evil
Right that that that art which actually moves me when I look at it is what we're supposed to smash, right?
Like that's that's what we're commanded to destroy because it's it's all full of idols
I am NOT down with that. So I
You know just naturally was gonna sympathize with the Egyptians. This is all here. Well, there's a Roger there's a real
tension there that I think is worth thinking about you know, because I
Understand why from a psychological perspective. I understand why there was an injunction against making images and you know,
You see the same thing happened out right now with Isis say in the Middle East where they're destroying world
For example all the great Buddhist art and all those ancient
Monuments which of course is an absolute and utter catastrophe
but
Legend I mean they're following it better than we do
Right, right
well
So so the conundrum seems to me to be that
And this has also played out in the story of Exodus with the golden calf
But you know
the the idea of God is supposed to be something at least in principle that you can't really grip that you can't really
Encapsulate, you know that you can't dogmatically represent because then it turns into an idol and an idol and ideology are very much the same
Thing and I think ideology is terribly dangerous, you know
Because you take something
Concrete like an axiom of some sort you you you that's very concrete and then you make that your highest value and it narrows you
and then restricts you and also makes you incredibly dangerous and so
The idea that there's a great danger in idolization I think is uh is a very very powerful notion
And so I think that's what informed the restrictions against making
graven images of God because you end up confusing the image with the
Transcendent reality right and then you think that you understand it and you have it in your hands
but it certainly does seem to have some pretty
dramatically negative consequences when the consequence of that is the absence of
visual art in any profound sense and also this injunction to destroy
No
the idols of well of the foreigner or or of the hair of the person whose heretic older or and
I'm not exactly sure. How do
What would you say?
I'm not exactly sure what the mediating path is between those two extremes and I think a real artist and
I definitely think that you
belong in that category
as someone who isn't using
idols as representation because you're using your artistic talent to push beyond what you already know like it's a form of
exploration rather than a form of
Canonization or or categorization, right?
it's it's uh, it's uh,
it's a journey into the unknown and an extension of the way that people think and I think of that as a
Way of uniting with the transcendent rather than trying to encapsulate it in some sort of formulate box
But there is a great danger of that kind of formula formulas ation. So
Anyways, there is that danger and that's that is of course the commonest
Interpretation of the injunction against idols, but I think that
I mean, it's it's never born out right? It's like any injunction against that kind of
Idolatry has never resulted in the absence of idolatry ever
And we can clearly do it with abstract concepts. We can clearly do it you me clearly don't need images to do this
So you could argue that you could do it with words just as effectively, you know anything
many of you will no doubt remember
lindsey shepherd
she was the teaching assistant in the
department of communications at wilford
laurier university who was subjected to
a three-member panel of inquiry after
she showed a video taken from canadian
public television of me debating the
compelled speech legislation introduced
in federal bill c-16
she showed my discussion with nicholas
matt who held the opposite position
here is part of the discussion in
question
what do we do
the three-member panel included
professors nathan rambuchana her
supervisor herbert pimlott in charge of
the masters program and adria joel
manager of gendered violence and sexual
assault prevention
shepard taped the meeting and released
it publicly producing what i think was
the biggest scandal that ever enveloped
a canadian university and certainly the
only one in living memory that became
news internationally
the thing is can you shield people from
those ideas
am i supposed to comfort them and
make sure that they are insulated away
from this like is that what the point of
this is
because to me that is so
against what a university is about so
against it i was not taking sides i was
presenting both arguments
so the thing is about this is
if you're presenting something like this
it uh
you have to think about the kind of
teaching climate that you're creating
and
this is actually these arguments are
counter to the canadian um human rights
code uh ever since i know that you've
talked about
c16 ever since this past it is
discriminatory to
be targeting someone um due to their
gender identity or gender expression so
bringing something like that up in class
not critically and i understand that
you're trying to like it was critical
i i introduced it critically
how so like like i said i it was in the
spirit of debate okay and the spirit of
the debate
is slightly different than being like
okay this is this is like a problematic
idea that we want to make when we want
to unpack but that's taking sides
yes like it's taking sides for me to be
like oh look at this guy like everything
that comes out of his mouth is bs but
we're gonna watch anyway okay
so i understand the position that you're
coming from in your positionality but
the reality is
that it has created a toxic climate for
some of the students it you know it's
how many it's great
like how many okay one yeah it may speak
i have no i have no concept of of like
how many people complain like what their
complaint was you haven't shown me
the complaint yes i i understand that
this is upsetting but there's also
confidential at the end confidentiality
matters the number of people's
confidential yes
although the university apologized
publicly for its treatment of shepherd
as did rambu khanna it is not clear at
all that the powers that be so to speak
learned their lesson and the
mistreatment of shepard not only
continued but arguably intensified
so she decided to press her case legally
and presented a statement of claim
against the three and wilford laurier
early in the second week of june
it lists in painful detail the many ways
that this situation was mishandled
during and after the initial inquisition
i also discussed the situation with
howard levitt shepard's lawyer i decided
that wilford laurier had learned very
little from its public embarrassment and
that shepard's claims were valid
justifiable and necessary including her
statement that her future lack of
employability in academia was improbable
to say the least
i've been on hiring committees and i can
tell you that even then the slightest
whiff of scandal is enough to disqualify
a candidate
in consequence not only did i decide to
read and post the entirety of shepard's
claims which i will do in a few minutes
i also decided to launch a claim of my
own against the same defendants i
thought that two lawsuits might make the
point better than one i'll read some of
my claim to after shepherds and you can
all make up your own minds about the
suitability of this course of action
ontario superior court of justice

defendants statement of claim
to the defendant
a legal proceeding has been commenced
against you by the plaintiff the claim
made against you is set out in the
following pages
if you fail to defend this proceeding
judgment may be given against you in
your absence and without further notice
to you
2. nathan rambu khanna
and to adria jewell
and to herbert pimlott
and to wilford laurier university
claim
the plaintiff claims the following
against the defendants individually and
cumulatively the following
five hundred thousand for the tort of
harassment five hundred thousand for the
tort of intentional infliction of
nervous shock five hundred thousand for
the tort of negligence a hundred
thousand for constructive dismissal
aggravated damages in the amount of five
hundred thousand general damages
in the amount of five hundred thousand
punitive damages in the amount of a

the plaintiff resides in the town of
waterloo in the province of ontario
the defendants herbert pimlott and
nathan rambuchana are professors at the
defendant wilford laurier university
pimlott was the coordinator for the
masters program of the university and
rambu khanna at the relevant time was
the professor for the course which
shepard was a teaching assistant for
both had considerable influence over the
plaintiff's employment as a teaching
assistant and status as a master's
student
the defendant adria joel was at all
relevant times acting manager of the
university's diversity and equity office
in charge of gender violence prevention
the defendant university is a creature
of statute
created pursuant to the provisions of
the wilford laurier act
the university is vicariously liable for
all of the conduct of the individual
defendants referred to herein and at all
relevant times created an environment
supporting and facilitating acquiescing
to and implicitly and sometimes
explicitly endorsing that conduct
the constituent statute of the
university the wilford laurier act 1973
as amended 2001 and 2016
in providing the fundamental
jurisdiction and authority for the
university to operate states as its
object in section four
that the objects of the university are
for the pursuit of learning through
scholarship teaching and research within
a spirit of free inquiry and expression
the university has no other object and
no jurisdict
and no jurisdiction to operate otherwise
the university has no other object and
no jurisdiction to operate otherwise
pursuant to section 5 powers of the
university the act further states that
the university has all powers necessary
and incidental to the satisfaction and
furtherance of its objects as a
university
the constituent statute creating and
empowering the university provides it
with no other power or authority
shepard was at all relevant times a
student in the university masters
program pursuing her master's degree and
employed as a teaching assistant for a
course under rambuchana and following
that under professor judith nicholson
as a teaching assistant shepard
supported a class taught by professor
rambikana
she was generally responsible for
teaching two groups of approximately 25
students was assigned topics and was
entitled pursuant to the policies of the
university and of rambuchana to devise
her own curriculum
was an indifferent mentor who had only
met with shepard twice about his course
and only then briefly
ironically given his complaint against
her as delineated below he provided her
with very limited direction as to the
content to provide to her students in
his classes
the topic for one of her communication
classes held on november 1st 2017 was
grammar she taught three classes that
day
shepard introduced the topic of the
grammatical correctness of
gender-neutral language in the evolution
of various languages and to facilitate
discussion on the subject showed a few
minute extract from a tv ontario program
moderated by stephen paken consisting of
a debate between professor jordan
peterson of the university of toronto
psychology department and nicholas matt
from the university of toronto's sexual
diversity studies program
peterson and nicholas matt were debating
compelled gender pronouns peterson
argued against being required to use
these new words which he argued had not
developed organically matt took an
opposing position
shortly following that class rambuccana
ordered her to attend a meeting the very
next day with himself pimlott the
program coordinator for the entire
masters program and adria joel acting
director of the diversity and equity
office
both rambukana and pimlot had
considerable authority over shepard's
fate at the university apparently so did
joel
shepard had never been called into such
a meeting indeed rambikana to that point
had barely acknowledged her existence
at this session all three lambasted
shepherd viciously attacking her
personally falsely alleging that there
had been a complaint or complaints about
her tutorial and insisting that in
playing the tv ontario clip she had been
threatening to her students rambokanic
claimed that her showing this tv ontario
clip breached the charter of rights and
freedoms and federal bill c-16 which
does not even govern provincially
regulated universities created an unsafe
learning environment and was illegal
shepard was accused of targeting trans
folks even though shepard had chosen no
side had up till that point disagreed
with what she understood to be
peterson's perspective and presented the
arguments and the debate neutrally ram
buchana attacked and slandered peterson
claiming that he was part of the
alt-right and that playing a clip of
peterson without first providing any
previous context to the students was
like neutrally playing a speech by adolf
hitler shepherd argued that doing as he
asked would be taking sides and that was
not her role she was then further
rebuked for taking that position at
various points during that almost
hour-long vicious and abusive attack
shepard was reduced to tears
ironically rather than being a
present-day personification of adolf
hitler as rambuchana implied jordan
peterson has spent decades educating his
students about the evils of the
holocaust and specifically as part of
his psychological teachings has studied
and taught how individuals degenerate
ethically to the point where they take
place
to the point where they take part in
atrocities
as part of his psychological teachings
he has studied and taught how
individuals degenerate ethically to the
point where they take part in atrocities
during the meeting shepard was
effectively attacked as a protege and
supporter of peterson
pimlott continued to libel peterson
explaining that people like him live in
a fantasy world of false conspiracy and
accusing shepard of being an agent of
those ideas because she had neutrally
shown this video with its opposing
viewpoints
rambu cana falsely but imaginatively
claimed that shepard herself was
targeting people based on their gender
identity or gender expression and in
doing so had violated the federal human
rights code of bill c-16 although
shepard's conduct was in no way violent
of of that or any law
shepard asked the individual defendants
whether her job as a teaching assistant
was to shield her students from debate
and ideas rambukana asserted that it was
and then accused her of targeting
students due to their gender expression
and identity
when shepard pointed out that she had
not taken sides in this debate the three
rebuked her for creating a toxic climate
the three refused to advise shepard what
the complaint was or who complained
claiming that even the number of
complaints was confidential
as was subsequently ascertained there
had been no complaint at all
shepard protested that she did not
understand how her teaching methods
constituted any disservice to the
university since the ideas in the video
were already part of social currency
joel responded without any foundation
accusing her of spreading transphobia
rambukana added to jewel's attack by
essentially comparing her actions to
white supremacy
contrary to the allegations of the
defendants at this meeting shepard
conducted herself at this seminar
precisely as her role required and
singularly represented the principles of
the wilford laurier university act for
this she was viciously attacked by
rambikana pimlot and jewell they
continued to abuse her even after she
began sobbing accusing shepard of
causing harm to unnamed students
shepard apologized for crying during the
meeting pleading i am stressed out
because to me this is wrong so wrong
noting that the very spirit of the
university is to challenge ideas that
you already have and reminding them that
she had not taken any side or position
the meeting concluded with shepard being
advised even after she promised to show
no further videos of peterson or
anything of the like that she now had to
run all of her seminar notes past
rambuchana
to obtain specific approval for any
future clips of anyone that she attended
to show
and that rambu kanna might have to sit
in on her future classes
she was prohibited from showing any
further videos
finally they suggested to her that her
job might be in jeopardy
the conduct of the defendants was
objectively outrageous and flagrant they
had reckless disregard for the fact that
the foreseeable consequences of their
conduct would cause shepherd to suffer
emotionless stress
which it did
there are various policies of the
university which constitute a contract
between the university and its members
including shepard
article 1.01 of the procedures relating
to the prevention of harassment and
discrimination policy 6.1 of the
university notes that informal
resolution possibilities as well as
emotional academic and departmental
supports will be explored
none of this occurred
it also noted in article 1.02 of the
procedures relating to the prevention of
harassment discrimination policy 6.1
that if the concern falls outside of
this policy's jurisdiction or could be
more appropriately dealt with elsewhere
the individual will be referred to the
appropriate office that also did not
occur
under article 3.02 of policy 6.1 the
office of dispute resolution and support
will determine whether a complaint may
go forward article 3.04 states that the
office is available to provide guidance
on the preparation of a complaint or
response to a complaint that guidance
was not provided to shepherd article
5.01 of policy 6.1 states that an
investigation may be required when other
efforts to resolve the complaint have
not been successful or not appropriate
in the complaint by jackson referred to
below
no other efforts to resolve the
complaint were considered before
proceeding to the formal investigation
of shepard
article 8.03 of policy 6.1 states that
wilford laurier university's prevention
of discrimination and harassment policy
is not intended to inhibit academic
freedom it was used by rambuchana joel
and pimlot for precisely that purpose
article 8.05 notes that the university
may take disciplinary action against
those who make allegations of harassment
or discrimination which are reckless
malicious or not in good faith
although pimlott rambuchana and joel had
acted recklessly maliciously and in bad
faith and it was ultimately determined
by the university that this meeting
never should have occurred no action has
been taken by the university against
them and shepard was provided no
protection from their predations
the prevention of harassment
discrimination policy provides in
article 1.02 that each member of the
campus community is responsible for
helping to create an environment that
promotes mutual respect and
understanding for the dignity and rights
of others this policy was violated by
rambuchana pimlot and joel
the prevention of harassment
discrimination policy defines workplace
harassment in article 2.04 as engaging
in a course of vexatious comment or
conduct against a worker in the
workplace that is known or ought
reasonably to be known to be unwelcome
or workplace harassment this provision
too was violated by rambuccana pimlot
and joel
article 2.07 defines a poisoned
environment as where harassing or
discriminatory behaviors are severe and
or pervasive and cause unreasonable
interference with a person's study or
work environment a poisoned environment
may be created a poisoned work or
learning environment is one that is
intimidating hostile and or offensive a
poisoned environment can arise even from
a single incident
it may be created by the comments or
actions of any person regardless of his
or her status
rambuccana pimlott and joel created a
poisoned work environment for shepard
and thereby breached the university's
contractual obligations to shepherd
article 4.04 states that the university
will take appropriate steps to fairly
investigate respond to allegations of
discrimination and or harassment in
accordance with the procedures relating
to this policy
no such steps were taken instead shepard
was wrongly attacked by the members of
the administration until public and
Hi
I'm in the dressing room at the Palace Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky on June 14th
2018 and
I thought I'd read you an excerpt from maps of meaning the architecture of belief which is a book I published
in 99 with Routledge and
It's been the basis of my YouTube lectures and I would say also
Twelve rules for life a lot of the ideas and twelve rules for life were first worked out with maps of meaning
I just recorded an audio version of the book was released two days ago
June 12 2008 een and
It's available from Penguin Books on audible. I'll put the links in the description of the video
I'm hoping that the audio version with its
Careful intonation will be easier to understand maps of meaning is a rather difficult book
in any case I'm going to read you an excerpt from it today and
That'll serve as a bit of an introduction to the book
I'll make some more excerpts over the next coming weeks I think as well, but we'll start with this one. I
Was reading
Jeffrey Burton Russell's mephistopheles the devil in the modern world when I came across his discussion of
Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov
Russell discusses Ivan's argument for atheism, which is one of the most powerful ever mounted
Ivan is one of the brothers in The Brothers Karamazov
Ivan's examples of evil all taken from the daily newspapers of 1876 are unforgettable
The nobleman who orders his hounds to tear the peasant boy to pieces in front of his mother
The man who whips his struggling horse on its gentle eyes
The parents who locked their tiny daughter all night in the freezing privy while she knocks on the walls pleading for mercy
The Turk who entertains a baby with a shiny pistol before blowing its brains out
Ivan knows that such horrors of kur daily and can be multiplied without end
I took the case of children Ivan explains to make case clearer
Of the other tears with which the earth is soaked. I will say nothing
Burton Russell states
the relation of evil to God has in the century of Auschwitz and Hiroshima once again become center of
philosophical and theological discussion
The problem of evil can be stated simply
God is omnipotent
God is perfectly good
Such a God would not permit evil to exist
But we observe that evil exists. Therefore. God does not exist
Variations on this theme are nearly infinite
The problem is not only abstract and philosophical. Of course. It is also personal and immediate
Believers tend to forget that their God takes away everything that one cares about possessions comforts success
professional craft knowledge
friends family and life
What kind of God is this any?
Decent religion must face this question squarely and no answer is credible that cannot be given in the face of dying children
It seems to me that we use the horrors of the world to justify our own inadequacies
We make the presumption that human vulnerability is a sufficient cause of human cruelty
we blame God and God's creation for twisting and perverting our souls and claim all the time to be innocent victims of
circumstance
What do you say to a dying child
you say
You can do it. There is something in you that is strong enough to do it and
you don't use the terrible vulnerability of children as an excuse for the rejection of existence and the perpetration of
conscious evil
When I wrote maps of meaning I did not have much experience as a clinical psychologist
Two of my patients however stayed in my mind
The first was a woman about 35 years old
She looked 50 she reminded me of a medieval peasant
Of my conception of a medieval peasant. She was dirty clothes hair teeth
dirty with the kind of Filth that takes months to develop
She was unbearably shy
She approached anyone who she thought was superior in status to her, which was virtually everyone hunched over
With her eyes shaded by her hands both hands as if she could not tolerate the light emanating from her target
She had been in behavioral treatment in a Montreal
Hospital before as an outpatient and was in fact a sight known to the permanent staff at the clinic
Others had tried to help her overcome her unfortunate manner of self presentation which made people on the streets shy away from her
Made them regard her as crazy and unpredictable
She could learn to stand or sit up temporarily with eyes on garden
But she reverted to her old habits as soon as she left the clinic
She may have been intellectually impaired in consequence of some biological fault
It was difficult to tell because her environment was so appalling. It may have caused her ignorant
She was illiterate as well
She lived with her mother whose character. I knew nothing about and with an elderly desperately ill bedridden aunt
Her boyfriend was a violent alcoholic
schizophrenic who mistreated her
Psychologically and physically who was always muddling her simple mind with tirades about the devil and the worship of Satan
She had nothing going for her. No beauty. No intelligence. No loving family. No skills
No employment
Nothing
She didn't come to therapy to resolve her problems
However, nor to unburden her soul nor to describe her mistreatment and victimization at the hands of others
she came she
Came because she wanted to do something for someone who was worse off than her
Of the clinic where I was interning was associated with a large
psychiatric hospital all of the patients that still remained after the shift to community CAIR in the aftermath of the 60s were so
incapacitated that they could not survive on the streets
she had done some volunteer work of some limited type in that hospital and
Decided if she could maybe befriend a patient take him or her outside for a walk. I
Think she got this idea because she had a dog which he walked regularly and what she liked to take care of
All she wanted from me was help arranging this helped finding someone who she could take outside
Help finding someone in the hospital bureaucracy who would allow this to happen. I
Was not very successful in aiding her, but she didn't seem to hold that against me
it is said that one piece of evidence that runs contrary to a theory is sufficient to disprove that theory of
Course people do not think this way and perhaps should not in
General a theory is too useful to give up easily
Too difficult to regenerate and the evidence against should be consistent and believable before it is accepted
but the existence of this woman made me think she
Was destined for a psychopathological end from the viewpoint of biological and environmental determinism
fated as surely as anyone I had ever met
And maybe she beat her dog sometimes and was rude to her sick aunt
Maybe I never saw her vindictive or unpleasant even when her simple wishes were thwarted
I don't want to say that she was a saint because I didn't know her well enough to tell
But the fact was that in her misery and simplicity, she remained without self pity and able to see outside of herself
Why wasn't she a criminal cruel?
unbalanced and miserable
She had every reason to be
And yet she wasn't in her simple way. She had made the proper choices
She remained bloody but unbowed and she seemed to me rightly or wrongly to be a symbol of suffering humanity
sorely afflicted
Yet capable of cur and love
God justifies his creation in Milton's Paradise Lost
Such I created all the ethereal powers and spirits both them who stood and them who failed
Not free what proof? Could they have given sincere of true allegiance?
constant faith or love where only what they needs must do appeared not what they would
What praise could they receive what pleasure I from such obedience?
Paid when will and reason reason also his choice?
Useless and vain of freedom both de spoiled made passive both had served necessity not me
They therefore as to right belonged
so were created nor can justly accuse their maker or their making or their fate as if
Predestination overruled their will disposed by absolute decree or high foreknowledge
they themselves decreed their own revolt not I
If I for new foreknowledge have no influence on their fault, which had no less proved certain unfair known
So without least impulse or shadow of fate or ought by me immutably foreseen they trespass
authors to themselves in all
Both what they judge and what they choose
For so, I formed them free and free. They must remain till they enthralled themselves. I
Else must change their nature and revoke the high decree
unchangeable eternal
Which ordained their freedom they themselves?
ordained their fall
The other patient I wish to describe was the schizophrenic in a small inpatient ward at a different Hospital
He was about 29 when I met him a few
Years older than I was at the time and had been in and out of confinement for seven years
He was of course on antipsychotic medication and participated in occupational therapy Act
He's on the ward making coasters and pencil holders and so on but he could not maintain
Attention for any amount of time. It was not even much good at crafts
My supervisor asked me to administer an intelligence test to him
The standard ways are more for the sake of my experience than for any possible diagnostic. Good. I
Gave my patients some of the red and white blocks that made up the block design sub tests
He was supposed to arrange the blocks so they matched a pattern printed on some cards
He picked them up and started to rearrange them on the desk in front of him while I timed him stupidly with a stopwatch
The task was impossible for him. Even at the simplest of stages. He looked
Constantly distracted and frustrated. I
Asked what's wrong?
He said the battle between good and evil in heaven is going on in my head. I
Stopped the testing at that point. I didn't know exactly what to make of his comment
He was obviously suffering and the testing seemed to make it worse
What was he experiencing?
He wasn't lying. That's for sure in the face of such a statement. It seemed ridiculous to continue. I
spent some time with him that summer I
never met someone who was so blatantly mentally ill we talked on the ward and
Occasionally I would take him for a walk through the hospital grounds outside
He was the third son of first generation immigrants his firstborn brother was a lawyer the other a physician
His parents were obviously ambitious for their children
hard-working and disciplined
He had been a graduate student
working towards a degree in
Immunology, I don't precisely remember his brothers had sent him a daunting example, and he felt pressured to succeed
His experimental work had not turned out as he had expected. However, and he apparently came to believe that he might not graduate
not at least when he had hoped to
so
He faked his experimental results and wrote up his thesis anyway
He told me that the night he finished writing he woke up and saw the devil standing over him at the foot of his bed
This event triggered the onset of his mental illness from which he had never recovered
It might be said that the satanic apparition merely accompanied the expression of some pathological
stress induced neural development whose appearance was
biologically predetermined or that the devil was merely
Personification of his cultures conception of moral evil manifesting itself in imagination as a consequence of his guilt
Both of these levels of description have their merits
But the fact remains that he saw the devil and at the vision accompanied or even was the event that destroyed him
He was afraid to tell me much of his fantasy and it was only after I had paid careful attention to him that he opened
up
He was not
Bragging or trying to impress me. He was terrified about what he believed
Terrified as a consequence of the fantasies that impressed themselves upon him
he told me that he could not leave the hospital because someone was waiting to shoot him a
typical paranoid delusion
Why did someone want to kill him?
Well, he was hospitalized during the Cold War
Not at its height perhaps but still during a time when the threat of purposeful nuclear annihilation
Seemed more plausible more likely than it does now
many of the people I knew used the existence of this threat to justify to
Themselves their failure to participate fully in life a life
Which they thought of romantically as doomed and therefore as pointless
but there was some real terror in the pose and
The thought of the countless missiles pointed here and there around the world sapped the energy and faith of everyone
hypocritical or not
My schizophrenic patient believed that he was in fact the incarnation of the world annihilating force
That he was destined is released from the hospital to make his way south to a nuclear missile silo on American territory
That he was fated to make the decision that would launch the final war
The people outside the hospital knew this and that is why they were waiting to shoot him
He did not want to tell me this story in consequence
Although he did because he thought that I might then want to kill him too
My friends in graduate school thought of ironic that I had contact with a patient of this type
My peculiar interest in young and Young's ideas regarding the collective unconscious were well known to them and it seemed absurdly
Fitting that I would end up talking to someone with delusions of this title
But I didn't know what to do with his ideas
Of course, they were crazy and they had done in my patient
But it still seemed to me that they were true from the metaphorical viewpoint
His story in totality linked his individual choice between good and evil with the cumulative horror then facing the world
His story implied that because he had given in to temptation at a critical juncture
He was in fact responsible for the horror of the potential of nuclear war
But how could this be?
And seemed insane to me to even consider that the act of one powerless
Individual could be linked in some manner to the outcome of history as a whole
But I have no longer so sure
I've read much about evil and its manner of perpetration and growth and I'm no longer convinced that each of us are so innocent
so harmless
It is of course a logical to presume that one person one speck of dust among six billion motes is any sense
responsible for the horrible course of human events
But that course in itself is not logical far from it and it seems likely that it depends on
processes that we do not understand
The most powerful arguments for the non-existence of God
At least a good God are predicated on the idea that such a being would not allow for the resistance of evil in its classical
natural
diseases disasters or moral war
pogroms forms
Such arguments can be taken further even than atheism can be used to dispute the justice of the existent world itself
Dostoyevsky states, perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a single innocent child's suffering
How can the universe be constructed such that pain is permitted
How can a good God allow for the existence of a suffering world?
These difficult questions can be addressed in part as a consequence of careful analysis of evil
First it seems reasonable to insist upon the value of the natural
moral distinction
the tragic circumstances of life should not be placed in the same category as
willfully undertaken harm
Tragedy subjugation to the mortal conditions of existence
Has an ennobling aspect at least in potential and has been constantly exploited to that end in great literature and mythology
True evil by contrast is anything but noble?
Participation it Out's whose sole purpose is expansion of innocent pain and suffering destroys character
Forthright encounter with tragedy by contrast may increase it
This is the meaning of the christian myth of the crucifixion
It is christ's full participation in and freely chosen
Acceptance of his fate which he shares with all mankind that enables him to manifest his full identity with god
And it is that identity which enables him to bear that fate and which strips it of evil
Conversely it is the voluntary demeaning of our own characters, which makes the necessary tragic conditions of existence
appear evil
But why is life tragic why are we subject to unbearable limitation to pain
Zees and death to cruelty at the hands of nature and society
Why do terrible things happen to everyone?
These are of course
Unanswerable questions, but they must be answered somehow if we are able to face our own lives
The best I can make of it is this this has helped me
Nothing can exist without
preconditions even a game cannot be played without rules and the rules say what cannot be done as much as what can
Perhaps the world is not possible as a world without its borders without its rules
Maybe existence wouldn't be possible in the absence of our painful limitations
Think of it this way if we could have everything we wanted merely for wishing it if every tool
Performed every job if all men were omniscient and immortal that everything would be the same the same
All-powerful thing God and creation would never exist
That is the differences between things which is a function of their specific limitations that allows them to exist at all
But the fact that things do exist does not mean that they should exist even if we are willing to grant them their necessary
limitations
Should the world exist?
are the preconditions of experience so terrible that the whole game should be called off and
There is never any shortage of people working diligently towards this end
It seems to me that we answer this question implicitly
But profoundly when we lose someone we loved and then grieve
This is a very common experience. I
Don't think we cried because they existed either
But because they are lost
This presupposes a judgment rendered at a very fundamental level of analysis
grief
presupposes having loved
presupposes the judgment that this person's specific
Bounded exists was valuable was something that should have been even in its inevitably imperfect and vulnerable form
But still the question lingers why should things even love things exist at all?
If they're necessary limitations cause such suffering
Perhaps we could reserve answer to the question of God's nature his
Responsibility for the presence of the evil in creation until we have solved the problem of our own
perhaps we could tolerate the horrors of the world if we left our own characters intact and
Developed them to the fullest
If we took full advantage of every gift we had been granted
Perhaps the world would not look horrible then

published in 1999 audio version released June 12
2018. I'll read some more excerpts in the coming days and weeks. Thanks very much. Bye bye
Thank you, Mr. Peterson for being with us.
Thanks for the invitation.
What I found most interesting in your book is the stuff you write about child development and child upbringing and
for example you explain how overprotective parents can damage their children?
You say it's far better to render beings in your care competent than to protect them.
Do you think that the parents 
today are
more protective of their children than previous generations.
I would say that it looks like that.
Yes, I think there are complex reasons for that. I don't think that you can necessarily
lay that at the feet of the parents people are having fewer children and
and they're having them later in life and
So I think both of those things those are major demographic shifts
and I think that one of the
Consequences of that is that children's lives are much more organized than they used to be
which might have some advantages
but that also parents are more likely to over protect their older and more cautious and
the children also don't have as many siblings and of course siblings were part of the child raising process and and
It's hard to be over protected in some ways when you're competing with a bunch of siblings
So it's complicated but I think that over protection is a problem
Rule 11 is do not bother children when they are skateboarding. This is a recurring theme in your book
If we are overprotective with our children
We will create weak individuals.
Well you you demolish people's resilience that way.
I mean life is difficult and you cannot protect your children?
What you can do is prepare them and you can prepare them to be strong and courageous and
truthful and
resilient and
reciprocal in their interactions with other people and that means you equip them for
what life will be which is at minimum a series of difficult challenges and and
often more than that because of course people go through very difficult times in their lives and a
resilient person is capable of standing up to things in the face of fear and moving forward voluntarily
convinced of their own
competence and ability to prevail and
so the primary, your primary goal as a parent apart from
facilitating your child's social desirability, which is a major
obligation on your part is to
encourage your children and to, and I mean that literally to instill in them a sense of courage in the face of the difficulties of
life and not to protect them from that.
We don't even want to be protected from those difficulties because a major part of life and its meaning is the
The challenge that comes with confronting difficulties
So...
What do you want to say to those parents?
That allow their eight or nine-year-old sons to sleep in their beds at night instead of sleeping in their own rooms
well
I the first thing I would say about that is you might want to ask why you don't want privacy with your spouse
You know
The last thing you want to do is use your child as an excuse to not interact properly with your wife or your husband
there's all sorts of reasons that people allow their children to interfere with their relationship and
so and by eight or nine a child is more than capable of
Spending time on their own and they need to do that anyways
Because you don't want your child to be either unable to spend time alone or terrified of it
you, you also destroy to some degree their, well, their ability to cope on their own but also their imagination by not requiring them to
rely on themselves for their own like
Call (?) for self calming and safe and also for self amusement
There's a rule when you're dealing with people who might be
dependent and this includes and includes the situation where you're dealing with sick people or or elderly people and the rule is
Do not do anything for anyone that they can do for themselves
Because you take away their competence by doing that I want to ask you about
I want to ask you about
the use of physical force on children because you think it is important to allow kids to explore and harm themselves to gain experience
still you believe strict parenting is important and you think this
Justifiable to flick the index finger on to certain types of two-year-olds
Why is the use of force justifiable
Well it depends on the context and it also depends on what you mean by force
There isn't a disciplinary strategy that you can utilize that doesn't involve something that's unpleasant while you can use reward
But that that's a different there's different
Circumstances underway and you should use reward every time you can because it's more effective but you often need something that's...
Instantaneous and that gets the message across and a flick is a very good
technique because it's instant. It's harmless it gets the message across you can use it publicly
It can't be misused. You won't hurt the child
You have to have an effective disciplinary strategy for you since in social situations, for example.
Yeah, you talk about the minimizing
Minumum. Yeah, well the basic rules are quite straightforward
minimum number of rules because otherwise the enforcement costs accrue and you end up
constraining yourself and the child too much and then
minimal necessary force and you might ask well what's minimal necessary force and the answer to that is
Minimum intervention necessary to bring the behavior to a halt as rapidly and harmlessly as possible and that has to be negotiated with the child
Because some children are much more difficult to stop than others.
But isn't it possible that the parent-child relationship
can be damaged if basic trust and safety is lost?
It's absolutely the case that it's it will be damaged yes, but the application of
judicious disciplinary force doesn't damage the relationship it actually strengthens it and everyone knows this. look if
If you have a relationship with your wife, let's say the relationship is partly based on mutual respect
Not merely on mutual love. It's also based on mutual respect and you
everyone tests out their partner to
Determine what their limits are and if you're not
Subject to corrective action on the part of your partner. You will have no respect for them
Your relationship will just deteriorate very rapidly
so and it's very important to understand that the limits that you place on children are not something that
Impede their child-parent relationship, but actually further it, substantially.
I want to talk about gender equality now
Yeah.
In chapter 11 you write about the so called oppression of the patriarchy and you write it looks
to me like the so-called oppression of the patriarchy was instead an imperfect collective attempt by men and women
stretching over millennia to free each other from privation disease and tragedy so
The oppression of women happened because it was practical
No, the, the oppression of men and women happened because life is difficult and treacherous and
So we were subject and still are to all sorts of terrible burdens that are intrinsic to life itself
I mean one of the things that's happened is because we're so
Technically and materially wealthy right now. We don't understand what privations our
Ancestors even a few generations ago faced. I mean it was very difficult for women to function
Let's say as, as technical equals in the absence of reliable control of menstruation
That's only been a reality for say seventy years and the birth control pill as well
Is it a major technological revolution.
You, you mentioned technological advancement?
Yes
So the hurdles have been removed in part way but you talk about the so-called oppression of the patriarchy.
Yes
Women were oppressed for centuries.
I mean, well, that's one way of looking at it or the other way of looking at it
Is that men and women were oppressed for centuries.
I mean there are certain burdens that women bore that men didn't bear but the opposite is equally true
Men suffered dreadfully for example in incredibly dangerous occupations,.
but its a fact that women suffered more than the men.
I don't believe that no. I don't think it is a fact I think that most people suffered by modern standards
immeasurably and that I don't buy the
Historical narrative that the fundamental reality of our history was that men were oppressing women
first of all women aren't that easy to oppress as you might have noticed if you've ever had a relationship with them and
You might say well it took women a long time to struggle forward
Until they attained civil rights status that was equivalent to men and I would say that's true
But it also was the case for men that it took very long time to struggle forward before there was anything approximating?
individual rights and that they were granted to women quite rapidly in the aftermath of that and that a lot of that was a
consequence of
technological transformation made that sort of thing even possible.
But we are both privileged white males
Can we really understand the suffering of women?
Well, it depends on how how useful your, your capacity for understanding the suffering of others is or how well-developed that
Is I don't see that it's necessarily any more difficult to understand the suffering of women
Well, I would never pose the question that way because I don't know how you understand the suffering of a group being an individual
I don't think a woman can understand the suffering of women because that makes the that's predicated on the assumption that a
Individual can take on the burden of a group and I don't buy that assumption to begin with. I think we, we vary in
the ability to
Let's say empathize with others, but I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that you can't empathize across a gender barrier
Otherwise no relationship would even be possible.
A lot of people argue that cultural oppression is still a fact in modern society
For example, something feminine is considered insulting
Doesn't that sustain the oppression of women?
Well, I think that there are negative
stereotypes associated with both forms of gendered behavior and that if those are
Utilized inappropriately, they can result in prejudicial attitudes. I think that most enterprises are
Imperfect enough so that some residual prejudice remains. It might be sex
It might be preference by gender or prejudice by gender
It might be prejudice by race, might be prejudice by ethnicity or, or attractiveness or intelligence or character
there's all sorts of things that warp the proper selectivity of
hierarchies, but I think we're doing a
An unbelievably good job at getting rid of those as rapidly as is humanly possible and that we've moved
So fast in that direction so quickly that we deserve some credit for it
There's one line in the book where you say you don't agree with the theory of the feminist revolution of the 20th century
but isn't that a fact that the feminist movement of the 20th century had a
significant impact for gender equality
No, I don't really think so.
What about (unintelligible)who are, what would equal pay?
What about what happened 60s?
I think that, I think that to, to, to lay, that to attribute that
primarily to the feminist political
movement is
to give far more credit to the feminist political movement than it deserves and I think the people who are pushing that are primarily
feminists
I think that most of what freed
women was the
extension of the idea of individual rights
To everyone including women and that, that was happening not only on the, on the front of women. Let's say but also
with regards to people of different races and ethnicities
I think it's part of a much broader cultural movement to extend the idea of individual rights universally
I think that's deeply embedded in the judeo-christian tradition
and I think that a very large number of
Technological innovations played a far more important role in the emancipation of women than feminist political
ideology even though
You can point to certain movements like the suffragette movement
for example that pushed hard to have the vote extended to women, but even that I would say was a
manifestation of deeper transformations at a cultural and technological level
I think the people who are pushing the idea that it was the feminists
It was feminist political macinations that produced the equalization of the situation between men and women are mostly diehard ideological
Feminists who like to think that way but it doesn't look to me like that's a valid historical
Interpretation in the least.
I would like to move on now.
I would like to talk about truthfulness, in Chapter eight and rule eight you write about the lie, the life lie
Mm-hmm.
It's, you say someone living a life lie is attempting to manipulate reality with perception
Based on what you write in the chapter
Couldn't one say that a large part of the population in 21st century
Live a life lie because they avoid conflict. They say what they think pleases their spouses or their bosses instead of telling the truth
Oh, yes
If they do what is convenient at every given moment instead of saying what they really want.
Yes
Well, perhaps not at every given moment, but they certainly fall prey to that temptation. It's conflict avoidance. Yeah, well as a psychologist
psychologists deal with a variety of problems, but I would say the two most common normal problem our
anxiety and depression that would be one class and the other would be lack of assertiveness and
and lack of assertiveness subsumes the, the
Problems that you just described people won't stand up for themselves and say what they need and want and then they don't negotiate
properly and you might and they're avoiding
They're avoiding conflict in the short term, which is a form of lie by omission and what that means is that problems
Aggregate around them that's often why people end up divorced, you know?
People will stay married for a long time and one partner will say to the other eventually
Well, I've been unhappy for the last eight years
it's like well that
might have been something to announce in increments
Say weekly or even daily
Long before everything accrued to the point where the only possible solution is a catastrophic
dissolution there's a lot of conflict involved in setting a relationship straight
You have to let each other know who you are because you're different that's going to cause conflict
You're going to conflict about
Whose job takes priority and win you're gonna come conflict have conflict about how to spend your free time about how to raise your children
about how to manage the domestic economy
About what disciplinary strategies you should use about where to vacation about what to eat like all of those things have to be negotiated
through and all of that requires truthfulness so that each of you know
What the other is wants and will be satisfied with and conflict. It's very very
What would you say the only thing more exhausting than telling the truth and
Negotiating with your spouse is not doing it and waiting for the divorce
Both of them are difficult, but I would recommend the former.
Yeah, we if we talk about the workplace
What do you want to say to those viewers that regularly, you know?
Agree with their bosses and instead of telling the truth. What are they doing to themselves in the long run?
Well, they're taking the soul out of their work. You know, let's say well just imagine for the sake of argument that you
encounter one annoying thing a day at work a small annoying thing and then let's say
for the sake of argument that you could have a little battle about that and
Improve it somewhat or you could just say it doesn't matter. It's like probably doesn't matter today
Oh, it might not even matter tomorrow
But if you make a thousand decisions like that
Which you will do or three years then now you have a thousand things
Bugging you at work, and if you wait for five years then it's well
Then it's 2,000 things and the same thing happens with your kids and the same thing happens in your marriage those things
Accrue and they turn into a monster.
Yeah you but you would agree that conflict avoidance is practical sometimes
People do it just go along with  their...
No, I don't actually I think in a marriage for example, there's almost nothing so small you shouldn't fight about it
But the question is what does fight mean? It doesn't mean win
Like if if you and I have a relationship, let's say it's a business partnership
it doesn't really matter if we have a relationship and we have a
Difference of opinion we need to battle it through
But the purpose of the battle isn't so that your viewpoint prevails or that my viewpoint prevails because either of us might be wrong
The purpose is to engage in the conflictual exchange of opinion so that we can see a joint path
forward to peace and
that's and that's the thing is like if you're fighting with your wife the first thing to remember if you're fighting with your wife is
You have to live with her
So maybe beating her in the argument is not the right outcome. What the right outcome is is saying what you have to say
listening to what she has to say and see if you guys can come up with a
Mutually agreed upon solution that will make the problem go away
so if we explore conversation
Between people in society a lot of these conversations are full of falsehoods and lies
People are nice to people they dislike
They're being fake. because we try to be friendly. Yeah, I mean, it's
Is it in fact morally wrong to live your life in that way?
Yes. Yeah it is it is I mean
you can't avoid the
Necessary conflict of negotiation towards peace. If you avoid it all that it means is that it accrues and multiplies.
It's the oldest one of the oldest stories we have the oldest stories
We have point to that as part of the prime moral doctrine, you know, it's it's it's a form of impulsivity, you know
If you only do what you want in the moment
Impulsively that there would be consequences of that into the future which is why you shouldn't act impulsively
Impulsively avoiding conflict is exactly the same and people, same problem
people know this, you know, if if someone's casually rude to you in, in, a bus driver for example, and
You'll, you, there's always the possibility that you'll stew for hours over what you should have said
It's like when someone
Transgresses against you let's say you have to say what you have to say. You don't have to say it as if you're the
totally, correct
authoritarian tyrant you can say it in the spirit of of
inquiry inquiry
You know because there's always the possibility that you're wrong and you want to listen
This is also why you want to listen to your partner your, your, your spouse even if what they're saying to you is
You find very annoying
It's always possible that they're right and you should listen because if they're right then they can stop you from
Heading for trouble in the future.
I want to go backwards I want to talk about rule number seven. Pursue what is meaningful not what this expedient
You write in the book there is no faith and no courage and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient
What do you say to those viewers that don't pursue their dreams and are locked into their careers?
Because they are too afraid to take risks and pursue something meaningful
well, the first thing I would say is well, you should be afraid of taking risks and pursuing something meaningful, but
You should be more afraid of staying where you are if it's making you miserable
it's like the first thing you want to do is dispense with the idea that you get to have any any
Permanent security outside of your ability to contend and adapt it's the same issue with children
it's like
You're paying a price by sitting there being miserable and you might say well the devil I know is better than the one I don't
It's like don't be so sure of that. The clock is ticking
and if you're miserable in your job now and you change nothing in five years
You'll be much more miserable and you'll be a lot older.
but isn't it a luxury to pursue what is meaningful?
Our viewers have mortgages. They have children. they have payments and loans. It's a luxury to pursue because we lack the resources
Well, I don't think I don't remember now. I'm not talking about what makes you happy
It's a luxury to pursue what makes you happy
It's a moral obligation to pursue what you find meaningful. And that doesn't mean it's easy
it might require sacrifice if you need to change your job to let's say you have
a family and, and, and, and children and, and a mortgage you have responsibilities
You've already picked up those responsibilities. You don't just get to walk away scot-free and say well I don't like my job
I quit that's no strategy. But what you might have to do is you think well this job is killing my soul
All right. So what do I have to do about that? Well, I have to look for another job
Well, no one wants to hire me. It's like okay. Maybe you need to educate yourself more
Maybe you need to update your your curriculum vitae your resume. Maybe you need to overcome your fear of being interviewed
Maybe you need to sharpen your social skills
Like you you have to think about these things strategically if you're going to switch careers
You have to do it like an intelligent responsible person that might take you a couple of years of
Effort to do properly.
When you say pursue something meaningful. Is it important to have a vocation?
I think it's more important to, to have a, an ethos, an ethic
So I have a program for example called the future authoring program
which is a writing program that enables people to develop a vision for their life and then to develop a strategy and
So it's based on the idea
Imagine that and it's an extension of the ideas in the book or at least something along the same lines
The first thing that you want to do is figure out imagine you were taking care of yourself like you were someone you cared for
Which is rule number two, by the way
essentially
Then you should figure out well if you could have what you needed and wanted what would it be?
What sort of friends would you have? What would your family relationships look like? How would you conduct yourself with your children?
How would you educate yourself you need to think through how it is that your life could be properly
Arranged if you had that ability and then you can aim at that. And the funny thing is is that if you do
Pause it a goal of that sort and work towards it
you will move towards it the goal will change because you'll learn things along the way but I mean I've
dealt with hundreds of people in my clinical and consulting practice and we set a goal we develop a vision and
Work towards it and it things
Inevitably get better for people. So it's not a luxury. It's it's difficult. It's a moral responsibility and it isn't happiness
It's it's not the pursuit isn't for happiness.
It's a moral responsibility to pursue what is meaning.
Absolutely.
I would like to end the interview with a, with
Citing criticism from your friend.
Oh, yes.
Bernard shift.
Yes
Your friend for many years and former colleague at the University of Toronto
Yes.
He wrote an article about you in the Toronto Star recently.
Yes.
It was quite hard criticism on what you've been doing in the last few years and he wrote
Jordan is fighting to maintain the status quo to keep chaos at bay or so. He believes
He is not a free speech warrior. He is a social order Warrior
Are you a social order warrior?
I think that people can decide that for themselves. I mean one of the things that Bernie
criticized was my
lecturing style at the University. Now all those lectures are online all the
Essentially like a representative sample of my lectures from the last 30 years are online and I mean hundreds of hours
it's not a few fragments and
hundreds of thousands of people have watched them and the
Criticisms that Bernie leveled at me have not been leveled at me by the watchers
And so people can go watch the lectures and make up their own mind about that.
But he also questions your motives
he, he wants to know what your end game is all about. I mean, what is your primary motive?
My primary motive as a clinical psychologist and educator is to help individuals
Live more meaningful and productive lives. In harmony with their families and their community. That's my motive and
The evidence for that I think is well if people go online and first of all
You can watch the lectures and decide for yourself, but you can also go. There's I suspect probably
Maybe
250,000 people have commented on the lectures and their effects on them. And so
That's what people say. I'm watching the lectures. Yeah, I'm trying to develop a vision for my life
I'm trying to become more
Responsible and its really helping and that's and that's what I hear all the time
When I do these public lectures, which aren't political
But when we gain success we raise the bar we set our ambitions higher. I mean, what is your end game?
What do you want?
That's all that's what I want. I want I want to help as many
Individuals as possible become more courageous
more truthful and more engaged in the pursuit of
Individual familial and social harmony. That's what I want.
You're pursuing what is meaningful.
I'm pursuing. I believe that to be the case. It's certainly meaningful to me. I mean there isn't everywhere I go now
Doesn't matter where I land and what airport or if I walk down the street
Three or four people will come up to me and they'll tell me I was in a dark place. I was anxious depressed
nihilistic, drug-addicted, alcoholic, homeless, in jail. You name it bad relationship with my girlfriend.
Bad relationship with my parents. I've been watching your lectures or reading your book
I've been trying to tell the truth to get my life together and everything is way better
And so then you think well if you could have what you wanted and what would be meaningful
You imagine you could go anywhere in the world and people would come up to you that were strangers and tell you that
That's as good as it gets.
What about politics? Do you have political ambitions?
No.
No political ambitions
No, I I have ambitions to speak with people who are politically motivated if they want to speak with me
But personally I've already decided that
what I'm doing at the moment is more and
I thought this, I've made this choice multiple times in my life that this approach is more suitable for me.
Okay, Mr. Peterson Thank you for your time.
Thank you very much for the interview
[I spent much more time on this than I initially expected, when will people get paid for transcribing YT videos]
[Music]
[Music]
brilliant minds even mediocre minds
operate better under stimulus Canadian
history is the Canadian and you can't
take away someone's and Barack Obama has
systematically rebuilt the trust of the
world in our willingness to work through
the Security Council and other three you
must not talk to anybody in the world
any of our allies whatever you want to
call this system a mafia state a feudal
empire it's a disaster for ordinary
Russians
[Music]
brilliant minds even with the ochre
minds
operate better under stimulus Canadian
is a Canadian Barack Obama has
systematically rebuilt the trust of the
world in our willingness to work through
the Security Council and other three you
must not talk to anybody in the world
any of our allies it whatever you want
to call this system a mafia state a
feudal empire it's a disaster for
ordinary Russians I think that's the
kind of hypocritical argument that if I
were Chinese that annoying but
historically Chinese foreign policy can
be described it's by Berrien management
science and religion are not
incompatible religion forces nice people
to do unkind things our men obsolete a
my conclusion to this question is no I
won't let you be you show me the oil
pretext I quoted them saying show me a
free program how you can keep screaming
out and it doesn't change the point we
do not want sympathy we do not want pity
we want opportunities it's an appalling
slander to me to the Muslim religion I
never said the word Muslim in my
fulminating it was a Muslim free form a
nation it is that that kind of restraint
it is that kind of sober-minded sensible
intelligent foreign policy that Obama
represents so I guess what I'm telling
you is he's sort of a closeted Canadian
vote for him for God's sake
[Applause]

his generosity and his drive that was so
important in allowing us to really win
international acclaim as one of the
world's great debating series his
philanthropy its legacy wow it's
incredible last fall we all remember
that hundred million dollar donation to
cardiac health here in Toronto

that wasn't his style so let's instead
celebrate a great Canadian a great life
and a great legacy of the late Peter
Munk Bravo Peter

okay we're gonna get our debate underway
momentarily but first a quick checklist
to go through we've got a hashtag
tonight hash at monk debate those of you
in the hall and those of you watching
online please weigh in let's get your
opinions going also for those of you
watching online right now we have an
running poll
ww monk debates comm Ford / votes
reflect input react to this debate as it
unfolds over the next hour and a half
my favorite part aspect of this show
that was Peter's brilliance and creation
we have our countdown clock what this
does is it keeps our debaters on their
toes and our debate on time so when you
see these clocks on the screen go down
to zero
I wanted you to join me in a warm round
of applause and we'll have a debate that
ends when it's supposed to end now let's
see we had our resolution tonight on the
way in we had this audience of roughly
3,000 people here in downtown Toronto
vote on be it resolved what you call
political correctness I call progress
let's see the agree disagree on that
number
36% agree 64% disagree so a room in play
now we asked you how many of you were
open to changing your vote over the
course of debate are you fixed agree
disagree or could you potentially be
convinced by one or other of these two
teams to move your vote over the next
hour and a half let's see those numbers
now Wow
okay a pretty open-minded crowd this
debate is very much in play and as per
the agreed-upon order of speakers I'm
going to call on Michelle Goldberg first
Michelle would you like I said but water
you can have a sip of water before you
start calling Michelle Goldberg first
for her six minutes of opening remarks
Michelle okay thank you for having me as
record knows I initially balked a little
bit at the resolution that we're
debating because there are a lot of
things that fall under the rubric of
political correctness that I don't call
progress
I don't like nope
forming or Twitter or trigger warnings
you know like a lot of middle-aged
liberals there are many aspects of
student social justice culture that I
find off-putting although I'm not sure
that that particular generation gap is
anything is anything new on the record
about the toxicity of social media
call-out culture and I think it's good
to debate people whose ideas I don't
like which is why I'm here so if there
are social justice warriors in the
audience I feel like I should apologize
to you because I'm probably not you're
probably gonna feel like I'm not
adequately defending your ideas but the
reason I'm on this side of the stage is
that political correctness isn't just a
term for left-wing excesses on college
campuses or people being terrible on
Twitter especially is deployed by mr.
Peterson I think it can be a way to
delay jitter mize any attempt for women
and racial and sexual minorities to
overcome discrimination or even to argue
that such discrimination is real in the
New York Times today mr. Peterson says
quote the people who hold that all that
our culture is an oppressive patriarchy
they don't want to admit that the
current hierarchy might be predicated on
competence that sounds particularly
insane to me because I'm an American and
our president is Donald Trump but
but it's an assumption that I think
underlies a worldview in which any
challenges to the current hierarchy are
written off as political correctness I
also think we should be clear that this
isn't really a debate about free speech
mr. Peterson once referred to what he
called quote the evil Trinity of equity
diversity and inclusivity and said those
three words if you hear people mouth
those three words equity diversity and
inclusivity you know who you're dealing
with and you should step away from that
because it is not acceptable he argues
that the movie frozen is politically
correct propaganda and at one point he
floated the idea of creating a database
of university course content so students
could avoid postmodern critical theory
so in the criticism of political
correctness I sometimes hear an urge or
an attempt to purge our thought of
certain analytical categories that
mirrors I think the worst caricatures of
the social justice left that want to get
rid of anything that smacks of
colonialism or patriarchy or white
supremacy I also don't really think
we're debating the value of the
Enlightenment at least not in the way
that somebody like mr. Frey who I think
is a champion of enlightenment values
brings it the efforts to expand rights
and privileges once granted just to land
owning white heterosexual men is the
Enlightenment or is very much in keeping
with the Enlightenment to quote a dead
white man John Stuart Mill the despotism
of custom is everywhere the standing
hindrance to human advancement I think
that some of our opponents by contrast
frame challenges to the despotism of
customs as politically correct attacks
on a transcendent natural order to quote
mr. Peterson again each gender each sex
has its own unfairness to deal with but
to think of it as a consequence of the
social of the social structure it's like
come on really what about nature itself
but there's an exception to this because
he does believe in social interventions
to remedy some kinds of unfairness which
is why in the new york times it calls
for quote enforced monogamy to remedy
the woes of men who don't get
their equal distribution of sex when it
comes to the political correctness
debate we've been exactly here before
the Alan bloom the author of the closing
of the American mind compared the
tyranny of feminism in academia to the
Khmer Rouge and he was writing at a time
when women accounted for 10 percent of
all college tenured faculty it's worth
looking back at what was considered
annoyingly outrageously politically
correct in the 1980s last time we had
this debate you know having to call or
not being able to call indigenous people
quote Indians or having to use
hyphenated terms at least in the United
States have terms like African Americans
you know adding women or people of color
to the Western Civ curriculum not making
gay jokes or using [ __ ] as an epithet
and I kind of get it right new concepts
new words sort of stick in your throat
the way we're used to talking and
thinking seem natural and normal you
know by definition and then the new
terms and new concepts that have social
utility stick and those that don't fall
away so if you go back to the 1970s myth
you know ms as an alternative to miss or
mrs. stuck around and women with a Y
didn't and I think that someday or I
hope that someday we'll look back and
marvel at the idea that gender-neutral
pronouns ever seemed like an existential
threat to anyone but I also don't think
it's clear that you know that might not
happen because if you look around the
world right now there are plenty of
places that have indeed dialed back
cosmopolitanism and reinstated
patriarchy and the name of staving off
chaos and they have seemed like terrible
places to live you know I come to you
from the United States which is
currently undergoing a monumental
attempt to rollback social progress in
the name of overcoming political
correctness and as someone who lives
there I assure you it feels nothing like
progress thank you
great start to the debate Michelle thank
you I'm now going to ask Jordan Peterson
to speak for the con team hello
so we should first decide what we're
talking about we're not talking about my
views of political correctness despite
what you might have inferred from the
last speakers comments this is how it
looks to me we essentially need
something approximating a low resolution
grand narrative to unite us and and we
need a narrative to unite us because
otherwise we don't have peace what's
playing out in the Universities and in
broader society right now is a debate
between two fundamental low resolution
narratives neither of which can be
completely accurate because they can't
encompass all the details obviously
human beings have an individual element
and a collective element a group element
let's say the question is what story
should be paramount and this is how it
looks to me in the West we have
reasonably functional reasonably free
remarkably productive stable hierarchies
that are open to consideration of the
dispossessed that hierarchies generally
create our societies are freer and
functioning more effectively than any
societies anywhere else in the world and
that and then any societies ever have
and as far as I'm concerned and I think
there's good reason to assume this it's
because the fundamental low resolution
grand narrative that we've oriented
ourselves around in the West is one of
the sovereignty of the individual and
it's predicated on the idea that all
things considered the best way for me to
interact with someone else is individual
to individual and to react to that
person as if they're both part of the
process because that's the right way of
thinking about it the psychological
process by which things we don't
understand can yet be explored and by
things that aren't properly organized in
our society can be yet set right the
reason we're valuable as individuals
both with regards to our rights and
responsibilities is because that's our
essential purpose and that's our
nobility and that's our function what's
happening as far as I'm concerned in the
universities in particular and spreading
very rapidly out into the broader world
including the corporate world much to
its
to what should be its chagrin is a
collectivist narrative and of course
there's some utility in a collectivist
narrative because we're all part of
groups in different ways but the
collectivist narrative that I regard as
politically correct is a pastiche of a
strange pastiche of post-modernism in
neo Marxism and it's fundamental claim
is that no you're not essentially an
individual you're essentially a member
of a group and that group might be your
ethnicity and it might be your sex and
it might be a race and it might be any
of the endless numbers of other
potential groups that you belong to
because you belong to many of them and
that you should be essentially
categorized along with those who are
like you on that dimension in that group
that's proposition number one
proposition number two is that the
proper way to view the world is as a
battleground between groups of different
power so you define the group's first
and then you assume that you you you
view the individual from the group
context you view the battle between
groups from the group context and you
view history itself as a consequence of
nothing but the power maneuvers between
different groups that eliminates any
consideration of the individual and at a
very fundamental level and also any idea
for example of free speech because if
you're collectivist at heart in this
manner there is no such thing as free
speech it isn't that it's debated by
those on the radical left and let's say
the rest of us so to speak it's that in
that formulation there's no such thing
as free speech because for an
individualist free speech is how you
make sense of the world in reorganize
Society in a proper manner but for the
radical left type collectivist that's
associated with this viewpoint of
political correctness when you speak all
you're doing is playing a power game on
behalf of your group and there's nothing
else that you can do because that's all
there is and not only is that all there
is in terms of who you are as an
individual now and how society should be
viewed it's also the fundamental
narrative of history for example it's
it's widely assumed in our universities
now that the best way to conceptualize
Western civilization is as an oppressive
male-dominated patriarchy and that the
best way to construe relationships
between men and women across the
centuries is one of oppression of women
by men
that's like well look no hierarchy is
without its tyranny that's a that's an
axiomatic truth people have recognized
that literally for thousands of years
and hierarchies do tend towards tyranny
and they tend towards the usurpation by
people with power but that only happens
when they become corrupt we have
mechanisms in our society to stop
hierarchies from becoming intolerably
corrupt and they actually work pretty
well and so and so I would also I would
also I would also point this out you
know don't be thinking that this is a
debate about whether empathy is useful
or not or that the people on the con
side of the argument are not empathetic
I know perfectly well as I'm sure mr.
Frey does that hierarchies tend to
produce situations where people stack up
at the bottom and that the dispossessed
in hierarchies need a political voice
which is the proper voice of the left by
the way the necessary voice of the left
but that is not the same as proclaiming
that the right level of analysis for our
grand unifying narrative is that all of
us are fundamentally to be identified by
the groups that we belong to and to
construe the entire world as the
battleground between different forms of
tyranny in consequence of that group
affiliation and to the degree that we
play out that narrative that won't be
hi this video has two components a
three-minute announcement of the
remaining venues of my American 12 rules
for life tour and the new Canadian
venues that will open up in July and
August followed by a lengthy discussion
with Ben Shapiro on the narrative
substrate of human commission derived
from his new Sunday YouTube video and
podcast so hi there I'm in Denver
Colorado today it's May 7th 2018 I'm
going to give the fourth talk of my
American 12 rules for life tour tonight
or maybe it's the fifth first one was
Toronto and Washington and Chicago then
Detroit now Denver so yes I guess that's
the fifth I'm announcing the remaining
venues today in the US where tickets are
still available and the dates and places
for my Canadian tour 10 Canadian cities
in July so there's tickets remaining to
ten venues in the United States on May
23rd Philadelphia on May 29th Houston on
June 8th Richmond on June 10th Charlotte
June 12th Nashville June 14th Louisville
June 15th Indianapolis June 16th
Milwaukee 25th Portland 27th Sacramento
and in between all that on Wednesday
that June the 5th will also be in Rick
javac in Iceland so tickets are
available for those and then I'm going
to be to her in Canada and July in
August the 19th in Toronto on the 20th

Edmonton in August on the 14th at Regina
and on August 15 in Saskatoon
Saskatchewan
he can find out more about that if you
go to Jordan B Peterson comm and look up
events that's Jordan B Peterson calm
under events also in this video is a
discussion that I recently did last week
in fact was just released with Ben
Shapiro as part of his new Sunday
podcast initiative and I think we had a
very good conversation and so the rest
of this video was taken up with the
conversation that I had with and I think
we got further on the issue of how human
perception and cognitive function is
nested inside a fundamental narrative
substrate and we related that to modern
findings neuro psychology related to
hemispheric function I think it was an
excellent discussion and so I'm very
happy to bring it to you there's some
ads in it because I took it directly
from Ben's video so anyway so that's the
tour Philadelphia Houston Richmond
Charlotte Nashville Louisville
Indianapolis Milwaukee Portland and
Sacramento and that's all in June and
May and then Rick G Vic in June as well
and then the Canada tour in July and
August Toronto Hamilton London Kitchener
Ottawa Vancouver Calgary Edmonton Regina
and Saskatoon and as I said you can find
out about that
Jordan B Peterson comm events thank you
very much and I hope that you can come
to one of the talks they seem to be
going really well so far we sold out a
very large number of them and the people
seem quite enthusiastic and I've been
able to get farther in my thinking than
I was in my book and each of the talks
is designed to illuminate a different
element of the let's say the 12 rules
and the topics that are associated with
that so thanks very much and I hope you
enjoyed the discussion with Ben Shapiro
there's lots of times in your life

excited to speak with Jordan Peterson
well as Jordan knows before the show we
talked for an hour before the show just
about interesting things we should have
caught on tape but now we're actually
gonna get a chance to do it live so here
is the Jordan's new book if you haven't
bought it yet everybody on planet has
bought this book I was walking through
the office today we didn't have a copy
in the office person the front desk had
a copier book you're sitting on her desk
sup that's the way this works twelve
rules for life an antidote to cast
fantastic book obviously topping all the
bestseller lists all over the world
Jordan thanks so much for joining the
show really appreciate it thanks for the
invitation well you know obviously your
your prominence has just blown up in the
last year and a half when we were
talking before the show about why that
is and why there are so many people who
suddenly are very angry about you I
notice there's an article in Politico
suggesting that young angry white males
you are now their their leader so
congratulations no you have said I want
to ask you about that why do you think
that number one your profiles become so
big of late and number two why do you
think it is that so many members of the
of the left are so angry about that why
are they characterizing people who
listen to you as angry and enraged young
white well we could we can look at the
characterization to begin with you know
because I think it speaks to the
pathology of the radical left instantly
they're absolutely incapable of viewing
the world
up through group identity terms you know
and so if someone comes out and
disagrees with them then they have to
characterize them by their fundamental
group attribute whatever that happens to
be maybe its gender because that's a
favorite or maybe it's race and so angry
white men young there we go sexist
ageist and racist all at once right
they're angry young white men well it
has to be that way if you're gonna be
the if you're gonna play the leftist
game because that's the only way that
you can look at the world and then if
you can't make your opponent
reprehensible in some manner and it's
strange that they would attempt to make
them reprehensible on the grounds of
race age and sex since that's precisely
what they stand against hypothetically
but if you can't make your enemy
reprehensible along some dimension then
you have to contend with them seriously
and so you know if I'm not an all right
fascist like Hitler you know or Milo you
know Alice which was how I was
characterized in Canada because the
radical leftist can't even get their
bloody insults straight he's like Hitler
or Milo innopolis it's like because
there's no difference between them right
no obvious difference it's just another
attempt to pillory as far as I can tell
and I think that it's it's dreadful I
really think it is there was an article
written in by the I believe the editor
of the New York Review of Books that was
just republished in The Globe and Mail
talking about the emergence of hyper
masculinity and how I was somehow
responsible without or contributing to
it like Mussolini and I read that and I
thought yeah like miscellany
and I thought okay so what are you doing
I see you're you're defining masculinity
or conflating masculinity and hyper
masculinity at the same time then your
virtue signaling by being against hyper
masculinity but really what you're
trying to do is bring down whatever it
is that's masculinity and what
masculinity is in in this frame is
something like competence and so it's
part of the radical leftists general war
on competence as well which I think is
one of the most pernicious elements of
the culture wars the dissolution of
hierarchies the the assumption that
every hierarchy has to be based on power
and served them the needs of your group
whatever that happens to be that there's
no such thing as
confidence and so and then the other
thing that's reprehensible about it
because that's not enough is that it's
just wrong
like there's I've got tens of thousands
of letters from people and people come
up to me all the time on the street I'll
give you an example this is a great
story this is really touching so I was
in LA about a month and a half ago and I
was downtown LA and downtown LA is kind
of rough and I was wandering around and
with my wife and this young guy pulled a
car up beside hopped out and he was kind
of a stylish looking 21 year old Latino
guy something like that it was all
excited he said he asked me who I was
and I told him and he you know that's
what he had presumed and so he was kind
of excited about that he said look I've
watched all your lectures and it's
really helped me and I've been
straightening out my life and trying to
get my room clean and he laughed about
that but you know developing some aims
and trying to tell the truth and and
look I've really fixed up my
relationship with my father and so then
he said wait wait just wait a minute and
I thought sure what sure so he went back
in the car and he got his farther out of
his car and he came over with his dad
like they had their arms around each
other and he said look we've really
improved our relationship and they were
both smiling away and you know that's
man if you're gonna target me for that
just go right ahead and as a real white
supremacist oh yeah yeah and it's
wherever I go now and this is one of the
things this is the thing that's so
wonderful about that all of this as far
as I'm concerned is that people come up
to me all the time and that's exactly
what they say they say look I was lost
aimless depressed nihilistic anxious
drug-addicted
alcoholic wasting my time masturbating
too much although they don't generally
use that particular example you know
loss essentially and and and hopeless in
some sense and I've been watching your
lectures and they've really helped and
I've really been putting my life
together and I've been trying to say
what I believe to be true and develop a
vision and it's really helped and like
and it's so overwhelming you know like
if I'm doing book signings after a talk
then there'll be a dozen people or more
who and these aren't like I'm only
talking to people for about 15 seconds
but you can have a very intense
conversation in 15 seconds and they'll
say look you know
like I was suicidal man like I was
really hanging on to the edge of the
earth by my fingernails
and I'm better and they have tears in
their eyes it's like it's amazing little
of that goes a long way well I think
that when I look at your eyes and look I
talk to people who love what you do I
mean every time I go on the road and I'm
speaking at a campus you're the number
one name that gets mentioned and people
would buy people who come to my lectures
and I think that the reason for that
that I've that I've seen is is really
twofold one is that one of the things
that you really talk a lot about is the
notion of self discipline and purpose in
your life and control and the idea that
you are in control of your
decision-making and your decision-making
matters that's one and the other
reserves you have you have a unique
capacity to say no to things and when
somebody says something to you that is
it illogical but popular then you have
the capacity to say no that's what
happen in that Kathy Newman interview
that then somebody was saying something
to you the made no sense and you just
said well no and then you just stood on
that now and when you stand on that no I
think it gives people a lot of courage
yeah well I mean the gender issue is
really an interesting one because one of
my professional domains of expertise is
individual differences I'm a personality
psychologist and so I know the gender
difference literature and it's it's a
very solid literature well first of all
it's very solid it has a 30-year history
once per psychologist got the
personality models down so that would be
the big five model all empirically
derived straight statistics right brute
force empiricism nobody had a
theoretical axe to grind with the big
five except to say maybe there are human
traits maybe they're encapsulated in
language we can use statistical
techniques to find out what they are
that was it that is the whole ideology
so very very neutral as far as
ideologies go five traits emerge okay
are there differences between the sexes
turns out there are all right they're
not massive although if you sum them
across all the traits you can separate
men and women with about 75 percent
accuracy so it's not trivial but you
have to sum across all the traits then
another question comes up well are those
differences socio-cultural or
biologically ok we can test that we'll
go around the world we'll look at
cultures will rank order them in terms
of the
gender equality of their sociological
policies we can do that with broad
agreement from the right and the left
then the hypothesis would be if gender
differences decrease among more
egalitarian societies then the gender
differences our socio-cultural or at
least more socio-cultural that's exactly
the opposite of what was found
repeatedly that's pseudoscience it's
like no that's mainstream psychology
those papers have thousands of citations
and right the average humanities paper
has zero citations right and then the
next most common one has one three
thousand that's an that's an
unbelievable classic and and here's the
other bit of proofs like you say well
how do you know that you can trust
someone's judgement about a fact the
fact emerges despite their ideological
presuppositions okay so it's well-known
that the social sciences and the
humanities have a have a left tilt and a
lot of that's temperamental and the tilt
has become more pronounced but as
Jonathan Hyde has pointed out there are
no conservatives among social
personality psychologists or none to
speak of yes very few vanishingly
feeling and if the field has a bias it
is definitely and indisputably a
left-wing bias okay so you have to fight
that if you're if you're a scientist
right even if you're a left-wing
scientist you have to fight that because
you want to get to the facts it was
these social scientists he generated the
data that suggested that the gender
differences not only were real but that
were bigger in egalitarian societies
they didn't do that to grind their
ideological axe because their
ideological presupposition was no no you
make the society you yell at Aryan men
and women get more the same it's like no
they get more different Oh booth isn't
that something and so then there's a
corollary there which is all right you
could still say and they're kind of
pushing in this direction in Scandinavia
boys and girls are different men and
women are different
it looks biological but because people
are malleable you could push the
socio-cultural structure harder and
harder to minimize the biological
differences okay well first of all maybe
and maybe not
you'd get a rebound and they'd get even
like the kids would rebel that could
easily happen but let's say okay you
could the problem with that is is that
if you seed that much power to the state
like you're basically giving the state
the right to socialize your kids rights
like you you really you really you
really want to do that I mean the people
in Israel couldn't do that with the
kabuto right it didn't work so people
aren't gonna give up their children to
the state and thank God for that well I
mean this is one of the big questions
that we were discussing earlier is that
we were talking about the polarization
in politics between right and left and
obviously you're you're a psychologist
you're a philosopher but you've been
dragged almost kicking and screaming
into this political sphere because
everything has been so politicized and
so when you say when you cite social
science statistics and they're
scientifically based you're called a
racist you're called the sexist you're
called the homophobe and exactly so so
why is it that so why do you think it is
that so many folks on the Left who
purport to be all about reason and
science and an objective fact are so
willing to throw those out the window
the minute that it becomes politically
inconvenient well because you imagine
that cognitive system so an
interpretation of the world has levels
there axiomatic levels some fundamental
presuppositions are more fundamental
than others and you could say well the
leftists historically maybe because of
their atheistic rationality are more on
the side of science than say the
fundamental isms of any sort but when
push comes to shove you find out how the
axioms are are nested there's deeper
axioms underneath that which is that all
hierarchies are based on power and all
power plays are based on group identity
tribal identity essentially and that the
entire history of the world is nothing
but a power play between between these
different identity groups it's like okay
well if the science indicates that some
of that's wrong then do you alter those
beliefs or do you alter the science and
the answer to that question is well it
depends on how you've hierarchically
arranged those if the science is at the
bottom then you alter your beliefs right
if it's the scientific facts or the
axiomatic
some structure then you then you alter
your beliefs if your beliefs are the
axiomatic sub structure then you alter
the science well we've seen how that
plays out and one of the things I've
tried to do so to speak is to diagnose
the axiomatic structure it's like okay
what's the what's the metaphysical
presumption structure of the radical
left well what it is is you're basically
your group your groups are basically
engaged in warfare right and the warfare
is arbitrary except insofar as it serves
your group okay I don't buy any of that
I think that's I think that's a route to
certain disaster I think it's a
degeneration into tribalism and that we
will seriously pay for it not only
because it returns us to tribalism and
warren farrell
is the author of books published in 17
languages
they include two award-winning
international bestsellers why men are
the way they are plus the myth of male
power warren has been chosen by the
financial times as one of the world's
top 100 thought leaders
he is currently the chair of the
commission to create a white house
council on boys and men he's the only
man in the u.s to have been elected
three times to the board of the national
organization for women now in new york
city
dr farrell has appeared repeatedly on
oprah today and good morning america and
has been the subject of features on 2020
in forbes the wall street journal people
parade and the new york times
his co-author of his newest book is dr
john gray the author of men are from
mars women are from venus
once again this is the book we're going
to talk not only about
the book today the new one the boy
crisis but also about dr farrell's
career and his goals and his aims and
all of that and so i'd like to introduce
everyone to dr warren farrell and ask
him to tell us what he's up to and why
well i guess what i'm up to is sort of
the evolution of maybe
all that time since 1969 and
when the women's movement surfaced i was
very interested in it and felt that
women really needed to be able to be
equally respected and enter the
workplace and have options open and
i was upset that women were not playing
sports to the degree that i felt that
was creating the benefits to them of
sports and so i started articulating
this and started talking to my
doctoral dissertation advisors about
doing this and their first reaction was
warren the women's movement is just a
fad and i said i don't think so i think
this is the beginning of the change of
of gender roles from both men and for
women and so i
talked with them about that eventually
convinced them that i could change my
dissertation
and that led me to being
seen by now as someone who was a man who
was receptive at a time that the
feminist movement was getting a lot of
um accusations of being man-haters and
so i think i served the purpose of
here's a who here's a man a real-life
flesh man who advocates but we're
advocating here um get up and say what
we're
saying it's going to be harder to call
you a manager and so um the i i started
doing that and then ended up speaking
all around the world on women's issues
and the value of women being secure
enough and competent enough to
be able to share the breadwinning
burdens that men handle um and that was
uh my focus for until the mid 70s and in
the mid 70s i began to see that the
feminist movement um had made a great
deal of progress and
was everyone was sort of getting on
board who was in at least in the sort of
um
middle class above and educated and so
um that was
but it was also a huge number of
divorces occurring and so i began to say
it's important for the children to have
both parents after divorce and
betty friedan and gloria steinem and a
woman named karen de crow agreed with me
but uh now the board i was on the board
of now at that time had gotten elected
as a result of my um advocacy to the
board of now and my fellow um and you
know female
co-workers on the board of now said we
we're at a dilemma here and the dilemma
is that the women are writing us saying
they're going to withdraw from now if
they don't have the option to determine
what happens with the children after
divorce um and uh
we don't want to lose now membership
because it's not only important for
family purposes but for all the other
agendas we have and so i said well the
important thing is not women's rights or
men's rights the important thing is
knowing what's best for the children and
they said yes warren great theory but we
really need to focus on empowering women
and on a broad spectrum and so they
ended up all voting in terms of giving
women the option to be fully involved
with the children or not depending on
under the guise that women know the best
know the children the best and therefore
they know what's best for the children
and so now and i began to have a
significant amount of tension over that
point and betty friedan and gloria
steinem didn't weigh in they weren't on
the board of now and then all the other
boards of nails
around the country began to go the same
way that the new york city now went and
so that led to my um
disengagement um and also i started
forming hundreds of men's groups
one of which i think you know was joined
by john lennon and um and that was uh
that had a big impact on both the people
in the groups and i began to see what
men's pain was and so i began to
articulate men's pain in as well as
women's pain in my um in my
presentations and when i was only
articulating women's pain and women's
challenges i would always almost always
get standing ovations and maybe an
average of three
invitations for a new speaking
engagement and that was helping me live
financially very well um but then when i
started to integrate the perspectives
and feelings of men from the men's
groups there was a lot of i didn't see
those standing ovations why not why not
what fights
for new speaking engagements went from
three to two to one and then eventually
to zero well it seems it seems
self-evident in some sense that if
you're articulating
truthfully and carefully
what would be good for either sex
in some sense you have to be
articulating what would be good for both
i mean unless you view the the
battleground
unless you view reality as a
battleground between the sexes and as
and as a zero-sum game we can't have an
intelligent conversation about what's
good for women or what's good for men we
have to have a conversation about what's
good for men and men and women and women
and men and women
and so why do you think what was your
sense
of why it was when you started to raise
these other issues that you were
that you were immediate immediately
unpopular two questions why do you think
that made you unpopular and
why is it that you so early cottoned on
to the fact that there was something
going on that wasn't exactly
kosher in relationship to
now's push for for
for a particular kind of family
structure and a particular view of
women's rights
yes yeah i i think what happened for me
was um
i i just when i started focusing on what
was best for children and then i began
to
we only had minimal amount of research
up for that at that point in time this
is your early 70s and but we had enough
for me to make a case to the board and
when i saw the resistance the degree to
which um there's there was two things
happening one is we
we don't want to lose our power base we
don't ever want to have a woman say
whatever option she wants should be
closed to her and so i began to see that
the women's movement was caring more
about women than they were caring about
the children that was the first
disillusionment that i had okay so your
first your first ethical point in some
sense is that when you're speaking about
families and you have to balance the
rights and responsibilities of men women
and children that it makes sense to you
to put children's well-being first and
foremost and then to to
place men and women as individuals say
or perhaps even as a couple below that
yes exactly what i was saying was that
freedom of choice is wonderful but when
you make the freedom of choice to have a
child
you then start prioritizing the needs of
the child you made but you knew that
those needs were going to be the child's
needs first
when you made that free choice so it
wasn't like you were coerced into the
into or pressured into making that
choice you made the free choice to have
a child that incorporates the need to
put the child's perspectives before
yours that's part of your free choice
right so it's basically the freedom
there is the freedom to take on a
certain kind of relatively permanent
responsibility and then to abide by that
come hell or high water essentially into
the future
that the children should not respect the
parents needs because part of what i
talked about in the boy crisis is that
uh ain't nobody happy you know um that
everybody has to be happy in a family
and that and that part of choosing a
child to be responsible is to choosing
the child not just to have its needs met
but to also
care about what whether what their moms
or dad's needs are being met as well and
that has to be very primary and primal
and introduced early um but that the uh
and then secondly um i i also felt
and betty ferdan felt this way also that
the women's movement would never go as
far as it could go unless the unless men
were equally involved and proud of being
involved in the fathering role because a
woman who has to take on the entire
response a woman who wants to break
glass ceilings and go as far as she can
but also wants children can't do that
all if the man is working full-time and
she's working full-time either the
children get neglected or um you know or
something something has to go and so
women will often say to me you know i
want to be a habitable woman and i say
you can be a habit all woman revere find
a man who wants to be home full-time
with the children and let's reshape
society so we're saying that that men
are not only worrier warriors that we
that we praise and call heroes when they
go to war and they die for us but
they're also warriors if they choose if
you if you choose a man who wants to be
fully involved with the child let's
honor him and respect him because we
know that the the social bribes that we
gave men to die allowed men to be
willing to sacrifice their lives in
exchange for being called hero uh well
if we if we reframe
being a father as being a different type
of hero men will follow because men
basically go wherever the praise goes
okay okay so in the 70s so you started
to put forward the case for children and
to some degree as well simultaneously
the case for fathers and you received a
fair bit of resistance as a consequence
of that and it sounds like
the way you're setting up the argument
is that the conflict
what was the conflict though was it that
the the women who
were being appealed to by now wanted
untrammeled freedom of choice for them
under all circumstances
the reason i'm asking is because if you
have children obviously half the
children you have are female and you'd
assume that if it was a matter of of
women's opening up what would be best
for women in any kind of medium to
long-term manner that the concerns about
daughters would be perhaps even if it
isn't concerns about sons it would be
concerns about daughters that would
emerge as paramount even over the
concerns of the mother so so what is it
that was i still don't exactly get why
it was that you weren't being successful
because it it doesn't make sense
because the pri
the priority there was two things
happening simultaneously one was such a
strong emphasis on freedom and the
freedom manifested in two areas one is
in the area of divorce in divorce the
women were often saying i i don't like
my husband i want to start a new life i
want to be able to move out of state if
i wish to to get a job that i want or my
new husband my new husband or boyfriend
has a has a wants to move out of state
and so i want to be able to take my
children or child with me um because and
and and i know what's best for my child
which would be like the you know medical
community saying we don't want women to
be participating in the medical
community because we know what's best
for for the patient and not not
not that women might have a separate um
contribution to make on the other hand
there was the
that there was women who wanted to have
the freedom to be able to have children
without being married um and so 53 of
women under 30 today who have children
in the united states have children
without being married and the belief was
again that women knew what was best for
the children so
we could they they could take this on if
they wanted to and if they couldn't find
a man that they really wanted that they
could raise the child by themselves or
the children by themselves okay so so
part of it was actually driven by
questioning the necessity of the nuclear
family as the smallest viable unit
and part of that
hey that's correct but and b
the feminist community started um when
when i would go to feminist rallies and
so on uh there would be many books about
you know lenin and the the
nuclear family being the the
patriarchal
that were oppressing women and so there
so i think the feminist the feminist
movement grew out of two huge iterations
one was the civil rights movement where
there was an oppressor and an oppressed
then there was the um the the
the movement of um
not just civil rights but um
after the fem after the civil rights
movement came the
the
marxism and the belief that there were
oppressors and oppressed in among
marxists and a lot of the feminist
movement the early feminist movement was
very we had groups like red stockings
and many other groups like that that
were socialist worker party type
feminists that very much believed in
marxism and they had the dichotomy of
oppressor versus oppressed so when it
came to men men because we earned more
we because our biological not our
biological but our socialized and
biological responsibility was to earn
the money and do that type of nature of
providing
the feminist movement looked at the fact
that we earned more money once we had
children and so therefore we must be the
oppressor like those
like the bourgeoisie of marxism and
women must be the oppressed so you have
two things happening simultaneously this
belief that the oppressors are wanting
to be equally involved with the children
and then secondly men having no idea
why they had value
third men who the very few men that did
study the value of being a father and
how important it was to children
um didn't speak up about it and women
can't hear what men don't say so
we had this world then where women were
sharing the burden of about breadwinning
but no one was even interested in asking
the question about whether men could
share the burden from women of of of
earning of providing equally for the
family and and women weren't even
interested in that because they were so
focused on their freedom and saw men as
the oppressor and so there was no space
to
articulate the value of fathers and men
in the family okay so well you know your
terminology is interesting too because
you're attributing the
the desire of the women who were pushing
against what you were saying say
um you're attributing that to a desire
to freedom but it seems to me that you
could easily use irresponsibility as a
terminology there you know because
free well freedom without concern for
the medium to long-term consequences of
your actions especially when you're
bringing in
when you're dealing with minors when
you're dealing with children that's not
freedom that's irresponsibility
that is absolutely irresponsibility and
that is where we as a society have
failed to come in and say
um you know first of all whenever either
sex wins that is a woman wins custody
for example whenever either sex wins
both sexes lose and it's worse than that
whether whenever either sex wins both
sexes lose and in the case of family the
children lose enormously
and we also need to sort of understand
exactly what is it that that that lead
to children doing so much better when
they have fathers involved i was i
started researching that and they ended
up as you know with the boy crisis ended
up with more than 70 different ways that
when children have
their father involved in it about an
equal way
that they do so much better than well it
would be a lovely thing if you could
detail out some of that now and then
we'll go back to the
the political ideological story here but
but see one of the things that's
happened in ontario recently is that
we've our our government has introduced
legislation that is predicated on on the
idea that all families are equal
and the
the idea behind that you could argue is
laudable
i i wouldn't argue that but you could
argue it
that
you know people have a variety of ways
of solving the problem of having
children and that there's a variety of
viable solutions to that problem and
that no one family
organizational type should be
privileged above the others i mean i
suppose with the exception of
multi-partner marriages which we we
still
don't approve of let's say
the problem with that as far as i can
tell is that it does appear from the
research that the nuclear family is this
my smallest viable unit which is not to
say that
there aren't single mothers or single
fathers who do an admirable job under
trying conditions but part of the
problem this is a deep problem is that
whenever you
whenever you posit something as a value
so you might say well we want intact
families mother and father that's that
that's the value we're heading for
because that seems to be best for the
children then you produce a rank order
of accordance with that and the people
who aren't in accordance with that value
you can easily make a case that they're
being discriminated against and we're in
a situation in our society now where
even if the discrimination occurs let's
say because of the pursuit of an
admirable value it's regarded as
prejudicial and i think that's fed by
that underlying hypothesis that was
anti-nuclear family that
any sort of hierarchical structure is
hello
so you've lined up a very large number
of questions today so a couple of things
first of all I have a number of YouTube
videos and podcasts lined up one with
Steven Pinker author of enlightenment
now one with Warren Farrell who wrote a
very interesting book called the boy
crisis and also a previous book called
white men earn more one with an animator
named Nina Paley one with a young guy
named Charlie Kirk who has organized a
large number of campus youth groups more
on the conservative end of things and
associated with free will so all those
will be coming out in the next month and
a half I would say and so thank you for
your continued support it makes all of
this possible and I'm also going on tour
I presume some of you know that if you
go to Jordan B Peterson calm and you
look up events you can see where it's
about 40 cities listed so far most of
them are in the US and a couple in
Europe Iceland the UK but we're
announcing we're going to announce ten
Canadian cities here in the next week as
well so that's all what's going to be
happening with me in the next two months
so I'll be on the road with my wife that
whole time sometimes in a plane you know
just commercial travel sometimes in a
Motorhome depending on where we're going
and how so I'm looking forward to seeing
you if you come out to the events I've
been enjoying them quite a bit it's good
to be able to talk to so many people so
twelve rules for life has sold about a
million copies now so that's really
quite something and I think we've sold
foreign rights in 43 countries so it'll
come out in not quite that many
languages but just about over the next
year and
something like that so all right so you
let's get at it here hopefully I could
warm up and get my brain going and and
answer some questions the first one 343
people have voted this one up could you
please discuss freewill and sam Harris's
and others ideas of its non-existence
well that's a good complicated question
to kick things off so I want to tell you
a little bit about how to conceptualize
freewill I think first because it's
obvious that we don't have infinite
freewill our our choice our choices are
constrained in all sorts of ways and I
think part of the reason that there's a
continual discussion about freewill in
the philosophical in the philosophical
literature is because just
conceptualizing the issue properly is
extraordinarily difficult so I like to
think about it at least in part the way
that you think about a game you know if
you're playing a game obviously the game
has rules so if it's a chess game or a
basketball game then there are things
that you can do and things that you
can't do and but and so it's a it's a
it's a closed world in some sense but
the fact that there are things you can't
do when you play a game also seem to
open up a universe of possibilities for
things that you can do so chess
obviously constrains you to a board and
to a certain number of men and to a
certain pattern of rules but the strange
thing is is that when you put in those
rules because rules sound like limits
they sound always like things you can't
do but when you set up a constrained
world like that and you lay out a system
of rules what you do is open up an
infinity of a near infinity of
possibilities same with music you know
music has rules obviously and if you
follow the rules then you can make an
infinite variety of music and so and so
there's a there's a very interesting
dynamic that's hard to understand
between constraint and possibility and
there's a deep idea that's associated
with that that I read in some Jewish
commentary on the biblical stories that
I I read a long time ago talking about
the relationship between God and man and
the idea was
God imagine a being with the classical
attributes of God omniscience
omnipotence and omnipresence all-seeing
all-knowing and all-powerful what is a
being like that lack and obviously the
answer is nothing right because by
definition those three traits provide
for absence of limitation but then
that's exactly what's lacking is
limitation and there's some strange
connection between limitation and and I
was saying say limitation that it's rule
governed as I mentioned before and the
opening up of possibility so that isn't
necessarily the case that now determine
determinism and limitation aren't
exactly the same thing but they're
analogous and they need to be discussed
together okay so though so that's the
first thing is that or whatever our free
choice is it isn't limited it's or it's
limited it's it's deeply limited now
here's another thing if I take my arm
and I go like this you see I'll do that
again now you see there's a movement
like that and then my hand stopped just
before my my other hand now it takes a
certain amount of time for the neural
messages to go from my brain to my arm
and back and the time it takes my hand
to go like this and stop is actually
shorter than the time it takes a message
to get to my brain and back so what that
means is that when I when I plan this
movement which is called a ballistic
movement it's called a ballistic
movement because it's like a bullet once
you let it go it's gone there's no
calling it back I've actually organized
the neurological and muscular sequences
that enable that action before it's
implemented I set all that up and then
it's released and the whole thing
cascades and so once the action has been
released let's say then I don't really
have any free will because I can't stop
it now so so you think about that it
looks like there's a temporal gradient
with regards to free will is that as you
look out into the future may perhaps the
farther out you look into the future
the farther down the road let's say the
more free your choices are but the
closer they get to implementation the
more they become
Mystic governed by standard cause of
processes and there's some transition
point where they change from being what
we would describe as choice that we
haven't got to free choice yet but at
least a choice there's some transition
point between that and ballistic
movement here's another way of thinking
about it like we know for example that
people who are expert at playing the
piano look ahead of where they're
playing and and they're doing the same
thing they're watching the notes they're
seeing where they're going but and then
they're disinhibited the automated
structures that enable them to play what
they've practiced so thoroughly they're
disinhibited those structures and then
they go automatically and then what
happens if you make a mistake is that
consciousness notes the error and then
unpacks the motor sequences that have
been practiced and then yuri practice
them and sequence them again until they
become automatic and deterministic so
there's choice in that you're reading
ahead but there's no choice in that once
you've read ahead and disinhibited the
actions then they run ballistically and
then you can think about the same thing
that's happening when you're driving in
a car you don't look right in front of
you when you're driving a car because
whatever is right in front of you if
you're going 40 miles an hour or
whatever you've already run over you
look a quarter of a mile down the road
and that gives you the opportunity to
see what's coming and to set up a
sequence of increasingly automated
movements that culminate in whatever it
is that you're doing while you're
driving and so there's a gradation from
choice to determinism a temporal
gradation and and I don't often see that
addressed when people talk about
freewill now Sam's issue is freewill is
that if you get someone to do something
like lift their finger and you and you
scan their brains using a variety of
techniques while they're doing that what
you'll see is that there's an action
potential that Emer and you ask them to
voluntarily move their finger so they're
doing it let's say by free choice
there's an action potential that you can
read that you can read off the brain
that occurs before the person either
moves their finger or let's say decides
to move their finger and that occurs
quite a bit before the feeling of
volunteer
or that voluntary act and so that's been
read by Benjamin Libet who did the
experiments as indication that even the
feeling of voluntary choice is
determined but I don't think that that's
a very useful way of addressing the
issue because the the issue of when you
lift your finger in up again is it
requires pre-programming to dis inhibit
like you know how to do this right you
don't have to learn to do that so you
have a little automated circuit that
does this sort of thing all these finger
movements and everything you can see
babies practicing them and they develop
automated circuitry that tends to be
posterior left hemisphere in order to
run those those automated processes out
and what you're basically doing when you
decide to do something that's a routine
that you've already practiced or made
out of subroutines that you've already
practiced is disinhibited them and the
the degree to which you might regard
that as free exactly is unclear as are
the temporal limitations so I don't
think that libbets experiments
demonstrate conclusively that there's no
such thing as free will even though
there are action potentials that
indicate that there is brain activity
signaling even the onset of a voluntary
choice voluntary choice early now
another thing that we might look at in
relationship to that is yeah so we can
look at it phenomenologically and we
could also look at it in in in
relationship to how people treat one
another so phenomenologically it seems
clear that we have free choice and it
isn't obvious to me why we have
consciousness if free choice isn't real
because consciousness looks to me like a
mechanism that deals with potential
before it's transformed into actuality
let's say and and I think consciousness
is also they the Faculty so to speak or
a manifestation of the faculty that
enables us to pre-program deterministic
actions so again let's think about
someone playing the piano they're
practicing you know after you repeat and
you repeat your finger movements if
you're playing the piano any complex
motor skill is like that you have to
repeat it and repeat it repeat it and
repeat it and you're using consciousness
to program it to sequence the motor move
limits and to pay attention to them that
all seems voluntary and it involves the
activation of a tremendous amount of
your brain because if you're doing
something new a lot of your brain is
activated and then as you practice it
the amount of brain that's activated
decreases it shifts from right to left
and then it shifts from frontal to
posterior and a smaller and smaller area
so what's happening is that
consciousness is creating little
machines in the back of your head that
do things in an automated manner and the
the the voluntas 'no Sapir and feels
that would be the phenomenological end
as if it's doing that voluntarily and it
is associated with a different pattern
of brain activity and so okay so there's
that there's the phenomenological
reality of voluntary choice and effort
as well because conscious programming of
that sort is also effortful it doesn't
seem to run deterministically like a
clock does and then finally there's also
and I don't know what you think about
this with regards to evidence but what
constitutes evidence is not always that
easy to determine even in the scientific
domain so emeriti think about how we
think about ourselves and other people
and how we treat ourselves and other
people you could imagine that you're
like a clock running down and that's
like a deterministic model but people
aren't clocks were dissipative
structures a clock is something that
runs downhill but human beings you can
look up dissipative structure I think
that was an idea that was first
formulated by the physicist Schrodinger
we were we're not we're not clocks by
any stretch of the imagination and we
take energy in and we disperse energy
and and we were anti-entropic in in a
temporary sense so that makes us and and
so and life is as well shorting a wrote
about that in a book called what is life
and we don't what we seem to do this is
how it looks to me we don't content with
the present and we're not driven by the
past instead what we see in front of us
is a
landscape of possibility and in my
Wilder moments I think that's associated
with the physical idea of multiple
universes but that's in my Wilder
moments it's just a speculation and so
what we see in front of us is a an array
of potential universes and those are the
universes that we could bring about as a
consequence of our actions and it and we
make choices to the right or the left
there's a lot of mythological
speculation about that sort of idea - in
an ethical sense because we decide what
sort of reality that we want to bring
into being and so we encounter potential
like God did at the beginning of time
when he made order out of chaos chaos is
this chaotic potential we confront
chaotic potential with our consciousness
and we cast that into reality and that
now then you think well is that really
the case well that's hard to say because
there are limits to our knowledge about
consciousness and about reality but if
you treat yourself like you're a free
moral agent with choice and that you can
determine the course of your life then
you seem to get along better with
yourself and to be less anxious and to
be more productive and if you treat
other people like that that they're free
agents that are making voluntary choices
about how reality is going to come into
being and you reward them when they do
it properly and you punish them or
otherwise discipline them when they
don't when they do it badly then your
relationships with them seem to work and
then if we predicate our society on the
presupposition that each individual
human being is capable of doing just
that
then we seem to have extremely
functional societies and so and this is
something that sam harris has been taken
to task for many times is if you
dispense with the idea of freewill how
is it you organize your relationship to
yourself your interactions with your
family and your relationships with the
broader social community it's a very
complicated issue so I believe strongly
that we have freewill that were
responsible for our choices those
choices are constrained in many many
ways I think there's a gradient of
freewill from free out into the future
to increasingly constrained as the press
manifests itself to deterministic in the
moment when with in the moment of action
we and that we might think that we
entered the realm of deterministic
causality at the moment of action
something like that that's how it looks
to me so well so at this rate we're
gonna answer about five questions so
that but that was a very very hard one
so anyways I hope that's helpful
Maelstrom who is apparently chaos given
the name asked me am i chaos or am i
order well that's a good question I
would say a lot of the time I'm chaos
but I do everything I can to put things
in order but I'm going to answer that in
the deeper way I would say because first
of all everything and everyone is chaos
and order at the same time and I don't
mean that in a trait sense I mean it in
a technical sense which is order
technically speaking in my way of
viewing the world is order is that
domain you inhabit when what you're
doing produces the results that you want
to have happen that's a pragmatic
perspective from from a philosophical
perspective it's derived at least in
part or is analogous to the pragmatism
of people like CS purse and William
James the the American American
pragmatists and there's a great book on
all that if you're interested called the
metaphysical Club so order is where you
are when what you're doing is producing
the results that you intended and that
validates what you're doing by the way
that's that's a pragmatic form of truth
your theory is accurate when if you
enact it then the results that you
intend emerge that's the definition of
truth from a pragmatic perspective it's
a very powerful definition and it's very
much associated with the Darwinian
notion of truth so that's worth that's
worth looking into now obviously there
are times when you implement a plan and
a world conception that goes along with
that plan and what you wanted didn't
happen and so then the domain of chaos
comes up the domain of the unpredictable
and unexpected and you have to contend
with it and sometimes when you are
acting you do perverse things
and things that that surprise you and
then things don't work out well for you
or or maybe you get a surprise and maybe
sometimes that might even be positive
and that's because the chaos within you
has manifested itself and you've done
something that exceeds the bounds of
your understanding and you know that can
happen to people so badly that they
develop post-traumatic stress
post-traumatic stress disorder sometimes
soldiers especially naive young soldiers
will go on a battlefield and watch
themselves do something they can't
imagine they're capable of doing and
then they have permanent post-traumatic
stress disorder so there's a chaos
within that can manifest itself that can
disrupt whatever order you are and you
know that minor ways because everybody's
always running around doing things that
aren't good for them that they know they
shouldn't do and that they can't control
and so there's a chaotic and an orderly
aspect to everything to the individual
to the family to the social world to the
natural world it's chaos and order at
every level of analysis simultaneously
which is why the Daoists think of the
world is made out of yin and yang which
is essentially analogous to the idea of
order and chaos and now but then there's
another element too so your order and
your chaos and the place that you live
the environment is order and chaos as
well but you're also the process that
mediates between the two and what that
means is you're the force that confronts
chaos and casts it into order we talked
about that in the free will discussion
that's the basis for the dragon myth or
at least part of it the hero myth you're
the force that confronts chaos and
transforms it into habitable order and
there's an idea that if you do that
using truthful speech it's probably the
deepest idea in the Bible if you
confront chaos and the unknown using
truthful speech then the order that you
produce is good so that also means that
your chaos and order and the process
that intermediates between them and
that's really the basis of the hero myth
so part of that is the hero story and
the dragon myth go out confront the
dragon get the gold bring it back share
it with the community and the dragon is
a representation of that which dwells
beyond the confines of the safe and
habitable space right it's an image of a
predator

without further ado please join me in
welcoming dr. Jordan Peterson tilapia
so the way this is going to work is that
I'm going to have a conversation with
dr. Peterson for 90 minutes and then
there is going to be a 90 minute Q&A
this event is being video recorded and
will be published online for
non-commercial non advertising purposes
during the Q&A session when you were
handed a microphone please speak
directly into it our viewers on YouTube
will appreciate it
and finally I am a moderator between
professor Peterson and the audience but
also a biased participant in this
conversation okay well it's a relief
that's all over okay so I thought we
would start things off with this I
assume that many in the audience are
curious but relatively unfamiliar with
you or have heard a lot about you
without ever reading or listening to you
so I thought we might start with you
introducing yourself to the audience and
maybe telling them some of the main
things that you think they might be
interested in knowing about you well I
guess the most relevant detail is that I
spent about 15 years writing this and I
worked on it about three hours a day
every day during that period of time and
at at the same time I was finishing off
my doctorate and I started lecturing at
Harvard but I was doing that continually
and thinking about it continually and
reading the material that I needed to
read in order to write the book
continually as well and I didn't realize
until more recently that what I was
doing was at the heart of the postmodern
conundrum I would say I was very much
obsessed by the events of the Cold War
for reasons I don't exactly understand I
had a lot of dreams about nuclear
annihilation for years on end
I mean it wasn't that uncommon to be
obsessed by that when I grew up I mean
because it was a preoccupation of
everyone who was my age I suppose there
there were lots of years probably
between 1962 I would say probably in
1985 where people were pretty convinced
that the probability of a nuclear war
was high much higher now than people
considered now and I was curious about
this I was curious about why everyone
wasn't obsessed about this all the time
first of all because it seemed like the
fundamental issue that two armed camps
were pointing something in excess of
25,000 hydrogen bombs each at each other
I couldn't understand how anybody could
concentrate on anything other than that
since it seems so utterly insane and I
was curious what was going on exactly
was this one leaked the explanation was
that there's a very large number of ways
that human beings could organize
themselves in society like a large
number of games that we could
hypothetically play and they're all
equally arbitrary in an in an equally
arbitrary universe and that the
Communists had decided to play one kind
of game and the West and the Western
free-market Democratic types have had
decided to play another game and it was
all arbitrary in some sense and so
that's what I was trying to figure out
was what the hell was going on with this
conflict and was it merely a battle
between two hypothetically equally valid
interpretations of the world drawn from
a set of extraordinary large potential
interpretations which I think would be
essentially a postmodernist take on it
and I think I went into the problem
neutrally in that I didn't think I knew
what the answer was you know so so lots
of times when you talk to people who
think or wouldn't you talk to people who
write they have an idea and it's right
and then they write whatever they're
writing to justify the idea that's how
they look at it but it's not a good way
to write a good way to write and think
is to have a problem
and then try to solve it right to
actually solve it not to demonstrate
that you're a priori commitment is true
and you know one of the signs I would
say that my a priori commitments weren't
the purpose for the writing was that I
walked away from that 15-year project
with a view of the world that was
completely different than the view that
I had going in and learned all sorts of
things especially about the role of
narrative and and religious thinking in
life that I had no idea was possible
when I started and a lot of that was a
consequence of reading the great people
who I read deeply you know I read well
all the great works of Friedrich
Nietzsche and the great works of
Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and most of us
collected works everything that had been
published up to that point and a very
large swath of the relevant clinical
literature the great clinicians of the
20th century and a huge stack of
neuroscience and etc etc because I was
reading constantly during this time and
I realized some things that I think are
true the Communists were wrong they
weren't and not just a little bit wrong
and not wrong in some arbitrary way they
were playing a game that human beings
cannot play without descending into a
murderous catastrophe and there's
something about what we've done in the
West that's correct
and I it's hearts complicated because
our our cognitive structures that's one
way of thinking about it or our
socio-political arrangements they're
actually they actually parallel one
another in an important way aren't are
grounded in a you know strange set of
axioms and the axioms aren't rational
precisely it's more like their narrative
their narrative axioms their stories and
the story of the West is that the
individual is sovereign over the group
and that that's the solution to
tribalism and I think that's the correct
solution now what that means
metaphysically because it's it's also
embedded in our religious doctrines
right because
especially in Christianity although not
exclusively to Christianity the
individual is sovereign the suffering
individual is sovereign and there's
something about that that's true at
least psychologically and I don't know
what that might mean metaphysically
because who the hell knows what anything
means metaphysically right I mean your
your knowledge runs out at some point
anyways I worked all these ideas out and
then I taught for a long time courses
that were based on the ideas and the
courses were very impactful I would say
they had the same impact on the people
that I was teaching as walking through
the material had on me and well it was
out of that that all of this political
controversy arose I mean I was never
focused on political controversy even
though I'm interested in politics and I
thought it many points in my life about
a political career I always put it aside
for a psychological and philosophical
career I would say and but but things
started to shift badly in Canada over
the last five years and our government
dared to implement legislation that
compelled speech and one of the things
that I had learned when I was doing all
this background investigation was that
there isn't a higher value than free
speech it isn't free speech it's not the
right way of thinking about it because
it's free thought and even that's not
the right way of thinking about it
because thought is the precursor to
action and life so there's no difference
between free speech and free life and I
was just not willing to put up with
restrictions on my free life and so I
made some videos pointing out the
pathology of this doctrine and the fact
that the government had radically
overreached its its appropriate limits
and well then you know well and maybe
you don't know but I've been enveloped
in continual scandal since for 18 months
as a consequence which to me as a
clinician indicates that I got my damn
diagnosis right right it's not about
pronouns it's about something
deeper than that and I stand by that I
believe that it's the case and I don't
think that we would all be here tonight
if that wasn't the situation so so I
wanted my first or my next question to
be about Lafayette and so I thought I
would read a couple of Facebook posts
that certain students who are critical
of you read in the lead-up to this event
and just ask you to respond to them okay
so this is a student writing Lafayette
College I'm utterly disappointed that
you're allowing this to take place on
our campus
I thought we went through this last
semester with roaming Millenial inviting
hateful speakers who make wildly
unsubstantiated claims is not going to
fly with the student body I get it
the mill series events are private and
not endorsed by the college but you
absolutely have the power to make a
statement on this the fact that you're
not is an embarrassment to our community
if you believe this man is a legitimate
source of knowledge because he has a
degree in clinical psychology feel free
to ask our psychology department faculty
and Counseling Center staff about the
validity of his claims I'm certain they
would not endorse this speaker do better
in all caps for those of you unfamiliar
Jordan Peterson is known for denouncing
the me2 movement claiming that women are
in no way marginalized in the West
arguing against the existence of
gender-neutral pronouns arguing against
gun control in the US and claiming that
identity politics and social justice
movements are part of a devious Marxist
agenda and then another student
responded and this is briefer College
conservatives know that if they bring in
a speaker who was willing to blatantly
insult a portion of the audience and the
libs get angry enough about this for
good reason then they may get an op-ed
written about them in the New York Times
as a result there are a whole group of
hacks like Milo and Peterson who get
famous and invited purely for their
promise to misgender trans students and
advocate provocative but ultimately
toothless arguments about social
Darwinist race theory what I'm saying is
that you have every right to be
pissed Jordan Peterson is a harmful
 but know that but know that you
being pissed is also a hundred percent
at the point of why he was invited he's
not a conservative he's just a guy who's
mildly racist enough to offend College
liberals and therefore secure wins for
the cultural right comparatively mild
stuff
it's the chattering buzz of
ideologically possessed demons so
there's nothing in it that's that's not
entirely predictable that's that's one
of the things you know you notice when
you're talking to people if you if you
want to find out whether the person is
there or the ideology is there you
listen to see if you're hearing anything
that someone else of the same
ideological mindset couldn't have told
you you know like I've had thousands of
conversations with people because I've
spent 20 years as a clinical
psychologist and one of the things I've
learned about people is that they're
unbelievably interesting if you get
someone to sit down and you move past
the superficial which you can actually
do quite rapidly they'll tell you all
sorts of things that only they know that
are unbelievably enlightening about
their own peculiar problems about the
way they look at the world about their
their idiosyncratic familial dynamics
like just fascinating personal stuff
it's the stuff of great novels you know
and just and this is ordinary people I
don't really think there is an ordinary
person exactly there the facade of
ordinariness but behind that people are
very rarely ordinary and so they're the
conversations are almost instantaneously
fascinating and one of the one of the
guidelines that I used in my clinical
practice constantly was like I had this
sense I probably learned this mostly
from Carl Rogers was that if the
conversation wasn't really interesting
then we weren't doing anything that was
therapeutically useful but the
interesting all of the interesting
elements of it were were very very
personal and so to replace this and I
learned this mostly from sold from
Alexander Solzhenitsyn in his detailed
analysis of what
would call ideological possession I
talked to people he talked about people
he met in the gulag camps who were under
the sway of of rigid communist orthodoxy
and noted very clearly that it was like
there was a crank in some sense on the
side of their head and you could just
crank the crank and out would come the
ideological dogma and it's all entirely
predictable and people who are in a
situation like that don't understand
that they're possessed by an idea rights
Carl Jung said people don't have ideas
ideas have people it's like so there's
nothing in that that's anything other
than exactly what you would predict and
then there's a deeper issue - and this
is one that I think has bedeviled me
ever since I made my initial videos
which is the rally it's impossible for
those on the radical left to admit that
anyone who opposes what they're doing
might be reasonable because what that
would mean would be that you could be
reasonable and opposed the radical left
and that would imply that what the
radical left was doing wasn't reasonable
and so instead of dealing with the fact
that I actually happened to be quite
reasonable the attempt is to assume that
anyone who objects must be part of the
radical right it's like well actually no
there's lots of space between the
radical left and the radical right
there's the moderate reasonable left for
example and you and then there's the
center and then there's the moderate
reasonable right and then there's the
far right and then there's the extreme
right all of that exists in opposition
to the radical left but it's very
convenient for the radicals on the left
to say oh well you don't buy our
doctrine and and and then to immediately
make the presupposition that you must be
the most Highness example of that entire
array of potential objection it's like
yeah well whatever you know it's just
not a viable stance and so but it's
convenient and it it it it's a bad thing
because it drives polarization and
that's a bad thing but it also it
doesn't address the issue so one of the
things that I've been thinking about
over the last couple of weeks and plan
to write about here's a mystery for all
of you I don't care what your political
background isn't it isn't like I'm anti
left I've made videos documenting this I
know why there's a left wing there's a
left wing because inequality is a
problem it's a way worse problem than
the radical leftists liked to admit
because you can't lay it at the feet of
capitalism and the free market
inequality is a way worse problem than
that but it's definitely a problem and
because inequality is a problem you need
part of the political structure to speak
up to the for the people who end up
arrayed at the bottom of hierarchies
it's crucial someone has to speak for
them that's the place of the left but
then but then consider this get so we
can get we can state that the right
speaks for hierarchy and the left speaks
on behalf of those who are oppressed by
inequality good we need that dialogue
the radical left okay we know from 20th
century history that things can go too
far on the right no one disputes that
and that things can go too far on the
left and we also know that when things
go too far it's seriously not good right
so when things went too far on the right
then we had 120 million people died in
the Second World War and when things
went too far on the left
we had god only knows how many people
murdered as a consequence of internal
repression at least a hundred million
and we risk putting the entire planet we
risk putting the planet into flames okay
so that's the consequence all right so
now in the aftermath of world war two
let's say we've come to some sort of
sociological agreement I would say that
you can identify the radical right
wingers when people make claims of
racial superiority you put them in a box
and you say well you're outside of
acceptable political discourse and so
you saw that with will William F Buckley
in the 60s when he started his
conservative review he dissociated
himself from the David Duke types and
you saw it more recently with people for
example like ben shapiro who immediately
distanced himself from the
Charlottesville types okay so now we we
kind of have a sense of where you've
crossed the damn line in your
ethno-nationalism right as soon as you
move into the racial superiority domain
[Music]
today I want to present to you some of
the things I've been thinking and
writing about as Easter approached I'm
going to do this in five separate parts
which hopefully will make up a coherent
whole I'm going to read all of this
because it's complicated
part one the nature of experience there
are two ways of looking at the world as
a place of things and as a forum for
action because we are living beings and
must make our way pragmatically in the
world
the second way of looking has to take
precedence this means that the world as
a place of things is nested inside the
world as a forum for action this means
that our conceptualization of the world
as objective must remain subordinate to
our conceptualization of the world as a
place of being this is from the first
part of my book maps of meaning quote
the world can be validly construed as
forum for action or place of things the
former manner of interpretation more
primordial and less clearly understood
finds its expression in the arts or
humanities in ritual drama literature
and mythology of the world as forum for
action is a place of value a place where
all things have meaning this meaning
which is shaped as a consequence of
social interaction is implication for
action or at a higher level of analysis
implications for the configuration of
the interpretive schema that produces or
guides action the latter manner of
interpretation the world as place of
things finds its formal expression in
the methods and theories of science
science allows for increasingly precise
determination of the consensually
validate able properties of things and
for if
utilization of precisely determined
things as tools once the direction such
use is to take has been determined
through application of more fundamental
narrative processes no complete world
picture can be generated without use of
both modes of construal the fact that
one mode is generally set at odds with
the other means only that the nature of
their respective domains remains
insufficiently discriminated adherents
of the mythological worldview tend to
regard the statements of their Creed's
as indistinguishable from empirical fact
even though such statements were
generally formulated long before the
notion of objective reality emerged
those who by contrast accept the
scientific perspective who assume that
it is or might become complete forget
that an impassable gulf currently
divides what is from what should be i
wrote this a little later it's also
relevant as introduction to what we're
going to discuss in a bit the world can
be validly construed as a forum for
action as well as a place of things we
describe the world as a place of things
using the formal methods of science the
techniques of narrative however myth
literature and drama portray the world
as a forum for action the two forms of
representation have been unnecessarily
set at odds because we have not yet
formed a clear picture of their
respective domains the domain of the
former scientific domain is the
objective world what is from the
perspective of inter subjective
perception the domain of the latter
drama and narrative is the world of
value what is and what should be from
the perspective of emotion and action
the world as a forum for action presents
itself in two stories the normal story I
was at point-a
and I was going to point B and the
revolutionary story I was at point a and
while going to point B something
entirely unexpected and earth-shattering
happened this meant I had to abandon my
story question my assumptions a lot of
my old beliefs to die and be reborn anew
the second story which is deeper is
essentially religious part to some
axioms of the Christian revolutionary
story number one to decide that and then
enact the proposition that being is good
despite its tragedy and malevolence
number two to work in consequence for
the continual and eternal improvement of
that being and to know that as love
number three to do such work in truth
number four to let everything inadequate
burn off in that pursuit and to welcome
its replacement by what is better number
five to know that as the sacred
imitation of Christ number six to
understand that although Christ's
sacrifice redeemed us all the work still
has to be done number seven to accept
that work as the sacred meaning of life
number eight to strive toward the
heavenly City on the hill in that manner
part three narratives and sacrifice from
my new book twelve rules for life rule
seven pursue what is meaningful not what
is expedient every man for himself and
the devil take the hindmost as the old
proverb hasn't why not
simply take everything
you can get whenever the opportunity
arises why not determine to live in that
manner or is there an alternative and if
so why should we bother with it
our ancestors worked out very
sophisticated answers to such questions
but we still don't understand them very
well this is because they are in large
part still implicit manifest primarily
in ritual and myth and as of yet
incompletely articulated we act them out
and represent them in stories but were
not yet wise enough to formulate them
explicitly we're still chimps in a troop
or wolves in a pack we know how to
behave we know who's who and why we've
learned that through experience
our knowledge has been shaped by the
interaction with others we've
established predictable routines and
patterns of behavior but we don't really
understand them or know where they
originated they've evolved over great
expanses of time but we didn't and still
don't understand what it all meant the
biblical narrative of Paradise and the
fall is one such story fabricated by our
collective imagination working over the
centuries it provides a profound account
of the nature of being and points the
way to a mode of conceptualization at
action well matched to that nature in
the Garden of Eden prior to the dawn of
self-consciousness so goes the story
human beings were sinless our primordial
parents Adam and Eve walked with God
then tempted by the snake the first
couple ate from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil discovered
death and vulnerability and turned away
from God mankind was exiled from
paradise and began its effortful mortal
existence the idea of sacrifice enters
soon afterward beginning with the
account of Cain and Abel and developing
through the Abrahamic adventures and the
Exodus after much contemplation
struggling humanity learns that God's
favor
could be gained and his wrath averted
through proper sacrifice and also that
bloody murder might be motivated among
those unwilling or unable to succeed in
this manner the delay of gratification
when engaging in sacrifice our
forefathers began to act out what would
be considered a proposition if it were
stated in words that something better
might be attained in the future by
giving up something of value in the
present recall if you will that the
necessity for work is one of the curses
placed by God upon Adam and his
descendants in consequence of original
sin adam's waking to the fundamental
constraints of his being his
vulnerability his eventual death is
equivalent to his discovery of the
future the future that's where you go to
die hopefully not too soon your demise
might be staved off through work through
the sacrifice of the now to gain benefit
later it is for this reason among others
no doubt that the concept of sacrifice
is introduced in the biblical chapter
immediately following the drama of the
fall there's little difference between
sacrifice and work they're also both
uniquely human sometimes animals act as
if they're working but they are really
only following the dictates of their
nature beavers build dams they do so
because they are beavers beavers build
dams they don't think yeah but I'd
rather be on a beach in Mexico with my
girlfriend while they're doing it
prosaically such sacrifice work is delay
of gratification but that's a very
mundane phrase to describe something of
soul-shattering significance the
discovery that gratification could be
delayed was simultaneously the discovery
of time and with it causality at least
the causal force of voluntary human
action long ago in the dim mists of time
we began to realize that reality was
struck
as if it could be bargained with we
learned that behaving properly now in
the present regulating our impulses
considering the plight of others could
bring rewards in the future in a time
and place that did not yet exist we
began to inhibit control and organize
our immediate impulses so that we could
stop interfering with other people and
our future selves doing so was
indistinguishable from organizing
society the discovery of the causal
relationship between our efforts today
and the quality of tomorrow motivated
the social contract the organization
that enables today's work to be stored
reliably mostly in the form of promises
from others understanding is often acted
out before it can be articulated just as
a child acts out what it means to be
mother or father before being able to
give a spoken account of what those
roles mean the act of making a ritual
sacrifice to God was an early and
sophisticated enactment of the idea of
the usefulness of delay there is a long
conceptual journey between merely
feasting hungrily and learning to set
aside some extra meat smoked by the fire
for the end of the day or for someone
who isn't present it takes a long time
to learn to keep anything later for
yourself or to share it with someone
else and those are very much the same
thing as in the former case you are
sharing with your future self it is much
easier and far more likely to selfishly
and immediately wolf down everything in
sight there are similar long journeys
between every leap and sophistication
with regards to delay and its
conceptualization short-term sharing
storing away for the future
representation of that storage in the
form of records and later in the form of
currency and ultimately the saving of
money in a bank or other social
institution
some conceptualizations had to serve as
intermediaries or the full range of our
practices and ideas surrounding
sacrifice and work and their
representation could have never emerged
our ancestors acted out a drama a
fiction they personified the force that
governs fate as a spirit that can be
bargained with traded with as if it were
another human being and the amazing
thing is that it worked this was in part
because the future is largely composed
of other human beings often precisely
those who have watched and evaluated and
appraised the tiniest details of your
past behavior it's not very far from
that to God sitting above on high
tracking your every move and writing it
down for further reference in a big book
here's a productive symbolic idea the
future is a judgmental father that's a
good start but two additional archetypal
foundational questions arose because of
the discovery of sacrifice of work both
have to do with the ultimate extension
of the logic of work which is sacrifice
now to gain later first question what
must be sacrificed small sacrifices may
be sufficient to solve small singular
problems but it is possible that larger
more comprehensive sacrifices might
solve an array of large and complex
problems all at the same time that's
harder but it might be better adapting
to the necessary discipline of medical
school will for example fatally
interfere with the licensee estoppel
core undergraduate party animal giving
that up is a sacrifice but a physician
can to quote George w really put food on
his family that's a lot of trouble
dispensed with over a very long period
of time so sacrifices are necessary to
improve the future and larger sacrifices
can be better second question
set of related questions really we've
already established the basic principle
sacrifice will improve the future but a
principle once established has to be
fleshed out it's full extension or
significance has to be understood what
is implied by the idea that sacrifice
will improve the future in the most
extreme and final of cases where does
that basic principle find its limits we
must ask to begin what would be the
largest most effective most pleasing of
all possible sacrifices and then how
good might the best possible future be
if the most effective sacrifice could be
made the biblical story of Cain and Abel
Adam and Eve's sons immediately follows
the story of the expulsion from paradise
as mentioned previously Cain and Abel
are really the first humans since their
parents were made directly by God and
not born in the standard manner Cain and
Abel live in history not in Eden they
must work they must make sacrifices to
please God and they do so with altar and
proper ritual but things get complicated
Abel's offerings please God but Cain's
do not Abel is rewarded many times over
but Cain is not it's not precisely clear
why although the text strongly hints
that Cain's heart is just not in it
maybe the quality of what came put
forward was low
maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe
God was vexed for some secret reasons of
his own and all of this is realistic
including the texts vagueness of
explanation not all sacrifices are of
equal
quality furthermore it often appears
that sacrifices of apparently high
quality are not rewarded with a better
future and it's not clear why why isn't
God happy what would have to change to
make him so those are difficult
questions and everyone asks them all the
time even if they don't notice asking
such questions is indistinguishable from
thinking the realization that pleasure
could be usefully for stalled dawned on
us with great difficulty
it runs absolutely contrary to our
ancient fundamental animal instincts
which demand immediate satisfaction
particularly under conditions of
deprivation which are both inevitable
and commonplace and to complicate the
matter such delay only becomes useful
when civilization has stabilized itself
enough to guarantee the existence of the
delayed reward in the future if
everything you save will be destroyed or
worse stolen there's no point in saving
it is for this reason that a wolf will
down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single
meal he isn't thinking man I hate it
when I binge I should save some of this
for next week so how was it that those
two impossible and necessarily
simultaneous accomplishments delay and
the stabilization of society into the
future could possibly have manifested
themselves here is a developmental
progression from animal to human it's
wrong no doubt in the details but it's
sufficiently correct for our purposes in
theme first there's excess food large
carcasses mammoths or other massive
herbivores might provide that we ate a
lot of mammoths maybe all of them with a
large animal there's some left for later
after a kill that's accidental at first
but eventually the utility of for later
starts to be appreciated
some provisional notion of sacrifice
develops at the same time if I leave
some even if I want it now I won't have
to be hungry later that provisional
notion develops to the next level if I
leave some for later I won't have to go
hungry and neither will those I care for
and then to the next I can't possibly
eat all of this mammoth but I can't
store the rest for too long either
maybe I should feed some to other people
maybe they'll remember and feed me some
of their mammoths when they have some
and I have none then I'll get some
mammoths now and some mammoths later
that's a good deal and maybe those I'm
sharing with will come to trust me more
generally maybe then we could trade
forever in such a manner
mammoth becomes future mammoth and
future mammoth becomes personal
reputation that's the emergence of the
social contract to share does not mean
to give away something you value and get
nothing back that is instead only what
every child who refuses to share fears
it means to share means properly to
initiate the process of trade a child
who can't share who can't trade can't
have any friends because having friends
is a form of trade Benjamin Franklin
once suggested that a newcomer to a
neighbourhood asked a new neighbor to do
him or her a favor citing this old maxim
he that has once done you a kindness
will be more ready to do you another
than he whom you yourself have obliged
in Franklin's opinion asking someone for
something not too extreme obviously was
the most useful and immediate invitation
to social interaction and trade such
asking on the part of the newcomer
provided the neighbor with an
opportunity
to show him or herself as a good person
at first encounter it also meant that
the latter could now ask the former for
a favor in return because of the debt
incurred increasing their mutual
familiarity and trust in that manner
both parties could overcome their
natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the
stranger it is better to have something
than nothing it's better yet to share
generously to something you have it's
even better than that however to become
widely known for generous sharing that's
something that lasts that's something
that's reliable and at this point of
abstraction we can observe how the
groundwork for the conceptions reliable
honest and generous have been laid the
basis for an articulated morality has
been put in place the productive
truthful sharer is the prototype for the
good citizen and the good man we can see
in this matter how from the simple
notion that leftovers are a good idea
the highest moral principles might
emerge it's as if something like the
following happened as humanity developed
first were the endless tens or hundreds
of thousands of years prior to the
emergence of written history and drama
during this time the twin practices of
delay and exchange begin to emerge
slowly and painfully then they become
represented in metaphorical abstraction
as rituals and tales of sacrifice told
in a manner such as this it's as if
there's a powerful figure in the sky who
sees all and is judging you giving up
something you value seems to make him
happy and you want to make him happy
because all hell breaks loose if you
don't so practice sacrificing and
gerri until you become expert at it and
things will go well for you
no one said any of this at least not so
plainly and directly but it was implicit
in the practice and then in the stories
action came first as it had to as the
animals we once were could act but could
not think implicit unrecognized value
came first as the actions that preceded
thought embodied value but did not make
that value explicit people watched the
successful succeed and the unsuccessful
fail for thousands and thousands of
years we thought it over and drew a

well dr. jordan pearson welcome to
Sydney on your Australian tour you're
talking to packed out houses and the
interest is extraordinary
and we've had the opportunity to talk
personally and I can understand why I
want to begin with something that
Churchill wrote in the 1930s and he said
this one of the signs of a Great Society
is the diligence with which it passes
culture from one generation to the next
when one generation no longer passes on
the things that are dear to it it's
heroes and their stories in its
religious faith it's in effect saying
that past is null and void it's of no
value
he goes on to say that leaves young
people feeling a lack of direction and a
lack of purpose and opens them to the
dictum of Karl Marx that our people
derived of their history are easily
persuaded have we stripped our young
people of purpose and we knee and left
them open to being bullied around well
there's two things about that that I
think are really worth worth laying out
the first is an analysis of the purpose
of memory now because people think that
the purpose of memory is to remember the
past and that's not the purpose of
memory the purpose of memory is to
extract out from the past lessons to
structure the future and now that's the
purpose of personal memory and so you're
done with a memory when you've extracted
out the information that you can use to
guide yourself properly in the future so
if you have a traumatic memory for
example that's really obsessing you if
you analyze that memory to the point
where you figured out how you put
yourself at risk and you can determine
how you might avoid that in the future
then the emotion associated with that
goes away so memory is a has a very
pragmatic function and cultural memory
is the same thing is that we need to
extract out stories from our past that
structure our future and we need that
because first of all if you don't have a
purpose let's say it isn't that your
life becomes neutral
in a meaningless sense it's that your
life becomes characterized by unbearable
suffering because the baseline condition
of life is something like unbearable
suffering and what you have to set
against that is a noble and worthwhile
purpose and hopefully hopefully your
determination of that purpose is
buttress to some degree by the wisdom of
the past because you can't conjure
something like that up on your own and
if you provide people with nobility of
purpose then they can tolerate the
suffering of existence without becoming
entirely corrupted by it and cultures
that don't do that
it isn't even so much that they die it's
that cultures that don't do that are
dead they're done they don't have a
story anymore and they don't have a call
to adventure and then well then everyone
suffers stupidly as a consequence it's a
very bad thing
so Churchill made the same observation
that many of the great psychologists and
philosophers made in the early part of
the 20th century it's like bring the
story forward and and propagate it and
make it the most noble possible story
and then you motivate people to do to
transcend themselves which they need to
do so yes he's exactly right in his
diagnosis just to stay with him for a
moment he's painted as the great
defender of freedom it's possible that
your country Canada and certainly my
country Australia would have not
continued as free societies had it not
been for that man courageously standing
at a time when so few did he wasn't the
inventor of freedom freedom as we
understand it and I want to unpack that
a bit something very very few people in
very few cultures down through the ages
and even today have ever really
experienced yes and partly because we're
afraid of it I would say I mean people
think of freedom as the ability to
implement your whim and freedom opens up
that as a possibility but sustainable
freedom that isn't what it's about at
all
it's about it's primarily about
responsibility it's about determining
which load you're going to pick up and
carry that's the proper definition of
appropriate freedom it's not grout
Dillman gratification of instantaneous
impulse it's self-evident that
doesn't work two-year-olds do that and
that's why they can't live in the world
they can't organize themselves across
time they can't sacrifice the moment for
the future and the more sophisticated
you get I suppose in some sense the more
you're able to do that and then your
freedom becomes the freedom to choose
the proper responsibilities and that's
not that's also not something that we've
been good at communicating to young
people if we talk to them about
responsibility we did generally do it in
a finger-wagging sort of way it's like
well you're breaking the rules you're a
bad person and and and well that may be
true because people break the rules and
there's no shortage of badness in people
but the the proper message for young
people is to say well no you don't
understand you you want to take on
responsibility you want to take on the
heaviest load that you can conceive of
that you might be able to move because
it gives your life nobility and purpose
and that offsets the tragedy and and not
only psychologically not only does it
all set it psychologically because you
have a purpose and and and something to
wake up for right and to face the
difficulties of the day but also because
if you face the difficulties of the day
properly you actually ameliorate
suffering not only in the psychological
sense but because you make the world at
least a less terrible place and that's
something right to move things away from
hell is something even if you're not you
know self-evidently moving forthrightly
to heaven to move things away from the
worst they can be is well that's a noble
goal in and of itself so and young
people are starving for that idea it's
very interesting to watch as I look at
it it seems to me that that Acton had it
right freedom properly understood this
needs to be seen as a negative and as a
positive the negatives is is a sort of
concept of freedom from right fear
addiction persecution Taron are tyranny
in a personal sense and then freedom to
be used to reach your potential but it
seems to me that what's missing is an
understanding that freedom exercised
within a framework of responsibility are
you doing what you ought will guarantee
ongoing freedom for yourself and for
your neighbors freedom exercised in a
way that confuses it with license
tends to destroy freedom in fact you
could even go so far as to say that
misunderstood freedom turns out to be
its own worst enemy well that's that's
the that's the difficult distinction
between freedom of the moment and
freedom of the freedom with everything
taken into account and I'm a real
admirer of the work of Jean Piaget and
Piaget is a developmental psychologist
and few people know the world's most
well known developmental psychologist
and few people know that he was actually
motivated in his intellectual pursuits
by the desire to reconcile science with
religion that was what his driving force
from the time that he was a young man he
wouldn't know that even necessarily by
reading his writings because it's
implicit rather than explicit in them
but he he he has a different model of
what constitutes morality than than
Freud Freud's model is combative it's
sort of the super-ego as tyrant so the
super-ego would be the strictures of
society the it'd the biological impulses
and the eagle crushed between those
right so the ego is this thing that's
crushed between nature and culture and
so it's a really it's a tense and combat
of model of the human psyche and there's
something about it that's that's that's
accurate because some of the
restrictions that are put on your
impulse gratification are imposed on you
in in a sense tyrannically but Piaget
his perspective was much more optimistic
and I think much more accurate he
noticed that as children organized
themselves spontaneously as they
developed especially within the confines
of their own spontaneous play they
didn't so much subsume lurk or inhibit
their dark and aggressive impulses as
make them sophisticated and transform
them into universally acceptable games
so for Piaget a game that a group of
children were playing that all of them
were playing voluntarily and that was
going well and that they all wanted to
continue playing was a microcosm of
society and and literally a microcosm of
society
the reason the children were playing
those games was to practice being
productive members of society and he
felt that the appropriate game tended
towards what he described as an
equilibrate
date so an equilibrate estate would be a
game that you'll play because you've
decided it's a good game but that you
can play with others because they've
also decided that it's a good game and
so that can work at the individual level
and at the familial level and at the
social level and if you get all those
things working simultaneously then you
have a sustainable enterprise and it's
it's predicated not so much on the on
the inhibition of impulse or on the
regulation of it but of the integration
of impulses into a into a pattern of
being that gratifies them on a
relatively permanent basis so you know
if you want to go to university and
become a physician I think there's a lot
of sacrifice of impulsive gratification
that goes along with that but if you
become a physician then it's a noble
enterprise people support you socially
and all the needs that you need to have
fulfilled will also be fulfilled by that
enterprise well that's a way better
model and so it's strange that the
maximum freedom comes with the adoption
of a discipline and then also the
adoption of responsibility that frees
you up and everyone else around you in
the long run and if you explain that to
people especially in this day and age
when they be fed a never-ending diet of
idiot rights and freedoms they're
immediately on board with it because
they know I know that most of the
meaning that people experience in their
life is a consequence of adopting
responsibility so they're starving for
that idea to be articulated opens up a
whole can of very very interesting
issues let's try and pick a couple of
but the first but if I do it's evident
to me and I'm an enormous encouraged by
this because you know I'm a passionate
Australian I want this country to be the
sort of place that offers opportunities
of the sort that I had when I was young
you know I've had my opportunities but I
look at my kids generation what's going
to be there for them if we keep feeding
the sort of thin gruel in reality the
people turning out in vast numbers every
one of your talks in Australia's been
over subscribed massively it tells you
they kind of get those more to this I
think they're being told oh yeah they
know well it's one of the things that's
so interesting about dealing with
archetypal themes you know archetypal
themes are archetypal because
actually speak of the structure of human
experience that's why they last and so
it's human nature and human experience
has a pattern you don't have the
capacity to articulate that pattern as
an individual in part because your life
is too short you just can't figure it
out but the the ancient representations
of those patterns are everywhere around
you and you you know some of them in
image you you caught on to them
automatically you you you fall into them
if you go to a movie for example because
movies always express archetypal themes
if you hear them articulated you think I
knew that I knew that I just don't know
how to say it that's that's the Platonic
idea of of learning is remembering your
soul already knows but it doesn't have
the words yeah and so when people talk
to me about watching my lectures let's
say they say they basically say one of
two things if it if it's not just a
simple thank you
they say one of two things a third of
them say quarter for them say when I
listen to you talk it's as if you're
telling me things that I already know
it's like yeah well that's exactly right
because that's what archetypal stories
are they're the description of what you
already know but that can be articulated
and then who you are and how you see
yourself and the way you describe
yourself or all become the same thing so
that's wonderful then you're not at odds
with yourself you know and then you have
then you're a functioning unity and that
makes you much stronger and more
indomitable than you would otherwise be
and then the other thing that people say
and this is more like 3/4 of them is
that they say I was in a very dark place
I was addicted I was I was drinking too
much I had a fragmented relationship
with my fiancee and I wasn't getting
married things weren't going where very
well with my family my relationship with
my father was damaged I didn't have any
aim I was wasting my time some variant
of that some combination of those and
they said well hmm I've been watching
your lectures I've decided to establish
a purpose I'm trying to tell the truth
and things are way better and I've and
so let's say I've done maybe eight or
nine large-scale public talks in the
last two months so that's probably
20,000 people and about half of them
half of them estate afterwards to talk
to me so that's about 7,000 people who
have said that to me and then people
stopped me on the street all the time
and tell me exactly that story which is
just wonderful like you can't imagine
how good it is to be able to go to
places you've never been and to have
people stop you on the streets
spontaneously and say look my life is
way better than it was it's like it's so
good and so and I've got like I don't
know 35,000 letters from people since
last August it's more than that I can't
keep track of them and it's exactly the
same thing like 3/4 the quarter of them
say well you've given me the words to
say what I already knew was true and
thank you for that I can see that in the
audience it's so interesting because I
can lay out a story people go like this
and say they're doing that all the time
it's like the lights are going on and
that's a really while there's almost
nothing better than that to watch lights
go on when you're talking to people it's
like that's just absolutely fantastic
but to get this response from people my
father I have my father's about 80 he's
83 I think 81 he's 81 and I put him in
charge of going through my viewer email
which is an overwhelming job but no he
we've had discussions about this
constantly he's overwhelmed by the fact
that so many people are writing and
saying the same thing it's like I have a
purpose man my life actually matters I
finally realized that and I'm putting it
into practice and I'm bearing up under
the heaviest load I can imagine and it's
really helping it's like God and that's
tens of thousands of responses now so
it's it's you couldn't hope for anything
better than that there's zero harm in it
right it's just people putting their
lives together they're not mucking about
with other people and I'm trying to make
broad-scale social transformations about
which they have no idea they're trying
to make their immediate environment
better and it's working it's like great
well great you say there's zero ha
minute I'd say as a form of legislature
that there's an enormous amount of good
enough huh a country is only there's
some type of the people that make it up
to the extent that they're put together
a resilient AV contribute don't have to
ask others to help them
the stronger the nation oh this is so
yes and rapidly like I I mean I think I
was thinking the other day some
journalist asked me why the audience why
people are responding so positively to
what I'm saying the young men for
example and I thought yeah that's a good
question says well I'm actually on their
side I'm pretty happy that I'm really
happy that they're not wasting their
lives I'm really sad to see that people
are disenchanted and nihilistic and
depressed and anxious and aimless and
and perverse and vengeful and and all of
those things it's terrible and then to
see people question whether that's
necessary and then to start to rise out
of it it's like it's so fun like last
night I was at after my talk it's
overwhelming
I don't usually think about these things
but I was I was after my talk last night
and so all these people line up and you
know they have their 15 15 seconds with
me and they're kind of tentative they're
excited and a tentative when they come
up to talk to me and then they have you
know 15 seconds of time to tell me
something I'm really listening to them
and they're hesitant about whether or
not to share the good news about their
life you know and I think it's often
because when people share good news
about their life people don't
necessarily respond positively you know
they don't get encouragement and people
need so little encouragement it's just
unbelievable and so there comes
something good and I'm like ah that's so
good you know somebody says well I'm
getting along way better with my father
I haven't seen him for 10 years and now
we get along great and then the power of
that you can't overstate the power of
that for individuals to get their life
together the individual is an
unbelievably powerful force and every
single person who gets their act
together a little bit has the capacity
to spread that around them it's it's a
chain reaction and so it's a lovely
thing to see and that's fantastic my
observation of atheists would be they
don't live like atheists they don't live
as though they really believe they're
just a cosmic accident and there's no
purpose well you are most of them the
best of them I have a lot of respect for
the atheists generally because
they've generally thought a lot more
about this situation and and struggled
with it more than the complacent
fundamentalists you know who wallpaper
over their doubts with with with over
statements about their belief the
atheists you know the word Isaac means
or Israel the word Israel means he who
struggles with God it's like well it's
not obvious that it's not the atheists
you know they're struggling away it's
like they're obsessed with it even and
so they have God more on their mind than
the typical person who's a believer and
so it it's interesting too because
there's been this little community
developed around my biblical lectures in
particular of people who call themselves
Christian atheists which I think it's
quite remarkable so if I lay out the
rationale for the Christian ethic which
is something like pick up your damn
cross and struggle uphill which is a
really good message they think oh yeah
well that makes a lot of sense it's like
well I don't need the metaphysical
baggage it's like well maybe you do and
maybe you don't but even to pick up the
the practical utility of that idea which
[Applause]
thank you
well welcome everyone I'm assuming that
applause was not for me
[Laughter]
my name is Bill Flanagan and I'm the
dean of law here at Queen's University
and I am pleased to welcome all of you
here today for the inaugural Liberty
lecture
generously sponsored by Greg pizzetsky
law 80 a long time and very generous
supporter of the law school and Greg is
here today and I just want to perhaps
join me in thanking Greg for sponsoring
this lecture series
[Music]
thank you
the Liberty lecture is intended to
explore the meaning of Liberty in our
contemporary Society
a subject of Rich interest to
philosophers political scientists
and legal Scholars just to name a few
and today's Liberty lecture is moderated
by Professor Bruce party to my right of
the faculty of law
an expert in a variety of areas
including environmental law
environmental law and governance
ecosystem management climate change
water law and University governance
Our Guest today is Dr Jordan Peterson a
professor of psychology at the
University of Toronto and a clinical
psychologist
his many Publications include his
recently published book 12 rules for
life an antidote to chaos
and his research spans a number of
topics including the psychology of
religion and the modern understanding of
creativity
and personality
I know that today's lecture has
generated a great deal of Interest as is
evident from The Pact Hall here today
it's also generated a certain amount of
heat
the proposed topic the rising tide of
compelled speech in Canada
is for many a controversial one
and I know that many of you in the
audience will hold widely Divergent
views
I fully support your opportunity to be
heard and should you wish challenge the
speakers to defend their positions
I know that today's speakers likewise
share this conviction
and will welcome your comments and
questions
as might be appropriate for a lecture
series named after Liberty
I believe it is also important for me to
affirm at the outset that the core
values of the faculty of law end of
Queen's University include academic
freedom and respectful dialogue among
those with differing views
this includes providing our speakers
with the opportunity to be heard
and providing all of you with the
opportunity to respond
in a respectful environment free from
any harassment or any attempts to shut
down the conversation
so it is in this Spirit of free and
respectful academic exchange that I am
pleased to launcher this new lecture
series
and welcome again and Welcome to our
guest and I look forward to our
discussion thank you
[Applause]
thank you Bill
welcome and thank you for coming
I would like to underline what Bill said
which is that this event would not have
happened without the initiative and
support of Greg piazewski so Greg thank
you very much
as well before we start I would like to
thank some people from The Faculty of
law Diane Butler Adam Blake gallipol and
Christina ulian for their help in
putting this together
I would also like to acknowledge the
support help and generous assistance of
several people around the university uh
Lisa plater and Event Services
David Patterson and the campus security
office
you have been professional helpful
straightforward and I thank you very
much for making this possible
I would also like to return to
Dean Flanagan's observation about the
importance of this moment
and to acknowledge the role that both
Dean Flanagan and principal wolf have
played in enhancing the reputation of
this University in terms of its
commitment to academic freedom and
academic debate
they have
reflected an unflinching commitment to
those ideas as principal wolf said on
his blog informed respectful debate
is Central to Academia and gentlemen I
salute your academic statesmanship thank
you very much
[Music]
so we're going to proceed as follows uh
the first thing I would like to say is
that in the hall
behind you afterwards there will be some
of Jordan's books on sale 12
um
what's the title again 12 rules for life
12 12 rules for life wanted to get to 12
what it was right that's not 12 steps
it's 12 rules right
um
we are going to proceed as follows
Jordan and I are going to have a
conversation
for
half an hour maybe 40 minutes
and then we are going to throw the floor
open to questions
we'll describe what kinds of questions
that you should ask later on when we get
to that stage but our topic is
the rising tide
of compelled speech in Canada
I am going to take just a couple of
minutes to give us some context and set
it up and then I'll uh ask Jordan to
tell us what he thinks
you may have seen the CBC production
of the tutors
the story of King Henry VII
in one episode
the King has condemned Thomas More to
death
for refusing to say that the king is the
head of the Church of England
more is in his cell
awaiting execution
a friend comes to him
to plead with him
to say what it is the king wants to hear
more says he cannot do that
for he does not believe it to be true
in exasperation
the friend says
you don't have to believe it
you just have to say it
when your brain
makes that kind of calculation
you know you are under the thumb
of a tyrant
and Thomas Moore
lost his head
the tide of compelled speech in Canada
is rising
the Law Society of Ontario has
introduced a new policy that requires
each lawyer to develop a statement of
principles which endorses
and acknowledges an obligation to
promote
certain values
the Ontario Human Rights Commission
says that under the Human Rights Code
failing to address Somebody by their
preferred pronoun
will constitute discrimination
for which you may be investigated
and prosecuted
the elementary teachers Federation of
Ontario
has introduced
new curriculum
to require teachers to teach elementary
students
about white privilege
and the federal summer grants program
requires applicants to attest
to the values
that the government believes in
they don't have to believe it
[Music]
foreign
[Applause]
[Applause]
okay
security
[Applause]
that's pure narcissism at work by the
way
you don't want to hijack to hijack an
event like this
that other people put time and effort
into and to use they their their
civility of the crowd and the civility
of the organizers as an excuse to
blatantly yell out your ill-informed
opinions there's no way to conduct a
civil dialogue it's absolutely appalling
the people who do that should be
embarrassed
[Music]
all right I guess I would also say that
as students and as faculty members you
shouldn't put up with it there's no way
that you should allow people who are
doing this to hijack your educational
opportunities and to bend and twist the
the functions and the structures of the
University it's it's not a good thing
not in any way at all I would say that
was a very disgraceful display
fundamentally so let's let's stick with
it why
why do you think people are afraid of
free speech
well you know people develop an
ideological view of the world because
they don't want to think through things
in real detail and they're aided and
embedded in that endeavor by their
pathological professors who are feeding
them uh what would I say and
oversimplified
an oversimplified radical view of the
world that in my estimation is
fundamentally based in in resentment
not that there's no reason for say a
left-wing view of the world and we can
get to that later
it's it's easy virtue you know you can
stand up in front of 900 people with
your placard and your and you're
screeching and you can you can decline
to the entire audience your fundamental
moral superiority you can tell everyone
at once that they're all beneath you and
you're standing for the right thing and
absolutely none of that is earned you
know like what the heck what the hell
was that there's it's come no seriously
man there's just it's just complete
misbehavior it's embarrassing and the
fact that people the people who do that
don't have enough sense to go hide their
head in shame just tells you how badly
socialized they are and how terribly
educated they are and the thing is the
thing that's so awful is that there are
professors and Educators who promote
that they say well that's how you change
the world it's like it is how you change
the world but it's certainly not how you
make it better you make it worse clearly
you know there's no comfort in that and
and there's nothing about it this
impressive it's no it's no better in
some sense than a two-year-old having a
tantrum on the floor it shows as far as
I'm concerned it approximate the same
level of psychosocial development
so when the fact that that this is
happening continually universities is
it's it it truly makes me embarrassed to
be associated with the university and
now I say that with great displeasure
because you know I've been working for
great universities for a very long time
and the university is an absolutely
remarkable institution you know it's
survived for a thousand years
and and to see it to see it brought down
by by people whose Behavior would be out
of place at a four-year-old's birthday
party is is something something visible
to behold
so so what about the actions of
government now because it is Government
after all that is the source of this
compelled speech as law as well as other
ways in which they seek to restrict
speech but the compelled speech is the
most egregious form of violation yeah so
tell us about that well I've been trying
to I've been trying to sort this out
because
you know if you're a clinician
I would say one of the problems you
always have when you're dealing with
behavior that's gone astray is to
understand at what level of analysis you
should address it you know is it a
theological problem is it a
philosophical problem is it a
psychological problem is it social is it
economic like these are very complicated
questions is it a trivial issue is it an
issue of Rights is it is it something
else the people who put in the in bill
c-16 for example and its Associated
legislation make the claim that it's
it's a legislative movement that's
facilitated by nothing but compassion
and desire to expand the domain of of of
let's say of of Rights and Freedoms and
you know there's nothing wrong in
principle with expanding the domain of
Rights and Freedoms except of course for
every right and and for every freedom
there's an attendant responsibility and
obligation so you have to keep that in
mind
when I looked at bill c-16 and the
legislation that surrounded it
especially that was written by the
Ontario Human Rights Commission the
policies that surrounded it and also the
policies that gave rise to the social
justice tribunals named social justice
tribunals appallingly enough that that
gave rise to those tribunals in Ontario
the things I read just made my hair
stand on end you know the social justice
tribunals have the right to place
themselves outside of legal out of
outside of jurisprudential Precedence
it's like what the hell is that it's
really you're going to make the case the
only way I think that you could justify
doing that is that if you tortured
yourself into the ideological
proposition that English common law is
somehow an oppressive branch of the
patriarchy and because of that you have
every right and even obligation to S to
place yourself outside of its structure
of precedent but we don't want to place
ourselves outside of the structure of
precedent of English common law I can
tell you that it's it's one of the
Supreme achievements of the human race
it's it's Purdue societies that are as
free and as productive as any societies
have ever been anywhere on the planet
and certainly are now and to dare to
state that you would Place yourself
outside of that President that's the
sort of thing that made my hair stand on
end and and there are other elements of
the policies that were equally
reprehensible not least their complete
incoherence of formulation you know I
couldn't understand some of it like I
don't understand for example with
regards to the gender
propositions how it can be that you can
be anywhere on the gender Spectrum which
by the way is not a spectrum technically
and it actually matters which words you
use if you're writing law you can be
anywhere or nowhere on that Spectrum
like I don't know what that means and I
don't believe that the people who wrote
it know what it means either and you
don't write things that you don't
understand into the damn law you don't
do that because the law unfolds in
society and it Tangles people up as it
unfolds and it's no joke when that
happens so you'll be very very careful
when you're writing law and you
certainly don't want to write law to
push forward your ideological
commitments especially in the face of
precedent because precedent is what
keeps law from degenerating into
ideology essentially and so well and so
to answer your question you know more
more more more fundamentally I don't
believe
that this argument has ever been about
the rights of transgender people I think
that it's an attempt by the radical left
ideologues to push their ideological
agenda forward using using their using
attempts to manipulate the linguistic
domain and I'm not willing to seed the
linguistic domain because I don't think
there are any more anything more
important than the words that you use
and then when the government says well
you should start using these words you
should start thinking hard about your
damn government because your words are
no different than your thoughts and your
thoughts Orient yourself your thoughts
Orient you in the world and if someone
is going to tell you what it is that you
have to think then they're going to
disorient you in the world and I
wouldn't recommend that because there's
lots of terrible things that can happen
to you and if you're disoriented you're
going to run into a very large number of
them so that's how it looks to me so but
but the ideological context of this
seems like something has changed yes
because if you think back decades
earlier
liberals were the champions of free
speech Yes it was the conservatives at a
certain moment in time
who were the sensors you know they they
sought to curb blasphemy and obscenity
Sedition and so on and and the Liberals
said no free speech is the way we want
to go
and yet today that has flipped
uh if you if you look back to what left
leaning
officials and authorities and and
figures said let me just give you one
quote this is Samuel Gompers who is the
founder of the American Federation of
Labor
in 1886
he said this he said the freedom of
speech
has been granted to the people in order
that they may say the things
which
sorry misquoted that have not been
granted to the people in order that they
may say the things which please
and which are based upon accepted
thought
but the right to say the things which
displease
the right to say the things which may
convey the new and yet unexpected
thoughts the right to say things even
though they do are wrong now that is not
a sentiment now carried on by the left
in today
what has happened
well again I see that it's a consequence
of continual agitation by I would say a
minority of of the left of radical left
in particular and those are people who
aren't Marxist slash neo-marxist in
their fundamental ideological
orientation and have joined that in an
Unholy Union with the worst of French
post-modernism
and and there they push it Forward
ideological certainty and the thing that
the thing that's really distressing
about that is that if you know anything
about the history of oppressed people
let's say much as I hate to engage in
that particular form of dialogue under
the current conditions it's pretty
obvious that its freedom of speech is is
a freedom that's particularly important
for people who don't have anything else
right it's if you're supporting freedom
of speech you're not supporting the
status quo I mean just think about let's
let's use the logic of the radical
leftists and assume that Society is a
tyrannical hierarchy and the people at
the top have the upper hand in
everything including access to
communication
foreign
are not your friends
[Music]
they would say you know
Dr.. Jordan Pearson good morning good morning
Thank you so much for coming in you're developing this enormous power and reach is it the heavy burden for it?
Well it it's heavy and light at the same time. You know it's it's constant I
Don't know what I'm doing day-to-day until that day
I have people managing my schedule, and I'm busy enough so that I pretty much attend to the next thing
But the responsibility of getting into all these heads mm-hmm
And you are influencing people's signa me aren't you?
well
I guess I take solace in the fact that so many thousands of people now have written to me and also talked to me
to say that
Things are better for them because they've been trying to do some of the things that I suggest in my lectures and so
It is a heavy responsibility
When when you have influence of that sort but it lightens it when you also have evidence
Suggesting that it seems to be doing people a lot of good your changing lives
That seems to be the case.
You're saving lives?
Saving lives too? Well, I would say there were six people in the audience last night. I was talking in Melbourne
I would say there were six, maybe there were more but there were at least six so half a dozen
And they were young men who told me that that that's that's what they said
That you had served their lives.
Yeah, how do you feel about that?
Breaks me up. Why, it's a very positive thing you've done. What what do you mean it breaks you up?
Well it's sad that there are so many people in that
State of crisis you know and they don't need
that much encouragement
That's the thing.
So,
It's sad that it only takes that much encouragement to make that much difference. There's a lot of lost people in the world
 
So it's a good thing to be able to help that
It's overwhelming. Well I can tell that you're very emotional about it.
Yeah, well it's really something. You know what time I hadn't thought much about what had happened last night, but you know
probably 500 people lined up after the talk and
Most of them say the same thing you know about a quarter of them say look you're putting into words things
I already knew I always knew but I didn't know how to say just like oh
That's what archetypal stories do and and I guess that's what articulate people
Do you know so that's a good thing, but then the other 3/4 of them say some variant of?
of
You know my life has been turned around
They say I was addicted or I was drinking too much, or I wasn't moving ahead my relationship with my girlfriend
I wasn't getting along with my family. I didn't have any direction in life
I was nihilistic or hopeless or anxious or any number of variants of those and
I've been trying to put into practice what you've been talking about in your YouTube lectures and
podcasts and and
It's really helped my turn my life around. Thank you. It's like
Yeah
Do something you feel fragile about that
Well
No, I wouldn't say exactly that um I seem to be able to handle this
It's been going on a long time now. It's it's been 18 months, and I would say in many ways now
It's better than it was because at the beginning
Especially when I got when I put my hat in the political ring
Let's say because I felt that the Canadian politicians had overstepped their boundaries
You know my job was threatened and
quite severely, and I thought I might lose my clinical license as well and
Things were up in the air in a big way.  This was over the gender pronoun usage.
Yeah was my refusal when I stated refusal to abide by the
by the requirement that that I
modified my language in a certain manner that I
Felt was you know appropriate
oh
I felt it was inappropriate of the government to demand that I modify my language the government has no right to
Intrude on people's lives to that degree
It's very very dangerous when that happens and so anyways there was I've been in one scandal after another in Canada like seriously like
Non-stop for 18 months the last one. Just two days ago. I was at Queen's University in Kingston, and there was a big
Demonstration there was a very eerie
Occurrence they arrested a woman who was carrying a garrote for God's sake you know.  Does that frighten you?
That was not good, the Queen's University thing was not good. We were in a hall. It was kind of like a church this
this Hall. It's what it looked like it was lined with stained glass windows and
probably 20 of them and there was a
Protester had climbed up in the window well of all 20 windows
probably five or six feet off the ground and there were seven feet high these windows and they were pounding on them and
Forcefully forcefully enough in one case to break the window and so there was 900 of us inside
and it was we were surrounded by this group that were pounding on the windows and yelling and pounding on the doors and
It was and you know you could see against the stained glass you could see these shadowy forms pounding away
And it was it was very eerie. No one and no one in that Hall will ever forget that experience.  Why?
Why were they trying to get in why the garotte, why the, it sounds like hate is it hate?
Some of it was hate for sure. Why, why do they hate you?
Because they because of who they imagine I might be I guess that's part of it
You know it's it's it's easy to hate someone who's been caricatured and
So, but there's more to it than that I have been very
Forceful. Let's say and my criticisms of the radical left not only in Canada
But in the West in general not critical enough in my estimation, so I hold no stock whatsoever for the radical leftist
I'm absolutely appalled that they're the force they are in the universities
and I do believe that in many ways the universities have done more harm in society than good over the last 20 years and
I say that you know with a fair bit of regret because I've been obviously associated with universities since 1993
But that, it's a really interesting thing, I sometimes enjoy dealing with the radical lift in the university so I think you're gonna grow up
You're going to get through this and I enjoy the the challenge and the drama and the yeah
It's a challenge of youth saying you're wrong well
I'm right, and I know I'm right because I'm 20 and I know everything it's not the students so much. I'm concerned about
Staff is it. Oh, yeah, it's the staff and the administrators, and no it's not the students
I mean look I've been protested against I watched the protesters and most of the time the vast majority of them are young people whose
Whose?
Desire to have a positive influence in the world is
Channeled into this particular political expression at the moment, but so many of them are manipulated by the faculty members hmm
And there's no excuse for that and what they're doing is is far more dangerous than it looks why do young men?
need you
Well first of all you know, it's not I would say it's not just young men part of that's an
Artifact of the fact that most of the people who watch YouTube are young men?
but but I won't evade the question I mean because
See to some degree
Maturation among men is a voluntary process. It's not so voluntary for women. They have to grow up fast
They have a lot of things to do before they hit 30 yeah with men it can it can take longer
And they need a call to adventure
Let's say, and they need a call to responsibility
And they need to be they need to to be initiated into
Responsibility and to have a case made for its utility
And so I'm saying look it's better to be adult than to be a child. It's better
It's better to be in control of your own destiny
There's a place for you in the world the world would be lesser if you don't take your place in it
That you have a responsibility to bear to sort out your education to straighten out your life and to become who you are
Grow the hell up don't grow up and and for reasons that are
Positive for you positive for your family positive for everyone, so is but is this generation lost
They desperate they're clinging to what you're saying and doing in a desperate. I'm not criticizing what you're saying
I'm doing, but they need it. They need it desperately
why why they think I think that I think that every generation needs a
Message that that that supports
maturation and and responsibility
I think that we've done a bad job as a culture of putting that message forward so to me since the mid-1960s
Our young people have been fed a never ending diet of rights and impulsive freedoms something like that and that leaves a hole
because most of the meaning that people
people manage in their lives
And so that would be the meaning that you can offset against the tragedy of life that comes from adopting
Responsibility and carrying a load like human beings in some sense our design for a load and the heavier the load the better
It's it's one of the things that gives you
You know there's this this proclivity among psychologists to attempt to facilitate self-esteem which is a word
I don't care much for I think that self-respect is a much better term
And I think you develop self-respect by carrying a responsibility I feel very lucky to be born in this country
I think it's essentially a decent country does follow a lot of what happens in the United States
I'll get to that in a moment, but I was talking to some welfare workers police Salvation
Army yesterday saying to me
They think society is becoming and and particularly the younger the age group
We're talking is becoming more aggressive more cynical more angry
Do you agree with that and if so why well?
I don't think the statistics bear that out because what we've seen over all over the last especially the last 20 years is a
remarkable decline in violent crime I
do think that there might be an epidemic more of aimlessness and and and depression and anxiety that sort of thing and
I think that that's partly because the case for growing up is not made well
And and and because we're also so cynical about our own societies. You know I was in Amsterdam month ago talking to a group of
well-placed intellectuals
They're all friends of Theo van Gogh who was who was killed in in in Amsterdam about 15 years ago was stabbed
And there they said that embarrassment about the Dutch culture is rampant in their society
and I
That just makes my jaw drop because I go to Holland and I think my god this is such an amazing place these people they
Scrape this country out of the bottom of the ocean they built dikes to hold back the waves. It's it's free. It's it's liberal
It's it's compassionate its orderly. It's beautiful. Yet they're embarrassed by it. They're embarrassed by it because of its
Tyrannical patriarchal nature, it's like well. Who are you comparing it to it's like?
What are we comparing our societies to where do you want to live it on on the planet or in time anywhere?
But in the West not if you have any sense you think you've sort of been described as a warrior
Against political correctness is that fit?
Yeah
Tell me about this in our national carrier Qantas. Got some attention early this week and I was thinking about this
I knew you were coming in and
Taking advice from a diversity group. That's that's a bad idea
And I wanted to ban words like guys and chairmen husband and wife
Replaceable replace words like mankind and chairman. What's your reaction to that?
I think that it would be better if people tried to solve some real problems
Instead of playing these idiot diversity games. I think that
Everyone who plays identity politics whether they play it on the right or the left is
is going to pay for it in ways they can hardly imagine. It's a very
Counterproductive way of dividing up the world
it's an it's
Impossible to come to a peaceful solution in the identity politics universe even the identity politics types themselves they've run into this problem they call
Intersectionality right so ok so you classify people by race and by sex let's say
So and and seek for equity along those dimensions, but then well what about the intersection between those dimensions?
So you you have enough?
Ethnic minorities in your in your organization, let's say you match by population which is a foolish way of doing it
But you do that and maybe you're matched by sex
But then what about the intersection between race and sex well then what about the intersection between race sex ethnicity?
Then you could add social class to that then you could add social proclivity then you could add attractiveness
There's never-ending way of dividing people up into groups, and you can't equalize across all those ways. It's just technically not possible
Do you think people need to make a stand on issues like this and when an airline like Qantas makes these?
decisions do they need to stand against it do they need to boycott it and to do that sort of thing I
I think they need to understand it at a deeper level
It's like we have to decide if we're going to
Divide people up if we think that dividing people up primarily by their group identity is a good idea
And it's not it's a bad idea it will lead to
an enhancement of our tribal proclivities
and I don't think that if you're a an advocate of peace that you would push and
advocate for
Ours further division into tribal entities. It's a it's not wise is this transient when we move through this
We'll see it's been not transient in the past. It's caused tremendous troubles in the past
This is another reason why I'm not a fan of the radical leftists, so
The the radical left ideologies were were murderous in their expression throughout the 20th century
I mentioned earlier this country follows a lot of the US trends good and bad...Like Canada...We're a little bit behind, but it can be fashioned
well
What do we need to be alert to what do we need to be aware of what we need to avoid?
We need to
We need to be alert to the benefits of the societies that we now inhabit
We need to be grateful for their existence and and note very carefully the unlikelihood of their continued success
No, I don't understand. How we managed it
In the West we have societies where the default assumption between human beings is trust. I do not understand. How we manage that
because
There's so many ways that you can be betrayed by someone especially if you don't know them
How do you set up a society where the typical interaction between strangers is straight? Oh?
How many societies in the world are like that like 30 40 something like that how did that ever happen?
We don't know and it's an ongoing miracle, and we should do everything we can not to disrupt it because the alternative to that
Generous trust that courageous trust, which is unbelievably productive is ruled by thug, and that's the rule in most of the world
So do  you have optimism or not for the future?
I think we're in a time of extreme chaos
Things could go unbelievably well if we were careful. There's so many good things going on in the world right now
they're almost miraculous so for example between the year 2000 and
2012 the level of absolute poverty in the world was cut by 50%
That was the fastest rate of improvement by a large margin in human history
It was three years faster than the most optimistic projections had suggested
There's hundreds of thousands of people a week now being being
Pulled into the electrical power grid almost everyone has access to almost infinite computational power and all the educational resources that go along with that
We're wiping out most transmissible diseases the fastest growing economies in the world are in sub-saharan
Africa like there are a lot of things. There's no starvation in China
There's a huge middle class in China and India these things are absolutely miraculous
So and and god only knows what we could accomplish if we got our act together in the next 20 years
You know the sky's the limit
So, but we're playing very foolish games in the West and we could bring the house down around us, so we'll see
Thank you so much for coming in good luck with the burden oh
Thanks very much for the invitation and for the interview Jordan B. Peterson 12 rules for life an antidote to chaos
[Music]
last time we spoke it was not so long
ago but you've been in the headlights
even more since yes since the release of
the book and and also the beautiful
interview with captain human
yeah well that seemed to start a whole
new Plateau let's say of interest yeah I
thought that yes I've been in the
headlines a lot and a rather unsettling
amount I would say yeah and I don't want
to dwell on the captain human include
too much because you've you've been made
to talk so much about it I think you
probably tired about it but just one
thing that I I think you demonstrated
very clearly about yourself and also
about the saying that patience is a
virtue that you actually in the end you
won out because she stayed calm and you
explained what you actually meant and in
the end she liked words and I think that
actually was an inspiring example to a
lot of people yeah it seems to have been
it although it isn't clear why it was it
isn't still isn't really clear to me why
it became so incredibly widespread I
mean I think the interview itself on
YouTube has something approximating 8
million views but if you add the
commentaries to that lots of people have
cut it up and commented on it I think
it's I suspect it exceeds 20 million and
there was something about the interview
that really attracted a tremendous
amount of attention so it's very
interesting it's it's obviously part and
parcel of the political tension that's
that's odd that seems to underlie
virtually everything right now yeah I
think it's just like
like the intern interview from the
Platonic ideal steaks like this is if
you want you want an interview but
illustrates the cultural world
everything that's wrong about not taking
your opponent seriously and then you can
always show that interview so it's a
great great way to just introduce people
to what's wrong with the political
discourse I think I have I have a
hypothesis to run by you yes well so
imagine what's happening is this the
we're in the midst of a technological
transformation and the online video
services are displacing network and
cable television and the online print
services are displacing the traditional
print media so let's say that okay so
there's increasing desperation on the
part of the traditional media and so
then let's say that as a consequence of
that that I did that additional
nervousness and instability first of all
many people are leaving second budgets
are being cut and third there's
increasing desperation for to hold on to
market share and as a consequence of
that more and more articles are
polarized because they attract more
attention and that that's driving the
political polarization in part does that
seem reasonable to you yes I do think
that seems reasonable and I do think you
also have a great need for the
established media to debunk sort of the
the people who are popular on YouTube or
have podcasts and are free free from the
the big media houses and the TV channels
so you think it's also direct
competition yes but I'm not sure if it's
sort of a conscious effort I think also
it's incompetent sometimes you know it's
never never
everything together like all bright
lights extremism populism and they have
a very hard time discerning what's what
and the real Nazis from just people
having legitimate ideas and the
legitimate
yeah well that that's another issue
right is that it's in the radical left's
interest to lump everyone who opposes
their their ideological attempts into a
single terrifying category because if if
they had to contend with the fact that
you can be reasonable centrist or even a
reasonable Center leftist and dispute
the validity of identity politics as a
framework for conducting a political
discussion if you have to accept that
reasonable people can do that then you
have to accept that reasonable people
can object your ideology and that
implies that your ideology isn't
reasonable so there's every reason for
people on the radical left to not only
assume that their opponents are
reprehensible but to make the case that
they're reprehensible without ever
bothering to scratch below the surface
so I think that's happening too and then
of course I never want to let the
universities off the hook and I think
the fact that the universities have
allowed and encouraged the growth of
reticle left ideology and the humanities
and the social sciences is absolutely
completely inexcusable so I might even
prove fatal to the universities we'll
see about that
but it wouldn't surprise me universities
have been around a long time though the
last we spoke I was doing a piece on how
radical feminism had been mandatory for
a course long university and we spoke
about that the
was mandated to include you you get
Butler in this course and I continued
writing about the universities and it
goes much deeper in swinging it goes
even white if you look at the grants if
you look at its we have ten ten billion
crona's which are being distributed from
the state and they are they have the
gender mainstreaming that's is taking
place in the you know universities when
it comes to courses and the reading
lists and the professors is also when it
comes to the grants so you have to
include a gender perspective or at least
you have to specify why you don't have a
gender perspective right which is
probably fatal yeah exactly
so one of my friend of mine that I got
to know him via his dog because I have a
dog and so our dogs became friends and
then we became friends so he made his
giddy about Travis wild and wine
droughts and and how do you say
domesticated plants no gap yeah yeah so
the difference in behavior sounds very
boring but it's actually kind of
interesting one thing but he was about
to not get his not getting grant because
he didn't think you know gender
perspective yep and so well I know now
that and that's it ten years ago and now
it's it's spreading so I'm getting a lot
of stories about that so it's crazy the
universities are really it's shifted
into second gear here in Sweden at least
yeah it's the same it's it's happening
everywhere in the West I would say our
government just handed down a budget and
every as far as I can tell from the
initial response and every government
program has to include a gender
perspective now in the same manner and
so our government is deciding to solve a
problem that doesn't exist well what's
happened is that we've accepted
hoody we've accepted equality of outcome
as the measure by which we're going to
judge the fairness of organization's
operations at the same time when the
social science research is stacking up
on the other side of the distribution to
state ever more clearly and with ever
more with ever less doubt that as you as
you flatten out the sociological
landscape so that men and women are
treated more equally that the difference
in their occupational choices widens
it's become crystal clear and the the
response to that from the radicals is
that pseudoscience even though the
people who are doing these studies
aren't conservative there aren't
conservatives in the social sciences and
so people do these studies and they're
shocked by the results they publish them
because they're good scientists not
because these findings buttress their
ideological position and Plus whose
ideological position wasn't to wish that
as you flatten out the sociological and
political landscape you make men and
women more different who is hoping for
that no one was hoping for that so as
the science stacks up the legislative
and political attempts to silence it and
to mount an ideological counter-attack
multiplied yeah and we need more we need
more more general science now because
the differences are accelerating so no
need even more yeah more of the same but
I would like to jump into the to the
book and see what because I read your
book and or I didn't really read it I
actually listened to it which was I can
really recommend to people because you
know you did a fantastic job of reading
the book by yourself and
so thank money I was looking at the
reviews on audible and there's a
performance review and a content review
yeah the performance review is higher
than the content review it
what what to think about that I don't
know whether I should be happy about
that or not happy about that it's not
much difference but I thought it was
comical I think you should stop writing
and you should just be a narrator of
books I think that's the takeaway well
I'm going to do an audio book version of
maps of meaning oh really yes that's
great
yes so that's coming and that that'll be
like 25 hours long or something like
that probably more so yeah that's the
first book I read as an as an audiobook
was better angels of our nature by
Steven Pinker hmm it's like 50 hours or
something so it was a 25 hours it's not
so bad I think maybe I'm out too because
it's a longer book I'm probably I'm
probably under estimating the amount of
time we'll sit but the rule the rules in
your book yeah I think the first rule
stand up straight with his shoulders
back I think that's really when you read
the chapter it's it's really good
chapter but I as last time when I was
about to speak to you I I went into the
Urim Pearson fan groups in Sweden and I
asked them what what do you think I
should ask you or him and then one of
the guys was sir he said I really like
the book but when he says stand up
straight with your shoulders back
I think he should explain more how to do
it and then a lot of the helpful other
guys in the thread started giving him
physical exercises how to strengthen the
muscles between the shoulder dress it
was like a long thread on how to how to
build your chest up like and then in the
end like after 20 or 30 comments like
somebody suggests that maybe maybe
you're done didn't mean it literally he
also meant it figuratively
so but it was no no no meanness or
anything but then yeah it wasn't it
wasn't the physical advice it was so
mostly a sort of a psychological advice
so yeah well it's a good place where the
metaphorical and the literal meet yeah
well and the important part
that chapter I think apart is that I was
really trying to make a case and this is
a case that needs to be made over and
over and over until people understand it
there's a book I would recommend that
was recently written called the great
leveller Walter Shaw Dell and it's a
study of inequality and it's a brutal
book because one of the things she Adele
does is he calculates inequality
coefficients like the Gini coefficient
which is a measure of inequality
economic inequality and he looks over
the empirical data to see if there's any
relationship between the the left or the
right wing nature of a government and
the inequality in the society and so
what you'd hope because inequality is
actually a genuine problem you'd hope
that left-wing governments were better
at regulating inequality than right-wing
governments you'd hope that there's no
evidence for that whatsoever so I'm
making a case in Chapter 1 that
hierarchies exist and because
hierarchies exist inequality exists or
at least the two things are are
indistinguishable at many levels but
that you can't blame the existence of
hierarchy or inequality on something
proximal like capitalism or Western
society inequality is the rule all the
way back down to crustaceans and so when
the Marxists complain about inequality
and how intractable it is well they have
a point but when they blame it on
capitalism they're not taking the
problem seriously it's way worse than
the Marxist think because inequality is
genuinely a problem now the yeah but
it's a problem in in in a bunch of ways
the first is is that those at the top
tend to get more and those at the bottom
tend to end up with zero and zero is
really not good now you might say well
in a capitalist society in a modern
industrial capitalist society people
tend not to end up at zero so much and
that seems to be true it is definitely
the case and and I think Pinker has done
a good job of outlining this the people
at human progress org are doing a good
job of the two
it's definitely the case that our modern
societies are making the poor much less
absolutely poor so we've we've decreased
poverty worldwide between 2000 and 2012
by 50% a massive accomplishment we
should be partying in the streets about
it
it's an amazing accomplishment but
inequality is still a problem so so that
chapters about how deep the problem is
now the suggestion is is that to compete
in a world where there's unequal outcome
your best bet is to take the full
tragedy of being full-frontal
essentially right to open yourself up to
the catastrophe of existence and to move
forward with courage and and and with
nobility and with with truth on your
tongue
that's your best bet and I do believe
that now I can give you an example of
that we did research on a program called
the Future authoring program and it's a
part of the suite that's offered at self
authoring calm and we did the research
the idea was to produce psychological
interventions that were very cost
effective that could be distributed to
many people but we wanted to test them
because you never know if you're idiots
intervention is gonna do something good
or something bad
that's like rule number one for a
serious social scientists assume your
idiot intervention will either be
useless or harmful because those are the
most likely outcomes right and any
social scientist who's truly credible
understands that those who don't are not
educated properly so anyways we tested
the future authoring program and we
mostly tested it in Holland and we did
some stratification by group so in
Holland this was at the Rotterdam school
of at the Rotterdam School of Management
and Erasmus University we had thousands
of University students do the future
authoring program where they laid out a
plan for their life
and they tried to optimize their lives
along they wanted to consider their
friendships intimate relationships
career choices educational choices
mental and physical health use of drugs
and alcohol and use of time productively
outside of work to optimize across all
those levels and then to avoid
catastrophic pitfalls so you write about
what your life could be like if you
could have what you needed in three to
five years and then what write about
what your life could be like if
everything fell apart on you and and
things went bad all right
so they all did this exercise now before
the exercise the Dutch women were
outperforming the Dutch men let's say
the Caucasians and the non-western
ethnic minority women were doing worse
than the Dutch men and the non-western
ethnic minority men were doing worse the
worst of all four groups about an eighty
five percent performance decrement
compared to the Dutch women two years
after the intervention they were doing
better than the Dutch women right man it
blew us away we couldn't believe and
that's research published with Michaela
shipper and and and some other
colleagues at from Holland and what was
so interesting about that was that a
psychological intervention seemed to
remove the barriers that were produced
by what was hypothetically a
sociological barrier it might be that if
you're you know an immigrant to a
country that you don't have your story
straight because it's so complicated
you know so you need a better plan
so and that's part of standing up it's
like okay man make a plan for the future
plan a good future and and move forward
towards it and also one one thing that I
took away from it was from the chapters
and take yourself seriously otherwise no
one else will yeah if you don't stand up
for yourself you will get pushed down
and pushed over and not be taking notice
oh yeah yeah well I think the way you
take yourself seriously is you you start
to construe yourself as a player in the
catastrophe of the world know the world
and this is a motif route 12 rules for
life in many ways
is a very dark book although it has a
very optimistic central message the
darkness is life is tragic and tainted
by malevolence but the optimism is
there's a hell of a lot more to you than
you think
and I don't think that's a message
that's really good for people because
everyone knows that life is a
catastrophe that's stated by malevolence
everyone knows that even if people don't
want to admit it at the bottom of their
heart they know it and I think they also
suspect that there's more to them than
meets the eye so and and so so the the
trick to taking yourself seriously is to
understand that your errors count they
make things worse like it really is the
case that it matters whether you get
your act together at least because if
you're fragmented and disillusioned and
resentful and angry and working to make
things worse you really can make them
worse the school shooters are a good
example of that people who become so
nihilistic and and desperate and then
angry that you know they they they
slaughter the innocent in in a in a fit
of vengefulness like that's third of the
bottom and of of the descent for human
beings it's really terrible you get the
sense I'm gonna divide this question
because the you you you you deal a lot
with Christianity and Christian thought
both mostly with the Old Testament but
also with the New Testament and the
Christian motifs and but you get the
sense from from your book that and from
your teachings and when we talk about
this that we can really create hell for
ourselves in this world and we have no
problem with creating a variety of
health for ourselves and for others so
that's within our grasp in our grasp you
bet
that's exactly right is that hell is
definitely within our grasp yeah
and and I think with our ingenuity we
can invent many kinds of health but I
would also do you think there's a do we
have the capacity to create paradise on
earth do you think is that within their
grasp I think that that's what we
struggle upwards toward you know I was
thinking recently about this this image
came to mind of st. Joseph's oratorio in
Montreal which is a huge religious
building it's one of the biggest
Cathedral I don't think it's a cathedral
because I think it's an oratorio
although I don't know technically the
difference but it's one of the biggest
religious edifices in the world and it
was built in the latter half of the 20th
century which is quite interesting
because most buildings of religious
significance weren't built that late but
anyways it's up on Mount Royal so it's
up on the hill and so it's the city on
the hill right it's the Universal City
on the hill it's an image of perfection
it's its lattice like stonework lit like
the interior of a forest devoted towards
hello everyone apologies for the delay I
hope this is all working I'm taking
questions from patreon people today so
there's 841 questions ready to go so
hopefully I'm up to this
what should teaching and research in the
humanities look like I'm going to grad
school for literature and I don't want
my work to serve ideological possession
well the thing is first of all is that
you kind of have to educate yourself
when you go to graduate school you know
you have your courses but I don't think
that you learn more than about 10% of
what graduate school can teach you by
taking the courses you have to read and
the mistake that most people read is
make is that they only read what's being
published in the last five or six years
in their own narrow field and that's
increasingly a bad idea
the libraries are full of classic books
and I would say take your field go back
to the beginning of the field at least
read the people who wrote the classic
works bring yourself up to date and then
familiarize yourself with as much
history as much history of art as much
history of literature and literature as
you can possibly manage you want to
learn as much as you can about
everything I would also say you have two
li that with a certain degree of
specialization you have to pick one
topic and really become expert at it but
it'll serve as a doorway to because
everything's connected it'll serve as a
doorway to what's behind it so you focus
on one thing and read as much as you can
on that that's your specific discipline
then outside of that read as widely as
you possibly can manage the other thing
I would really recommend and this is
also true if you're going to university
is it isn't enough to read you also have
to write and if you're gonna go to
graduate school you should write
everyday it's a good idea for anyone who
wants to develop themselves
intellectually but even half an hour a
day you know that's a hundred and eighty
hours a year that's a lot of thinking
because writing is thinking and you
should be writing out your understanding
of what you wrote or what you read and
the questions you have about it and
trying to formulate what you regard as
clear questions and problems and also
clear answers both of those and that's
how I would say you should approach
graduate school have you thought about
slowing down there are people worried
about how hard you're pushing yourself
with
the countless commitments yes well I
would say that those people worried
about that include I don't know if it's
me but certainly my family they're
worried about it but I'm putting
competent people around me increasingly
to handle the scheduling of the public
events for example and I have good
agents and a good publisher and I'm
learning how to manage this I think I've
I'm not really interested I suppose and
slowing down although it has been a bit
much in the last year and a half I I do
better in some ways when I'm working
flat out if my health was good it's
better than it was by a large margin and
maybe it's still getting better if my
health was good this none of this would
be an overwhelming challenge but I'm
trying to do everything I can to put my
health in order and many many things
have been fixed so yeah I thought about
slowing down but I've decided against it
I guess is really the final answer to
that that's the other thing you know
there are times in your life where it's
not time to slow down it's time to
become more efficient that's the thing
you can become so efficient you know you
end up doing things in five minutes that
would otherwise take you a week might
that might seem like an exaggeration but
and I suppose it is to some degree but
it's not that much of an exaggeration so
as you take on more responsibilities and
you determine that you're going to
become more efficient the responsibility
pushes the efficiency so what do they
say - there's time enough to sleep when
you're in the grave
many who respect your work feel your
tweets are often impulsive or even
expedient very funny in certain
interactions would you consider a change
in the way you tweet well I've been
considering that for a very long time
one of the things I did in the last
month which that I think was productive
Twitter's a hard dishearten to manage
because it rewards impulsivity and I
have somewhat of a temper and I suspect
that it's maybe I'm more susceptible to
being to being tempted to respond in a
too forceful manner maybe I'm more
tempted by that then I should be but
Twitter is really useful I mean it does
keep me updated with regards to the
ongoing let's say war that's raging at
the bottom of our culture and it doesn't
able me to stay in contact with people
at least to some degree and it's a great
way of communicating small but at least
in principle important ideas and also to
let people know about what I'm doing on
YouTube and with the tours and and all
of that people seem to respond
positively to those sorts of
notifications so what I did do in the
last month was to find people I tweeted
out one day I asked people to send me
the Twitter handles of organizations or
individuals who were reporting on
positive developments in a credible and
realistic way human progress org seems
to be doing that really well I thought
it would be good to tilt my Twitter feed
toward or to my Twitter actions towards
things that are positive and also true
as much as possible and so I've started
doing that in the last month I feel
somewhat of an obligation
- if I'm being discussed publicly by
journalists or or other professors and
they misrepresent me or misrepresent the
ideas that they're purporting to discuss
then I feel like I have a moral
obligation - I suppose one is to defend
myself I suppose and certainly to object
to the MIS utilization of ideas by my
fellow academics I don't know if that's
uh I don't know if that's reasonable or
not it's not easy to figure out in a
situation like this how much you shut up
how much you stay patient how much you
push back how much you fight how how
firmly you respond whether or not to use
wit I mean the rule I tried to outline
in in my book twelve rules for life
there's a chapter called don't let your
children do anything that makes you
dislike them and there's a philosophy of
discipline in there and and it really
has two dimensions let's say or two it's
it's at the juncture of two ideas one
idea is that you don't want to make any
more rules than necessary because you
get tangled up in them so minimum
necessary rules that's a good guideline
for setting up any structure even in
dealing with yourself and then if you're
going to have rules you have to enforce
them because otherwise they're not rules
and so how do you enforce them with
minimal necessary force and some of that
has to be played with you know and
experimented with so you know at minimal
force is those are really good
principles and I try to govern myself by
them in my Twitter behavior but and I
hope that that's successful
you know sometimes when I've gone after
people I went after a couple of
journalists in Canada last year who
wrote I would what I would regard as
scurrilous and incompetent articles
that's a bad combination and you know it
was kind of a harsh exchange I would say
but it isn't clear that it was the wrong
thing to do
so it's hard to know how much you have
to skirt the ragged edge of disaster if
you want to do things right so anyways I
am changing the way I tweet because I'm
trying to make it the bulk of it
informative and positive I guess I
should say something about that too you
know there's a lot of really good things
going on in the world so we have poverty
absolute poverty between the year 2000
and 2012 which was three years ahead of
what the UN had hoped would happen you
know in cynics say well you have
absolute poverty and but the cutoff was
kind of arbitrary it was a dollar ninety
a day if I remember correctly which
obviously is quite low so it's not a
real transformation it's like it's a
real transformation some number had to
be picked to represent absolute poverty
and I don't suspect the UN erred on the
side of capitalist over optimism perhaps
they did but hundreds of thousands of
people are being connected to the power
grid every day fresh waters available
not to fewer and fewer people but to
more and more people and that's
happening extremely rapid rapidly no
starvation in India and China is a thing
completely of the past you never hear
about that and that's pretty much the
case for the rest of the world except
now and then for political reasons so
you know everybody's got a cell phone or
an and anybody who doesn't is gonna have
one in the next 10 years and that puts
in people's hands a degree of
communication and access that would have
been absolutely incomprehensible even 15
years ago
so it seems to me that the reason to
that I changed it seemed to me that it
was worthwhile to change the way that I
was using Twitter because all these good
things are happening and just
concentrating on this polarization
process that seems to have gripped us in
the West seems counterproductive given
all those good things that are going on
in the background now that doesn't make
what's going on in the West with regards
to political polarization trivial but it
does set it inside a much more positive
context so that's something to keep in
mind
whatever clients need for autonomy /
identity in therapy they would prefer
that which is meaningful and therefore
under the under their control is this
not unhealthy hmm I'm not exactly sure
how to meet what to make of that
question well first of all let's try
whatever clients need for autonomy
identity in therapy that's paramount I
mean in again in my book and in Chapter
nine assume the person that you're
listening to knows something you don't
that's so that you can learn something
maybe because you need to learn
something because like what do you know
in therapy I don't think that if you're
a good therapist you try to take
responsibility for the decisions that
your clients make like you don't take
that decision-making onto yourself
because you have to adopt a position of
radical ignorance no a person is sitting
across from you and this is the true
true of every person you know a person
is sitting across from you and they
don't understand themselves but you
really don't understand them and if
you're a therapist or maybe even if
you're a friend or a partner for that
matter the person wants help and so
something's wrong as far as they are
concerned and there might be some way to
fix it that's your initial starting
place I would say and both you have to
kind of agree on that in a
psychotherapeutic situation well but you
don't know what's wrong you know you
know something's wrong because the
person is upset enough to come and seek
counseling so they want to set their
life right but you have no idea what's
wrong you don't know anything about the
way they think or what what they value
or what their past is or or how or what
they're what they're like
physiologically or what their
temperament is like or or what how
things are going in their relationships
or what their career is like you just
the things you don't know about that
person man it's it's intersectionality
gone mad I can tell you that
and so you got to listen and let the
persons tell you what it is that's wrong
as if you don't know because you don't
know and and so and you have to ask
questions of clarification and but you
always have to remember not only do you
not know what's wrong maybe the person
doesn't know what's wrong it's highly
probable they know that something's
wrong but they don't know exactly what
and they certainly don't know what
caused it and so you got to listen
radically and clarify and ask questions
and make sure you're not confused so
that you do understand and maybe you can
help the person start to understand what
they're talking about or thinking about
just talking in thinking are very much
the same thing and then then well maybe
you get some sense of what's wrong and
maybe some sense of how it came about
god only knows how long that'll take
and then the next thing you have to
figure out is well what would a solution
look like
like even hypothetically what does the
person want and and do they know what
they want and if they don't know what
they want then how can you help them
figure out what they want and how do you
help them figure out what they need and
how do you help them admit to that and
all of that and so that's a boatload of
listening there again you know and it's
the same in every relationship that you
have if you try to foster that person's
development you want to find out well
what's wrong in their lives and you know
but they have to figure that out because
they're the ones that they're the ones
that will have to bear the
responsibility for the decisions so you
don't want to take that onto yourself
it's like well I don't want to tell you
what to do because I don't know what you
should do like we can both agree that
you should move toward what's better for
you and hopefully for the people around
you because we would include that in the
definition of better right because
otherwise it's not sustainable but we
have to talk forever to find out what
that is and you have to be you have to
be very incautious to think that you can
make decisions for someone it's an
arrogant move and it's an ill-advised
move and you shouldn't do it if you're
properly terrified of your errors
because well again I'll repeat
you're not the one that's going to have
to take responsibility for the decisions
they are so it has to be left in their
hands and so so autonomy it's everything
in a clinical practice no that doesn't
mean that you can't help a person
strategize you know you might say well
as you're moving towards some
formulation of the problem you might say
well here's five things that it might be
or here's a list of things that might be
bothering you or you know you can make
suggestions but they can't be baited
suggestions either you can't overweight
the one you hope they'll choose you know
again it's it's incautious a lot of this
I would say I learned well from thinking
about it but also from reading Carl
Rogers I'd really recommend Carl Rogers
you know he was a smart guy when it came
to listening you can really learn a lot
from and and he was also smart in how we
outlined the clients need for autonomous
development and that's the development
of the individual so any update on your
plans to start providing independent
classes or an online university well I'm
working with some young people right now
who are very very smart and the first
thing we're we're gonna build modules by
the looks of things
each module hopefully will stand alone
because then we can test them instead of
launching like a whole University which
seems to be a crazy thing to do we're
gonna make independent modules for
different purposes and then launch them
probably as quasi independent products
let's say to see if there's a demand for
them so the one we're working right now
on right now and I'm not gonna say too
much about it is a competitive writing
module where you'll be able to look at
paragraphs and paragraphs that other
people have written of a variety of
sorts now I don't think I'll tell you
about that I better wait so anyways
we're going to write a competitive
writing module and because one of the
big problems the biggest problems that
has to be solved for any online
university is how do you teach people to
write because you don't want the
university just to be lectures and
multiple-choice tests even though
that could be done with some degree of
reasonable competence mostly what you
want when you educate people is to
educate them not so much into like
factual knowledge but intellectual skill
they have to be able to speak so we'll
need a speaking module and they have to
be able to think and we'll have to
develop exercises that are relevant to
critical thinking writing is a big part
of that so and they have to be able to
read and so those are the big problems
to solve and then the other problem for
an online university is accreditation
obviously we've got some ideas about
that and also what you do with regards
to the social element because that's a
huge part of university is to develop an
intellectual peer group right that's
really an important part in you it's not
going to be easy to replace that online
because you know the relationships that
people make in college often last well
they can last for decades or maybe they
can last a lifetime for that matter but
it's a place where you can eliezer adult
identity and the peers that you pick are
a big part of that of course some of the
peers that you pick when you go to
university should be the great people of
the past that's really what university
is for is to make them in some sense
your peers now that you know that's
pushing it because you have to do a lot
of work before they become peers anyways
we're definitely working on this um the
part of the problem is is that I'm it's
hard it's what's the problem I'm doing
enough other things at the moment so
that finding the time to do this
credibly in addition is one of the major
challenges so I married young and have
had only one sexual partner now I desire
variety but value my marriage and will
not cheat any insight and overcoming
this conflict as a matter of fact yes I
would say get the variety with your
partner you know there's lots of
games you can play to spice up your
sexual life you know buy some lingerie
like buy a hundred pieces you know buy
something sexy for your partner to wear
maybe multiple things buy some buy
whatever you need that you might want to
experiment with you know I mean you have
to introduce that spirit of pretend play
that you had when you were a little kid
into your sexual life and then you have
many partners in the same person and you
put some thought into it you know I mean
sex is something that that sex is a
domain in which expertise can be
developed just like any other domain and
some of that's play and fantasy play and
all of that and some of its sexual
technique and and I guess then the other
thing I would say is take stock of each
other and see if there are things that
you could do in your life that would
make you more attractive to one another
you know those are hard questions
because no one wants to say well you
know I'd be more attracted to my wife
sexually if she just acted xwy and the
same with regards to how a wife's
contemplation of her husband but those
are the real questions man it's like if
your partner isn't acting in a manner
that is sexually attractive then either
there's something wrong with you or
there's something wrong with them and of
course I know people have ill health and
all of that I'm not talking about that
but those harsh judgments that your
sexual attraction makes are also very
useful ways of orienting yourself
I've thought a long time about what motivates behavior like that
manifested at Columbine and at Sandy Hook and then of course most recently at Parkland and
because of the Parkland event I thought that I would read a chapter from my book to everyone.
It's Chapter 6, Rule 6, 'Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World'
and it's an extended meditation on the kind of motivations that drive the people who wish to slaughter innocents as a form of revenge against God.
So, I'm going to read it to you and you can let me know what you think.
Rule 6: Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World
A Religious Problem.
It does not seem reasonable to
describe the young man who shot 20 children and 6 staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton
Connecticut in 2012 as a religious person.
This is equally true for the Colorado theater gunman and the Columbine high school shooters,
but these murderous individuals had a problem with reality that existed at a religious depth.
 
As one of the members of the Columbine duo wrote,
"The human race isn't worth fighting for - only worth killing.
Give the earth back to the animals,
they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore".
People who think such things view being itself as
inequitable and harsh to the point of corruption and human being in particular as
contemptible.
They appoint themselves
supreme adjudicators of reality and find it wanting.
They're the ultimate critics.
The deeply cynical writer continues,
"If you recall your history, the Nazis came up with a final solution to the Jewish problem.
Kill them all.
Well, in case you haven't figured it out, I say kill mankind,
no one should survive".
For such individuals the world of experience is  insufficient and evil; so to hell with everything.
What is happening when someone comes to think in this manner.
A great German play, 'Faust', a tragedy written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
addresses that issue.
The play's main character, a scholar named Heinrich Faust, trades his immortal soul to the devil:
Mephistopheles.
In return, he receives whatever he desires while still alive on earth.
In Goethe's play Mephistopheles is the eternal adversary of being.
He has a central defining credo,
"I am the spirit who negates
and rightly so.
For all that comes to be, deserves to perish wretchedly.
It were better nothing would begin, thus everything that your terms sin,
destruction, evil represent,
that is my proper element."
Goethe considered this hateful sentiment so important, so key to the central element of vengeful human destructiveness,
that he had Mephistopheles say it a second time
phrased somewhat differently in part two of the play written many years later.
People often think in the Mephistophelian manner, although
they seldom act upon their thoughts as brutally as the mass murderers of School, College and Theater.
Whenever we experience injustice, real or imagined, whenever we encounter tragedy or fall prey to the machinations
of others.
Whenever we experience the horror and pain of our own apparently arbitrary limitations,
the temptation to question being and then to curse it, rises foully from the darkness.
Why must innocent people suffer so terribly? What kind of bloody horrible planet is this, anyway?
Life is, in truth, very hard. Everyone is destined for pain and slated for destruction.
Sometimes suffering is clearly the result of personal faults, such as willful blindness, poor decision-making or malevolence.
 
In such cases, when it appears to be self-inflicted, it may even seem just.
"People get what they deserve", you might contend.
That's cold comfort however, even when true.
Sometimes,
if those who are suffering change their behavior, then their lives would unfold less tragically.
But human control is limited,
susceptibility to despair, disease, ageing and death is
universal.
In the final analysis we do not appear to be the architects of our own fragility,
whose fault is it then?
People who are very ill or worse, who have a sick child will inevitably find themselves asking this question,
whether they are religious believers or not.
The same is true of someone who finds his shirtsleeve caught in the gears of a giant bureaucracy,
who is suffering through a tax audit or fighting an interminable lawsuit or divorce
and it's not only the obviously suffering who are tormented by the need to blame someone or something for the intolerable state of their being.
At the height of his fame,
influence and creative power, for example, the towering Leo Tolstoy himself began to question the value of human
existence
He reasoned in this way:
"My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way of rational knowledge
except a denial of life. And in faith, I could find nothing except a denial of reason.
And this was even more impossible than a denial of life.
According to rational knowledge, it followed that life is evil and people know it.
They do not have to live, yet they have lived and they do live just as I myself had lived
even though I had known for a long time that life is meaningless and evil.
Try as he might, Tolstoy could only identify
four means of escaping from such thoughts
One
was retreating into childlike ignorance of the problem.
Another was pursuing mindless pleasure.
The third was
continuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless knowing beforehand that nothing can come of it.
He identified that particular form of escape with weakness.
The people in this category know that death is better than life,
but they do not have the strength to act rationally and quickly put an end to the delusion by killing themselves.
Only the fourth and final mode of escape involved
strength and energy. It consists of destroying life once one has realized that life is evil and meaningless.
Tolstoy relentlessly followed his thoughts, only unusually strong and logically consistent people act in this manner
having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead
are greater than those of the living and that it is better not to exist,
they act and put an end to this stupid joke. And they use any means of doing it: a rope around the neck,
water, a knife in the heart,
a train.
Tolstoy wasn't pessimistic enough. The stupidity of the joke being played on us does not merely motivate suicide,
it motivates murder,
mass murder often followed by suicide.
That is a far more effective
existential protest.
By June of 2016, unbelievable as it may seem, there had been 1000 mass killings
defined as four or more people shot in a single incident
excluding the shooter in the U.S. in twelve hundred and sixty days
That's one such event on five of every six days for more than three years.
Everyone says, "we don't understand".
How can we still pretend that?
Tolstoy understood more than a century ago.
Tthe ancient authors of the biblical story of Cain and Abel
understood as well more than twenty centuries ago.
They described murder as the first act of post identic history and not just murder
but fratricidal murder. Murder not only of someone innocent, but of someone ideal and good.
And murder done consciously
to spite the creator of the universe.
Today's killers tell us the same thing in their own words.
Who would dare say, that this is not the worm at the core of the apple.
But we will not listen, because the truth cuts too close to the bone.
Even for a mind as profound as that of the celebrated Russian author,  there was no way out.
How can the rest of us manage when a man of Tolstoi's stature admits defeat?
For years he hid his guns from himself and would not walk with a rope in hand in case he hanged himself.
How can a person who is awake avoid outrage at the world?
Vengeance or transformation.
A religious man might shake his fist in desperation at the apparent injustice and blindness of God.
Even Christ himself felt abandoned before the cross or so the story goes.
More agnostic or atheistic individual might blame fate or meditate bitterly on the brutality of chance.
Another might tear himself apart
searching for the character flaws underlying his suffering and deterioration
These are all variations on a theme. The name of the target changes, but the underlying psychology remains constant.
Why?
Why is there so much suffering and cruelty?
Well, perhaps it really is God's doing
or the fault of blind pointless fate, if you're inclined to think that way.
And there appears to be every reason to think that way.
But what happens if you do?
Mass murderers believe that the suffering attendant upon existence
justifies judgment and revenge as the Columbine boys so clearly indicated;
'I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. Before I leave this worthless place,
I will kill whoever I deem unfit for anything, especially life. If you pissed me off in the past,
you will die, if I see you.
You might be able to piss off others and have it eventually all blow over,
but not me.
I don't forget people who wronged me.'
One of the most vengeful murderers of the 20th century, the terrible Carl Panzram, was raped,
brutalized and betrayed in the Minnesota institution
responsible for his rehabilitation
when he was a delinquent juvenile.
He emerged enraged beyond measure
as a burglar, arsonist, rapists and serial killer.
He aimed consciously and consistently at destruction. Even keeping track of the dollar value of the property he burned.
He started by hating the individuals who had hurt him.
His resentment grew until his hatred encompassed all of mankind, and he didn't stop there.
His destructiveness was aimed in some fundamental manner at God himself.
There's no other way of phrasing it,
Panzram raped, murdered and burned to express his outrage at being.
He acted as if someone was responsible. The same thing happens in the story of Cain and Abel.
Cain's sacrifices
are rejected. He exists in suffering. He calls out God
and challenges the being he created.
God refuses his plea. He tells Cain that his trouble is self-induced.
Cain, in his rage, kills Abel, God's favorite and truth be known, Cain's idol.
Cain is jealous, of course, of a successful brother, but he destroys Abel primarily to spite God.
This is the truest version of what happens when people take their vengeance to the ultimate extreme.
Pansram's response was, and this is what is so terrible,
perfectly understandable. The details of his autobiography
revealed that he was one of Tolstoy's strong and logically consistent people. He was a powerful,
consistent, fearless actor. He had the courage of his convictions.
How could someone like him be expected to forgive and forget given what had happened to him?
Truly terrible things happen to people,
it's no wonder they're out for revenge.
Under such conditions vengeance seems a moral necessity.
How can it be distinguished from the demand for justice after all?
After the experience of terrible atrocity, isn't forgiveness just cowardice or lack of willpower?
Such questions torment me, but people emerge from terrible pasts to do good and not evil,
although such an accomplishment can seem superhuman.
I've met people who managed to do it.
I know a man, a great artist, who emerged from just such a school as the one described by
Panzram, only this man was thrown into it as an innocent five-year-old, fresh from a long stretch in the hospital where he had suffered
measles, mumps and chickenpox
simultaneously.
Incapable of speaking the language of the school, deliberately isolated from his family, abused,
starved and otherwise tormented he emerged an angry broken young man.
He hurt himself badly in the aftermath with drugs and alcohol and other forms of self-destructive behavior.
He detested everyone. God,
himself and blind fate included.
But he put it in to all of that.
He stopped drinking.
He stopped hating,
although it still emerges in flashes.
He revitalized the artistic culture of his native tradition and trained young men to continue in his footsteps.
He produced a 50 foot totem pole
memorializing the events of his life and a canoe 40 feet long
from a single log of a kind rarely, if ever, produced now.
He brought his family together and held a great potlatch with 16 hours of dancing and hundreds of people in attendance
to express his grief and make peace with the past.
He decided to be a good person and then he did the impossible things required to live that way.
I had a client who did not have good parents. Her mother died when she was very young.
Her grandmother who raised her was a harridan, bitter and over-concerned with appearances.
She mistreated her granddaughter.
Punishing her for her virtues,
creativity, sensitivity, intelligence, unable to resist acting out her resentment for an admittedly hard life on
her granddaughter.
She had a better relationship with her father, but he was an addict who died badly while she cared for him.
My client had a son.
She perpetuated none of this with him
He grew up truthful and independent and hardworking and smart,
instead of widening the tear in the cultural fabric she inherited and transmitting it, she sewed it up.
She rejected the sins of her forefathers
Such things _can_ be done.
Nietzsche wrote these words:
"Distress, whether psychic, physical or intellectual
need not at all produce nihilism.
That is the radical rejection of value, meaning and desirability.
Such distress always permits a variety of interpretations."
What Nietzsche meant was this,
people who experience evil, may certainly desire to perpetuate it, to pay it forward,
but it is also possible to learn good by experiencing evil.
A bullied boy can mimic his tormentors,
but he can also learn from his own abuse, that it is wrong to push people around and make their lives miserable.
Someone tormented by her mother can learn from her terrible experiences, how important it is to be a good parent.
Many, perhaps even most, of the adults who abuse children, were abused themselves as children.
However, the majority of people who were abused as children
_do not_ abuse their own children. This is a well-established fact,
which can be demonstrated simply
arithmetically in this way: if one parent
abused three children and each of those children had three children and so on, then there would be three abusers in the first
generation, nine
in the second, twenty seven the third, eighty-one, the fourth and so on
exponentially. After twenty generations,
more than ten billion would have suffered childhood abuse.
More people than currently inhabit the planet, but instead, abuse disappears across generations.
People constrain its spread.
That's a testament to the genuine dominance of good over evil in the human heart.
The desire for vengeance, however justified, also bars the way to other productive thoughts.
The American English poet T.S. Eliot explained
why in his play, the cocktail party, one of his characters is not having a good time of it.
She speaks of her profound unhappiness to a psychiatrist. She says she hopes all her suffering is her own fault.
The psychiatrist is taken aback, he asks why?
She has thought long and hard about this, she says, and has come to the following conclusion;
if it's her fault
she might be able to do something about it. If it's God's fault however, if reality itself is flawed,
hell-bent on ensuring her misery
then she is doomed.
She couldn't change the structure of reality itself,
but maybe she could change her own life.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
the great Russian documenter of the abuses of Stalinism,
had every reason to question the structure of existence when he was imprisoned
in a Soviet labor camp in the middle of the terrible 20th century.
He had served as a soldier on the ill-prepared Russian frontlines in the face of a Nazi invasion.
He had been arrested, beaten and thrown into prison by his own people.
Then he was struck by cancer.
He could have become resentful and bitter, his life had been rendered
miserable by both Stalin and Hitler, two of the worst tyrants in history. He lived in brutal conditions,
vast stretches of his precious time were stolen from him and squandered.
He witnessed the pointless and degrading suffering and death of his friends and acquaintances,
then he contracted an extremely serious disease.
Solzhenitsyn had cause to curse God,
Jobe himself
barely had it as hard.
But the great writer, the profound
spirited defender of truth, did not allow his mind to turn towards vengeance and destruction.
He opened his eyes instead. During his many trials Solzhenitsyn, encountered people who comported themselves
nobly under horrific circumstances.
He contemplated their behavior deeply. Then, he asked himself the most difficult of questions,
had he personally contributed to the catastrophe of his life?
If so,
how?
He remembered his unquestioning support of the communist party in his early years.
He reconsidered his whole life,
he had plenty of time in the camps.
How had he missed the mark in the past?
How many times had he acted against his own conscience, engaging in actions that he knew to be wrong?
How many times had he betrayed himself and lied?
Was there any way that the sins of his past could be
rectified, atoned for, in the muddy hell of a Soviet gulag?
Solzhenitsyn pored over the details of his life with a fine-tooth comb,
he asked himself a second question and a third, can I stop making such mistakes now?
Can I repair the damage done by my past failures now?
He learned to watch and to listen. He found people he admired who were honest despite everything.
He took himself apart piece-by-piece,
let what was unnecessary and harmful die and resurrected himself. Then he wrote the Gulag Archipelago,
a history of the soviet prison camp system. It's a forceful terrible book
written with the overwhelming moral force of unvarnished truth. Its sheer outrage screamed
unbearably across hundreds of pages,
banned and for good reason in the USSR. It was smuggled to the west in
the 1970s and burst upon the world.
Solzhenitsyn's writing utterly and
finally demolished the intellectual credibility of communism as ideology or
society.
He took an axe to the trunk of the tree,
whose bitter fruits had nourished him so poorly and whose planting he had witnessed and supported.
One man's decision to change his life instead of cursing fate shook the whole
pathological system of communist tyranny to its core.
It crumbled entirely not so many years later and
Solzhenitsyn's courage was not the least of the reasons why.
He was not the only such person to perform such a miracle, Václav Havel, the persecuted writer who later
impossibly became the president of
Czechoslovakia, then of the new Czech Republic comes to mind as does Mahatma Ghandi.
Things fall apart.
Whole peoples have adamantly refused to judge reality, to criticize being, to blame God.
It's interesting to consider the Old Testament Hebrews in this regard, their travails followed a consistent pattern.
The stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel are truly ancient,
their origins vanish into the mysteries of time.
It's not until after the flood story in Genesis, that something like history as we understand it, truly starts.
It starts with Abraham.
Abraham's descendants become the Hebrew people of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible.
They enter a covenant with Yahwah,
with God, and began their recognizably historical adventures.
Under the leadership of a great man, the Hebrews organized themselves into a society and then an empire.
As their fortunes rise,
success breeds pride and arrogance. Corruption raises its ugly head.
The increasingly hubristic state becomes obsessed with power.
Begins to forget its duty to the widows and the orphans and deviates from its age-old
agreement with God.
A prophet arises
He brazenly and publicly reviles the authoritarian king and faithless country for their failures before God,
an act of blind courage, telling them of the terrible judgment to come.
When his wise words are not completely ignored, they are heeded too late.
God smites his wayward people dooming them to abject defeat in battle and generations of subjugation.
The Hebrews repent at length,
blaming their misfortune on their own failure to adhere to God's word.
They insisted themselves, that they could have done better.
They rebuild their state and the cycle begins again.
This is life.
We build structures to live in, we build families and states and countries.
We abstract the principles upon, which those structures are founded and formulate systems of belief.
At first, we inhabit those structures and beliefs like Adam and Eve in Paradise.
But success makes us complacent, we forget to pay attention. We take what we have for granted.
We turn a blind eye. We fail to notice that things are changing or that corruption is taking root
and everything falls apart.
Is that the fault of reality? Or God?
Or do things fall apart because we have not paid sufficient attention?
When the hurricane hit New Orleans and the town sank under the waves, was that a natural disaster?
The Dutch prepare their dikes for the worst storm in 10,000 years.
Had New Orleans followed that example, no tragedy would have occurred.
It's not that no one knew. The Flood Control Act of 1965
mandated improvements in the levee system that held back Lake Pontchartrain.
The system was to be completed by 1978. 40 years later only 60 percent of the work had been done
Willful blindness and corruption took the city down.
A Hurricane is an act of God. But failure to prepare when the necessity for preparation is well-known,
that's sin. That's failure to hit the mark and the wages of sin is  death.
Romans
6:23
The ancient Jews always blamed themselves when things fell apart.
They acted as if God's goodness, the goodness of reality, was
axiomatic and took responsibility for their own failure.
That's insanely
responsible.
But the alternative is to judge reality as insufficient, to criticize being itself and to sink
into resentment and the desire for revenge. If you are suffering,
well,
that's the norm. People are limited and life is tragic.
If your suffering is unbearable however, and you are starting to become corrupted,
here's something to think about:
Clean up your life.
Consider your circumstances.
Start small.
Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you?
Are you working hard on your career or even your job? Or are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back and drag you down?
Have you made peace with your brother?
Are you treating your spouse and your children with dignity and respect?
Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being?
Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities?
Have you said what you need to say to your friends and family members?
Are there things that you could do, that you know you could do, that would make things around you better?
Have you cleaned up your life?
If the answer is no,
here's something to try:
Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong!
Start stopping today!
Don't waste time questioning, how you know that what you're doing is wrong, if you're certain that it is.
Inopportune questioning can confuse without enlightening, as well as deflecting you from action.
You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why, your entire being can tell you something that you can neither explain nor
articulate.
Every person is too complex to know themselves completely and we all contain wisdom that we cannot comprehend.
So,
simply stop, when you apprehend however dimly that you should stop.
Stop acting in that particular
despicable manner. Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.
Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honor.
You can use your own standards of judgment, you can rely on yourself for guidance.
You don't have to adhere to some external arbitrary code of behavior,
although, you should not overlook the guidance of your culture. Life is short
and you don't have time to figure out everything on your own.
The wisdom of the past was hard-earned and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.
Don't blame capitalism,
the radical left or the iniquity of your enemies.
Don't reorganize the state until you have ordered your own experience. Have some humility!
If you cannot bring peace to your household, how dare you try to rule a city?
Let your own soul guide you, watch what happens over the days and weeks.
When you are at work you will begin to say, what you really think.
You will start to tell your wife, or your husband or your children or your parents what you really want and need.
When you know that you have left something undone, you will act to correct the omission.
Your head will start to clear up as you stop filling it with lies. Your experience will improve as you stop
distorting it with inauthentic actions.
You will then begin to discover new, more subtle things, that you are doing wrong. Stop doing those too.
After some months and years of diligent effort your life will become simpler and less complicated.
Your judgment will improve. You will untangle your past, you will become stronger and less bitter,
you will move more confidently into the future.
You will stop making your life
unnecessarily difficult.
You will then be left with the inevitable bare tragedies of life,
but they will no longer be compounded with bitterness and deceit.
Perhaps you will discover that your now less corrupted
soul, much stronger than it might otherwise have been, is now able to bear those remaining
necessary, minimal,
inescapable tragedies.
Perhaps you will even learn to encounter them so that they stay tragic,
merely tragic, instead of
degenerating into outright hellishness.
Maybe your anxiety and hopelessness and resentment and anger, however murderous initially,
will recede.
Perhaps your un-corrupted soul will then see its existence as a genuine good, as something to celebrate
even in the face of your own vulnerability.
Perhaps you will become an ever more powerful force for peace and whatever is good.
Perhaps you will then see that if all people did this in their own lives the world might stop being an evil place.
After that with continued effort, perhaps it could even stop being a tragic place.
Who knows what existence might be like, if we all decided to strive for the best.
Who knows what eternal heavens might be established by our spirits, purified by truth, aiming skyward
right here on the fallen earth.
Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.
well I have a question I guess I'd like
to know a little bit more about why you
specifically chose the title the master
and the emissary yeah that that's to
meterics plain what I believe to be the
relationship is Union hemispheres and
they like most other things in life
they're in equal and asymmetrical and
that one of the brain hemispheres sees
more than the other that is the one that
I've designated the most it mm-hmm and
it was the right hemisphere mm-hmm
that's a weird inversion because people
often think of the left hemisphere is
the one that's like dominant they do
they do traditionally that's been the
case but as is becoming ever clearer the
right hemisphere this has been a real
steep learning curve for some people but
the variety emma sphere is in many ways
more reliable sees more understands more
than the left hemisphere is like a sort
of hybrid high functioning bureaucrat in
a way mm-hmm and the idea of the story
was simply that certain matters needed
to be delegated not only because as it
were the master couldn't do everything
he needed an emissary to go abroad and
do some of it but also that he must not
get involved with a certain point of
view otherwise he'd lose what it was
that he did to see so that's what I'm
really saying there is that there's a
good reason why
evolutionarily speaking the two brain
hemispheres are separate and when you
say doesn't get involved what's the
advantage of that that detachment from
the involvement well it's it rimoni
cahal you who you know is a great
history ologist yeah and one of his
findings was in primates are more
inhibitory in neurons than in any other
animals and there are more in humans and
than in any other primate and there are
many and that's proposed speaking
proportionally proportionately and there
are more kinds as well so we think that
about 25% of the entire
cortex is is inhibitory right so it's a
very strong effect and the corpus
callosum seems to be very largely in the
end inhibiting function in the other
hemisphere and that is I think because
over time the two hemispheres have had
to specialize there are reasons why
actually it can't be I'm not going to go
into now but I was talking about just a
few days ago that the evolutionary
psychiatry meeting but there are reasons
why the corpus callosum has had to
become more selective and to inhibit
quite a lot of what's going on in the
other hemisphere because it enables the
two to do distinct things mhm and of
course they have to work together but
usually good teamwork doesn't mean
everyone trying to do the same role
right so differentiation is very
important for two elements to work
together and inhibition is one way of
doing that so effectively the two takes
on the world if you like that the
hemispheres have are not easily
compatible right and we're not aware of
that because at a level below
consciousness there's a meta control
center that is bringing them together so
in ordinary experience we don't feel
we're in two different worlds but
effectively we are and they have
different qualities and different goals
different values different different
takes on what is important in the in the
world and what meeting or whatever so
let me let me ask you about I've got
I've developed a conceptual scheme for
for thinking about the relationship
between the two hemispheres and I'm kind
of I've been curious about what you
think about it and how it might map on
to or not your your ideas so I've been
really interested in the orienting
reflex and discovered by so club I think
back in about 1962 right he was a
student of Laureus and the orienting
reflex is manifested when something at
least in their terminology something
unpredictable happened i've thought much
more recently than it's actually when
something undesired happened happens and
the laboratory constraints obscured that
and that turned out to actually be
important but good um so and i kind of
put together the ideas
the orang ting reflex with some of the
things I learned from Jung Jung's
observations on the function of art and
dreams so imagine that you have a
conceptual scheme laid out right we
could say that it's it's it's
linguistically media its enforced on the
world and then there are exceptions to
that to that conceptual scheme those are
anomalies that are unexpected and the
orienting reflex Orient's you towards
those yes and so those are things that
aren't fading property in your
conceptual scheme that you have to
figure out you know the first thing you
do is react defensively essentially
because it might be dangerous yeah and
then your exploratory systems are
activated yes so and the exploratory
systems first of all our enhanced
attention from an attentional
perspective but then and this is where
the art issue sort of creeps into it
it's the idea would be something like
the right hemisphere generates an
imaginative landscape of possibility
that could map that anomaly so you can
kind of experience that it's at night
you know like say you're sitting alone
at night it's 2:00 or 3:00 in the
morning you're kind of tired maybe
you're in an unfamiliar place and
there's a noise that happens that
shouldn't happen in another room yep you
can play with that so for example if you
open the door slightly and put your hand
in to turn on the light and you watch
what happens your mind will fill with
imaginative representations of what
might be a route is right so it's like
the the the landscape of anomaly will be
populated with something like
imaginative demons yes and that's a
first pass approximation and it seems to
me that that's a right hemispheric
function and then that as you explore
further that imaginative domain which
which circumscribes what might be is
restrained and constrained and
constrained and constrained until you
get what it actually is and that's
specialized and realized it's something
like that yeah does that seem like a
reasonable what do you think about that
I love that host of reasons one is you
mentioned defense and one of the ideas
behind my hypothesis is the right
hemisphere is on the lookout for
predators right whereas the left
hemisphere is looking for prey and this
has been confirmed in many species of
things I'd never heard
second part amphibians and mammals yes
[Music]
so and you're in left hemispheric mode
you're more in predator Morgan Williams
well I mean of course we are not lizards
or toads or marmoset or whatever but in
animals generally speaking yeah this is
the case getting in grasping and after
all our left hemisphere is the one that
controls the grasping head is left
hemisphere and exploring which you
mentioned yeah is more right hemisphere
and when the when a frontal function is
deficient people often go into warm
somatic mode of the hand of that side
and the left hand it's usually
exploratory motions meaningless ones but
trying to explore the environment and
with the right hand its grasping
pointlessly at things so they as where
they're automatic thing is with the with
the left hand the right hemisphere to
explore with the right hand the left
hemisphere to grasp so when you said
exploratory and you said defense and you
said also opening up to possibilities
these are all aspects or the way the
right hemisphere I often say the right
hemisphere opens up to possibilities
right whereas the left hemisphere wants
to close down to a certainty right and
you need chaos an order and and you know
I loved in your talk you talked about a
chaos and order but if I may say so you
seemed and maybe you'd like to gloss
that a little you seem to suggest that
it would be good we can't get rid of
chaos but you've seemed to imply that
would be better if we could whereas my
view is that chaos and order are
necessary to one another and there is a
proper sort of harmony balance okay I
think that's that's as deep a question
as you could possibly ask I would say
because I'm saying some of them I would
say there's a central theological issue
there and yes you there's the you know
in Genesis the proper environment of
humanity is construed as a garden yes
and so I see that as the optimal balance
of chaos and order nice nature is
flourish isn't it prolific and is
chaotic
yeah then if you add harmony to that you
garden yes where you live in the garden
you're supposed to tend the garden okay
so now the garden is created it's a
walled space yes even as a walled space
yeah Ferriday side so it's a walled
garden that's it now the thing is as
soon as you make a wall you try to keep
what's outside out but you can't because
the boundaries between things are
permeable so if you're going to have
reality and you're gonna have a bounded
space you're gonna have a snake in the
garden yes
now then the question is what the hell
should you do about that make the
walls so high that no snake can possibly
get in or should or should you allow for
the possibility of snakes but make
yourself strong enough so that you can
contend with them and I think there's
there's an answer there that goes deep
to the question of even maybe why the
theological question of why God allowed
evil to exist in the world I agree with
you it's like well do you make people
safe or strong and strong is better and
safe might not be commensurate with
being like it might not be possible to
exist and to be safe well our existence
is predicated on the fact that we dies
well what's never safe well it's
certainly bounded yeah this inevitably
wrapped up with you sort of finitude
yeah there's this there's a lovely
lovely Jewish idea and ancient ideas one
of the most profound ideas I've ever
come across and so it's a kind of a Zen
koan and here it is is that so it's a
question about the classic attributes of
God omniscient omnipresent and
omnipotent hmm what is it being with
those three attributes Locke mm-hmm what
kind of question is that
the answer is limitation yeah and the
second answer is that's the
justification for being is that the
unlimited lacks the limited exactly and
so because a limited is us for anything
to come into existence there needs to be
an element of resistance and so things
are never predicated on one pole of what
is always a dipole right
everything is has that type oh yes it is
and it's imaged in the yin-yang idea but
it seems to me very important because in
our culture we often seem to suppose
that certain things are just good and
other things are just bad and it'd be
good if we could get rid of the bad ones
but actually by pursuing
certain good things that are good within
measure too far they become bad not so
cool right but now let's go back to your
a normally thing because Ramachandran
calls the right hemisphere the unnormal
yes yes and so I think that that's a
very important point because there are
two ways you can react to an anomaly
one is to and both have to be explored
one is to try and prove that it's not
really an anomaly and therefore you can
carry on with things as normal
yes and the other is hopeful that's that
you hope that that's it that's the
that's the typical left hemisphere
approach doesn't want anything to have
to shift yeah and quite reasonably you
don't want to be chaotically shifting if
you're onto a good thing too stressful
exactly it takes too much work it and
you might actually be mistaken in a way
it's perfectly correct to be wary but
it's not correct to be so wary that you
blot out anomalies and there's a lot of
evidence as I'm sure you know that the
left hemisphere simply blocks out
everything that doesn't fit with its
take it doesn't see it acting at all
right so it's there's a hugely important
element in the right hemisphere going
hang on but there may be another way of
thinking that will accommodate this
better and actually good science needs
yes to be skeptical about anomalies
otherwise the be chaos it also needs to
be able to shift when an anomaly is
rightly large enough right right or
there is quite a lot of them and they
don't really fit very well into this
exactly yes yes so there's there's
another observation that Jung made which
I loved I love this observation he was
trying to account for radical
personality transformation right and so
his idea was this and I think it's it's
it's commensurate with the ideas of
inhibition between the two hemispheres
so let's imagine the left is habitually
inhibiting the function of the right to
keep fear under control it does that all
sorts of ways but so imagine that the
right is reacting to anomalies and it's
aggregating them okay the left can't
deal with them so the right is
aggregating anomalies and maybe that's
starting to manifest itself and
nightmarish dreams for examples like
that these normally sir piling up it's
indication that you're on shifting sand
well so then imagine that the right
hemisphere aggregates anomalies and then
it starts to detect patterns in the
anomalies and so now it starts to
generate
what you might consider a counter
hypothesis and the left psychosis if
that counter hypothesis gets to the
point where the total sum in some sense
of the anomalies plus the already mapped
territory can be mapped by that new
pattern then at some point it will shift
yes and the person will kick into a new
yes now it's like a piagetian stage
transition except more dramatic it is
and what a fusion stage transition is
also like and subsumes those is regalian
Alf fable the idea that a thing is
opposed by something else
but when it when there is a synthesis
it's not that one of them is annihilated
right there both transformed and taken
up into the new hole which embraces what
before looks like look like an
opposition okay so here's a question for
you you know when I read Thomas Kuhn I
was reading to a PSA at the same time
and I knew that PSA was aware of codes
work by the way and the problem I had
with cone and the interpretation
interpreters of Kuhn is they don't seem
to get something who interpret Kuhn has
a moral relativist in some sense yeah
you don't seem to get the idea of
increased generalizability of a plan so
let's say I have a theory and a bunch of
anomalies accrue and I have to wipe out
the theory and so then I wipe out the
theory and I incorporate the anomalies
and now I have another theories yeah
it's a descent into chaos that's my
estimation okay old story so the anomaly
yeah disruption is the mythical descent
into chaos yes and then you reconfigure
the theory with the chaos and you come
up with a better theory yes okay the
reservoir is it better and the answer is
what accounts for everything that the
previous theory accounted for plus the
anomaly exactly so there's progress
always yes exactly
but Kuhn is often read as stating that
there is no progress that you know
there's incommensurate paradigms and you
had a just shift between them but yeah
there isn't there is a cumulative
knowledge in some sense well I think one
thing that when we probably would both
agree about is that we don't buy as a
story that you know because nothing can
be demonstrated definitively utterly to
be the
there is no truth I mean I think we both
believe that there are truths things
that are truer than other things and
indeed if the actor well we couldn't
even talk correctly if we did exam and
even to say that there are no truths is
itself a truth statement which is it's
truer than the statement there are
truths so everybody automatically has
choose whether they know it or not yes
because while you and you said why I
don't think it's not only that you can't
talk you can't even see no because you
don't know how to point you wouldn't
know how to discriminate what's coming
into your brain so it's inevitable and I
think we would agree about that but I
think that may be a slight point of
difference between us in that I'm very
willing to embrace the idea of
uncertainty and Isis I may be wrong
perhaps you could expand on that but
sometimes you come across as as a man
who has certainties this well it's a
peculiar kind of certainty I'm certain
that standing on the border between
order and chaos is a good idea that's a
weird exactly because that you need to
be in this sort of slightly unstable
position yes you have to you have to be
what would you say encountering as much
uncertainty as you can voluntarily
tolerate yes I think that's equivalent
to vygotsky's zone of proximal
development I'm sorry so when we talked
a little bit earlier about the idea of
an instinct for meaning yeah so I think
what meaning is it's it's it's the
elaborated form of the orienting reflex
but what meaning does its function its
biological function which I think is
more real in some sense than any other
biological function is to tell you when
you're in the place where you've
balanced the stability let's say of your
left hemisphere systems with the
exploratory capacity of your right so
that not only are you master of your
domain but you're expanding that domain
simultaneous it and when you I think
that when you're there yeah it's a it's
a it's a kind of a metaphysical place in
some sense that you're imbued with a
sense of meaning and purpose and that's
an indication that you actually
optimized your neurological function yes
and the perhaps we could gloss the idea
of purpose because I think there's
a difference between people get very
confused I think about the idea of
purpose particularly whether there's a
problem that suggesting there is a
purpose and I believe there is a purpose
or there are purposes to the cosmos not
just to my and suggest that somehow it's
all been predetermined by God but this
is to misunderstand the nature of time
that there are time static slices and
God as there and he's sorted it all out
and the whole thing's just unfolding as
birdsong says like a ladies fan being
unfurl is extremely boring and and and
and an entirely static and non creative
universe but actually something is at
stake things are unfolding they have
overall a direction but actually exactly
what that direction is isn't know what
it looks like and it's a fool who says
anything positive about the nature of
God but but I'm not convinced that God
is omniscient and omnipotent either I
think God is in the process of is
becoming God is not only just becoming
but is becoming epidemic yeah so being
and becoming more becoming I think
becoming is the important thing why do
you think that I mean it's also a
strange segue I mean I'm not criticizing
but I'm curious what what drove you to
that conclusion an awful lot of thing is
really and I think that everything is is
a process in fact I'm writing a book
called there are no things oh there are
processes yes and there are patterns
patterns yes well I think music is so
powerful music is one of the most
mysterious and wonderful things in the
universe and I don't think it's at all
Sometimes there's a glitch in the matrix where the limitations of the old operating system are laid bare and something new pokes through
They've been dozens of responses to the jordan peterson channel for interview already. What makes this one different?
Well, I have a pretty unique perspective in
October last year I went to Toronto to interview Jordan Peterson at his home you came in from where I came in from London
last night, I turned the interview into the first full-length documentary about Jordan Peterson's ideas I
Was pretty sure he'd soon become a lot more famous and be recognized as one of the most significant public thinkers
but I couldn't possibly have predicted how he'd break through to a mass audience a
few weeks later Peterson did an interview with journalist Kathy Newman on Channel four News in the UK a
Program I worked on as a reporter and producer for ten years
It was a sensation
Millions watched it online
Tens of thousands commented an overwhelming majority felt Peterson had been unfairly represented
And in the week since it hasn't stopped
Peterson has been asked about it constantly on the most high-profile online shows
12 rules for life so without reading this
So what you're saying is
There's only 12 things you need to do in life right, that's it well yeah this
This interview that you just did with this woman Kathy Newman shit was that in the UK
it was Channel 4 UK so what does this glitch say about the state of mainstream media and
the culture at large
By diagnosis of what's actually happening is that people are moving further and further away from?
what is what thinking actually is I'm at or more into merely running a script and
What does Jordan Peterson actually think that's so controversial you are?
misrepresented more than anyone
I know in a weird way. You are villainized in a weird way where I can't believe that these people are honestly
looking at your opinions and
Coming up with these conclusions. I believe this encounter struck such a nerve because it's a cultural watershed moment
But seen properly as Peterson would say it's archetypal in that it contains layers and layers of meaning
That go right to the heart of the biggest rift. We're seeing playing out in the culture
Over the next 50 minutes. I'm gonna do my best to unpack it
From the clash between new and old media. There's also why YouTube is gonna kill TV
Because television by its nature all of these narrow
broadcast
technologies they rely on forcing the story all the way down to the mythological an
Archetypal level I thought of ideologies as fragmentary mythologies
That's where they get their archetypal and psychological power, but in the postmodern world and this seems to be something that's increasingly
Seeping out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father nothing
But the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing, but the benevolent
Benevolent great mother and it's a it's an appalling ideology, and it seems to me that it's sucking the vitality
Which is exactly what you'd expect symbolically
It's sucking the vitality of her culture and to ask how do we move forward constructively rather than just adding to the polarization?
I've been a journalist for 16 years in the newsrooms of the BBC in channel 4 and then making documentaries I
moved away from the frontline of news some time ago and started learning psychology
Which is what first drew me to Jordan Peterson?
from a distance I've started to see the blind spots of the establishment media much more clearly I
Spent some of the best years of my working life at Channel 4 News and have a huge amount of respect
And gratitude to the program
But I'm making this film because I feel so strongly that if we can't have open conversations about the kind of topics Peterson is raising
We're in serious trouble
Peterson is one of a new breed of thinkers made famous almost completely by the internet not the broadcast media
Part of a powerful new informal network being called the intellectual dark web
The mainstream media is based on an old dying model that is being replaced by new media
And new technology so quickly that its faults are becoming glaringly obvious
Fortunately, thanks to YouTube podcasting and however else you get shows like this one the mainstream media's stranglehold on information
Which really is a stranglehold on your ability to think clearly about the issues of the day is crumbling at an incredible rate?
Now the question is who and what will replace it a few months ago one of my favorite people to sit across this table from
Eric Weinstein came up with the phrase
Intellectual dark web to describe this eclectic mix of people from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro to his brother Brett
Weinstein to jordan Peterson all of whom are figuring out ways to have the important and often dangerous
Conversations that are completely ignored by the mainstream
It's why I would argue that this collection of people are actually more
influential at this point than whatever collection of cable news pundits you can come up with
If you think I'm being hyperbolic about the growing influence of this group just check the traction that these people get on Twitter or Facebook
Compared to our mainstream competitors twitter may not be real life as I say in my Twitter bio
But it is some barometer of what the zeitgeist is right now
what unites this group of thinkers is a sense that the set of ideas that have run Western culture for years are breaking down and
That the chaos of the moment is the attempt to find new ones
It's nearly all happening online part of the problem that we have right now in our culture is
Trying to diagnose the level at which the discussion should be taking place
And I think the reason that this is a tumultuous time is because it actually is a time for discussion of first principles
and it's that first principles are
Virtually at the level of theology because the first principles are the things that you assume and then move forwards like well
What should we assume well the dignity of the human soul let's start with that you can't treat yourself properly without assuming that you
Have a relationship with another person you can't stabilize your family
You can't have a functional society, so what does it mean for this human soul to have dignity?
well
The part of the idea is that you're participating in
Creation itself and you do that with your actions in your language
And you get to decide whether you're tilting the world a bit more towards heaven or a bit more towards hell
And that's actually what you're doing so that's a place where the literal and the metaphorical truth comes together and people are very
They're terrified of that idea as they should be because it's a massive responsibility
They also argue that the central problem is polarization
boosted by social media
Peterson's work looks at how people are hard-wired to see the world differently a lot of what determines your political
orientation is
Biological temperament far more than people realize so for example
left-leaning people
liberals, let's say although that's kind of MIS misnomer, but
We'll keep with the terminology liberals are high in a trait called openness, which is one of the big five personality traits
And it's associated with interest in abstraction and interest in aesthetics
it's the best predictor of liberal political leaning and they're low in trait conscientiousness, which is dutifulness and and
Orderliness in particular whereas the Conservatives are the opposite?
They're high in conscientiousness
They're dutiful and orderly and they're low in openness and that makes them really good managers and administers ministers and often businessman
But not very good entrepreneurs
Because the entrepreneurs are almost all drawn from the liberal types and so
These are really fundamental
fundamentally biologically predicated differences, and they're you might think about them as different sets of
Opportunities and limitations, and and certainly different ways of screening the world and
Each of those different temperamental types needs the other type
Let's call this a diversity issue if you start understanding that the person that you're talking to who doesn't share your political views
isn't
Stupid that's the first thing necessarily. They might be but so might you be no stupid. He isn't the
Differences in intelligence are not the prime determinant of differences in political belief
All right
so you might be talking to someone who's
More conscientious and less creative than you if you're if you happen to be a liberal
But that doesn't mean that that person's perspective is not valid
And it doesn't mean that they wouldn't outperform you in some domains because they would so one thing to remember is
People actually do see the world differently. It's not merely that they that they're possessed of love
ilie informed opinions
the whole point of the dava democracy is to
Continue the dialogue between people of different
Temperamental types so that we don't move so far to the right that everything
becomes
encapsulated and stone and doesn't move or so far to the left and everything dissolves in a kind of
Mealy-mouthed chaos and the only way that you can you can navigate between those two
Shoals is by is through discussion, which is why free speech is such an important value
It's the thing that keeps the temperamental types from being at each other's throats in
The aftermath of the Trump election that came as such a shock to most of the media
One of the most widely shared analysis pieces was from deep code
It describes how the establishment mainstream media perspective based around liberal values of openness and inclusivity
He calls the blue church is being challenged by a new web-based
insurgency a red religion based on the values of tribalism
The culture were the the 20th century was a decisive
success for blue any
effectively a route for red
So what we see first is that red was forced to move into a deeply exploratory phase
Second that it did this in a context
Where as it turns out?
things were changing meaningfully quite significantly in fact it from my perspective in a world historical level the emergence of
entirely new forms of
communication and therefore entirely new sense-making and coherence
He concludes that the blue church is in the process of collapse as its dominant ideology
Can't adapt to changing reality
But that a combination of the two sets of values of blue and red is essential
we are conscious and
Effective in the world in groups, not as individuals and the ingredients of those groups
Include aspects that are currently showing up as both red and blue I
Propose somewhat strongly that
Neither red nor blue as pure
Elements contain the ingredients necessary to actually be adaptive to reality
This is a disaster in fact
It's a little bit like
Separating the hand and the eye
Now you're the eye can see if the eye takes itself as being the essence of virtue it separates itself from the ability to do
The same thing with the hand for most of human history these groups have actually always commingled
They're necessary that they actually relate to each other in a deeply healthy and direct fashion
their separations into armed camps is
Extinction area actually you know the values of red that you think blue needs to integrate you also may also reintegrate. Oh well
That's actually pretty easy
Responsibility I mean we've actually even seen it
The ability to
Make a commitment and keep it
Which which by the way ideologically shows up is either duty or loyalty, but those are both ideologies the the deeper sense is that ability
Responsibility both of the individual in the group level the ability to actually really make a
Personal sacrifice on the part of the group that's actually a deeply
read value
and I don't mean that by the way as
Politically ideological certainly there are people who?
Are currently part of blue who feel that deeply what I'm saying is that that shows up much much more intensely in
Read and when you're feeling it in blue. You're actually feeling a red value, and that's good mixing is crucial
Because that's very Jordan Peterson esque -
How would you how do you define Jordan Peterson?
Or do you think the fact the issue is that he is is not definable within one of those two camps
Yeah, I think that's the point
I think that he grasps directly the fact that human beings can only actually make sense of the world by virtue of
communication with other human beings and this is all about the notion of admixture that one must have a mixture of of
What I mean he uses the mythopoetic to make sense the order order and chaos
The way right the taoist way is the alchemical admixture of order and chaos
And that's it like that's how you do it, and so if you bias towards orderliness
You find yourself in a rigid non adaptive
non creative non exploratory framework
Which will die because the world changes if you bias towards chaos
You you eat your young and evaporate
Which also ties for obvious reasons?
And the key is to actually enable these things to be in
relationship with each other and vital healthy relationship with each other, and I think that's in some sense the essence of what he's
Focusing on and instead of the core what he's asking about Peterson is hard for the broadcast media to get a handle on
Because the depth of his thought means he doesn't fit easily into any of their categories
The clash with Kathy Newman was his breakthrough a moment where the new world met the old
To give the context from Kathy Newman side she has to do dozens of interviews each month
Peterson is hard to get a grip on and he sure as hell looks controversial
She's also focused on getting sound bites for a five minute cut down of the interview for TV. Not a long conversation for online
The interview was ridiculous. It was a ridiculous interviewing. I listen to it or watched it several times
I was like this is so strange
It's like her determination to turn into a conflict - it's one of the issues that I have with
Television shows yeah, because they have a very limited amount of time, and they're trying to make things as salacious as possible
They wouldn't have these sound bites these clickbait sound bites
And she just went into it incredibly confrontational not trying to find your actual perspective
But trying to force you to defend a non non realistic perspective. Yes well
I was that I was the hypothetical villain of her imagination essentially. No this is also. Why YouTube is gonna kill TV
Because television by its nature all of these narrow
broadcast
technologies they rely on
forcing the story right because
It has to happen now
It has to happen in like often in five minutes because they only broadcast five minutes of that in interview
They did put the whole thing up on YouTube to their credit
It it it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet. I think that they thought that the interview went fine
after the interview Channel four News found themselves at the center of an online storm
Which included some nasty personal and misogynistic attacks?
It's understandable that they just wanted it to go away
But online is forever
and as the center of gravity continues to shift away from traditional media this interview is I would argue a
slow-motion and
Continuing car crash for Channel 4's credibility, so why did it happen?
Partly the limitations of the medium of TV, but also because of the institutional political blindness of the mainstream media
I've always considered myself of the liberal left, but especially since the election of Trump
I've been trying to understand what happened and I'm convinced that the polarization
We're seeing is mainly driven by the shadow side of liberalism in particular where supposedly
Inclusive social justice liberalism stops being inclusive and secretly judges and despises people that don't think the same way
the rebellion of Trump and brexit was a direct response as
Yuri Harris argues in this article in Colet the new gatekeepers of the media have become a new bourgeoisie
Enforcing a rigid etiquette and using the rights of the oppressed
as an excuse to put forward a vision of the kind of society they personally want to live in
on the surface level
it's about how a narrow social justice worldview embodied by Kathy Newman in the interview became the new status quo and
How this institutional bias of much of the mainstream media?
Means it can't see or understand the forces that are challenging this new consensus
The counterculture used to be on the left, but once it won. The culture war it left space for a new counterculture
The biggest manifestation is the red pill phenomena which the mainstream media?
Mistakenly assumes is the same thing as the OLT right? I was surprised to just discover the overlap between
What I minute II particularly like
Greek philosophy and stoicism and
The alt-right who I've always thought of you know if I come across on the tour. I thought the most kind
Swivel-eyed bogeymen you know
completely unpalatable
extremists in their in their basements and then to discover that
You know a lot of them were a lot of people in stoicism were also really into the alt-right
Made me wonder. What was going on and why?
People like me were getting radicalized
I'm drawn into if you explain. What stoicism is for
Stoicism is basically an ancient Greek philosophy, which was became very popular in the Roman Empire
You know with like the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was a stoic for example?
And it's in some ways like a Western form of Buddhism
It's like a therapy for the emotions it teaches you to take
Responsibility for your thoughts to take and thereby to take some control over your emotions
so in some ways it's putting forward a model of
strength and integrity and kind of resilience
Amid adversity and rapid change so for that reason it's become very popular in the last 10 years I
Think this is also. Why from my perspective at least someone like Jordan Pederson
Is often looked from the outside as being aligned with the alt-right because he has a similar message
But it's but there are crucial differences. I think between what we would consider
I mean certainly white nationalism would be an essential part of the alt-right
I would say of any useful definition, and yeah, that's that's certainly not characteristic of of Jordan Peterson from my experience
No, there's a crucial difference at least between stoicism and the alt-right
Even though a lot of alt writers into stoicism in that stoicism, and and maybe Jordan Peterson as well
I don't know. I'm not an expert on him talk about the way to gain strength and
maturity and power is
Internal it's to take responsibility for your own thoughts and feelings
Whilst I think people sometimes men might look for that sense of power and control
externally by
suppressing or
Segregating anyone who they feel threatened by whether that's other colours or other sexualities or
Gender so there's a crucial difference there one is about kind of inner
Integrity and and and just kind of being strong within yourself
and the other is about trying to take control through the kind of exterior I
Mean every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that were discussing is overwhelmingly men
It's like it's like eighty-five to ninety percent
And so I thought wow that's weird like what the hell's going on here exactly, and then the other thing. I've noticed is that?
I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to not about rights
But about responsibility right because you can't have the bloody converse. What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the
conversation about responsibility because your rights are my
Responsibility that's what they are
Technically, so you just can't have only half of that discussion, and we're only having half that discussion the question is well
What the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is what you're leaving out
Responsibility and then the question is well
What are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well, maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life
That's what it looks like to me. It's like here you are
Suffering away, what makes it worthwhile, right?
You know you're completely. Oh, you're completely you have no idea what you're
You it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is
responsibility
That's what gives life meaning
It's like lift a load
Then you can tolerate yourself right because look at your useless
Easily hurt easily killed. Why should you have any self-respect?
That's the story of the fall
Pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think yeah well
Useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there well
What's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this the man's eyes light and that's very good
I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this
Mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift their eyes let light up
Because I put something together for them. That's what mythological stories. Do so I'm not taking responsibility for that
That's what the stories do so I say the story and people go click click click
You know in their eyes light up, but this responsibility thing
That's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that. It is unbelievable. It just blows me away
It's like really that's what's that's the counterculture?
Grow the hell up and do something useful really I could do that oh
I'm so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before it's like rights rights rights rights Jesus
It's it's it's appalling. It's and and I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are who are coming out to
To listen to these sorts of things to they're they've had enough of that
So and they better have because it's it's a non-productive mode of being
responsibility man
Peterson is part of the counterculture that he describes himself as a classic liberal and yet he's frequently
Described as right-wing by the media
This is not limited to Peterson
James d'amours infamous Google memo was described everywhere as an anti diversity screed
Despite him specifically stating he wanted to encourage more diversity in the workplace
Many believe that the Channel 4 interview was a significant moment in exposing this mindset as dogmatic
reactionary and fixed so during the interview we see an example of a
Delusional framework that is what appears to be largely incapable of perceiving and reacting to reality in real time
but much more interesting is what happened afterwards which was the sort of the
self-healing and policing mechanism of the larger social consensus of how when how the blue church
Reactively goes about maintaining the integrity of its frame
And so what ended up happened was there was a break in the frame there was a glitch in the matrix the
Mechanisms of the blue church reacted to endeavor to control the frame and to convert it into a way of sense of
Making sense of the what occurred that still maintained the integrity of its frame?
Do you mean when they tried to characterize it as sort of?
abusive trolls and you're right hero, and all of that exactly exactly it's sort of a
to use of a military language it was a fallback position that was a
Reactive almost instinctual and not almost in fact precisely instinct was that pure habit there was no
Thoughtfulness or even
strategic
Action there it was if if X then Y and in this case Y is. Here's a set of things that one does to
re-establish the dominant frame and
Now we're now were two levels deep you know the first. Level was a
sort of self-evident disaster, but then the second level was also a relatively self-evident disaster and
There isn't really a third level
In this approach so it ends up happening, and this is again. You can kind of just think about this from ordinary psychology
This is how?
delusions fall apart
As try as we might our desire to interpret reality to mean what we wanted to mean at the end of the day. We'll always
Be checked against what reality actually is
It may be some time. You know we're pretty good at making things up and pretending, but eventually
Reality is reality this isn't to say that Peterson is not controversial
He's saying things that challenge the most deeply held assumptions of the new establishment narrative
I guess the other reason that people are on
My case to some degree is because I have made a strong case which I think is fully documented by the scientific literature that there
Are intrinsic differences say between men and women and I think the evidence and that this is the thing that staggered me is that?
No serious scientists have debated that for like four decades
It's that argument was done by the time. I went to graduate school everyone knew that human beings were not a blank slate that
biological forces not
Parameterised the way that we thought and and felt and acted and and and valued everyone knew that the fact that this has become somehow
debatable again is just
Especially because it's being done by legislative Fiat. They're forcing it
Part of Peterson's argument based on years of psychological research is that much of the political?
Conflicts are due to try to integrate the different political temperaments of men and women
we were talking about the relatively the relative evolutionary roles of men and women this is speculative obviously and and
Because our research did indicate. It's tentative research so far that that the the the SG is
SJW sort of equality above all else philosophy is more prevalent among women
It's predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women so agreeable this and high negative emotion
Primarily agreeableness, but in addition. It's also predicted by being female and so I've been thinking about that a lot because
well men are bailing out of the humanities like mad and
Pretty much out of the university is except for stem the women are moving in like mad
And they're also moving into the political sphere like mad, and this is new right
we've never had this happen before and we do know know do not know what the
Significance of it is it's only 50 years old and so we were thinking about this
and so I don't know what you think about this proposition, but
imagine that that that historically speaking, it's
something like
Women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production
Something like that and maybe maybe that's only the case really in the tight confines of the immediate family
But that doesn't matter because that's most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings anyways what the women does did was make sure that everybody
Got enough
okay, and that seems to me to be one of the things that's driving at least in part the SJW demand for for equity and
Equality it's like let's make sure everybody has enough. It's like look fair enough
You know I mean you can't you can't argue with that
but there's there's an antipathy between that and
The the reality of differential productivity you know because people really do differ in their productivity
I think that the SJW phenomena is different
and I think it is associated at least in part with the rise of women to political power and and
We don't know what women are like when they have political power because they've never had it
I mean there's been queens obviously and that sort of thing there's been female authority figures and females have
Wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit, but this is a different thing
And we don't know what what a truly female political philosophy would be like, but it might be
Especially if it's not been well examined
And it isn't very sophisticated conceptually it could easily be let's make sure things you've distributed equally. Well, yeah
Why
One of Peterson's main influences is the psychologist Carl Jung
Young psychology was built around the concept of the shadow all the things about ourselves. We don't want to accept our anger
negativity
Unconscious judgments, and how we need to integrate all those disowned parts to grow
I'm convinced. That's what's happening on a vast cultural level
since leaving channel 4 news
I've retrained as a counselor and started leading personal growth workshops for men
And thought a lot about how these unconscious gender dynamics are playing out in the culture
One of the central concepts is Jung's idea of animus and anima possession
How each have both an inner masculine and feminine essence in?
A man when he's unconsciously possessed by his feminine side his anima he becomes withdrawn
Moody and reactive and when a woman is possessed by her male side the animus
she becomes aggressive and dominating and
How many women are pushed into that by the nature of the modern workplace?
The Kathy Newman I know is warm compassionate a successful and talented journalist none of this is criticism of her
Just the role she was playing in the interview
It moves forward in these pattered and manners like the dominance hierarchy for example, so that's that let's call that the masculine archetype
It's part of the masculine archetype in fact the onus
Proclamation was that the female representation of the male
so that's the animus is the
Dominance hierarchy it's the patriarchy
So that's that that's the unconscious archetype, which I think is extremely interesting given
what's happened say in the women's movement because that's what's projected onto men and
and
It can be projected in a very negative way
it doesn't have to be but it can be and so an animus possessed woman treats a man as if he's the
Manifestation of the tyrannical patriarchy he's a group he's that group of men
Yeah, the group of bad men actually you watched the Jordan Peterson Kathy Newman entity. What did he what did he think I?
My whole body contracted, and I I felt so sad for
womanhood I felt
disappointed and I
Could see how
the shadow part of womanhood was acting out I could see how the
collective rage was acting through Kathy Newman and
This is what happens is that when that's unknown its projected blindly on to
Whatever stick wherever it sticks
and it was very clear that she already had an agenda and she already had a projection that she was just
Looking to state she was she was just looking to have that confirmed so I felt on behalf of women
I felt sad and disappointed because we need to have intelligent
conversations, and I also want to say that this isn't
even though the the specific example is the Kathy Newman Jordan Peterson interview, it's not specific to
- Kathy Newman I think the fact that that interview has resonated with so many people that it's been so popular shows that actually something
archetypal was going on in that in that interaction
And I think as well why it's gone viral is a lot of people watching it
Recognize those dynamics. They're like I've been in conversations like that
I've been in this conversation where nothing I say works where nothing I say gets through
So there's something sort of fundamental about about the masculine feminine dynamic. That's going on in there
What do you think that is I think Jordan Peterson? He's everyman Kathy Newman
She's every woman I can tap into that rage like this
I know it in myself and women that say they don't they're just denying it because it is in the collective
So in that sense it just highlighted what what's that?
It's wonderful because here we really get to look at why is this so?
Important why is it so important to listen to?
To a thinker like Jordan Peterson and take it seriously and say what can we do with it?
It's just so obvious that it's needed
Because if this is where we are if this is where society and cultures is if this is the ability to have an intelligent conversations
Conversation then we are in trouble, I really feel that there is this
collective
subconscious rage that is just
boiling in women and it's coming up in so many ways we see we see in the media and
What's going on is this?
unknown
Rage that comes up in in many different ways um
And on one hand it needs to come out we need to clear it it needs to be expressed it needs to
Be acknowledged on the other hand it's not enough. This is only like this is breaking the ice
So that the next step of evolution, can you know?
Consciousness can start coming through and that's what I'm lacking in women. It's really to take
responsibility for what we do as women in our
Manipulation in our seduction in our control, and and it's so easy for women to say
but that's just because we angry and men did this and patriarchy, but it's
It's such a lack of
responsibility and this
Women really need to know I mean, that's the the kind of shadow work is
The acceptance that we all have shadows that men certainly have a shadow. There is a shadow around masculinity
but there's also a shadow around femininity and
while part of the cultural conversation now is toxic masculinity and everyone knows what you mean by toxic toxic masculinity if
You talk about toxic femininity
Everyone still knows what you mean, but you can't have that conversation
Which is it's it's interesting?
What is allowed to be said and what is not allowed to be said at the moment and that that I think is?
is very
Dangerous that certain topics certain conversations are off are off-limits
And this is where we see where we see the victim persecutor dynamics activates it because women
become the become the victims, and we make ourselves the victims and we
Persecute men but in that aggression in that rage and when we are the victims. We are in perfect control
we become the persecutors because we say
It's all about blame
Men did this and men need to take responsibility
But in that we become the persecutors, and it's also very difficult as well because one imagines that that
Combative attitude is something that has served her well in the past and it's something that
She's maybe felt forced into because of the nature of the society that she's operating in so it's a kind of catch-22 situation
for the many successful women because they feel that they're pushed to be more masculine and
Then when they're more masculine they get judged for being more masculine
It's it's very sad and and and I can see that dynamics being played out absolutely
But I think the only thing we can do is to take responsibility okay?
I'm doing that do I really want to compromise my femininity do I want to compromise my integrity?
Do I want to compromise my gender and?
Play that or is there another way that I can be powerful without being aggressive without playing a power game
But resting in my natural power
resting in my natural dignity
Resting in that deep rootedness that we both have in our genders that
When we are peace with it and when we acknowledge it in ourselves
It's there as a natural thing and and this is the thing I don't want to make this personal about Kathy Newman
Because it's it's in that potential is in every woman, but it's because we are persecuting our own femininity
What's being played out that we're doing it to ourselves because we don't trust that it's good enough to be a woman
We don't trust that we can have conversations that come from a felt embodied perspective. We don't trust that we're connected to truth
because these these
Masculine ways have been have been very strong and women have been denying their own power
In my work over many years of working with this I find that very few women
Grew up in households which really?
Loved admired respected honored
cherished the feminine and
So there is intrinsically for so many women who've grown up in the I don't know the last hundred years that say
A kind of devaluation of the feminine that gets taken on and of course and as well as abuse
aggression all sorts of things so very
Many women out of an intelligent strategy to survive
Develop their masculine side as a defense against that devaluation for the feminine and over time they become very
Identified with that masculine side the male equivalent is animal possession
in anima possession it's the loss of relaxed confidence in the
Groundedness in the masculine and is overwhelmed by his own inner feminine side
a passive withdrawn
moody
bitchy
Complaining
not showing up kind of guy, which I think is really so much what feminists are angry about I
Don't see them as really angry about the masculine per se but it the way that
Males behave, and you know I have got a lot of compassion for that
Because for myself and most men that I know we weren't really shown how to be as men
We didn't really get initiated into it and so and then this strong thing comes from feminism
And we feel like it's it's maleness. That's wrong, and it's not it's not maleness. That's wrong. I don't even think feminism
tonight's talk this is the most popular
talk we've ever done in 15 years tonight
is the third so it's been a weekend of
Jordan Peterson rich with has been a
huge pleasure for anyone who doesn't
know him and last night I think it was
one babe in arms and tonight it's
probably my mother he is a was a
professor associate professor at Harvard
University and is now the professor of
clinical psychology at Toronto his first
book was a huge success it
revolutionized the psychology of
religion and his latest book of the
twelve rules of life is set to do
exactly the same just a few housekeeping
things at the end of the talk we're
going to have a Q&A which I'm going to
moderate so do prepare your questions
please make them questions and also for
those people in the livestream they'll
be posted notes and you can't hand
questions for the ushers and we'll be
taking those as well so I look forward
to that and at the end of it we're going
to be doing not so much as signing but
here on stage a dedication everyone's
book is or pretty what everyone's book
is already signed so if you want to if
you don't want a dedication then just
leave you on the third page you'll find
the signature in order to last night
there was a huge queue as you can
imagine in order to make the queue run
smoothly and sorry to sound bossy but
he's not going to be doing selfies
just because it means he's got a stand
up the whole time and it'll slow down
the flow but he is very happy to be
photographed and you can photobomb him
if you'd like
also because all of us particularly me
are really keen for him to solve the
problems of our lives please resist
doing that during the dedication because
it'll really slow everything down I
think the three things that you can take
away from this evening and you'll be the
judge is first of all be inspired by the
talk secondly read the book and thirdly
marry a Canadian I feel rather fortunate
to have now done all three also if you
would like to tweet its hashtag the
rules of twelve rules of life so without
further ado please welcome one of the
world's great public intellectuals
Jordan Peterson thank you
[Applause]
[Applause]
well that was nice so I thought I'd I
talk about my book tonight I give him
two talks now and I didn't actually talk
directly about it I sort of talked
around it and so I thought I don't like
to give the same talk twice so I thought
I'd actually walked through it and and
and outline it a little bit and so I had
to spend most of the day memorizing the
rules you know you'd think if you worked
on something for three years or it's
been five years I guess you'd actually
have it memorized but memory is a very
strange thing and it's it's very
particular and goal-oriented and I
actually didn't have the rules memorized
and certainly not their numbers so
hopefully I do by now so I guess we're
gonna find out but I have a copy of the
book here in case I in case I forget so
I think we'll go through them one by one
and we'll see how see how that goes
seven o'clock so all right good the
first rule which is kind of a comical
rule is stand up straight with your
shoulders back and it's a meditation
among other things on the habits of
lobsters I read some papers on lobsters
well must be ten years ago I guess and
it they just absolutely blew me away and
one of the things I've really loved
about being a psychologist there's many
things but I've really loved
psychoanalytic theory and and the great
clinicians the behaviorists as well
I mean Freud Jung addler Carl Rogers
Abraham Maslow that behaviors like
skinner and and and the cognitive
behaviors I mean I've learned a
tremendous amount from reading the
clinicians and so if any of you are
interested in psychology I would really
recommend reading the great clinicians
because they know they've learned so
much about life it's crazy by reading
them so that's been fun but then on the
entirely other end of the spectrum where
I've learned most about psychology is
from the really low what would you call
them the really science oriented animal
behaviors that's where they would they
turned into the neuroscientists right
they were the animal behaviorist first
of all and then they turned into the
neuroscientists I've learned a
tremendous amount from them there's such
clear thinkers the best of the bunch I
think there's two of them one named
Jeffrey gray who wrote a book called the
neural psychology of anxiety which is
just a deadly book it's impossible to
read it takes like six months to read it
because I think he he read like 1,800
papers to write it or something like
that and he actually read them that's
the cool thing and he understood them
which is really something then there's
another guy named yakky egg Ceph who
wrote a book called how affective
neuroscience which outlines his studies
for example of rats he was the guy who
learned that rats laugh if you tickle
them with the end of a pencil eraser but
they laugh ultrasonically like bats so
you have to salute you have to slow down
the ultrasonic vocalizations before you
can hear them giggle and you think why
the hell when you spend your time
tickling rats with a pencil and making
them laugh but see what he demonstrated
there was that that there was a play
circuit in mammals that there's an
actual there's a psycho biological basis
for rough-and-tumble play for example
it's a bloody big deal you know
discovering a whole new circuit in the
brain that's like discovering a
continent it's Nobel prize-winning stuff
and panksepp so effective neuroscience I
would highly recommend that so there's
this other book I know about - which is
twelve rules for life which you could
also look into if you want anyways I was
reading these these articles on lobsters
and I came across this this finding that
lobsters lobsters governed their
postural flexion with serotonin and I
thought god that's so interesting it's
so in deflection is this is to stand up
straight wow that's so interesting
because you know depressed people
crouched over I wonder if there's any
link between those two things and then I
went and read a whole pile of papers on
lobster lobster neural chemistry lobster
neuro chemistry is actually quite well
understood because they have a fairly
simple nervous system right and so if
you want to understand a complex nervous
system it's a good idea to understand a
simple one first and then sort of
elaborate upwards and it turns out that
serotonin governs status governs status
emotional regulation and posture in
lobsters just
like it does in human beings and so that
would just blew me away and so one one
one thing that the chapter one is about
is the fact that if a lobster is
defeated in a dominance battle you can
give it essentially antidepressants and
it will fight again now that just blew
me away you know it's so it's so
remarkable because one of the things
that tells you is that so if you're a
imagine that you could be lobster top
dog or bottom dog imagine there's ten
strata in the lobster hierarchy and so
you could be number one right top
lobster number ten bottom lobster if
your bottom Lobster you have low
serotonin levels than high octopamine
levels that's the neurochemical that
human beings don't produce and if you're
a top lobster you have high serotonin
levels and lower top amine levels and
you can move a lobster in its dominance
hierarchy by moderating its levels of
serotonin and I thought that's so
interesting because what it means is
that the counter that keeps track of our
status when we have a counter in a sense
in our minds that keeps track of our
status is a third of a billion years old
and what that also means is that the the
idea of the hierarchy let's call it a
dominance hierarchy because it within
lobsters it's kind of like a physical
prowess hierarchy something like that
the idea of the hierarchy is at least
350 million years old and so I read that
and I think well so much for the idea
that human hierarchies are a
socio-cultural construct it's like no
that's wrong it's not just a little bit
wrong it's unbelievably wrong it's
mind-boggling ly wrong right and it's
right and so so hierarchies hierarchies
have been around for a third of a
billion years and and we have a
neurochemical system that modulates our
our understanding of those hierarchies
and then also and this is the
interesting thing too and this is why
people's reputations are so important to
them among there's lots of reasons but
this is one of them is that where this
counter that you share with lobsters
rates you in terms of your hierarchical
position determines the ratio of
negative emotion to positive emotion
that you feel and that's also an
absolutely mind-boggling
idea for two reasons one is it tells you
why it's so hard on people to be put
down because it doesn't just upset them
in the moment it changes the way their
entire system responds to the world so
that they now experience more positive
emotion and less than eight less
negative emotion so that's really rough
and then there's a corollary to that too
which is like there's a very tight
relationship between your belief system
and your dominance hierarchy position
it's complicated but it's worth going
through like let's say that so I have a
certain amount of status as a professor
and and and I have the let's call it the
what would you say I've been granted the
entitlement to a certain position in a
in a social hierarchy now the question
is why do I have a valid claim to that
position and the answer hypothetically
is because I know enough so that my
claim to the position is valid so then
if you stand up in the audience and
challenge my beliefs and show that I'm
wrong you might you might say well I get
upset because I'm wrong but the more
accurate reason that I get upset is
because you're indicating to the crowd
that my my position in the hierarchy of
authority is invalid and by doing that
you lower me in the hierarchy and you
mess around with the neurochemical
systems that are regulating my emotions
and so if you're interested at least in
part in why people are so prone to
defend themselves and their beliefs in
the service of their position then
that's why and so that's a great example
of how you can learn these unbelievable
things by stumbling across a rather
obscure biological fact it's just it's
just what would you say it it's like
it's like a series of dominoes and and
that's also why biological facts are so
useful it's like we don't have to argue
about whether or not haha social
hierarchies as I said or or or
hierarchies are social constructs a
given hierarchy is influenced in its
structure by socio cultural conditioning
let's say but the fact of the hierarchy
so like the part of your brain that
detects and regulates your response to
hierarchies is older than the part of
your brain that recognizes trees like
it's old it's really really fundamental
and so and almost all social animals
organize themselves and social in
hierarchies because now the other thing
that chapter one
is a bit of a meditation on what might
constitute a hierarchy one of my
business colleagues a former student of
mine from Harvard very very smart guy
it's got a graduate degree in
engineering from MIT and a PhD in
psychology from Harvard so there's like
one of him in the whole world and he's a
very smart guy and he helped me design
the self authoring suite by the way and
he's been working for about 20 years on
that that's the suite of programs that
helps people write about their lives and
straighten them out he told me to stop
using the word dominance hierarchy and
he said the reason for that was that it
was infested with Marxist
presuppositions and it really bothered
me when he first said that because I've
been using the word for years dominance
hierarchy he said we had a discussion
about that he said well it's predicated
on the idea that you climb up the
hierarchy human hierarchy as a
consequence of the expression of power
it's like that's wrong you climb up
valid hierarchies as a consequence of
the expression of competence and that's
actually technically right he was
exactly the right person to tell me that
because he had done his PhD on what
predicts success in Western hierarchies
and the answer is quite clear general
cognitive ability some prefrontal
ability as well which was what he
specifically tested so intelligence
roughly speaking although it's a little
bit more elaborate than intelligence but
that's close enough and trait
conscientiousness accounts for about 50
percent of the variance in long term
success and you think well hey how do
you want your society be structured it
seems pretty good to me that smart
hardworking people are the ones most
likely to succeed that's not a bad
empirical test of the validity of a
structure now especially given how much
vagary there is in life lots of random
things happen to people but it's better
to be born three standard deviations
above the mean in intelligence in the
West than it is to be born three
standard deviations above the mean in
wealth in relationship to where you'll
end up when you're 40 so he said to use
the word competence hierarchy or we
decided that and I think that's much
better
so chapter one as a bit of a meditation
on the nature of hierarchies and the
biochemistry of hierarchy but it's also
an injunction about how to present
yourself because you don't you want to
present yourself to the world in a
manner that that doesn't disgrace you in
some sense that that might be a good way
to think about it and
you don't want to disgrace yourself
because the consequence of disgrace is
its emotional dysregulation more pain
less positive emotion and so the best
way to present yourself is to stand up
forthrightly and to stretch out you know
and to occupy some space and to to to
you make yourself sort of vulnerable by
doing that because you open up the front
of your body right but it's a sign of
confidence and that way people are most
likely to give you the benefit of the
doubt and that's a good way to start
regulating your mood but not only does
it directly regulate your mood to stand
up because it's so tightly associated
like posture reflection is associated
with serotonin and emotional regulation
but also because if you straighten up
and you present yourself in that manner
then other people are more likely to
take you seriously and that means
they'll start treating you as if you're
a number one lobster instead of a number
ten lobster and that's another way that
you can at least give yourself the
bloody benefit of the doubt right and
and and and and and and confront the
world in a courageous manner and that's
a really good way of also of of figuring
out how to establish yourself in
multiple competence hierarchies because
one of the general rules of thumb about
how to be successful is to confront
things that frighten you forthrightly
and with courage and that's kind of a
universal strategy for success and so
that's what the first chapter is about
so that's quite fun my graduate students
I told them these lobsters stories a my
graduate students when we used to go out
for breakfast and they were very
competitive Bunch very fractious and
witty and they were always trying to get
one over on each other a hundred and
some witty put down or something like
that and it got to the point in the
restaurants where they put their claws
in the urns click like this when they
you know got one over on one of their
colleagues which was very peculiar and
strange and very funny as well so so
that's rule number one rule number two
is uh treat yourself like you're someone
that you care about and that that's a
deeper chapter I would say like chapter
one is kind of comical but it's also got
this serious scientific end for example
and it's practical like most of the
rules are
chapter 2 is a bit of a meditation on
why see I read this I read this site
this piece of work by Jung a long while
back and it was a meditation on the
injunction to treat your neighbor as as
you would like to be treated
something like that and what Jung
pointed out which I really liked was
that that wasn't an injunction to be
nice to other people it was an
invitation to reciprocity it was
something like this is like you should
figure out how you would like to be
treated like you were taking care of
yourself not how you would like people
to respond to you it's more important
than that it's like imagine you had a
child that you really cared for and
someone said well people will treat this
child exactly like you want them to but
you have to figure out what that is and
so then you'd have to sit down for like
a month and you think okay well how do
you want your child to be treated you
don't want everyone just to be nice to
him you know you want people to
challenge them and you want people to
discipline them and you want people to
tell him when he's wrong it's like you
don't just want everyone to be nice
that's that's pathetic it's pathetic
isn't there's no challenge in that and
so well you want to treat other people
like you would like to be treated well
then you have to figure out how would
you like to be treated and while you'd
like people to fawn all over you and
just lay everything at your feet it's
like no that's that's not something
you'd wish for for someone that you were
taking care of and then then there's an
additional problem which is it's often
the case that people will treat other
people better than they treat themselves
that happens extremely frequently so one
of the things I pointed out chapter 2
was that if you have a dog and you take
him to a vet and the vet gives you your
prescription medicine you'll go buy the
medicine and you will give it to the dog
and you will do it properly but if you
go yourself to a doctor and you get a
prescription there's one that there's a
30% chance you won't even pick up the
medication and if you do there's a 50%
chance that you won't administer it to
yourself properly and so I really
thought about that when I first came
across that statistic it really it was
another one of those little facts I
thought what the hell's up with that
it's like you'll do it for your dog
so obviously you'll do it for something
you care about and you're conscientious
enough so you'll actually do it so like
why wouldn't you do it for you your dog
likes you you know even your dog would
rather that you did but but you don't
you don't and and it's it's actually one
of the reasons that modern medicine
doesn't work nearly as well as it could
because people just don't take their
medication and it's not only because
they don't take care of themselves
there's some skepticism about doctors
but you could be just as skeptical about
the vet so it's a deep meditation I
would say and it's what I've done with
these rules is they're very simple rules
[Music]
okay so i'm talking today with dr
michael shermer
and dr schermer is among other things
the publisher of skeptic magazine but
more importantly for our purposes today
he is also the author of this book new
book
and we're heaven on earth and we're
going to talk about this today in some
detail and so i'm going to turn this
over first to dr shermer who's going to
tell you some things about himself and
then we're going to have a discussion
he's going to outline his book and then
we're going to have a discussion about
about why he wrote it and what it
contains and what the implications are
and all of that so
over to you michael
uh sure jordan thank you for having me
on the show it's
well the the book is uh kind of an
extension of my previous work most of my
books when i write them they kind of
push off from the previous book so going
all the way back to my first book why
people believe weird things which was
about the supernatural and the
paranormal and
and all that then that led to how we
believed which was why people believe in
god
and then if you don't believe in the
supernatural and you don't believe in a
deity what about morality so i wrote two
books on math the science of good and
evil and the moral art last book
uh so then you know kind of covering all
the big subjects uh
from a skeptical scientific perspective
um the afterlife is obviously a huge one
and i had really dealt with that too
much in my previous books and you know
now that i'm in my 60s i guess you could
say i'm cramming for the final
thinking about these big issues it's not
something i obsess about i'm not
terrorized by death like like some
people allegedly are but but i think
it's a super interesting subject because
um
it's obviously a part of the human
condition it's something people do think
about and
apparently we're the only species that
can do this although i have a chapter in
heavens on earth on animals that grieve
clearly quite a few mammals do grieve
and they have some sense of loss
death and grief you know for fellow
group members or family members that die
but it's not clear that they understand
that they're mortal
um and then like you know i covered the
the possibility that neanderthals were
self-aware of their mortality because of
grave goods that have been found
although that's you know it's hard to
fossil
fossilization of thoughts is difficult
to interpret but you know it seems
reasonable that they had some sense of
that but in any case um
uh so i deal with um the you know the
the monotheisms versions of the
afterlife heaven immortality uh judaism
christianity and islam mainly because
you sort of have to although mine's a
science book and those are sort of
low-hanging fruit that atheists have
already kind of picked at so i don't
spend a lot of time on that i'm focused
more on scientific attempts to achieve
immortality and it's a book of science
so i actually start with what doesn't
seem like a scientific attack but deepak
chopra's world view of sort of western
buddhism that
um that there is the idea of
birth death
after life life before life is all kind
of meaningless because it's all
consciousness in a deepak's worldview as
he puts it uh you know consciousness is
the ontological primitive
you can't get underneath it uh you know
the scientific attempt to explain it by
material means will always fail because
that's not where consciousness lies
anyway so i i um thanks to my wife uh
you know actually delved into his
worldview
deepak and i have clashed for you know
20 years and i've called his worldview
woo-woo and
pseudoscience and and you know we've
been kind of at odds at each other so
as it changes i mean he's sort of the
main you might say intellectual force i
don't think it's unreasonable to say the
main intellectual force behind the new
age movement or associated with the new
age movement is that certainly that's
one of the yeah certainly one of the
most prominent ones he's got a huge
following you know he goes on oprah and
talks about these things and dr oz or
whoever and and you know he has a lot of
following so
um so my wife and i actually went down
to his center the trooper center in
carlsbad california and spent some time
there i we delved into meditation and
yoga and the tea and the chanting and
all that stuff just to kind of see what
it's all about and uh you know i think
there's something there in terms of
behavioral change that is how it affects
your body and your mind and you're
thinking and i could definitely see
something to that and um
and but but also the difficult part that
that deepak and i have had is the same
problem that most scientists have
with um new age uh beliefs but not just
epic but
non-western traditions that what depot
calls the eastern wisdom traditions that
it's the language the difficulty of
language we have to use words to
communicate
and the words you use matter
at some level you have to be able to be
talking on the same
level with words so when deepak says
um you know the ontological primitive or
consciousness is the womb of creation
you know these are it sounds sort of
metaphorical and he means something very
specific by that and if you can't get at
that then you're wasting your time
talking so um deepak and i have kind of
become friends and we you know we're
constantly communicating just to try to
see if we can find some
ground where we're talking you know
on the same plane and so i think i've uh
learned a lot from him in that in that
sense and so my chapter is devoted to
him on that and and the general eastern
wisdom traditions you know that when you
die
because i always ask him well where do
you go and he said he's just the wrong
question i mean you just returned to
where you were before
because when people ask me well what do
you think happens after you die my
standard kind of quip is the same thing
you go to the same place you were before
you were born
people say what are you talking about i
wasn't anywhere before i was born right
and you'll be nowhere after you die but
for deepak you know time and
consciousness kind of overrides the
concept of time at the beginning and end
right
your consciousness just returns to where
it was
and that the this physical body and
brain is just a temporary instantiation
of consciousness into physical being but
it just goes back to some other place
and and as near as i could figure we
don't have the words to even conceive of
what that means
uh that is that the western language the
way scientists talk
can't really capture what uh he's
talking about in that sense and so
that's why i think
uh we kind of hit an epistemological
wall there where
you have to actually get into
introspection meditation and that the
deeper parts of that tradition that i've
never been able to you know really get
into personally so i can't say i
understand it although i i kind of see
where he's coming from in that regard
so let me ask you some questions about
that so
the first might have to do with this
idea of the ontological primacy of
consciousness say
now one of the things i've learned from
studying mythology is that the
mythological worldview first of all i
think the mythological worldview
conceptualizes the world as a place to
act
rather than as a place of things so it's
sort of like stephen jay gould's idea of
two magisterium that don't overlap
there's a moral magisterium and a
materialist magisterium say but it's
been striking to me looking at the
archetypal foundations of mythological
thinking that in that that in the
scientific world view there seem to be
two fundamental causal elements you
could say nature and nurture something
like that or biology and society and
then
technically sophisticated western
academics argue about the relative
contribution of each to any given
uh existential phenomena but in the
mythological world view there's always
three actors there's nature
um usually personified as female or
experienced as female because
personified isn't quite the right word
there's culture but there's also the
individual and the individual seems to
be the same thing as the conscious actor
and that would be the hero the dragon
slaying hero say and
there's a there is a kind of primacy
given to that so in the oldest creation
myths you always see this interplay
between
the the mother often mother earth and
the father the sky and then the hero who
separates the two and somehow brings and
perversely in some sense although being
their product clearly as the offspring
is also the thing that gives rise to
them at the same
at the same time
and it seems to be something that's in
keeping in some sense with our lived
experience is that we confront the
social world
obviously and are
beneficiaries and victims of it and we
confront the natural world
in the same manner but we also seem to
be agentic actors
and without us as a gentic actors the
idea that there's a reality seems to it
seems to be full of paradoxical holes
like reality without a conscious actor
and i think that's the sort of thing
that that generates the thinking that
you've referred to as characteristic of
of deepak chopra and the people who who
make those sorts of claims and so
i mean what
what's your what's your take on on
consciousness and its role in being
well and on the one hand it's everything
because
um it it's what i tell what i tell deep
what i write about in that chapter is
that um you're you're familiar with the
anthropic principle so i call this the
the weak consciousness principle that um
without consciousness without
consciousness nothing exists you know
this is one of the points deepak makes
uh and for me and you personally if
we're dead or we're not conscious the
world doesn't exist for our brains it's
gone there's nothing there's nothing
uh this but but he goes further than
that he says this is what i call the
strong consciousness principle that that
consciousness is required our
consciousness is required for material
things to exist and
and so there i have a discussion of what
um
donald hoffman the cognitive scientist
at uc irvine calls his
um
the interface perception theory
uh i don't know if you're familiar with
this but his analogy is like you know
your laptop screen here and you have
these icons on the screen
and like the little trash can icon looks
like a trash can but of course there's
no trash if you open
if you open your laptop there's no trash
can in there you know these are just
kind of icons that represent something
that we think of as a trash can and um
you know this is gets the problem of you
know what it's like to be a bat
uh famous thought experiment i can't
know if i bolted on some
some huge ears and and i had an
echolocation system in the neural
processes to process that information
and so on i would have some sense of
what it's like to be a vet but
but to have everything on
to actually be about them i would just
be a bat and i wouldn't even be
i wouldn't even know i was a human
wondering what it's like to be a fat
okay so at some level we can't actually
know
um you know what it's like to be
something else and so you
again with deepak and i and these kinds
of traditions like that we hit this
system logical wall of language it's
difficult to say what you mean by
certain things yes yeah well especially
when you get down to the fundamentals of
things well it's pretty clear that
the things that
so let's look at that user interface
idea
so
obviously what happens when you're
looking at a computer screen is that the
complexity of the screen is reduced to a
set of icons that can serve as tools
right and i think that that's a
reasonable way of thinking about how we
look at the world is the complexity
that hoffman's theory is that natural
selection didn't select our brains to to
record an accurate representation of
reality
like a scientific model attempts to get
ever closer to what reality is really
like no natural selection just wants us
to escape predators doesn't matter what
they look like what the icon is in your
brain a breath fat's brain or whatever
as long as you survive that's all that
matters so uh this is why we're so
easily deceived by illusions and magic
tricks and things like that that you
know our brains aren't really wired to
to to represent reality as it really is
whatever that means and um
yes you can say that without human
consciousness the iconic reality that we
inhabit would not exist
right okay okay
that slightly is that um
as i told them so let's say you know
what's it like to be a dolphin
i don't know okay so some kind of
echolocation system so and his point is
well they're you know the sharks are
dangerous so uh his they avoid sharks
but so the question is what does a shark
look like in a dolphin's brain versus
what it looks like in our brain
um it's probably quite different and i
really have no idea what a shark looks
like to a dolphin but i do know this
there really are sharks and they really
have sharp things on one end and a tail
on the other and they're eating machines
and you should avoid them so yeah
so that's actually a weakness of the
icon
claim i would say because yeah it looks
to me like here's a twist on it
what we see in in our conscious
experience are
functional icons
but they're also low resolution
representations of the things that are
actually there yes and and i don't think
that computer icons are low resolution
representations of the things that are
there they're just functional icons now
i might be wrong about that because
because it's hard to to conjure up that
analysis on the fly but the trash can
for example on your desktop
is actually
it's actually a low resolution
representation of an actual trash can
not a computer trash can even though it
functions the same way right
so so i like the icon idea but i think
it misses some element of the actual
relationship between the perception and
the reality we definitely see in low
resolution which is why we can stand
animated pictures like say the simpsons
that you know where where everything is
well extremely low resolution but that
makes no functional difference to us
whatsoever
and we definitely see and hear in low
resolution but the resolute like i i
think what we see are something like
instead of icons they're more like
thumbnails that are functional
that's a good analogy and then well i
like it because the thumbnail the
thumbnail
actually is an unbiased sampling of the
actual
object right because a photograph is
relatively unbiased sample of an object
and you can compress it you can you can
you can
until it and
and what you're doing is blurring out
distinctions between
you're blurring out distinctions between
different aspects of it without
without losing the relationship between
the parts it's something like that yeah
that's right yeah and all in in a way
much of science operates at a
metaphorical level you know that string
you know have you ever seen a string
theory documentary that didn't have
violins featured in it you know that
that the compute the brain is like a
computer it's like a dual processor it's
like a quantum information
we can't because we have to talk and we
have to you know transfer the literal
meaning of metaphors to move something
from here to there in the original greek
so you know we're trying to capture some
idea that's really hard to get that by
something we're very familiar with so
right part of the problem we have too
that addresses some of the issues you've
dealt with with
some of your recent um conversations
with people is is we're operating at
different levels so but deepak for
example uh pounds me with articles about
quantum physics that show
you know the the
stuff is really just energy atoms are
mostly empty space
and so forth and you know this this
table is you know it's actually mostly
empty space okay this is all true but we
don't live at the quantum level right
you live at the micro level where i'm
sitting in a chair and i'm not passing
through it because
at that at this level you know it's it's
not the same as at the quantum level and
yeah
and i think making that distinction um
you know helps clarify a lot of things
so like when you talk about the truth to
be found in uh biblical stories or
literary stories like dostoevsky or or
shakespeare or whatever
and the materialist scientist says well
no i mean something different by truth
it's not that one of you is right the
other is wrong it's just that these are
different levels or different
uh ways of talking about yeah whatever
you think about them as different tool
kits
yeah that's right different tool kits
that's right yeah
that's what makes it kind of a classic
american pragmatist is that i think of
these things as tools you know and
there's a scientific toolkit and there's
a there's a toolkit for action in the
world and they overlap but they're not
the same
so for example i call this um
alvey's error
alvey singer the character in woody
Ben and I met about eight months ago, eh? He came up to Toronto and gave a rousing talk and...
Talk about political correctness at that point, quite a politically appointed political talk, and I got a couple of questions for you.
One is what are you planning to do in 2018?
What do you want to see happen in 2018, personally?
And what are you aiming at, and why?
So I'm aiming at broadening the reach of the the political messages that I espouse and the messages of,
I think, personal responsibility and virtue that I try to espouse.
I'm also working on a book that I'm really interested in right now about the roots of Western civilization.
What is that makes for a happier and more fulfilled Western civilization?
What generates purpose for a civilization and for individuals?
And why it is that we seem to have lost purpose.
Because my general theory is that the reason that we're trying to murder each other
politically and the reason that we hate each other so much is that there is a
purpose-shaped hole in our heart that we are now filling with anger, a tribal anger at each other.
And I'm trying to trace back, kind of backtrack, and say okay, where did where did we go wrong?
Where was purpose at, sort of, its high-water mark and why are we now at low ebb?
Okay, one of the things that I've found in the discussions that I've had over the last year, especially the public discussions,
public lectures, let's say, is that it seems perfectly possible to
make a room go silent by speaking to, especially if it's a room full of young men,
by speaking to them about responsibility and truth.
This has really staggered me because those are not obviously saleable messages.
You know, especially for someone who's rather cynical about the fundamental nature of human beings.
I'm not saying that I am, but if you launched a business plan to the typical observers and said,
"Well, I'm going to base a public movement on the adoption of excess responsibility and the requirement to speak the truth,
and that's going to become hyper popular," the probability that people would agree that that's a possibility is pretty much zero.
So I've been thinking that
we've spoken about rights for so long and spoken about freedoms for so long, let's say since the early 60s,
just essentially speaking, that we've actually left a conceptual hole in our culture.
And that seems to be akin to the point that you're making with regards to this book.
And now, you mentioned responsibility, and why that specifically?
Well, I think that what you're talking about is exactly right.
People in the West have seemed to pose rights in direct opposition to duties.
So the American founding, particularly, was obsessed with this idea of rights and individual rights.
But there was also this corresponding idea of duties that's very clear in founding thinking.
George Washington talks about duty. Benjamin Franklin talks about duty.
The idea was that duty was to be socially generated, not by government, but by society itself.
By small communities, by churches, by your family.
And that that would fill the gap that allowed you to actually have a functioning society of rights.
But we seem to have left duty completely behind.
Now it's just all about the rights and not about the duty.
And what's happened is that that's collapsed in on itself because the society of only rights and no duties ends up generating duties masquerading as rights.
Positive rights that are actually not rights at all, that are actually me imposing a duty on you in order to further
my own perception of my rights.
And that's I think where we've been going and it's a dark place.
And it creates an enormous amount of opposition.
When you say, Jordan, when you talk about the fact that people would not have thought of building a movement on notions of truth and responsibility,
that's because, I think, for a long time, people just took it for granted that we all agreed on these things.
But there's been an actual forcible counter movement for
generations now, against both truth and responsibility.
The idea is there's no objective truth.
It's socially defined. We can make it up as we go along.
There's no telos. I talk a lot in the new book about a teleological way of thinking.
This idea that you actually have a purpose for which you were created.
And that it's your job to fulfill that purpose.
And that's completely been left by the wayside, so there's no truth.
There's no capacity, even the scientific materialist worldview actually robs you of the capacity to even change yourself.
The studies that I've seen suggest that if you believe in a certain form of determinism,
if you believe in hard determinism, you're less likely to go out and actually change your life and make it better
because you buy into your own philosophy.
And I think that as a society, we've sort of bought into that,
that we're all victims of our own biology, victims of our own race, victims of our own ethnicity or our situation,
and there's no way for us to get out of that.
And so we may as well throw up our hands or at least give the power to the only thing that can change things,
which is this massive collective that comes in and is the boot stomping on the human face forever.
Well, there's also the strange misapprehension,
I think, with regards to the nature of rights, because as far as I can tell, rights are a multi-faceted phenomena.
But I think the least metaphysical claim that you can make about rights
is that if I have a right, then that brings with it a parallel responsibility,
not only to myself, to act in a manner that is in accordance with that right, whatever that happens to be,
but I also have a responsibility,
if the right is universal, to act in a certain manner towards you.
Because there is no difference between rights and responsibilities, fundamentally.
They're just the mirror image of one another.
Now that's to say nothing about their potential metaphysical origin.
I don't want to talk about that.
But it doesn't seem to me to be logically tenable to have an infinite conversation about rights without having a parallel conversation about responsibility.
So there's a logical flaw in it that leaves that gap that needs to be filled.
And then the other thing that's occurred to me
is that
the genuine meaning in life, and I do believe that life has a genuine meaning,
I think I could make that claim without even making it metaphysical,
although I don't mind the metaphysical addition to it
It seems to me that almost all the things that people find meaningful in life that aren't merely impulsive pleasures, which, of course,
create their own entanglements, have to do with the voluntary adoption of responsibility.
So families are like that, okay. So then here's the next question.
What do you think it is that's driven our loss of that half of the conversation? What's happened?
So I think that this has been
basically a 200-year movement that first manifested itself in Europe and is finally reaching American shores about a hundred years later.
Which seems to be the pattern. All the bad stuff from Europe
hits Europe about 50 to 100 years before it hits here, and now it comes here.
I think that what happened here is that the enlightenment mentality was built on certain fundamental premises, including the use of human reason, the capacity for free will.
And all of that in turn rested on assumptions about the universe including the idea that the universe has a
discoverable design that we can actually find and pursue and that in doing so we will find happiness.
The Aristotelian idea of happiness is very much bound up with the idea of you fulfilling your telos.
The Judeo-Christian idea of happiness is you fulfilling God's purpose for you.
There is always this idea of a higher purpose that you were seeking and I think what happened is that
the enlightenment project, which started off in an attempt really in the 13th century by people like Aquinas and Maimonides to unite religion and science,
fell apart when they started to divide the two.
We're seeking the same thing. Religion and science are both seeking universal truths that can be applicable to our own lives and make us more fulfilled.
The project of science became to destroy one pole, to destroy religion.
And then by doing that, science almost turned in on itself. Reason almost ate itself.
So I think reason basically turned into, okay, we're going to follow to the logical end point all of the non-religious bases of human thought.
And once you do that, it's very difficult not to fall into a sort of self-refuting trap about human thought.
You're just a set of neurons that are firing. Neurons don't have responsibility.Your dog doesn't have responsibility.
Do you have responsibility? You are a product of your environment, your biology.
Does that carry with it any sort of moral responsibility? You don't have the capacity to choose.
If you don't have the capacity to choose, how do you have moral responsibility?
I debated Sam Harris on particularly, this issue, and I thought that actually the most telling point of the debate and discussion was not anything the two of us said.
It was a woman who got up at the very end and said to Sam, "I totally agree with you.
"There's no free will in the hard sense.
"You can't make any... see, there's no choice other than TO, right? You will have to do this,
"just driven by your biology and environment. But I have a five year old son, what do you want--
"What should I say to him?" and Sam basically said, "Lie."
Right? He basically said, "Well, tell him that he's capable of making a choice and that that's the truth about civilization."
Either you believe that's a lie and you're actively engaging in plato's good lie, basically,
or you have to believe in free will. And I don't think the capacity to choose in the capacity to self better is a lie.
I think that people do have the capacity to do that.
I think even Sam believes that, but he refuses to acknowledge it because otherwise I don't think it would be in the educational position that he is, right?
He spends his life trying to people, so that it's all weird.
I mean, I actually said in the in the discussion,
"Why are we all in this auditorium? We were just sort of predestined by the universe to be in this auditorium at a certain time?
"Do you bring the feel fulfilled by that? If so, you really have no choice in the matter."
Well one of the things that's always bothered me about the new atheist types and the hyper-rationalists
is that, as far as I can tell, their conduct is full of performative contradictions
They say they believe certain things,
but they don't act that way.
And in my sense because I'm an existentialist at heart, is that what you believe is what you act out.
What you say might be in accordance with that and it might not.
But there's no reason to assume that your beliefs are transparent to yourself, regardless of your claims.
And so I also don't see any evidence whatsoever that a society can exist that functions over any reasonable period of time, in any reasonable manner,
without predicating itself on the belief that people are both capable of free will and that they're responsible.
And so, the fact that it seems to be impossible to build a functioning society, or even functioning dyadic relationships for that matter,
in the absence of the presupposition of free will and the capacity for voluntary change,
indicates to me some evidence for the existence of those capacities.
And you have to be a staggeringly cynical person to think that no, we just have to believe that that's true even though it's a lie,
and predicate our cultures on that. First of all I don't...
I think it's a weak claim. I don't think that--it's also not the rock upon which you want to found your culture.
So one of the things that struck me about the mythological stories that I've immersed myself in, is that there's always three,
there's always three prime characters in a mythological story.
There's culture, right? So that's the Great Father,
let's say, in his many mythological guises. And there's nature. That's the Great Mother.
And so you could say that that's the biology and society of the modern scientists.
But then there's the independent individual as a causal force,
who has a nature that enables choice and free will and all of those things.
And that independent third factor is something like the Logos that gives rise to being at the beginning of time, right?
That calls order forth out of chaos.
And the fact that we can't account for that scientifically, although, I don't think we can deny it either, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
And, of course, I enjoy Maps of Meaning, so I'm pretty familiar with the terminology that you use, because I've read your book.
But I think that you know there's
this idea that you can find meaning in a meaningless universe.
That we're just meatballs wandering through space with a little bit of sentience.
Understanding that we're meatballs wandering through space.
I have a hard time building any sort of system on that.
And the refusal of the new atheist to even recognize that the morality that they promulgate, right, the rip that they have on religion typically
is that religion is barbaric and backwards and promulgates all sorts of horrible moral values with which they disagree.
And what they refuse to acknowledge is that their moral values are predicated within that system.
For the vast majority of human time, the values that they are espousing are not only not universal,
they're not even minority values. They didn't exist for the vast majority of human time.
They are absolute creations of a Judeo-Christian system that is combined with Greek reason to come up with what we have today.
And this is essentially the theory that I have come up with, is that,
and this is the thesis of the book that I'm writing right now,
which is that in order for in order for a society or an individual to feel fulfilled,
you basically have to have four things.
You have to have an individual purpose, you have to feel like you have a purpose in the world.
You personally have a purpose in the world.
You have to feel like you have an individual capacity. You have to feel like you are capable of pursuing that with alacrity.
You have to have a communal purpose. You have to feel like you along with others are pursuing a higher goal that means something.
And you have to have communal capacity, so a system that has been built that allows that community to activate when it needs to activate
and back off so that the individual can exist in that vacuum.
And we have torn away at all the roots of those things because of all of those things
that, I think the apotheosis of--I think the apex of modern thought was basically the unfulfilled
but universal theories of the the American Founding Fathers.
I think it's about as good as it got in terms governmental theory.
I don't think it's gotten better since then. I think that it's been extended more broadly.
I think the Universalism that they were implying has now been applied in many ways, and that's a great thing, right?
The founders, obviously, still held slaves, many of them.
But their principles were not in favor of slavery.
So the principles that they espoused were based on, again, these two competing poles
that are constantly in tension with one another in this sort of Leo Strauss-ian tension with one another.
Between reason and revelation, the Judeo-Christian tradition and the Greek tradition of reason.
And the tug and back and forth is what allows you to have one foot in right and one foot in duties.
So it'd be really good to have a lengthy conversation about this at some point,
because there's some things in here that really have to be dealt in deeply.
The "you have to find your own purpose" argument was one that was put forth very strongly by Nietzsche after he announced the death of God.
He said that people would have to revalue good and evil and to come up with their own definitions of what constituted morality.
The Nietzschian criticism of Christianity is about as deep as it got, with the possible exception of Dostoyevsky.
But there's one of the things I really liked about Carl Jung, and that's really struck me as irrefutable, is
Jung's fundamental response to Nietzsche was that, well,
let's take the argument of the death of God to its logical conclusion.
And then let's investigate the idea that human beings have to be the creators of their own systems of meaning.
Jung's idea, and this was also the case for the other psychoanalysts, was that's just palpably false
Because it turns out that you're not the sort of creature that can create your own meaning.
You're the sort of creature that has to discover the meaning that already exists encoded within you.
And part of that is that you're not your own slave.
And so it's a critique, not only of the idea that you can will your own destiny in its entirety,
while completely ignoring the fact that you have a nature.
But it's also a profound critique of the socialist utopian ideas that human beings can be molded in any way that they see fit.
And so Jung's objection was something like,
well, try to generate a meaning on your own, out of nothing.
And then try to force yourself to follow it and see how far you get.
What you'll find is that you rebel.
Your own nature rebels in every possible way
against the arbitrary imposition of a certain--of just any old moral framework on the manner in which you're going to conduct yourself.
Yeah, I think this is such a deep critique.
And I think that it's so telling because what we've come up with is,
the substitute for what you're talking about,
which is this acknowledgement that there is a universal purpose that we ought to be aspiring to discover.
That it's actually out there.
There's a purpose out there, and it's our job to uncover it, as opposed to self creating it.
Then that is a really deep divide in America, I think in the West generally, because what people have said is,
okay, we finally realized that we do need this thing called purpose, right?
We can't just be hedonists all the time. Drugs and sex aren't going to cut it.
We're actually gonna need to come up with some purpose...
Yeah, they're hydrous.
Right, but we're not going to be able to, but at the same time
we don't want a government or a society or a church or a community forcing down its universal perception of values on us.
And so therefore, our our happy medium is going to be you define your own freedom.
You define your own rights. And you define your own view of the universe.
Well that is always going to just evolve into this pathetic sort of solipsism
that can never be escaped from and doesn't provide happiness anyway.
I mean, the people who quote-unquote define their own meaning are some of the least happy people that you will ever meet, because
they don't believe that they're in consonance with anything larger.
If you're looking into your self,
your self is not that big.
There's not that much there, right?
There has to be something beyond you, whether you find it in God or whether you find it in a community or in nature.
There has to be something that speaks to you beyond the guts that exist inside you, or you're just examining your own intestines.
I think too that you can make a strong scientific case, and this is something I never got to in my discussions with Sam Harris,
is you could make a strong scientific case for the reality of meaning as an...
let's just call it for the reality of meaning.
You might think about it as a psychological reality,
but you can think about it as a metaphysical or a biological reality too.
Because as far as I can tell, and there's good neurological evidence for this,
your brain is adapted to two modes of being.
And one mode of being is that mode that obtains when you're where you know what you're doing
and you know what's going on.
So you could call that explored territory, let's say.
And there's another mode of being that is that which obtains when you don't know what's going on.
When you're in unexplored territory.
You can say, well, animals since the beginning of time have adapted to some combination of exploring an unexplored territory.
And that's roughly akin to known and unknown, which I think is what's symbolized in the yin-yang symbols.
And as far as I can tell, the sense of meaning that people experience that's spontaneous and deep
is an indication that they're functioning well in exploring territory, but simultaneously Increasing their capacity to deal with unexplored territory.
So it's like the zone of proximal development, or even the flow states that Csikszentmihalyi has talked about.
But see, the best thing to be is where things are going well for you.
But also where you're expanding the capacity of things to go well for you simultaneously.
And then you can add to that the fact that that's not going to be solipsistic.
Because we live in a social world.
If I'm pursuing something that's deeply meaningful, then what if things are constructed fortunately?
Then I'm going to be pursuing something that's very good for me now and me later and me deep in the future at the same time
I'm pursuing something that's good for you now, and you later and you deep into the future.
And I believe that sense of
deep engagement that envelops people in fortunate periods of their lives is actually a neurological signal that
the layers of being are stacked on top of one another properly and that you're oriented
properly within them and that it's...
See, to me, I've often thought that the most real thing is pain.
And then you might say, well,
If there's an antidote to pain, that would be something that would be even more real than pain.
And it seems to me that the sense of meaning that I'm talking about here,
that's associated with this sense of ultimate responsibility is an antidote to pain and therefore is something that's most real.
I don't see anything- you can make a metaphysical claim about that and that's perfectly reasonable.
But you don't have to. You can make a bloody hardcore scientific claim for that.
And I think it's extremely difficult to refute.
I tend to agree with that.
And I think that you referencing the flow state, that's something that the...
where we are happiest, right, from from scientific research, is in that flow state.
And that flow state Is exactly what we're talking about now.
This feeling that you have mastery over your capacity to explore the unexplored.
And that the unexplored is worth is worth exploring, right?
I mean, that's the other thing, is that what drives you to to explore the unexplored?
It's not just that you get up in the morning and you feel like wandering outside into the forest.
There's some of that.
But I think some of it is that you feel like there's an actual necessity for you as a human being to do that.
There's a moral duty for you to try and conquer new worlds.
And adding the moral layer, the moral impetus on top of,
I just have a decision to go out and explore unexplored territory is what I think
allows civilization to create rather than destroy.
And I've talked a lot on my show about male toxicity.
You know, what people call "toxic masculinity" and all this nonsense.
Yeah, yeah.
And the binary nature, I think, of human beings, particularly men, is that men,
because I have a little boy who's a year and a half old, and he's either he's either building a stack of blocks or he's destroying the stack of blocks.
There is no in-between and so if you're exploring unexplored territory,
They're only two ways to deal with that one is to actually take a fire and set it in the unexplored territory or the other
Is to cultivate that unexplored territory and adding that moral layer of it's your job
to forge out into the universe and make that cultivated territory, to bring that into the known that adding that moral dimension is I think
what both the Greeks and
Judeo-Christian tradition are about and I think it's more
Christian but the idea that there is a God worth exploring and that God has reached down to man and uplifted him is is I
think relevant to Judeo-Christian religion
And is really the essence of Judeo-Christian religion.  Iif you look at polytheism
That notion that you're out there to try and understand God
It doesn't it doesn't exist in polytheistic religion the notion that you're supposed to look beyond
Your you're supposed to look beyond yourself to a broader understanding of the universe
No
You were subject to forces in the universe right and those were represented by the different gods not this idea that there's a universal system
That's that's at least partially knowable that if you spend your life trying to investigate and live in consonance with you will be happier
That's a lot closer to the Greek system
Which is why you ends up with this common idea of the Logos that you talk about being in the book of John.
But also really springing from from Greek thought. I mean that's that's that's the idea there. Right, right.
Yes an unbelievably brilliant synthesis. No you-you-you
touched on the idea of cultivation
So I wanted to ask you about that
I'm going to Amsterdam to talk to you this event at this event sponsored by a group called the Dutch lion
And that's going to happen January 19th
and we've got about 2,000 people attending this event and it's going to be a national discussion about
Dutch and European identity and immigration and
So in principle it could be a big deal and one of the things I've been meditating on is what it is that
Western civilization got right and
so the first thing I think is that we got the idea of the Logos right that's a big deal the sovereignty of the
individual and the sovereignty and the necessity for respect of the capacity of the
Exploring individual to conquer new territory and make it habitable.  We got that right and so and I mean fundamentally right, but then
That seems also to me to tie interestingly into the idea of property rights because the fundamental Marxist claim
There's a number of them
but one of the most fundamental
claims is that
property is in some sense theft and so that might even mean the property that you accrued as a consequence of being successful
and I think it might be worth giving the devil his due and say well are there conditions under which my
occupation of a space to the exclusion of you isn't merely theft and the idea of cultivation I think is exactly the right
Answer to that
Is that the point is for each of us to allow the other to
occupy a particular place and time
In the hopes that we'll each take care of it for our own benefit and for the benefit of others
And then what happens is that everyone wins
Yeah, and this is a very obviously Lockean idea, right?
This is this is Locke's idea of what makes property worthwhile and property rights worth well as you mix your labor with the land and
You cultivated it
Which is why Locke specifically talks about the notion of adverse possession right if I own a piece of property?
And I just decided to leave it trashed
Somewhere and then someone comes in and cultivates the property even though I own the property
I should have a good legal case to actually make against that owner because I'm not cultivating the property the idea being that
Cultivation and use of the land is actually your individual duty. It's your individual duty
There's also your communal duty
So I think the moral legitimacy of property rights is you know in in Locke's thought particularly is very much tied to
Cultivation and your personal stake in what you've done with with the property that you own again
It's exactly your point that there's a mix of rights to these property rights our linkage of duties. It's not just props go be owned
Okay, so maybe we can close with this
You know the the idea of a garden is very interesting to me and of course the natural
Environment of the human being is the garden according to Genesis right it's the Garden of Eden
And I've thought for a long time, "Well, Why is it a garden?" And the answer to that is that a garden is the optimal
Juxtaposition of nature and culture. Right, so a garden is nature
Blooming of its own accord, but tended very carefully and so then the rule would be something like you're allowed
You're allowed to own something you have the right to own something you have the privilege to own something if what you're doing is
Transforming it into a bountiful garden
Right I think it's true, and I think that's true in every area of a successful life
It's true with how you raise your children
Yeah, you lose the right to raise your children properly if you're raising your children improperly
I think it's true of marriage marriages break down when you don't cultivate
cultivation is the the ultimate human need is cultivation and
When we cultivate whether it's in the realm of knowledge or science or whether it's in the realm of religion and relationships
then we are happier and when we don't cultivate and we and when we deprive ourselves of the capacity and
Both the capacity and the purpose of cultivation, then everything falls into anarchy, then then just through entropy everything will fall apart, I think.
Ok, ok, so the right objection to "privilege" is cultivation. It's like. I'm not privileged. I'm cultivating
I like that. I like that a lot. Yeah well
It's necessary to take it to grip these things by the neck you know and so ok, that's good well look
Thanks very much for talking to me
I hope we get a chance to talk again in the relatively near future because there's some things we could really sort out I think
That'd be great. I'd really appreciate it and big fan of your work obviously
Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
Thanks so much. Good talking to you. Happy new year, eh? You too.
hi everyone happy new year I've got some
things to say to junior high and high
school students and their parents about
the politicization that is occurring in
the public school system and what should
be done about that I have some very
radical suggestions I would say which I
am NOT putting forth lightly I think
that it is time for public school
students and their parents to actively
rebel against the indoctrination that is
being offered in the guise of Education
but before such a recommendation can be
reasonably offered or considered by its
recipients some careful argumentation
and review of recent events is in order
so please bear with me while I walk
through that process it's important to
get these things right and not to rush
about a year ago actually on September
27th 2016 I made a series of videos one
of them criticized a new piece of
federal legislation bill c16 bill c16 is
and I'm reading this directly from the
government website an act to amend the
Canadian Human Rights Act and the
Criminal Code here's the summary this
enactment amends the Canadian Human
Rights Act to add gender identity and
gender expression to the list of
prohibited grounds of discrimination the
enactment also amends the Criminal Code
to extend the protection against hate
propaganda set out in that act to any
section of the public that is
distinguished by gender identity or
expression and to clearly set out that
evidence that an offense was motivated
by bias prejudice or hate based on
gender identity or expression
constitutes an aggravating circumstance
that a court must take into
consideration when it imposes a sentence
now you may notice on careful reading
that the Act modifies the Criminal Code
to clearly set out that evidence that an
offense was motivated by bias prejudice
or hate extends the purview of what
might cost
- hate to a degree that's I think
completely unacceptable but that's the
least of the problems with this bill you
can't really tell what the other
problems are though unless you go read
the policy guidelines that were
established by the Ontario Human Rights
Commission which already guide
interpretation of similar legislation in
Ontario and would be used by the federal
government's own admission to guide the
interpretation of bill c16 now when I
made the videos I said as much I said
that there were two fundamental dangers
to this bill one was that because the
Ontario Human Rights Commission is a
radical and dangerous organization bent
on producing the most punitive possible
policies in the pursuit of its radical
neo-marxist postmodern agenda that the
legislation would introduce the
possibility of persecution or let's say
prosecution for so-called offenses that
should never be considered within the
proper domain of legal prosecution now I
also objected to the manner in which the
relationship between biological sex
gender identity gender expression and
sexual orientation was written into the
Ontario Human Rights Commission's
policies and therefore essentially into
the law pointing out that the law now
demands that we consider those four
different phenomena as essentially
independent when they are in fact very
tightly causally linked and as well that
the claim that's being made both
implicit and explicit that those four
sets of phenomena differ within each
strata as a consequence of socialization
in fact is also wrong but also
undermines the primary arguments that
transsexual people and gay people use to
buttress the reality of the our identity
namely that they have a biological
proclivity that directs them towards
such identities expressions and
orientations I pointed all of those
things out and that we were in danger of
legislating compelled speech in
relationship to preferred pronouns which
are the pronouns that people who vary in
their gender identity hypothetically
want to use to be referred to I pointed
out that we were in danger of making
compelled speech something
acquired in Canada so that for the first
time in our history and in the history
of the British common law the government
would be able to legislate the content
of your speech which is quite different
than legislating what you can't say
which is already something that's very
dangerous there are a variety of
consequences of making this video which
we're much more dramatic than I presume
they might be although I did know that
bill c16 posed a genuine threat to the
integrity of our state
now the first consequence was that a
very large number of faculty members at
the University of Toronto decided that I
had made the campus an unsafe place by
my statements and petitioned the
university to do something about that
and then there were a number of
demonstrations and then the University
of Toronto sent me two letters telling
me that I was violating their policies
and probably the law in Ontario which
was something I had warned about by the
way because the law was written in such
a dismal manner and over-inclusive
matter to ensure that even criticizing
it could be prosecuted under its
guidelines let's say and then there was
a debate that the university held we're
defenders of Bill c16 insisted that I
was all the terrible things that I had
been called and that I was
misinterpreting the bill and that the
dangers that I foresaw as a consequence
of its implementation would never
manifest themselves rather than to
address himself to the scientific
evidence concerning gender identity and
expression and by adopting rhetorical
strategies more common to Breitbart news
comm than a university professors
lecture dr. Peterson goes on to
discredit the very constructs on
political grounds instead of on grounds
provided by scholarly evidence that
these constructs are in no particular
order leftist radical and politically
correct on the subject of pronouns and
gender expression dr. Peterson is
emphatic that quote I don't recognize
another person's right to determine what
pronouns I used to address them I won't
do it for the vast majority of people he
goes on to say gender identity and
sexual orientation and I guess
he means sex are the same thing and
quote as for the definition of
transgender dr. Peterson claims that and
I quote I don't believe that they these
people these terms stand for good things
I think that these people use these
terms as a pretense that they stand for
good things as a pretext for them to
continue their nefarious activities and
quote well this is hardly the stuff of
academic scholarship now I should say to
the university's credit by the way that
once they got on their feet after
sending me the original two letters they
seem to have come down quite strongly on
the side of free speech in the last year
and so that's something positive that's
come out of all of this but the truth of
the matter was that I am none of those
things
and that I had read the bill and its
surrounding policies extremely carefully
and what's worse I actually understood
them and that what I had done was merely
communicate my understanding and I would
say my proper and accurate understanding
of the bill to a public that was
actually quite willing to take the time
to investigate the issue and follow it
carefully the press initially was very
ambivalent towards me but as some of the
leading journalists in Canada including
Christie Blachford and antonella are too
so and eventually Conrad black and also
Margaret went too early listen to the
videos that I had made it and then
actually read the policies in question
they understood that the bill did in
fact pose a threat to free speech in the
manner that I had described and came out
very strongly on my side now I have some
sympathy for the fact that I was tarred
with a variety of epithets immediately
after having made the video because I
was warning that there was something not
good going on in Canada and whenever
anybody warns that you should be
skeptical of them because Canada has
been a very stable and well-functioning
state for a very long period of time so
when someone pops out of his rabbit hole
or comes out of his swamp let's say and
says there's something rotten in the
state of Denmark the proper response is
no there's probably something wrong
with you and then the next investigative
strategy is to say well here's a bunch
of things that are typically wrong with
people that have something wrong with
them
bigoted transphobic racist etc maybe
you're one of those things and so we'll
throw those at you and see if they stick
because if they stick then we don't have
to pay any attention to the problem and
maybe it will go away but the truth of
the matter is that I was and am none of
those things I was fortunate because
there was evidence that that was the
case I have videotaped virtually
everything I've said to students in the
entire 25 years of my university tenure
and so everything that I thought was a
matter of public record and I had posted
it on YouTube in the form of hundreds of
lectures not only is there nothing
scurrilous and self damning in those
videos it's quite the contrary people
have found the content extremely useful
from a psychological perspective and and
that's now up into the millions of
people and so it turns out that I'm not
the bad guy of the supporters of this
Bill's imagination now the other tactic
employed by the people who have been
unhappy about what I have been saying is
to assume that I'm an all right or even
a far-right figure which is an
accusation that has been leveled at me
many times in the last year and there's
also a reason for that the reason for
that is that the group of people to the
right of the radical left is a very
large group and it includes everyone
from socialists say of the classic 1970s
type all the way to the most far-right
Nazis imaginable who are all united in
their opposition to the radical left
agenda and thus form what you might
describe as a group by default now the
fact that some of the members of a group
by default are unsavory characters does
not demonstrate that all of the members
of that group are of that type now it's
very convenient for the radical left and
much more straightforward than actually
formulating arguments to assume that
everyone who doesn't think exactly what
they think is some sort of monstrous
figure but it happens to not be the case
there are many reasonable people in fact
vast majority of reasonable people who
are firmly opposed to the agenda of the
radical left and it's completely
unreasonable to lump them in with all
right far-right and Nazi type figures
part of the reason that the postmodern
neo-marxist find themselves compelled to
do so is because they believe that they
are correct and that they have right on
their side and if it turns out that
anyone reasonable is objecting then the
fact of that reasonable opposition would
make it necessary for some things to be
rethought and so it's much easier and I
would also say much more gratifying to
an inner sense of resentment and
vengefulness to merely tar everyone who
doesn't agree with the same brush and
the argument be damned this brings us to
the most fundamental reason why there
has been such vociferous opposition
generated in relationship to what I've
been saying and that's because I got the
interpretation of Bill c16 and its
surrounding policies and the pernicious
postmodern Neel Marxist doctrine that
gave rise to it essentially correct and
it's in the best interest of those who
are pushing this pernicious doctrine and
its legislative consequences to do
everything possible to discredit me so
that the facts of the matter remain
hidden from the general public and
perhaps even from those who have
formulated the doctrine themselves so I
read bill c16 and the surrounding
policies that would guide its
interpretation as formulated by the
Ontario Human Rights Commission and then
I informed the public to the best of my
ability about the content of that
legislation and policies and its intent
and we've outlined the consequences two
major questions remain is what I had to
say to be trusted and if I was correct
in my analysis and diagnosis what steps
should be taken now if any to rectify
the situation so let's begin with the
question of whether or not my
interpretation is to be trusted and
we'll start that with a brief overview
and then an analysis
of the recent events at Wilfrid Laurier
University as you may know or may not
know but should know at Wilfrid Laurier
University recently a teaching assistant
named Lindsey Shepherd found herself in
hot water because she had the temerity
to play a video clip from TVO's the
agenda in the class that she was charged
with conducting as a consequence of
playing the video clip she was brought
in front of a disciplinary panel
consisting of three individuals nathan
rambo khanna herbert Pimlott and adrià
joel rambo comma and Pimlott are
professors in the communications
department at Wilfrid Laurier University
and Adria joel is an administrator who
was hired as a consequence of
legislation introduced by Kathleen Wynne
to conduct exactly the sort of
disciplinary investigation that she sat
in on now
Lindsay Shepherd had the presence of
mind and the fear to tape the
disciplinary hearing and after the story
about what had happened was released
lindsay released the entire audiotape
and caused a national and international
scandal i would be interested to see the
original complaint or complaints because
like i don't really have any context
like as to what exactly their problem
was can I just ask you anything - yeah I
just like to hear the whole like your
what what took place so if you just give
us okay so um we we have to teach about
grammar and in the Pearson book there
was a section about pronouns and using
like gendered language so I wanted to
make it more engaging so what I did is
we were talking about in papers using
bei as as like a singular and then we
were also talking about like
his-and-hers and like how to construct
sentences with that and then to
contextualize it I brought up like a
a YouTube debate so debate with both
sides during Peterson sides and this
this fellow named Nicholas Matt who is
also a prophet UT and they do have the
name of the UM it was from the agenda
with Steve Paikin what's in a name
potentially a great deal University of
Toronto psychology professor Jordan
Peterson has a fight on his hands after
objecting to proposed legislation that
he says would violate his freedom of
speech by forcing him to address
transgendered people using the pronouns
of their choosing joining us now to
better understand the issue and debate
what's at stake in Vancouver British
Columbia Theron Meyer transgender pundit
and youtuber in the nation's capital
Kyle Kirkup professor of law at the
University of Ottawa and here in studio
the aforementioned Jordan Peterson
professor psychology university of
toronto nicholas mat lecturer
transgender studies at U of T and Mary
Rogan whose article entitled growing up
trends is featured in the October issue
of The Walrus magazine good to have you
three here and our two friends and
points beyond we appreciate everybody
being on the program for what is I think
one of the hottest topics in the country
today professor Peterson and it's all
because of you and I think before we go
any further with our conversation here I
want to give people a sense of how hot
this has got starting on the downtown
campus of the University of Toronto
[Applause]
well as you can see the opponents of
free speech are capable of making
annoyance inarticulate noise free speech
is the mechanism by which we keep our
society punched by doing this I'm going
to post this online that you would like
people to not to be to be more
accommodating of trans people in people
of color at your events in future I felt
very common here there have been
multiple multiple recorded instances of
trans people killing themselves because
it wasn't for this wall I ask you why do
you have the authority to determine
whether or not an individual is worthy
of you using their pronouns like if I
asked you would you please use they/them
pronouns for me what what it would
depend on what do you want to jump my
pronoun okay with indulgence of
everybody else on the program I'm gonna
start with Professor Peterson off the
top here for a while because as I
suggested you thought long and hard
about this you posted a few things up to
YouTube because you had been thinking
long and hard about it one and a half
million hits later Jordan one and a half
million hits later this has become a
huge issue so let's start there why did
you post those views to YouTube in the
first place well there's proximate and
distal reasons the proximate reasons was
because I received some correspondence
from from from clients of mine who had
been I would say persecuted in a variety
of ways by people who were politically
correct and they sent me some
documentation about Bill c16 and The
Associated policy statements on the
Ontario Human Rights Commission which I
read and was not very happy about and
also because the University of Toronto
decided to make anti racism and anti
bias training so-called
anti racism and anti bias training
mandatory which I regarded as an in a
per
incursion into the domain of political
opinion by the university administration
have you taken that training yet no and
I don't have to yet it's it's the HR
department personnel that have to take
it if they decide that you have to will
you no way not a chance
and what's the other referred to
persecution that friends or clients of
yours had experienced so yes yeah well
there are lots of places now where the
workplace has become I would say
excessively politicized and so people
who have viewpoints and this also
involves includes I would say fairly
radical leftist viewpoints people don't
feel comfortable at all in in in being
able to use the language of their choice
or to have even opinions about a variety
of different things essentially I guess
what I'm asking is to lay the case of
what now what is it you find offensive
about this legislation well
fundamentally there were two things that
really bothered me although there have
been other things I've thought about
since one was that I was being asked as
everyone is to use a certain set of
words that I think are the constructions
of people who have a political ideology
that I don't believe in him that I also
regard is as dangerous what are those
words those are the made-up words to
read that that people now describe as as
gender-neutral and so to me they're
they're they're they're an attempt to
control language and in a direction that
isn't happening organically it's not
happening naturally people aren't
picking up these words in the typical
way that new words are picked up but by
force and by Fiat and I would say by
force because there's legislative power
hi everyone so here we are for the first
QA for 2018 there's five hundred and
fourteen questions lined up I don't
think I'm gonna get to all of them so
it's been a busy time since the last
time I did a QA some of you probably
know about the wind lindsay shepherd
affair at Wilfrid Laurier University
where a teaching assistant was brought
in front of a tribunal because she had
the temerity to play a video where I was
discussing Bill c16 on a public
television show that's been quite the
national and international scandal I
would say and so I made a bit of a video
about that today which I haven't
launched yet it contains a message to
junior high and high school students I'm
recommending to them that they well I
guess you'll have to watch the video I
didn't mean to make it a cliffhanger
like that but then as soon as I said
that I thought better of it and thought
maybe I'll just wait but anyways let's
take a look here Steve a has the first
question how can we know the difference
between unhealthy repression and healthy
self restraint of sexuality well I would
say you know part of what constitutes
ethics let's say first of all let's
start let's think about ethics to begin
with so what's the point of conducting
your life ethically the answer that
isn't so that you follow the proper
rules precisely the the answer to that
is so that you balance your life so that
it says productive and meaningful as it
can possibly be and that would be
productive and meaningful for you with
any luck but also for people around you
that would even be better and and for
you now and next week and into the
future so it's sort of a variation of
the philosopher Immanuel Kant's moral
dictum which was act such that your
action becomes a moral universal
something like that although I think
that it's it's better phrased across
time and across people like that so when
you're thinking about an ethic that has
to do with any fundamental motivation
like sexual
you have to think about it in the
context of the rest of your life
the question is whether or not but what
did I say what what did I read at one
point that I really liked with regards
to sexuality who's in control that's the
issue is it you or is it the sexuality
that's in control is have you integrated
your sexual life into the rest of your
life so that the whole thing makes a
harmonious balance and are you in charge
or is it in charge so to speak because
if you're not in charge with that
harmonious balance then things are going
to waver wildly out of control and
you're going to find yourself in
dreadful trouble that happens whenever
any given drive or me really any given
value predominates to the exclusion of
all else now it seems to me that
sexuality is best handled within the
confines of a relationship that's the
classic ethical solution to the problem
it's because sexuality brings with it a
tremendous amount of responsibility now
people don't like to think that
especially people who I would say are
low in conscientiousness let's say or
high and impulsivity it's easy for
people to believe in what would you call
it casual sex which is not something
that I think exists because I don't
think you can divorce sex from its
sociological or political or economic or
psychological consequences and I would
say the endless scandals that have
plagued the United States in particular
in the last year with regards to sexual
behavior are proof positive that there's
no such thing as casual sex I think the
reason for that is that the consequences
of sex are too dramatic it's not just
pregnancy and disease let's say which
are both as dramatic as consequences can
be in life but also the fact that
there's no disentangling sexual behavior
from emotional behavior or maybe you
could say even worse if you try to
disentangle your sexual behavior from
your emotional behavior then I think
what happens is that you end up
cynical I mean if you're let's say if
you're a serial if you're us if you have
a lot of one-night stands and a lot of
casual partners then first of all
there's not much discrimination between
one partner and the other and so in some
sense you're in a loop and and just
repeating the same act over and over but
you can't there's nothing deep about it
there's nothing that that enables you to
establish a relationship with another
person and I think that that's a I think
that you corrupt your soul in that way
and that you hurt yourself across time
and of course you're going to hurt other
people as well so I'm not a big admirer
of the casual sex idea I think it's a
demented adolescents fantasy
fundamentally it just doesn't work out
in the real world now
healthy self restraint well with regards
to sexuality it's the same with
everything else is that there's there's
the necessity to forego immediate
gratification for the purpose of medium
to long term thriving let's say so if
your sexuality is integrated in an ethic
that encompasses the rest of your life
and if it serves that ethic then I would
say it's properly restrained if it's
unhealthily repressed well then you're
angry and bitter and resentful and
cursing the opposite sex or perhaps the
same sex if you happen to be gay for
failing to recognize your particular
form of sexual what would you call
attractiveness
I think resentment and anger are a good
indication that there's something wrong
with the manner in which your sexuality
is restrained so I hope hopefully that's
a decent answer
Trevor MOOC says why are dragons in
Western culture bringers of death and
destruction that must be slayed well in
the East they're portents of good
fortune to be revered well I
that's a great question by the way the
dragon the dragon I already defined the
dragon at some point partly from a book
I read a while back on dragons as a tree
cat snake bird the idea in the book was
that the dragon was a imagistic
representation of the class of all
predators which means also might be why
dragons also breathe fire because
fire was undoubtedly a common
destructive agent in our evolutionary
past but the dragon is the most
primordial symbol of that which lurks
beyond which is known in fact it's even
more primordial than that because it
even is that which lurks beyond what is
unknown in some sense remember Don
Rumsfeld unknowns unknown unknowns well
that's basically the dragon there's some
unknowns that pop up that you can master
right away and you could kind of think
of those as known unknowns but unknown
unknowns are those things that pop up
that you don't know how you didn't even
you had no idea whatsoever that they
even existed anyways what's the
character of an unknown unknown well
part of its terrifying because it can it
can it can do you in right but part of
its also positive and and because it
anything that's truly unknown brings it
with it a tremendous amount of new
possibility that's why dragon's hoard
gold or why they also hoard princesses
or guard princesses hoard I would say is
the right word so I don't think the
dragon in the West is a fully negative
symbol because the dragon has gold
associated with it or virgins and the
reason for that is that the hero who
confronts the dragon gets the virgin and
that hasn't changed that's that's a
story as old as time and and I don't
think it'll ever change as long as there
are human beings now why the Chinese put
stress on the positive side and the West
put stress on the negative side is
difficult to say I might say because the
Chinese got organized so early I have a
sneaking suspicion that it was easier
for them to see a little bit of chaos as
something positive something necessary
and positive as a counterbalance to the
tremendous organizational weight of
their state that's the best best answer
that I've been able to formulate so so
anyways the dragon is a very complex and
ambivalent symbol it it combines
everything into one symbol positive and
negative and then you can stress the
positive or you can stress the negative
you could also say to some degree that
whether a dragon is positive or negative
depends to some degree on the manner in
which you approach it because the
psychological reality is that Dragons
approached voluntarily well small are
most likely to be positive and that's a
really good thing to know in your life
it's a good reason it's a good rule of
thumb to help you stop avoiding things
that you shouldn't avoid so that they
don't grow and magnify beyond your
capacity to deal with them you often
mention disciplining children so they
behave what is your advice for making
them behave without resorting to
corporal punishment well first of all it
depends on what you mean by corporal
punishment
timeout could be regarded as corporal
punishment it also depends very much on
the age of the child let's say a two
year old well in my new book by the way
I have a chapter in there called don't
let your children do anything that makes
you dislike them and the reason that I
wrote a chapter about that is because
people who let their children do things
that make them dislike them end up
disliking them and because there's a
huge power differential generally
speaking between adults and children if
you end up disliking your children
because they're not behaving well
they're behaving disgracefully say or
their or they're challenging your
position in the Authority hierarchy to
regularly something you won't put up
with by the way even if you think you
will it's necessary to get your
disciplinary routine straight so the
first thing I would say is figure out
what the rules are there shouldn't be
too many for two-year-olds basically
they have to know what no means and they
also have to learn as they approach 3
not to kick hit bite or steal
essentially now it's easy to train a
two-year-old but no means you can
actually start with a child that's only
13 months old a child that can cry let's
say that or that can crawl let's say
that you have a child is starting to
crawl and wants to explore the house so
the first thing you do if you have any
sense is try to get rid of most things
that the child could cause a tremendous
amount of trouble with to to the things
or to the chair
so that it's reasonably safe and then
the child is gonna want to want to crawl
around and get into everything and so
but maybe there are things you don't
want him or her to get into like maybe
there's a Oh what would we say maybe
there's a tablecloth and on top of the
tablecloth there's a plant or maybe
there's some plants on the floor and
when the child is crawling and goes off
to do something that he or she shouldn't
you can just grab his leg and you know
gently but firmly and say no and the
child will keep trying to move forward
because they're stubborn little
blighters and you can continue to say no
and if you persist with saying no then
the child will eventually give up and
sort of go limp now now and often the
child will cry when you do that and of
course that might make you feel guilty
but what that means is that you've
effectively brought the behavior to a
halt and if you do that ten times you
got to watch your child and don't stop
them from exploring things that they
need to explore and you want to use this
sort of thing with judiciously you can
grab them by the leg and say no and no
no and wait until they give up usually
they'll cry and then you can let them go
and then soon after you do that about 10
times soon then if you just say no with
the same tone of voice the child will
generally what happens the child will
immediately cry and then stop and then
after about ten repeats of no without
having the leg grabbed then no will just
produce stopping of the behavior and
that's unbelievably useful because as
soon as you're you train your child to
understand what no means then they
really have free rein of the house in
some sense with relative minimal
supervision from you first of all they
can learn what things they're not
supposed to get into and it's amazing
how fast children can learn that and how
fast they can generalize to the class of
things that they shouldn't get into like
you don't have to teach them every
single thing they can generalize very
rapidly that's not much different than
thinking but also once they are capable
of understanding what no means you have
an extremely potent means of helping
them regulate
their behavior with a minimum of
intervention so that's unbelievably
useful so now let's say you have a
two-year-old who's pretty contentious
and two-year-olds are pretty contentious
some of them in particular because about
5% of two-year-olds most of them are
male are quite aggressive by temperament
and those are the ones that if you put
with other two-year-olds will frequently
kick hit bite or steal not all kids are
like that but some are and most of them
get socialized out of that by the time
they're about four now let's say you
have and at two they also start to
experiment with saying no back and also
with misbehaving although they can do
that even younger than that so if you
have a two-year-old who's particularly
rambunctious and who decides he isn't
going to listen to you we use he in this
example because it's boys that are more
likely to misbehave and not not listen
you can you can pick them up and you
know by the arms now you got to get your
attitude right because you don't want to
be stupid you don't want to let your kid
make you mad especially when they're
really little because you're really big
and you can hurt them and so you got it
you got to have us a clue that's why you
want to get the rules of discipline and
order the minimum rules of discipline
and why you want to have a strategy but
let's say your two-year-old is insisting
upon doing something that you don't want
them to do like inserting a fork into an
electrical outlet and you just can't
have that and so you can say no
hopefully you've already done the no
training that I recommended and and if
that doesn't work what I recommend doing
is picking the child up by the arms and
then putting them on the steps say look
you sit there until you're ready to
listen now or usually the child will sit
there and then the rule has to be
something like you can get up as soon as
you're ready to be a civilized human
being again and you can refer to
yourself your own attitude during a
process like that because if the child
does comply and sits on the steps and
then comes and says I'm ready to be good
and you like him again you've got to be
honest about this then you can tell that
he's honest in his decision to rejoin
the civilized world now sometimes if you
put a two-year-old that's particularly
rambunctious on the staircase that as
soon as you let go of their arms they'll
run off and that can be a game or it can
just be an act of defiance and in that
case then you go
get him and he put him back on the steps
and you do that several times if
necessary and if that that becomes a
game then you sit on the step and you
hold him by the arms remember no anger
cuz he's just - for God's sake you know
you don't have to be angry just put him
on the steps and hold him say look I'm
not letting you go until you sit there
and behave and so if you hold him for a
while he'll squirm and look away and so
forth but you can get his attention if
you're a little bit stubborn you hold
him there and say you're gonna sit there
till I decide that you can leave and so
you hold them and he'll squirm and but
you can outweigh them if you're patient
but you got to make the time and then
eventually he'll stop squirming and you
can let him go and then you can sit
there and watch him and when you think
he's you know decided that he's going to
be a civilized creature then you can say
that's good and you can give him a pat
on the head and you can say let's go
back and do what we're doing and the
rule has to be you see that the
punishment not only has to bring the
behavior to halt in the most merciful
manner possible but that's still
effective but it also has to satisfy
your need for order and justice so that
you don't carry resentment and
irritation about the child's misbehavior
forward with you because you don't want
to kid yourself about what sort of nice
person you are you're not nearly as nice
a person as you think and no one likes
to be brought down the authority
hierarchy by a recalcitrant two-year-old
so in almost all circumstances those
processes will suffice
there's other disciplinary strategies
that you can use too that are more
positive I mean one of the things that
you can do for example if you're let's
say you want to get your child to go to
bed which is a really good idea you
should set a stable bedtime for your
child and I would say if they're under 4
it should be around 8 or 7 or something
like that because you want to have a
life and you want to have a life with
your wife so that you don't end up
hating your child and so one of the
things you can do if you want to train
your child to go to bed at 8:00 so maybe
he's not going to bed until 10:00 right
now and you want to fix that so you say
okay go to the grocery store or a little
convenience store buy ten little gifts
and it can be cheap kids don't care
they're not very bright you know you can
fool them so by 10:00
things that you think your kid would
like and wrap them up and then put them
up on the shelf where he can see them
but can't get out them then you say look
kid I'm gonna put you to bed at 9:30
tonight and if you don't get out of bed
then I'm going to give you one of these
I'm gonna give you one of these gifts in
the morning so or if the or you can do
it another way too if the child is
always giving you a rough time about
getting ready for bed and going to bed
you can say look if you're if you put on
your pajamas without fussing and you
climb into bed then they'll give you one
of these little gifts and so then if
that works then the child can have a
little gift and he's in bed at 9:30 and
then you can make it 9:00 and then you
can make it 8:30 and then you can make
it 8:00 and those are called that's
called successive approximation right
you hit the target you specify the
target that you want the child to
achieve and then use small rewards not
too often in order to attain that goal
and those are unbelievably effective
strategies and they can actually be
pretty fun but I would say the advice to
not let your child do anything that
makes you dislike them is really really
useful you want to talk this over with
your partner too so that you have your
disciplinary strategies and your rules
talked out so that you don't work across
purposes to one another so okay so
that's probably good enough for that can
we take the biblical Andrew Wells asks
can we take the biblical story seriously
enough with us without also keeping
biblical traditions what's the
psychological impact of group gathering
church-going I think we could take the
biblical stories seriously enough but I
don't think that it's particularly easy
of professors from Wilford Laurier to
talk about the Lindsay Shepard Scandal
and what happened with professor
rambucana and pimlot and administrator
Adria Joel Adria right Adria Joel who I
think is The Unsung
what would you call it the unsung
villain in this entire process because
she seems to have escaped relatively
unscathed even though I think her role
is more reprehensible than anyone else's
anyways why don't you guys introduce
yourself and talk about what you've been
doing at Wilford Laurie and also just
let everybody know why we're meeting
yeah well uh I'm Dave Haskell and I'm a
prophet Laurier I'm in the faculty of
liberal arts this is my colleague will
will how did we come into this whole
thing like this is this didn't just
happen with the Lindsay Affair like well
to background we support maximum freedom
of expression and we've really found
each other along with a few other
professors who feel the same way that we
do that free expression and free inquiry
is the core value of a university and
but sort of how do we run into each
other business school uh so my exposure
to faculty Arts is minimal and I've been
really sheltered from this
professionally but watching what's
happening in the U.S watching what was
happening to you at UT I'm a grad I did
my PhD here and
um
it was in January that uh our University
leadership sent out an email
um explaining to The Faculty how to
think about the Trump travel ban and
declaring uh it's its commitment to
diversity equity and uh inclusivity and
I was really offended by that that they
would see fit to pronounce on a
political issue in another country uh
offended why
I I'm I got a PhD I'm able to reach my
own conclusions uh about whether these
things are good or bad I don't need my
Administration preaching to me about the
right way to think about an issue a
political issue particularly and so so
why do you think they did that well and
and what do you think they were thinking
when they did that because that sort of
seems self-evident right it's not the
administration's role to dictate a
political stance to The Faculty that's
just clearly not their role so what do
you think they were thinking it would it
seemed like a manifestation of trump
derangement syndrome it seemed like just
the the same reaction that the the
Democrats in the US were having that
they lost to this horrible person and
they couldn't understand why and it was
so reprehensible and here was yet
another
terrible thing that he was doing and we
must all agree how bad it was well I
mean even if the funny thing is even if
you can make that case and say
personally and even socially the idea
that you could make that case and then
be University Administration and then
tell your faculty to think that way I
mean that's taking it in a whole
different that's taking it to a whole
whole different level of presump
presumptuousness did that come from our
Administration or from the diversity and
Equity from the administration from the
leadership the university leadership is
that right
I remember the uh it's confusing because
I remember we also got an email from the
diversity and Equity office when when
Trump won and they said that they've
created a safe space and they were going
to be open for extra hours in case
anybody needed to go and find uh Comfort
right that happened a lot in the United
States eh but you think at least the
Americans have some justification for it
given that it's their country I mean we
need safe spaces because a conservative
was elected in the United States in the
in not even in our country it does seem
to be a little bit on the Absurd side
well it's just to me you know they
didn't send out an email when Justin
Trudeau won and I have to imagine that
there were some students who were
offended like there's got to be
conservative students at Laurier but
it's it's very much a one-sided
conversation when we talk about
Administration when we talk about the
diversity and Equity office they talk
about diversity but they really don't
mean it because they do not want those
students who are ideologically diverse
they talk about inclusion but they
purposely will exclude those students
and an email like that is proof positive
of that kind of exclusion but didn't so
well that was that was the thing that
just got me hopping mad and I was
emailing back and forth with a colleague
of Queens uh and we were talking about
the importance of free speech and this
had outraged me and uh and he sent me a
link to a Star article that David had
written this is now maybe a month later
in February or March about uh this guest
speaker oh Daniel robotic yeah yeah yeah
yeah and that she couldn't speak and was
she was she uh umeshi's lawyer yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah so merely because she
served as a defense lawyer for someone
she was pilloried well this was another
like when people look at the Lindsay
Shepard Affair this is not an isolated
case at Wilford Laurier this is
something that is
it is a regular occurrence and now it
isn't always as high profile but whether
it's students in my office saying I
can't speak whether it's my colleague
sometimes saying to their students who
believes that they're stifled and every
hand goes up and there have been cases
of that colleagues have come and told me
but we've got these other examples like
when Daniel robatai came to speak at the
Brantford Campus of Wilford Laurier and
some students agitated until she was
forced not to do so and and my my
president right we should provide some
background so that was the gomeshi case
right and so ganeshi was a CBC
journalist who was accused of sexual
assault and sexual misbehavior by a
number of people who was immediately let
go at CBC who has dragged viciously
through the Press I would say and then
was
um
found innocent
in the courts and and but and he had a
defense lawyer and the defense lawyer
had been invited to speak yes she was
part of the defense team she was going
to speak and she wasn't going to speak
about the gomeshi trial in fact she was
going to talk about what it's like to be
a high power powerful lawyer
um in in the big city in Toronto and I
mean that would have been really
valuable for the criminology students
but the students who were agitating
against her really with the support of
several professors uh they were saying
well no if she comes on it will trigger
students it will um it will mentally
harm students and so that was used as
justification for the interesting too to
be to see that these claims of harm and
so forth are are generally put forth by
people who have no clinical expertise
whatsoever and their idea is that the
way that you
first of all that the way to Aid
people's mental health is to protect
them and there's no evidence for that
whatsoever and the second is that
in your attempts to protect them the
best thing to do is to shelter them from
exposure to ideas that would be
challenging or frightening which is
precisely the opposite of what a
clinician does when he's trying to or
she is trying to deal with someone who
has excess anxiety what you do
in a case where someone who has excess
anxiety even as a consequence of a
trauma let's say is you get them to
voluntarily expose themselves to
increasingly larger doses of exactly
what frightens them that's the Curative
root so not only is it
um advice that's being disseminated Say
by people who aren't clinicians it's
actually advice that's being
disseminated who are promoting the
opposite of what an informed clinician
would do and it isn't that isn't my
opinion that's that that's as close to a
consensus as anything you could reach
among clinical practitioners right one
the rules for clinical Improvement is
get your story straight something like
that talk about your past sort it out
and expose yourself to the things that
you're afraid of that you're inclined to
avoid that's the pathway to to
resilience and more robust mental health
okay so tell us the story a bit you guys
have an inside view of what's happened
on the Wilford Laurier campus since the
the Lindsay Shepard Affair broke I
should just say that you know after this
robita event I read David's piece and
immediately emailed him and just said
and that's how hindrance right and uh we
met and we had lunch uh and uh and and
just talked about the you know free
speech in the Chicago statement and how
can we get it implemented the university
but we just couldn't see any way forward
and really right so that's another thing
we want to discuss you guys have
Rewritten the Chicago statement right so
that it's more appropriate in a Canadian
context right we call it the Laurier
Laurier statement for freedom of
expression okay okay and you've been
trying to convince or or you're trying
to being tried you've been trying to
communicate with the university
authorities to have that ratified
essentially adopted as a statement of
principles and have you had any success
with that or what's the consequence they
deferred to a task force that's that's
uh going to be held uh and we can
certainly okay and is that in the
aftermath of the shepherd Affair is that
going to be part of it really do
anything over the summer just because it
just seemed too big a mountain uh and
there seemed to be no way to introduce
the idea right catalyst forward now
you've got your Catalyst and Lindsay
Shepard becomes the Catalyst and oh my
goodness and and you know what
what uh object lesson in what goes on at
Laurier but also what an object lesson
and how you handle these Free Speech
opponents uh she's really given a model
that other students I hope will follow
but it was it was through this robotic
thing that we got to know each other and
and a few others yeah there's a couple
more of you that's right yeah and and so
about five I think you told me that's
right so so the robot eye incident
really brought us out of the woodwork we
started to chat and say you know we see
this problem on our University we don't
know what to do and then when the
Lindsay Shepard Scandal broke uh we all
immediately we were emailing us it's
happened again is essentially what we
were saying we said we've got to do
something about this uh I'd already
the I was out on a on a trip and I came
home and I said to my wife where are the
newspapers this was uh November 12th
when the story broke Christy
blatchford's story and I said hey honey
where are the newspaper she said I can't
let you see them I said why not she said
you cannot read the papers and of course
it was because Christy blatchford's
article was in there so as soon as I
read it I I was beside myself I thought
it's happened again and this time this
is really terrible they've attacked a TA
is what they've done so I contacted with
the full force of the administration and
and claims that she had done mental harm
broken two laws two laws Federal and
provincial
sincerely worried that they were going
to Railroad this young lady or they
could have easily taken her to the
Ontario Human Rights Commission they
would have had a field day what was
going to happen I contacted Christy
blatsford I said can you put me in touch
with her she was kind enough to do so I
got in touch with Lindsay and I said
I know that this is a terrible time but
you've got a professor who supports you
I knew that these gentlemen also would
uh and then quickly I as quickly as I
could I wrote an op-ed for the Toronto
Star that week just again saying this is
happening the world needs to be aware of
it but it was really after that uh that
Monday after the story broke on the
Saturday we started to talk and and how
can we how can we assist Lindsay and and
how can we well the op-ed helped and the
fact that the star ran it was quite
remarkable as well so hooray to the star
the star really does want to do its best
to Champion free expression yeah well
you'd think journalists would actually
be concerned about that to some degree
well and I think they are like one of
the things that's happened to me in the
last year is that although the Press
coverage of what I did and just to
remind people so last year I made a
video about Bill c-16 which was the bill
whose Provisions Lindsay Shepard
theoretically transgressed against just
to be clear about that and when I first
made the video I was a kid used by all
sorts of people including journalists of
well first of all making unnecessary
noise and being unnecessarily alarmist
which were the minor accusations and
then the more major accusations were
that you know I was all the things that
you'd expect at far right
um agitator to be a bigot in a
transphobian a racist and all of these
things and so but what what was
interesting was that the journalists by
and large especially the main
journalists turned around on that issue
really quickly it was probably within
three weeks because what happened was a
couple of them actually went and read
the policy documents that I had referred
to on the Ontario Human Rights
Commission website which are still there
and which are still appalling and have
led exactly to this situation with
Lindsay and as soon as they read what I
had been
uh uh what what outing let's say in my
video then they started to understand
that this what that I wasn't just
ringing a bell for no reason at all it
was actually reasonable I think of
people to go after me to begin with
because Canada is such a safe and
peaceful place in our political
situation an economic situation is being
so stable that when someone comes out
and says look we're in danger of making
a major error The Logical First Response
should be no there's something wrong
with you it's like we're fine there's
something wrong with you I was just
trying to protect these people right
exactly well and and so it's reasonable
I think it was reasonable for me to be
hit hard in the aftermath of doing that
because well generally speaking
whistleblowers in Canada are alarmists
in Canada have very little to be
alarmist about right but this this okay
so now so fine so this thing happened
with Lindsay what what have you seen
happening on the Wilford Laurier campus
things that I'm not particularly proud
of I I would say I mean I knew that will
and some other colleagues were going to
come to the aid of Lindsay but I was
thinking that once her recording became
public that we would just have a flood
of professors coming to support our
cause which is we had a Laurier
statement for freedom of expression
modeled on the Chicago statement we
thought that immediately people would
just say of course we need to reinforce
that this needs to be the primary
Mission free expression free inquiry
needs to be the primary Mission and we
got that up pretty fast we really did in
about 10 days uh and and got it on
change.org and then where I was emailing
everybody that I knew and trying to get
people interested and I would say out of
50 emails I sent I got 15 signatures
from personal uh relationships so even
with personal relationships you could
only get a 30 hit rate so what do you
think's stopping professors from signing
that say or clambering on board
especially in the aftermath of the
shepherd record recording which we
should point out you know and this is
one of the things that's very
interesting is that
outside
Wilford Laurier and perhaps outside
universities that are in the same boat
the reaction to that
recording was Universal right and
National and international and uniform
and the reaction was what the hell this
is scandalous there's nothing about this
that is acceptable right and so what's
what struck me as so remarkable is that
even though there's been International
outrage over this and and very and not
and and outrage of A Sort that's only
been disputed by a very small number of
people at least to begin with Wilfred
Laurier responded on Moss let's say as
if this was somehow debatable you know
as if there were two sides of the story
here let's say and I thought well I
thought rambucana and pimlot who were
the professors did what they did I
thought was appalling
for in upgrading her and in the manner
in which they did it and in the language
that they used but I thought what was
truly terrifying was the presence of
Adria Joel at that Inquisition because
she was a administrator who was hired
specifically to do exactly what she was
doing by legislated necessity on the
part of the Ontario liberal government
right because it wasn't just the
university that was involved in this her
position was set up because of
legislative necessity which is something
also to keep in mind when we're going
after the universities okay so you had a
hard time getting faculty on board how
many faculty members did sign it 59 is
it yeah out of out of how many faculty
550 full-time and now and so you say
well what what's going on with them well
I think that some maybe I know this is
hard to believe but maybe unaware even
now I think there's a big proportion
that are unaware I I it's unbelievable
is that it is I think that okay well
that's its own Mystery because I I don't
know where you'd have to have been in
the now last month to not have noticed
that this has happened that people
perhaps in The Sciences the Computer
Sciences the math they they've got their
head down and they're they're doing
their research and and so and so I don't
think there's anything diabolical there
I think that business as well I've got
very few signatures from the the
business faculty I mean some but uh a
lot of people just aren't engaged it's a
bit of a commuter school a little bit
and so I think people are just getting
on with their research and their
teaching maybe not aware of the problem
well that's that's an interesting thing
in and of itself because I think part of
What's led to the occupation of the
University let's say by the radical
post-modern types is the proclivity of
the scientists in particular but also I
would say the more serious Scholars to
be focusing near thoroughly on their
field of inquiry which is essentially
what they should be doing and not paying
attention to any of the broader
contextual issues which is actually a
perfectly fine strategy when things are
going well but a terrible strategy when
they're not and what you also see so
we've got these people who might not be
aware
and we've got the few who are aware and
are supporting maximum free expression
but then you've got these other people
who are convinced that maximum free
expression free inquiry is not a good
thing for a university and and those
people are definitely congregated within
the Arts and the humanities and they
[Music]
that's a hell of a welcome for someone
who's gonna talk about the Bible so I
thought I would get farther than through
Genesis by by this point but I'm not
unhappy about the pace either I've
learned a tremendous amount and so
hopefully what we'll do today is finish
Genesis completely and then I think I'll
try to start up with Exodus in May
depending on what happens next year I
have a busy travel schedule and but I
would really like to do it I really like
the Exodus story and I understand it
very well a lot of the stories in
Genesis especially after the first few
stories say up to the Tower of Babel I
had to do a tremendous amount of
learning about which is really good but
I do know the Exodus story so I'm really
looking forward to that so so let's dive
right into it and see how far we can get
today so we'll review first so Joseph's
father is Jacob and Jacob is the
patriarch of Israel essentially that the
father of the twelve tribes and we might
remember that he had a very morally
ambivalent pathway through life and it's
one of the things that I think so
interesting about the stories in the in
the Old Testament is that these so
called patriarchal figures are very
realistic and it's something that I was
also being struck by that accounts in
the New Testament that way there's lots
of things that Christ does that you'd
think would have been edited out over
time and sanitized but they're not and
that the Old Testament is definitely not
a book that's been sanitized and that's
it
quite interesting that that's the case
so you sort of see people with all their
flaws and I've been trying to also
derive some general conclusions about
them the moral of the story of the
Genesis stories and because these
stories are fundamentally moral and
moral as far as I'm concerned has to do
with action right because moral
decisions are the decisions that you
make when you're structuring action when
you decide to do one thing or another
generally you want to do things that are
the best things that you can think of to
do and hence good but sometimes you also
want to do things that are they're worse
things you can do you know because
you're angry or resentful or bitter and
so the moral decisions that you make
that govern your actions are really the
most important decisions that you make
in your life and it's not that easy to
figure out how to make moral decisions
we don't have an unerring technology for
that the same way as we do for say
making decisions about empirical reality
which in some ways seem a lot simpler
partly because we can work collectively
at it partly because we have a rigorous
methodology for deciding what's true and
what's not so one of the things that's
really struck me like it's an
overarching theme I would say that the
emerges out of Genesis especially after
the really ancient stories say
especially after the stories of Cain and
Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel
when you get to the accounts of the
historically or historically real people
one injunction seems to be get the hell
out there and do something you know one
of the major themes for all of the
patriarchs that we've talked about
Abraham say Jacob and Joseph is move out
into the world regardless of the
circumstances at hand now that's in in
in the Old Testament stories that's
basically portrayed as harkening to the
voice of God something like that maybe
you could think about
his destiny or a psychological calling
and the funny thing too is is that it's
not that these people have an easy time
of it when they heed that call so what's
what's fascinating is that they often
run into extreme difficulties right away
and I think that's very interesting
first of all because life is obviously
full of extreme difficulties and second
it's another example of the failure to
sugarcoat things which is one of the
things I think makes a mockery of anti
religious theories that are even quite
sophisticated say like Freud's because
Freud thought of religion as a and it
was a wish fulfillment essentially and
and also Marx who thought about religion
as the opiate of the masses it's if
those were true it seems to me that
there'd be a lot more wish and a lot
less reality a lot less stark harsh
reality you know in the first thing that
Abraham encounters is a famine and then
he has to hide his wife and then he he
basically journeys into a tyranny so
that's about as bad as it gets in some
ways and those themes recur continually
and no one ever lives where they're
supposed to live they'll even live in
Canaan and not the promised land and so
it's a pretty rough it's a pretty rough
series of stories but the fundamental
idea is something like there's no time
for sitting around there's time to go
out into the world and engage and then
there's there's hints about the proper
and improper ways of engaging right so
clearly the improper way to engage is I
think most clearly delineated in the
Cain and Abel story and with Cain
exemplifying the inappropriate way to
engage with the world and that's to
engage with the world in a bitter
jealous and resentful manner now one of
the things that I really like about the
Cain and Abel story and that theme
recurs continually with the with the
duality of the brothers right there's
there's constant conflict between a
perspective that's essentially like
Cain's and and the and the opposite
perspective which all which I'll get to
in a minute
but Caine sees that the world is a very
tragic place and that the rewards are
distributed unfairly and that there are
people who do better and people who do
worse and as a consequence of that he
becomes bitter and resentful and curses
God and then he becomes homicidal
fratricidal which is even worse than he
destroys his own ideal then his
descendants basically become genocide or
something like that so that seems to be
the wrong way to go about things you
know unless your goal is to make things
worse like it's not like it has a
limited number of things has nothing to
object to he's got plenty to object to
his situation actually is bad he's
overshadowed terribly by his brother who
everyone loves who does extraordinarily
well and who's good at everything and
the story is a bit of nivel inton for
Keynes failure although a fair bit of
its laid at his own feet
but he's definitely failing and so you
can understand why he would have this
terrible attitude
but the problem is all it does is make
it worse so it doesn't seem to be one of
the things I've also learned as a
psychologist sort of pondering these
sorts of things it's often a lot easier
to identify what you shouldn't do than
what you should do like it's I think
evil is easier to identify than good I
think good is trickier but evil stands
out to some degree and then at least you
can say if you're trying to get as far
away from that as possible we could even
say just for practical reasons so your
life doesn't become hell and your family
life doesn't become hell at least you
could get as far away from that as
possible even if you weren't able to
conjure up what would constitute the
good as a name you could at least avoid
those sorts of pitfalls and I do also
think that its pitfalls like that that
really threaten our society right now
you know that I see a tremendous rise in
resentment fueling almost all of the
political polarization that's taking
place and seems unfortunate given that
by and by large everyone on the planet
is richer than they've ever been
now that doesn't mean there's no
disparity there's but there's always
disparity anyways Jacob of course Jacob
on
see so and so the and Jacob ends up with
with with Isaac's blessing and so that's
that's a moral catastrophe and then he
has to run because his brother wants to
kill him
and so that's the fratricidal motif
again I like that too I think that's
real really realistic you know one of
the things that Freud noted constantly
and this is where Freud really is a
genius is that the most intense hatreds
and also sometimes the most intense love
is within families you know and in the
Freudian world of psychopathology it's
all it's all inside the family and in
fact the pathology in the Freudian world
is actually the fact that it's all
inside the family because people who get
tangled up in the Freudian familial
nightmare which is roughly eatable in
structure can only conceptualize the
world in terms of their familial
relationships they've been so damaged by
the enmeshment and the trauma and the
deceit and the betrayal and the blurred
lines and all of that that they just
can't expand past the family and go out
in the world so the idea that brothers
can be at each other's throats I think
is that's a very powerful idea and it's
not something that people like to think
about so so Jacob has to leave and it's
not surprising because I mean what he
did was pretty reprehensible he betrayed
his brother but nonetheless he's the
person who dreams of the ladder that
unites heaven and earth and that's a
very perverse thing you know what but
one of the things I think it does is
give in some sense it gives hope to
everyone because it isn't you know if
only the good guys win we're really in
trouble right because it's not that easy
to be a good guy it's it's it's really
not that easy and most people are pretty
keenly aware of all the ways that they
fall short even of their own ideals and
so if there was no hope except for the
good guys almost all of us would be lost
and so that's one of the things I really
liked and was more surprised about with
the Old Testament stories is that these
people are a very complex
and they make very major moral errors by
anyone's standard and yet if and yet the
overall message is still hopeful and the
the message that runs contrary to the
message of evil say that message of good
is something like well there's a lot of
emphasis on faith right and the that's a
tough one because cynics people who are
cynical about religious structures like
to think of faith as the willingness to
demolish your intellect in the service
of superstition and well there's there's
something to be said for that
perspective but not a lot because the
reality is much more sophisticated part
of the faith that's that that is being
insisted upon in the old testament is
something like and I'm speaking
psychologically here again that it's
useful to pause it a high high good and
to aim at it so and I really think
that's practically useful to the
research we've done with the Future
authoring program for example indicates
pretty clearly that if you get people to
conceptualize an ideal and a balanced
ideal you know so what do you want for
your family what do you want for your
career what do you want for your
education what do you want for your
character development how are you going
to use your time outside of work how are
you going to structure your use of drugs
and alcohol in places where you might
get impulsive how can you avoid falling
into a horrible pit if you really think
that through and you come up with an
integrated ideal and you you put it
above you as something to reach for
then you're more committed to the world
in a positive way and you're less
tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and
so and that makes sense right because
here you are alive and everything and so
unless you were capable if you're not
capable of manifesting some positive
relationship with the fact of your being
then how could that be anything other
than hellish because you it would just
be anxiety provoking and terrible
because you're vulnerable and there'd be
nothing useful or worthwhile to do well
that's just not I just can't see that as
a winning strategy for anyone you can
make a rational case for adopting that
strategy in that you know you can say
well there's no evidence for for a
transcendent morality or for an ultimate
meaning there's no hard empirical
evidence but it seems to me that there's
existential evidence as well that has to
be taken into account
and of course psych psychologists have
talked about this a lot Carl Rogers for
example in Hume for that matter Freud
for that matter most of the great
psychologists have pointed out that you
know you can derive reasonable
information that's that's solid from
your own experience especially if you
also talk to other people and you can
kind of see in your own life when you're
on a productive path that sort of in
Nobles and enlightens you or a
destructive path and I think it's kind
of useful to think that maybe the
dichotomy between those two paths might
be real you know and and because that
also allows you to give credence to your
intuitions about that sort of thing but
I don't anyways I don't think it's
unreasonable to posit that since you're
alive adopting the highest possible
regard for the fact that you're alive
and that you're surrounded by other
creatures that are alive I just can't
see how that can possibly be construed
as a losing strategy and so that's the
first thing so that's something like
faith right it's faith it's not it's not
only faith in your being but it's faith
in being as such and the faith would be
something like if you could orient your
being properly then maybe that would
orient you with being as such and you
never know like I mean it might be true
there's no reason to assume that it
wouldn't be true I mean even if you just
take a strict biological perspective on
this and think about us as the product
of three and a half billion years of
evolution I mean we have struggled over
all those billions of years to be alive
and to match ourselves with reality and
so because one of the things I've often
wondered is you know life is definitely
difficult there's no doubt about that
and that's unfair and there's inequality
and all of those things and people are
subject to all sorts of terrible things
but I also wonder if you weren't
actively striving to make things
worse just how much better could they be
you know because people are very they
like houses that are divided amongst
themselves they're pointing in six
different directions at the same time
they're working at cross-purposes to
themselves because of bitterness or
began and resentment and on what
unprocessed memories and childhood
hatreds and unexamined assumptions all
sorts of things and you you just gotta
wonder if you could push that aside and
or int yourself properly and then the
other thing that of course is stressed
very heavily in the Old Testament and of
course that goes through the entire
biblical corpus is that it's not only
enough to establish a positive
relationship with being which I think is
the essential it's a good description of
faith you have to make that decision
right because being is very ambivalent
and you can make the case that maybe
it's something that should have never
happened
but that doesn't seem to be productive
to me and faith seems to be I'm going to
act as if being is ultimately
justifiable and that if I partake in it
properly I will improve it rather than
making it worse so I think that's the
statement of faith and then what seems
to go along with that is something like
truth in conception and action you know
even people like Jacob who are pretty
damn morally ambivalent to begin with
get hammered a lot by what they go
through and what seems to happen is that
they're hammered into some sort of
ethical shape right so by the mid point
of their life's journey there are people
who are solidly planted who you can
trust and who don't betray being or
themselves or their fellow man and so
it's an interesting I mean it seems
reasonable to me to first assume that
you have to establish a relationship
with something that's transcendent it
might even be just the future version of
you but and then second that you have to
align yourself with reality in a
truthful manner and that that's your
best bet
and
the biblical stories are actually quite
realistic about that too because they
don't really say that if you do that
you're going to be instantly transported
to the promised land
like even Moses as we'll find out in the
Exodus stories he never makes it to the
Promised Land and so it's not like
you're offered instantaneous final
Redemption if you move out forthrightly
into the world establish a faithful
relationship with being an attempt to
conduct yourself with integrity but it's
your best bet and it might be good
enough and even if it's not good enough
it's really preferable to the
alternative which seems to be something
closely akin to hell both personal and
social so Joseph's father is Jacob later
Israel he who wrestles with God and
we've talked about that a little bit
it's sort of implicit and what I've been
saying is that I think we all do that to
some degree we wrestle with reality
itself that's for sure not only the
reality we understand but the reality we
don't understand which is sort of a
transcendent reality and then maybe
whatever reality is outside of that you
know because the classic judeo-christian
conception of God is that there's time
and space and of course there's lots of
things about what exists in time and
space that we're completely ignorant of
and that's transcendent in that sense
but then there's an idea that there's a
realm outside of that which is a well
it's an interesting idea it's a very
sophisticated idea I think rather than a
simple idea it's it's difficult to know
what to make of it but it doesn't really
matter because I think regardless of
what your attitude is towards those
sorts of things intellectually you still
end up in the same position as Jacob for
all intents and purposes practically
speaking because I don't think that
there's anyone who at some point in
their life or perhaps even everyday
doesn't at some level wrestle with God
and you could just call it well the
nature of reality I suppose if you want
to be say reductionistic about it but I
don't think it makes any difference it's
still something you're stuck with and
it's not only the nature of reality
itself that you
have to struggle with but it's also the
nature of your moral relationship to it
your behavioral relationship to it so
that's how you should perceive it and
how you should conduct yourself and then
whether or not the the advantages of
doing it properly are worth the
difficulty and the disadvantages so that
seems to me just a straight existential
statement then you know Jacob gets
damaged by his wrestling which is also
very realistic so anyways he also ends
up his father of Joseph who's the
favorite son son who's born in his old
age to his favorite wife and that's who
we're gonna talk about to you today so
you remember so Jacob is the forefather
of the twelve tribes of Israel and
there's his his wives and this son and
the offspring that resulted those are
all the sons there's a daughter named
Dinah as well and rachel is the woman he
yeah and I'll get right into it I've I
work for svenska Dogbot which is the
newspaper one of the the second largest
with daily circulation swing and then I
ask sometimes on Twitter and Facebook if
they excited what kind of people do you
think I should interview and and your
name has come up a lot I think you've
heard this before so and then recently I
wrote piecing in collects all the
freedom in in Sweden and and you shared
it on twitter and facebook so then i
that's when i mail you because then i
thought that perhaps now I have a
perhaps now you will respond on I can
get me into you
yeah well quill apt has really turned
out to be quite quite the platform man
yes you know I mean it's it's I'm really
I did an interview with Claire layman I
interviewed her which I haven't released
yet but I but will in the next probably
two weeks something like that but she's
hitting it out of the park as far as
aren't far as I'm concerned it kind of
reminds me of what magazine like
Harper's used to be or at the Atlantic
before before mainstream journalism
collapsed virtually completely and
became so politicized so yeah well it's
been really impressive I would just ask
that it's something that like a mother
of two or one yeah raelia
and just being fed up with the political
correctness of her psychology department
I think it was and then she starts quill
it and now we're all like sharing in her
project from all over the world yeah
yeah it's amazing it's really amazing
and she well she has really good
editorial sense she must be really smart
that that girl yeah I would say so too
and but I'll try I don't know if you
remember I'll just begin by asking you
about the Sweden Sweden case I don't
know if you remember what the article
was about but I wrote about Eric green
Marv is a professor at
political science department and he was
forced to include Judith Butler but you
did Butler on his literally oh yeah
right Judith Butler yeah yeah great yeah
great
and the course is about modern society
and its and its critics so it's
basically about the reactionary forces
and left-wing extremist forces during
the turn of the last century so in the
early 20th century and late 19th century
and then new leaf Butler and actually
one of the course not Eric but his other
his teaching assistant interviewed at a
you get butter and she said that she is
agreed with the method so is she agreed
with the professors that she did she
thought that the academic freedom was
more important than being forced to
teach about feminist authors and gender
science so she was actually on the other
side gender science yeah exactly is by
no means a scientist or even a credible
academic as far as I'm concerned I think
she's a straight-out ideologue and and
the fact that anybody would be forced
well first of all force to include
anything on their curriculum I think is
absolutely reprehensible it's talk down
interference with academic freedom and
it's extraordinarily dangerous because
once that precedent is established then
you open the door for political
interference in the like like organized
political interference from outside the
Academy and it'll collapse very rapidly
under certain we saw that happening in
Germany and also in the Soviet Union
it's like that can happen so quickly
that people can't can't it's almost
impossible to believe now we're in this
weird situation where the same thing
seems to be happening to a large degree
within the Academy itself and so and
what to do about that is by no means
obvious but but I don't think that
allowing external control of any sort
over the contents of the courses that
Professor teach professors teaches it's
a very very bad idea
we they have a rule rule of thumb they
call it but it's basically it's much
more a rule than a rule of thumb but at
least 40% of all the literature has to
be written by women so if you're
unbelievable
if you're holding a course for example
about porn in society and it's create
critics with a lot of primary literature
from the turn of the century then you
run into a problem because women weren't
so they weren't a lot of women who were
respect them oh you know is so
unbelievably I would say resentful I
really think that's the fundamental
issue here to push a dr. resentful and
uninformed to push a doctrine like that
look it's unbelievably widespread so
I'll give you an example that's very
that's very similar our prime minister
Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that
half the cabinet that he put together
would be women he's right the fact that
only approximately I think it was 20 to
25 percent of the elected officials were
female and so what he basically admitted
as far as I'm concerned art
was two things number one he was
incapable of judging people on their
competence because when you put together
something like the cabinet for a country
what you do is you find the most
competent people period because it's so
bizarre that it even has to be said
because it actually turns out that the
cabinet is important and so to me all he
did was default on his set his central
moral obligation to screen every single
one of his members of parliament with
exceeding care and to pick the most
qualified people and his rationale was
that it was 2015 you know so and we to
reduce competence to racial ethnic
gender identity something like that is
absolutely appalling move
philosophically as well as far as I'm
concerned to assume that diversity is
somehow represented by group membership
there's no evidence for that there's
absolutely no scientific evidence for
that whatsoever in fact the scientific
evidence suggests quite the contrary
which is that there's more variability
with
in groups than there is between groups
which is actually an antidote to the
central racist claim right because the
central racist claim is there's more
difference between groups than there is
difference within them and so you know
you seen one black person you've seen
them all and well well this is we
actually have in Sweden it's cold
I think the translation is gender
mainstreaming in English but it's
basically you have to include gender
scientific perspectives into all this is
happening within all Swedish
universities right now so you have to
include the this perspective of gender
gender scientific gender scientific
perspective in all parts of the
university so it's not just literature
lists and courses it's also the who you
gonna recruit the number of and we have
a goal in Sweden from the government
this is all the government's doing and
we have a goal that I think it's 40% of
all the professor's by 2020 should be
women right which means that if you're a
young man who's entering academia the
probability that you're gonna get a job
is zero yeah right and that yeah the
same things happening here so for
example this there are minister of
science who was one of the people let's
say selected because of Trudeau's
insistence upon gender equity in his
cabinet you know he could have picked a
number of women that was proportionate
to the number of women elected like even
that I wouldn't have agreed with because
I think he should have gone on straight
competence and and taken on the heavy
moral burden of trying to figure out
what competence meant but just but no it
had to be 50/50 because I guess that was
you know this is a very snide thing to
say but that seems to be at the level of
arithmetic intelligence that he could
manifest no it's and and one of his
ministers our minister of science has we
have this program called count the
Canada
research chairs and the Canada Research
Chair zwarst up so that Canadian
universities would have an additional
amount of money to hire the most
qualified people they possibly could for
senior named chair positions and the
idea was to attract international talent
like high-level now what has happened
because it wasn't very well designed
this program was that Canadian
universities mostly ended up poaching
from each other which was you know
relatively counterproductive because it
just elevated the salaries of the
professors which maybe they deserved
rather than bringing in a lot of
international talent but men were
radically over-represented in Canada
research chairs now the minister of
science is very annoyed about this and
thinks that that's a consequence of
systemic you know misogyny or some some
bloody thing failing to note entirely
see if you look at scientific
productivity it's very interesting
because an gender the median professor
male and female publish approximately
the same amount so the typical but the
the exceptional professors are almost
all men even though the typical male and
female can't really be distinguished in
academia if you take that tiny subset of
hyper productive professors they're
almost all male now why that is is my
suspicions arts that is pretty
straightforward I suspect that the
reason it is is because to be a hyper
productive in any given field means you
have to be absolutely single-minded and
obsessed about it as well as being very
intelligent conscientious so it's rare
right you have to be intelligent say
99th percentile
conscientious 95th percentile so that's
hardly anybody right there and then you
have to have the time available to do
nothing whatsoever but concentrate on
your work no family no friends nothing
like that if you're gonna be at the very
top of your profession because obviously
you'll get out competed otherwise now
that's a lot harder for women because
well for obvious reasons I mean win so
so the mirror
fact that most of these people were see
the other thing people don't understand
is that people can on average be very
similar so their distributions but if
you go way out onto the edges of the
distribution small differences in the
middle can make massive differences at
the edge and so and that's the kind of
phenomena you see where you are
selecting the highest qualified people
it's a it's an edge of the distribution
phenomena so here's an example this is
really cool one so if you look at the
overlap between male and female
aggression it's pretty high so if you
randomly select a man and a woman from
the general population and you bet that
the woman was the more aggressive of the
two you'd be right 40 percent of the
time which is actually pretty often so
but if you go way the hell out to where
let's say you only imprisoned the one in
100 most aggressive people they're all
men yeah even though on average you know
it's 60/40 you go out to the 99th
percentile it's all men which is why
almost all the people in prison are men
now so people well it's it's yeah what
you're describing in Sweden that's the
death of the universities it's another
it's another sign of like the
universities are killing themselves
they're hiring adjunct professors and
not faculty members like I think it's up
to 70 percent in some American
universities they have no salary no
power no autonomy no job security
nothing it's it's it's you know some of
these adjuncts teach four or five
courses a year and make $25,000 so it's
read about one who lived in her car yeah
okay so they've jacked up tuition
honorary materials yeah exactly
well that there you go you know if the
little Marxist or you hahahaha
they've jacked up tuition to the point
where it's unsustainable
they made it impossible for kids who
rack up tuition debt to declare
bankruptcy because they've taken that
out of the bankruptcy laws now you can
take away their driver's license if they
don't pay their their their tuition
their student loan bills so it's
basically indentured serve
dude right the administration has become
completely top-heavy the Academy is
completely infested by these terrible
equity ideas that you're laying out
I mean it's and and the people who are
in the radical leftist disciplines which
increasingly are spreading their
influence out through the entire
universities our tenured and won't be
moved for 25 years so as far as I can
tell it's it's done and I would would
like to ask you or you take about on
gender science and all these like ethnic
studies and because I was a sociology
student back in 2004 and I was 22 years
old and so a lot of these perspectives
we were taught post-modernism and queer
queer feminism and all all these things
and and it was I mean I was just
starting out as a student so I but I
must have been wired faulty because he
didn't I was very critical about it but
but all those perspectives was was back
then was fringe in Sweetman so like like
identity politics
everything that's now in the mainstream
was at the institution back then and the
professor's they were they are the same
I mean and they are now it's their their
PhDs and master students that are taking
over the the public discourse so even
though they lost a lot of debates back
then and they still do like public
debates they're still teaching students
year after year of the year might ask
you about that and like oh and also
about your fatigue of gender the
understudies in Swedish it's called
gender science because we turn all this
into science oh yeah so it's not even
studies it's science here that was a
good move on on on the ideologues parts
that's free-weight this mode so it's a
two-pronged question but
yeah well I think well I listed about
seven things I think that are killing
the universities I actually think that
like I've watched major institutions
collapse and be privy to the manner in
which that occurs like what happens is
that as the enterprise pathologize is
the good people leave the people who
have other things that they could do
they leave first those are the most
productive and and talented people as
soon as the most productive leave then
the bloody thing just spirals downhill
because what what's gonna happen you
you've you know because the rule is is
that within a certain discipline
whatever it happens to be the square
root of the number of people in the
discipline produce half the productive
work so if a university has let's say a
thousand professors thirty of them
produce half the publications right
which is staggering right it's
staggering
that's the kirino distribution or prices
law and so and those people are often
have more opportunities than they know
what to do with and so as soon as
whatever they're doing becomes unstable
it's like they go off and do other
things and then then the institution
loses its most productive people and
that's it it's done it can't recover
from that and so and the introduction of
these so-called science disciplines that
we call studies disciplines you know it
was a market lowering of standards it
involved a market lowering of academic
standards a blurring of what actually
constitute a discipline refusal
whatsoever to consider anything
methodological rigorous cuz anything
goes including author what do they call
that off no Auto ethnography which is
where you just write a diary essentially
about your own experiences that's got
this fancy name so Auto ethnography as
part of gender science you know it's
positively Orwellian and
it's and the other thing that's
interesting about that is that what's
happened is that the people who have
these radical viewpoints have been given
a permanent signing here right there
they're their state and tuition
sponsored activists who can spend every
single moment of their time on what I
would consider their Fifth Column agenda
so we're basically funding a cohort of
people whose stated purpose is to
demolish the patriarchy you know one of
the things Carl Jung said which I really
liked and haven't talked about that much
is that the unconscious representation
of men in the female psyche he called
the animus and the animus was always in
his estimation because of the dream
analysis he did and so forth that
although the unconscious representation
of a woman in a man's psyche was an
individual woman the unconscious
representation of the male psyche in the
female unconscious was men as a group
and there's a very large number of women
and and also some men whose conception
of maleness is has been damaged very
badly by their failure to establish any
positive relationship with any male
whatsoever in their developmental
history and then they project this
paranoid representation of what
constitutes hierarchical masculinity on
to the world and then fight to bring it
down and it's and the thing is they're
being successful that's the problem is
this is this is this is another what
when I was actually I know that you were
very popular with a lot of young men but
I was actually introduced to you by a
mother of two so professor in education
so he's really she's not dinner at home
so to speak ideologically or but one
thing that that's worrying me is the I
mean there are certain certain reports
of idea certain ideologies that take
religious overtones and you know and I
think that the feminism has some of
those characteristics I mean in
Christianity we're all born sinful and
we need to come to grips with our
sinfulness and in the end only God's
grace and forgiveness can redeem us and
in Lutheranism at least it's we don't
can we can't be forgiven by priests it's
only god yeah yeah it's a doctrine
there's no escape
Rob and I totally sympathize it with it
even though I I don't in a little ways
but I realized but but within feminism
the sin is situated within males instead
so not only with within males but within
males as a collective you know which is
even see the thing about the Christian
doctrine that you referred to is that it
makes each individual responsible for
their own darkness now the Catholics say
look that's unbearable and people need
to have the slate wiped clean now and
then and confession will do that and
there's an intermediary and you
considered that merciful and there's
some real power in that argument you
know that the cynical argument is well
you can just wipe the slate clean at any
time and you don't have to bear any
responsibility but I think that's
cynical the Protestants put themselves
in a much tougher position because
there's no escape and but the upside of
all of that is is that the darkness is
to be regarded as within not without and
yeah and as soon as you move away from
that then while you're you're the good
person and so is everyone that thinks
like you and all the evil is wherever
you want to put it and and then as soon
as the thing that's really dangerous
about that especially if evil is
conceptualized as contemptible and and
parasitic and and using disgust related
language for example instead of fear
related language then the logical
directive is to purify it and boy that's
that's not good and this is something
that I think is happening if I've read
So I'm here tonight talking to Howard bloom
Who's a fascinating person and an an author of many books and a polymath of sorts and we've known each other by?
Electronic communication for quite a long time, it's it's something exceeding a decade
but we've never met either in person or electronically by video until now and
Howard is definitely well he's a singular sort of person and he has a very broad range of knowledge
As broad as anyone I've ever encountered
I would say and so what I'm going to do first is turn this over to him so that he can tell you a little
bit about himself and about what he's done and
Then we're gonna talk about his newest book which is called how I accidentally started the 60s and then well
We're gonna see where it goes from there, so Howard. Thanks for
Showing up here and let's let's see where we can go, so why don't you tell everybody about yourself?
Well, it's a pleasure to see you in person because I think it's about been about 14 years
maybe 15 years that we've known each other I
Put together a science of the soul initiative a long time ago, and and you were one of those kind enough to sign on
but I am the author of six books the first book is called the Lucifer principle a scientific expedition into the force of history and
Even though it's about 25 years old
People are buying it at because it feels like it was written yesterday
For tomorrow and people call it their Bible the second book is
global brain the evolution of masked mind from the Big Bang to the 21st century and
the office of the Secretary of Defense in the United States the reform based on one of the on that book and
brought in people from the State Department the Energy Department DARPA IBM and MIT
The third book is called the genius of the Beast a radical revision of capitalism
I preferred its original title which was reinventing capitalism porting soul the machine and that
Book the man who runs Dubai the Sheikh who runs Dubai
named a racehorse after one of that after that book the
His former minister of development who's on Dubai's ruling council and runs a thirty
Three billion dollar sovereign real estate company to built the tallest building in the world
went in front of the Arabian Business and Economic Forum and
told them there is a book that I particularly resonate with it's the genius of the Beast and
It contains the future of Dubai and he proceeded to read passages from that book and dr. APJ Kalam the eleventh President of India
Said that that book is a visionary creation
And this is despite the fact that the Sheikh who runs Dubai his former minister of development and dr. Abdul J
Column are all Muslims
And I'm a Zionist atheist Jew so if there's any sign of hope for peace in this world
That's it I've done lots and lots of other things just a few months ago. I
Founded and shared the Asian space technology summit with a large
groups of representatives from china the chinese academy of space technology and from
England space program, I've done the weirdest variety of things you've ever seen in your life
Oh, and I should not forget once upon a time. I found it. I knew nothing about popular culture
I founded the biggest PR firm in the music industry
I used my scientific tools since it's my background of science my life is science my bones and my flesh our science and
It became the most successful PR on that firm in the record industry
So I worked with Michael Jackson Prince Bob Marley about Midler ac/dc
Aerosmith kiss Queen Run DMC Billy Joel Paul Simon Peter Gabriel David Byrne Run DMC Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five
little things like that
Yeah, well it's a crazy biography
You'd think you'd have to think that someone was making that up if you didn't know it was true
And then you also accidentally started the 60s apparently yes, and it was just reading that book about a week ago
And thought what did you think of it? Oh? I thought it was very funny
It was it was it was I also thought
It was remarkable that you managed to have a foreword by or was it wasn't a foreword
I don't think it was caught it by Timothy Leary. Yes. Well. Let me tell you how that came about
There I was well. It was about 1981 and I
Started to go back to my science. Yes, I was running most successful PR firm the music industry
Yes, we were still on the ascent
Yes were establishing
Taking unknowns like prints and establishing them as major stars or joan jett who've been turned down by 23 record companies
And we made her double platinum in a year and a half
But I finally got a little time for you to go back to my science
And then I was taking a bunch of journalists out to Long Island to see REO
Speedwagon and a bunch of them said bloom all these ideas you keep talking about us
you need to write a book and one of them took me under his wing and
Actually mentored me Timothy white who wrote for The Associated Press and Rolling Stone
So I started working on a book in 1984 about
1988 I had gotten up and running and written the first chapters on a vacation and then I came down
Well for two things happen first. I really needed to get out of publicity in the music industry
I had satisfied all of my intellectual questions because there were SATA questions. I was answer answering
What are the mass exhilarations the mass ecstasy's the mass emotions that are the forces of history that power?
historical change
that's what I was after and you see that in miniature with the Beatles or with Michael Jackson or with Prince so I
Gotten as far as I could I mean you two would approach me to represent them. I wasn't interested
Mick Jagger had sent an emissary talk about representing him. I wasn't interested I'd been through all of this so
Let me ask you. Let me ask you a couple of questions there, so I mean the first question would be I think
How what is it that you had done that had prepared you for that and how and how did you manage it?
So I guess that's two questions, but also what did you?
What did you learn from all of that well these were these are very good questions to prepare me for this Martin Gardner
From the time I was 10 I was reading two books a day
My teachers hated me because I was reading a book under the desk at all times and never ever paid attention
to them and many of these were science books and I read the Scientific American from cover to cover and
Martin Gardner who was a mathematician
Had a column called mathematical games, and I learned what I know from mathematical games it taught me certain techniques
I was able to bring into the record industry, so so that's it's a hell of a stretch
I mean yeah, but singular story, so okay, so elaborate on that well what it taught is how to look for correlations?
and more than
mathematical techniques for finding correlations it gave you a gut feel of what a correlation looks like so that you
didn't have to
Go off to a world of mathematics of a cell or Kane that had no relationship to reality you could take the search for
Correlations into the real world I listen to music as obsessively from the time
I was about 10 years old my uncle and I used to stand next to a huge old
Burlwood radio that was as tall as I was at the time
And it had a giant speaker in Jordan in those days 12-inch speakers nobody to receive 12in speakers
but it had one, and we've listened to the classical music station in Canada because we were in Buffalo on the border and
we would compete to see who can identify a
Piece of music by its first four notes well often we could both identify the piece of music by its first note however
It was all classical music it was Rachmaninoff Barto Beethoven Stravinsky
Mozart stuff like that so I can't really say that I was properly prepared
Because I was hated by the other peak it's my age in Buffalo nior and my parents didn't have any time for me
So I was an outcast and the crowd of people that shut me out
Listen to popular music, so popular music. What started is with Elvis Presley
What was around before Elvis Presley and then moved on that was alien music to me?
and I wasn't the least bit interested in it and but in the
1970 will late 1960s and early 1970s
I
Knew I had fellowships at for grad schools in what is now called neuroscience at that point?
It was a do-it-yourself proposition
I was going to have to take courses in the med school at Columbia and put them together with courses in psychology
At Columbia and make my own neuroscience because there were no neuroscience courses
But I had four fellowships to do this, and I realized that grad school would be Auschwitz for the mine
Why because I was fascinated by these ecstatic mass
fashions that
give people that boost people out of themselves that lift them into something much bigger than themselves a
deep need that every human has to feel at some point a part of something much bigger than his or herself and
Those are the mass passions that create historical change
They are the forces of history, and I was not going to get to study mass fashions
I was not going to get to make contact with mass fashions if I went on to an academic career
I'd be spending the rest of my life
Giving paper and pencil tests to 22 college students in exchange for a psychology credit now exactly how much
Ecstatic experience are you going to see in a classroom of that sort with paper and pencil tests 0 the entire?
Phenomena I wanted to understand would not be there anywhere in my life
So I took advantage of the fact that I had basically been kidnapped in my junior year
By the poet in residence at NYU who had said he'd said look bloom when everybody rose out of the room
Close the door
I thought I need to talk to you well Jordan that means a bawling out right
So I waited till everybody left. I shut the door I sat down and you're about to be bawled out chair and
the poet in residence
Said to me look last year I asked you to be on the staff of literary magazine
You didn't even show up this year. You are the literary magazine
You don't even have a faculty advisor the minute you walk out that door
You're it now walk out that door and I walked out the door looking totally
Baffled because I hated literary magazines they were the most boring things you had ever seen you could have a group of
Vikings each of whom had drunk a quart of ale
Bunk parking up against the wall on bonking each other
And if you put a literary magazine in the room that pale blue cover and the mists chosen type would
Make you I'd to put everybody to sleep instantly or would drive them out of the room
So I looked very confused and a student walked up to me and said you look troubled about something can I help you?
Why don't I take you down for a cup of coffee?
I didn't know what a cup of coffee was I grown up with lab rats and and hamsters
not with human beings
but but I followed him obediently down the stairs and
When we sat down at the we shop, and I ordered water, and he ordered coffee
He said if you could do anything you want with this magazine. What would it be and I said a picture book so
That that'd be Jordan. I learned that question that question is a very valuable tool
So I turned it into experimental a graphics magazine
And it was a wild hit and it was a wild hit not just on campus where they doubled our budget for the second issue
It was a wild hit in the art directorial community
I think I think you covered that in in how I started accidentally started the 60s right I think yeah there
Yeah, you know so what that allowed me to do
is
When I and my wife was putting pressure on me
She had had a previous husband who was assuming she was tired of having student husbands
She made it clear in a kind of sotto voce way that if I went off to grad school at Columbia
I could kiss her goodbye not a nice idea after three years of marriage so with all these pressures on me I
threw my lot in with the artists that I'd assembled for this magazine we we formed an art studio and
the first year we are in $75 a piece which is
Which is just enough to get you food and possibly a little bit of shelter in New York City
But eventually I made another cover of Earth Direction magazine. I invented a new
animation technique for NBC TV and most important my studio did all of the graphics for
ABC 7 FM stations at a time when there was a revolution taking place in radio there was this brand new form of radio called
rock radio or album radio or progressive radio it was ditched which disc jockey said actually play what they wanted and
I was there because ABC 7 FM stations all converted to this new progressive format
And they used me and my art studio to get that across
to kids all over the YC, I see so yeah, you're responsible that was I got to thank you for that because I
Listen to album-oriented FM stations a lot when I was a kid and so and a lot
I mean lots of people did but I didn't know you were you had a hand in that so that was very good thing
Well, I thank you for the thanks. I had a hand in that and
ABC asked me to form an advertising agency to handle all of their advertising and
Jordan I didn't want to get involved in time buying that was just too dry for me
But because I was walking into a we did one other thing there was a new magazine
With a bunch of Harvard kids. It was a monthly version of the annual Harvard Lampoon
It was called the National Lampoon and my art studio art directed the first seven issues that that it was ABC
PG o Ruth got his start there. Yes exactly and I acted in a Michael. O'Donoghue script that we did for the Evergreen revue
Which was leading a bohemian publication of the time it's art director was all those people who had called me
After he saw the Washington Square review the student literary the graphics magazine that that I've been putting together
But the the promotion person at ABC was
Extremely kind to me and every time I walked in I'd hear Carole King or James Taylor who were the biggest people in
Rock music at the time on the speakers on the floor
and she would do things like I mean she was just
Clue me in she was bringing me into the rock and roll world one day for example
she said we're going to have a stew we're gonna have a live performance in Studio B by a pianist and
Why don't I give you two tickets? So I took her two tickets?
I went down to my art studio on 4th Street and 2nd Avenue in the East Village
And my my leading artist was just a brilliant brilliant
cartoonist and
I invited him to come to this event with me we went to the event
The pianist took through the stage my artists sat next to me and from the minute the pianist played his first chord
my artist was on his feet going Wow yippee Yahoo and
Totally embarrassing me I mean I wanted to crawl under the seat and become absolutely invisible
The the pianist on stage was Elton John what I failed to get was that my artist was
Giving Elton John the energy he needed to do the very kind of ecstatic
Performance that takes you out of yourself and makes you feel part of something bigger than yourself that I was trapped trying to track down
using things like William James the varieties of religious experience and
taking advantage of my my
Special vantage point so why do you think you know? You're you there's car
There's a kind of a contradictory narrative that runs through that story
Which is that?
You know when you were a kid you were sort of isolated you were booked as she were more scientifically oriented
but at the same time you obviously had a
What would you call it a feel for ecstatic experience and like was that was that a consequence of your?
Participation in the counterculture in the 60s or was that something that had emerged even before that
It was suddenly an emerge probably between the age of 10 and 12
It probably came from the fact that I was suffering serious social deprivation
I really I had one friend at a time and that's about as much as I had and I was I was an indispensable
Figure when it came time to beat somebody up because I was the target
Okay, so okay, so that's interesting too because that also I mean
It isn't obvious how you get from that position to being interested in ecstatic experiences per se so
What's the connection there with your rather like what would you call it isolated childhood experiences?
do you think I mean you said it had something hardly to do with music which makes a perfect perfect sense to me because
Music is almost
Uh, what would you say it's an unerring gateway into that ecstatic experience right and for for very complex reasons?
I'd like to talk to you about that a little bit, but
it
It isn't obvious why someone who was more scientifically oriented say would also
Make that leap over to the more mystical end of things and then of course pursue it through pop culture so you laid out
You know you're surprising involvement with literary magazine your transformation of that into what was essentially in a visual art
publication your entry into the world of radio and then into
Rock, I don't want to lose that thread because that also leads to your PR firm
And I presume we're getting to that
But right what what?
Deikun is there anything you can put your finger on you you associated there also with with?
like being physically bullied and being a social outcast
But why did that give you the hunger for that experience for that ecstatic experience well remember back to the days of the?
1960's and 1970's one sleep deprivation was a new discovery and then back in the 1990s and early
2000s Jaak panksepp took that a step further and in his studies of rat behavior
He discovered that if he deprived a bunch of child rats little rats, baby rats
If he deprived them of the ability to play yeah, and didn't give them access to each other as peers
until they'd they'd become adults they
suffered play deprivation
And they spent just as much time
Playing with each other as adults as they would have spent playing with each other had they been allowed to as
Children okay, so I want to make a quick glad remove there
And we'll get back to that you know I've been thinking about these these strange
modern manifestations of
Identity fantasy or that's what it looks to me like these people who are playing at
what do they call them other kids and playing with their identities in a really fantasy based way and
Sometimes I wonder if part of that isn't a consequence of play deprivation in childhood
Well, that sounds that sounds like a distinct possibility, but remember
Herrmann has said that there is somewhere deep dark in the mind
There's a closet with 10,000 hidden personalities one of the things that I discovered we're going to get out of chronological order
But one of the things that I discovered when I first became full-time
Involved with rock and roll was the story of Alice Cooper and the story of Alice Cooper
Reveals something about the question that you just raised okay
Alice Cooper
was a little bit like me when he was a kid his mom used to dress him up in a suit every day and he
Was a gawky thin with a huge nose
I was lucky thin with a huge nose
I can identify and ever wore suits though
And he was always a teacher's pet and the result was the other kids hated him
and he was kicked around and beaten and and
Excluded the way that I'd been kicked around and beaten and excluded then one day a neighbor was in his kitchen
Who was into a Ouija board and making contact with spirits through the Ouija board?
So a spirit allegedly contacted her and said I am the ghost of a witch
Who was burned at the stake in the 16th century and?
or 17th century and
You pointing to Alice I'm pointing to his name was rince Fournier at the time
Pointing to Vince you are my modern reincarnation and my name is Alice Cooper
Now when when Vince Fournier won on stage and a dress with mascara at a high school?
talent night for the very first time playing his own music chopping up baby dolls with an axe
Which is the more real?
Person Vince ferny a the shy little kid dressed up in a suit who gave apples to his teacher
Or Alice Cooper the person on stage who comes to life with an ecstatic
Identity that makes him a surfer on the back of those mask passions those masts
Exhilarations that make the forces of history well Alice of the two
They're both real people and they're both inside events Fournier
But the one that's in there that has the greatest passionate intensity is the Alice Cooper not the Vince Fournier
And that's why though he had been picked on and none of the kids in his school had liked him the minute
He finished his first performance all the football guys who used to beat the crap out of him
surged down to the foot of the stage and
Volunteered to be parts of his band and when he when he was super famous some of those guys were still
Mainstays of his bin we carry many selves well inside of us and my job in PR
Was to find people who deserve to be iconic and then to explain to them first of all I will not
if you think that I as your publicist I'm gonna fashion an artificial mask an image and
Through that make you a star, I'm gonna get you an appointment with my best competitor immediately you'll be with them in hours
If you're gonna work with me you have to understand something the music you make is about human soul
that comes from the very soul of you and what happens to you when you go out on stage and feel as if
Yourself leaves you and you are danced like a puppet. They're like a puppet on a spring like a marionette
onstage the force that moves you that's one of the gods inside of you that is your soul and what you're
Experiencing with that audio is a soul exchange if you're willing to put up with the fact that music is not about marketing music
It's not about product. Music is not about downloads
music is about the exchange of human soul then I will work with you and quite the statement for a
Zionist atheist Jew yes
it really is all it not matter that you know I
Listen tell us Cooper a lot when I was a kid and still now especially that
Record welcome to my nightmare which I think is an absolute classic
You know there's a couple of pop songs on it, which which I think?
I mean record companies did that a fair bit on on?
Concept albums you know they throw a pop hit on there, but right as a concept album
It's brilliant, and it's really well arranged and it's really
Like
Not horrifying exactly because that's not exactly right, but it's unbelievably dramatic I would say
theatrical in in the best way
and I really think it's a work of genius that welcome to my nightmare so
And I had no idea that that was Alice Cooper's background although. I did hear that
He was the child of a minister is that also correct oh, no no, no his father was in the aerospace industry in Arizona. Oh
big aerospace territory
Right, but a lot of the kids who were turned on to Alice Cooper and were turned on by other shocked bands like that were
the children of
Ministers the children of deeply religious people from another religious, right
Because he's bringing out the other side of things he like exactly the kind of things right well
He's there obviously the precursor of people like Marilyn Manson yes exactly
Marilyn Manson was a sort of cheap even though Marilyn Manson signed enough to be good to me Marilyn Manson was a kind of cheap
Take off on Alice Cooper didn't have the staying power that Alice seems to have had but the point is that I?
one of the things that I told you if you were gonna be my client as what you just don't you don't just owe your
Audience your songs you owe your audience your life now Jordan typically 20 years to articulate what I meant by that
And it's simply that if you deserve
super sir
then you doesn't you will become an iconic figure and
Twelve-year-old kids will paste posters of you up on their bedroom walls
And you will be you know the concept of the trellis you grow tomato plant on a trellis well
You will be the trellis on which people grow you will be the role model so your life is
One of the most important things that you have to offer
But I wasn't just after their superficial life. I was after I was after this when you sit down of an afternoon
Let's say two o'clock in the afternoon with a blank computer screen or a blank piece of paper
And you need to write a lyric you
Feel as if you could you don't know how you've ever written a lyric in your life
You certainly know you can't write another one again and by four o'clock in the afternoon on a good day
There's a lyric in front of you by 4 o'clock in the afternoon on a really really rare
Good day that lyric is so perfect in itself, but it feels like it wrote itself through you
When you go onstage if you see the dot the pupils of the audience dilating if you see their faces
melting losing individual characteristics if you see their energy
fusing into a collective energy rather than just individual energies, and if that collective force reaches a
Pseudo pod out to you and hooks into something inside of you
That's bigger than yourself and again
you feel like an empty pipe and something inside you is transmogrifying all of this energy and
Flooding it back down to the audience and a reverberatory circuit
And you have an out-of-body experience
you watch yourself from the ceiling as
you're danced that self inside of you that dances you on stage that is your fucking goddamn soul and that's
My and tend to find and that's what I intend to introduce you to why?
Because you are about to become an icon
and if you become an icon you have to be a force that takes hundreds of thousands or even tens of millions of
Kids who feel lost in the world who don't dare express their feelings because there are no
except socially acceptable words for their feelings and who feel crazy
Isolated and alone and you by revealing. What's deep inside of who will validate. What's deep inside of them
So I think you had the other made the other shoe drop for me
Then because you know you're talking about that at least in part. You're talking about that ecstatic experience as the as the
necessary
counter position to isolation and abandonment loneliness and all of those things
Which which I think is a very?
very reasonable way of thinking about it's like meaning as the antidote to isolation and why and trap and tragedy and
Malevolence for that matter, and I think music is you know I've thought deeply about music. I've tried to figure out
Why it has what it represents?
and why it has the effects that it has and I think and this is a
neuroscientific view of it to some degree and you know it seems to me that
It's better to think about the world as
Something that consists of patterns rather than as something that
Consists of objects so an object would actually be a pattern that sustains itself across time
It's that's not all that very very good insight. I you get applause for that. Thank you
Thank you
and so
Then you think well for you can even think about the way the visual system works this way so
You know we tend to think that there's a world out there
And then there's an image of that world projected onto a retina and then the images is
reconstructed say in our visual cortex, and then we
Then we we could become conscious of that image and plan our actions and in consequence of that, but that isn't how it works
The way it works is that there are patterns in the world and then the patterns are shifted into patterns of light of
Illumination and then those are shifted into patterns of neural activity on the retina
And then those are shifted into patterns of neural conductance along the optical nerves and then patterns in the visual cortex
and then those are expressed as patterns of movement so it's all the
transformations of patterns and the meaning of a visual perception is the
Pattern of action that it gives rise to which is why you need a body meant to be able to perceive
And I think the reason that music speaks so deeply to us of fundamental meaning is because it's actually the most
Representative art form you know because people think about it in some sense is the least representative art form
I don't think that's right at all
I think it represents the reality that exists in a profound since beyond
What our senses revealed to us moment to moment and so it puts people?
Then when you're moving to the music and we're all moving to the music or when you're dancing
Let's say with someone else and you're and you're as pairs, and you're all dancing together
It's that the patterns of the cosmos so to speak
Manifesting themselves as the patterns of the music manifesting themselves as the patterns of your body and in
syncopation with everyone else it's also a symbolic representation of a
Harmonious and ideal Society and there it is something that's beyond us
and so it's it's interest so I get it so so partly what you're saying if I understand you is that for you the the
ecstatic collective experience that was associated with music for example in pop music perhaps was
You could see it out very clearly as the antidote to painful isolation, and I mean one of the things that struck me as
Struck me as near miraculous about music especially in a rather nihilistic and atheistic society is that it really does
Fill the void that was left by the death of God and it's partly because you cannot rationally critique music
You know it speaks to you it speaks of meaning and no matter what you say about it. No matter
How cynical you are you cannot?
Put a crowbar underneath that and lift it up and and and toss it aside
and it's like music was so such a powerful cultural force in the 60s and the 70s and the
Overwhelmingly powerful force so the other the other element is very important to this is music is the voice of a subculture?
So when you tell a hundred million kids who felt utterly isolated and alone that they that their
Experiences had not been reflected in the experience of any other person on earth that in fact. They are not alone layer a movement
you give a subculture a voice and you can see that with well when I
Finally got into working with music one of the first things. I did was work with country and western music now Jordan
I worked with a company called dot records
I was hired by Gulf and Western to found a public on artist relations department for their 14 record companies
And one of those companies was dot records and dot records was number three on the country charts
And that it was with third place company, and it wanted to be number one
In country and western music now when I was a child when I was about three and a half years old
I
Woke up on a Sunday before anybody else in the house had woken up
went out to the front room where there was sunlight which I didn't get to see as often as I'd like and
Turned on the radio and because it was six o'clock in the morning or something like that
But I got were farm reports and Country and Western music this was in nineteen
nineteen forty six or something like that or nineteen forty seven and
I immediately knew that that music was alien to me
And I knew that it was the music of another subculture would not necessarily be kind to the subculture from which I came
So I never liked country music
But in the 1970s when I got this position with Gulf and Western
One of the things I crusaded for the hardest was country and western music
Because I felt that these people had a right to express their identity
I felt they had a right to get beyond the ghetto of the Bible Belt
Which is where they were kept and where they were suppressed. It was an era of
Subcultures finding themselves and expressing their right to exist
It's sort of music really does seem to have that binding capacity you know and I think there's also something
Neurological about that because I think you tell me what you think about this if this is in accordance with your observations
But it seems to me that
The music that people listen to as they're catalyzing their adult identity say between the ages of about
Fourteen fifteen to twenty you know there's a there's a there's a real intense
Period of neural pruning that occurs at the end of adolescence so you get then this amount of neural pruning after
After you're born in the early stages of infancy because you have a lot of neural connections
And then a lot of them you kind of die into your childhood self, right
You're you're born with twice as many neurons as you will actually need right right exactly and so
You're you're a massive possibility, and then you die into your actualities and then that happens again
It laid out lessons right which is also in schizophrenia develops because that process seems to go wrong for some people
but
As you're dying into that adult identity one of the things that seems to catalyze that is
The music of your culture at that time and that also seems to unite you in some way underneath
rational thought with the people of your generation
Let's say with the people you'd have to cooperate with and compete with and so there's something really deep about that, too
That's not well understood and and and
So alright well
So I I don't know what you think about the second element of that because it's a brilliant
Observation and the second element of that is that me in your late teens your prefrontal cortex gets wired up now. What's the prefrontal cortex?
It's probably we talk about it as the the center of Administration in the brain executive functions
Its primary job is making you human
What does that mean you would think that means encouraging certain things like creativity and thought no the job of the prefrontal cortex
and making you human is to
repress things
It's too damp things down
It's to inhibit things and you are learning which things to inhibit after you become utterly
Grafted into your subculture
And what is one of the elements that has drafted you into your subculture music and so what Freud would call the super-ego
Is formed to a certain extent based on your sub cultural connections that you've developed as a team and again
Music helps identify that sub culture of which you feel apart all right well, okay, so so partly what's happening there
Is that because music is poetic and also it's poetic and emotional, let's say it also
constitutes the
Pre rational substrate from which the values of that subculture emerge, so it's like the it's part of the mythological
substructure of the values of that culture and you can make absolute yeah, yeah
You can see that expressed in the lyrics right right and where which layout a system of values in some sense, right?
Something like hip hop for example well roughly 95 percent of the lyrics in pop culture are about mating they're about mating
rituals they're about courtship rituals and
You as a person who's wait the meeting has been upgraded by the best and now includes, okay?
God knows what it was trying to tell us so at any rate
You have just emerged from childhood
Your hormones your sexual hormones have begun to act girls as young as 11 can become pregnant already
and you were obsessed with finding your place in the world and finding a mate and
Courtship rituals mean an awful lot to you
They're about to what they're there what you are about to embark on for the next ten years of your life at least
and so this obsession with courtship rituals with mating and dating and breaking up and
And betrayal and all of that kind of stuff makes makes absolute sense
Right exactly well the thing is music frames that too because it gives you something that's in common with your
Potential mate, and it also gives you a set of rather
I wouldn't say stereotyped activities
But at least predictable activities that are associated with courtship and mating and so that would be
going to concerts and going to movies which are heavily musically influenced and dancing and and even discussing your
Your shared immerse Minh tin whatever that subculture happens to be right and my guess is that at some point?
Music provokes oxytocin because oxytocin is the ultimate bonding hormone and music is a bath in
The sense of human belonging in the field, but even if you're alone and you're listening to Pandora
Awesome or Spotify all by yourself. It feeds you social bread and meat and
in the in the
nervous system the central nervous system
everything boils down to
inhibition or excitation
there is a hormone of
excitation and it's glutamate
there is a hormone of inhibition and that's gaba and
Oxytocin feeds down into the gaba system the system that keeps you calm down
Basically it gives you a sense of peace
Now music itself. I mean the first musical first
I have to give you an experience that I had that allowed me to see into all of this. I had already been
Fascinated by the gods inside of us
I concluded at the age of 12 that I was an atheist and if there were no gods in the heaven above us and no
Gods in the ground beneath us where were the gods while my parents were trying to drive drag me an atheist off to high holiday
Services and they were so intent about it that I was literally holding onto the doorframe of their blue Frasor by now
Forgotten car and and they were shredding my socks. They were very regularly tearing my shoes off
they were doing everything they could to get me up to the temple and
So I realized in that moment if the gods are not above if the gods are not below
Where are they they're inside my parents if they're inside my parents they're inside of me
They're inside of all of us so my task at
Basically the age of 12 to 13
Became use your scientific tools to find the gods inside of us, okay, okay?
Well you also again you
Elaborated on that part of the story that also made you attune to those ecstatic
Experiences because the case that you've just laid out and I suppose we laid out together to some degree is that?
Perhaps it was that the fact that you were isolated as a kid made you even more sensitive to the collective belonging
Element of music because you were so starved for it and right
and then the idea of the gods within that you just laid out seems to me to be very much akin to
What you described as either your tactic or your philosophy with regards to PR for the rock?
Personalities because what you said you were doing was trying to make them reveal some of these
archetypal figures within and
that that would and that you were actually trying to foster that which meant in some sense you were doing PR and all like I
Don't know what the hell. You'd call it. I call it secular shamanism. There was a name
I was never comfortable with because it's so unscientific but
That was the closest I can come to it
It's like dowsing for the human soul what I would have been a good name for a PR company a second
Yeah, yeah, but I think that's a very well. I think that's a very useful way of thinking about it because obviously
one of the
Holdovers from the shamanic traditions is obviously music
[Music]
[Music]
all right so the last time I was here
many of you were as well we got halfway
through the story of Jacob and I've been
digging underneath the story
sporadically since then to try to find
out whether other themes are being
developed and I've got some things that
I think are really interesting to talk
about so so we'll get right into it so
I'm gonna review a little bit first so
we were talking about Jacob and I'll
read eight his biography a little bit so
that we can place ourselves in the
proper context before we go on so his
mother Rebecca gave birth to twins and
the twins even in her womb were
struggling for although they were
struggling and of course the story is
that they were struggling for dominance
the older are the younger against the
older really because Jacob Jacob means
usurper and Rebecca had a what would you
call a vision from God that said that
Jacob would supplant Esau and so even
before her twins were born they were in
a state of competition and that's a
recapitulation of the motif of the
hostile brothers right it's a very very
very common mythological motif and we we
already saw that really well developed
in the story of Cain and Abel right and
Cain and Abel were essentially the first
two human beings the first two natural
born human beings and they were
instantly locked in a state of enmity
which is symbolic of first the enmity
that exists within people's psyche
between the part of them you might say
that's aiming at the light and the part
of them that's aiming at the darkness
and I think that's a reasonable way of
portraying it obviously it's a way that
sort of rife with symbolism but my
experience of people especially when you
get to know them seriously or when
they're dealing with serious issues is
that there is quite clearly a part of
them that's striving to do well in the
world or even to do good and another
part that's deeply sinned
and embittered that that says to hell
with it and is self-destructive and
lashes out and really aims at making
things worse and so that seems to be a
natural part of the human psyche and
that's also reflected in the the idea of
the fall and so those ideas are not
easily cast away they're associated with
the rise of self-consciousness right and
in the story of the Garden of Eden and I
think that's right because I do think
that our self-consciousness produces
that division within us because more
than any other creature were intensely
aware of our finitude and suffering and
that tends to turn us at least to some
degree against being itself you know I
was watching a bunch of protesters in
the US last week scream out the sky
about Trump you know and it was
interesting like I thought it was an
extraordinarily narcissistic display but
but despite that there was something
symbolically appropriate about it
I also there's a movie I really like
sadly enough called fubar I don't know
how many of you have seen that yeah you
know that movie I take it yeah it's
about the people I grew up with so yeah
that's true man I'm telling you that's
true so the the guy the main actor in
fubar who's quite bright but completely
uncivilized gets testicular cancer and
there's one great scene where he gets
far too drunk and he's stumbling around
the street you know in in a virtually
comatose state and of course he's not
very thrilled with what's happened to
him and he's shaking his fist at the sky
it's pouring rain and he's cursing God
and you know it's like well you can kind
of understand his position so that kind
of reminded me of these people who were
yelling at this guy you know they were
basically they were out dramatizing the
idea of in rape they were enraged at
well you could say god of course most of
them wouldn't say that but but they were
the ones yelling at the damn sky I mean
you know so you got a he got a look at
what they're doing rather than what they
say
and they were outraged that being was
constructed such that Trump could have
arisen as president and so well so this
idea you know that we can be easily
turned against being and work for its
destruction is a really it's a really
common common common theme it never goes
away you see it echoed in stories like
with the new Marvel series for example
you see the enmity between Thor and Loki
that's a good example of the same thing
or between Batman and the Joker there's
there's a Superman and Lex Luthor these
there's these pairs of hero against
villain that's a really dramatic and
easily what everyone can understand that
dynamic right it's a basic plot and the
reason it's a basic plot is because it's
true of the battle within our spirits
our own individual spirits it's true
within families because sibling rivalry
can be unbelievably brutal it's true
between human beings who are strangers
it's true between groups of people like
it's true at every level of analysis and
then in some sense it's it's archetypal
true at least with regards to deep
religious symbolism because you see that
echoed in many stories as well so I
think the clearest representation is
probably Christ and Satan that's the
closest to a pure archetype although
there's in the old Egyptian stories
there's Osiris and Seth or Horus and
Seth and Seth is a precursor to Satan
etymologically so it's a very very
common motif and so that's what happens
again in Rebecca's womb is that this
thing this idea is played out right away
and the two two twins are actually what
would you call it there they have a
superordinate destiny because one of
them is destined to become the father of
Israel and of course that's a pinnacle
moment in the Old Testament obviously
and arguably a pinnacle moment in human
history now you know degree to which the
stories in the Old Testament actually
constitute what we would consider
empirical history as a matter of debate
but it doesn't matter in some sense
because as I mentioned I think before in
this lecture series know there are there
are forms of fiction that are met a true
which means that they're not necessarily
about a specific individual although I
generally think they are based on the
life of specific individuals it's the
simplest theory but who knows right but
they're they're more real than reality
itself because they abstract out the
most relevant elements of reality and
present them to you and that's why you
watch fiction you know you don't you
want you want your fiction boiled down
right you want to boil down to the
essence that's what makes good fiction
and that essence is something that's
truer than then plain old truth if it's
handled well and so you know if you
watch a Shakespeare play half a lifetime
of events can go by in a Shakespeare
play and it covers you know a wide range
of scenes and so on and and so it's it's
cut and edited and compressed all at
once but because of that it blasts you
with with a kind of emotional and
ethical force that just the mere
videotaping of someone's daily life it
wouldn't even wouldn't even come close
to approximating so then this motif of
the hostile brothers that's a that's a
deep deep archetypal truth and raychel
two nations are in thy womb and two
manner of people shall be separated from
thy bowels and one people shall be
stronger than the other and the elder
shall serve the younger and so there's a
inversion there right because as we've
discussed historically speaking and
traditionally speaking it's the elder
son that to whom the disproportionate
blessings flow there's some truth in
that too even more
what would you say more empirically iq
tends to decrease as the number of
children in the family increase the
younger the old
is the smartest generally speaking it
isn't clear why that is but it might be
that they get more attention and who
knows so those of you who are younger
can be very unhappy about that fact now
Jacob
okay so there's another there's another
plotline here too because Abraham and
and Rebecca are at odds at sorry Isaac
and Rebecca are at odds about the
children right so there's a there's an
eatable twist to it too because well
Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out
to be the hunter type so he's your basic
rough-and-tumble character you know and
he's kind of a wild looking guy he'll
Harry and he likes to be outside he
lives in tents he likes to hunt he's a
man's man that's one way of thinking
about it
whereas Jacob dwells in tents you know
he doesn't go outside much he's more
well maybe he's more introverted but
he's certainly this sort of kid
adolescent say who hangs around home and
it there's some intimation that he's his
mud well he's clearly his mother's
favorite and with all the advantages and
I suppose disadvantage does go along
with that and Isaac and Rebecca don't
see eye-to-eye about who should have
predominance among the sons and Rebecca
is quite complicit with Jacob in
inverting the social order so the first
thing that happens that's crooked is
that Esau comes in from hunting and he's
you know maybe he's been out for a
number of days and he's ravenous and
he's kind of an impulsive guy doesn't
really seem to think about the long term
very much and Jacob was cooking some
lentil stew and Esau I want some of it
and Jacob refuses and and then says that
he'll trade his his birthright for it
and Esau agrees which is a bad deal
right it's a bad deal and so you you
could say that Esau actually deserves
what's coming to him
although
at minimum you'd have to think of them
both as being equally culpable it's a
nasty trick
and so that's Jacob's first trick and
then the second trick is that it's later
and Isaac is old and blind and you know
close to death and it's time for him to
bestow a blessing on his sons which is a
very important event apparently among
these ancient people and Esau again is
out hunting and Rachel dress dress is
Jacob up in a hairy it puts a goat skin
on his arm so he's kind of hairy like
Esau and dresses him and Esau is closed
so he smells like he's so and Isaac
tells Esau to go out and hunt him up
some some venison I think it is and
which is a favorite of his and Rebekah
has Jacob cook up a couple of goat kids
and serve that to Isaac and play the
role of Esau and so he does that it's
pretty net damn nasty really all things
considered you know to play a trick like
that both on your brother and on your
blind father and the inclusion with your
mother it's not the sort of thing that's
really designed to promote a lot of
familial harmony and so especially
because you've already screwed him over
in a big way once you know you'd think
you'd think that would be sufficient so
anyways he's successful and Esau loses
his father's blessing and so that Jacob
ends up really in the position of the
firstborn and it's quite interesting
because you know God tells Rachel that
Jacob is going to be the dominant twin
and you'd think again with God's
blessing or at least the prophecy that
Jacob would end up being a good guy but
he's certainly not presented that way to
begin with which is also quite
interesting given that he's the eventual
founder of Israel and it's another
indication of the realism of these old
stories you know and it's it's quite
amazing to me it's always been quite
amazing to me how unpretty fight these
stories have remained you know because
you'd think that if you're even the
least bit sinned
especially if you had the kind of
Marxist religion is the opiate of the
masses kind of viewpoint which which is
a credible viewpoint you know although
it's wrong but it's correct well I I
think it's a shallow I think it's a
shallow interpretation and not part of
the reason I think it's a shallow
interpretation is because the stories
would be a lot prettier if that was the
case these characters wouldn't have this
strange realistic moral ambiguity about
them you know if you're gonna feed
people a fantasy then it you want it to
be like a Harlequin novel or or our
greeting card or something like that you
don't want it to be a story that's full
of betrayal and deceit and murder and
mayhem and genocide and all of that if
that just doesn't seem all that
what would you say calming I guess would
be the right right answer
so anyways Jacob gets away with this but
Esau is not happy and and Jacob is quite
convinced that he might kill him and I
think that was a reasonable fear because
he saw was a tough guy and he was used
to being outside and he knew how to hunt
and he knew how to kill and he actually
wasn't very happy about getting
seriously screwed over by his you know
stay-at-home younger brother twice and
so Jacob runs off and goes to visit his
uncle and on the way and this is a very
interesting part of this story he stops
and to sleep and he takes a stone for a
pillow and then he has this vision it's
called a dream but the context makes it
look like a vision of a ladder reaching
up to heaven and with angels moving up
and down the the ladder let's say and
there's some representations of that I
showed you some of them the last time we
met but I'll read it to you first he
lighted upon a certain place and Ty read
there all night because the Sun was set
and he took of the stones of that place
and put them for his pillows and lay
down in that place to sleep and he
dreamed and beheld a ladder set up on
the earth and the top of it reached to
heaven and behold the angels of God
ascending and descending on it and
behold the Lord stood above it and said
I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father
and the god of Isaac
land whereon thou liest to thee I will
give it and to thy seed and thy seed
shall be as the dust of the earth and
thou shalt spread abroad to the west and
to the east and to the north and the
south so that lays out the canonical
directions right so now there's a center
with the canonical directions like the
thing that you see you know that little
symbol you see on maps it's the same
thing that symbolically placed upon the
earth so a center has been established
with radiating well with with what with
with directional lines radiating from it
so it establishes as a place and in the
end I seed shall all the families of the
earth be blessed so that's pretty good
news for Jacob and it's not self-evident
why God is rewarding him for running
away after screwing over his brother but
that seems to be what happens and so
here's a couple of representations
classic representations the one on the
right is William Blake is what I
particularly like you know and Blake
assimilates God with the Sun and with
light right so that's quite a common
mythological idea that that God is
associated with light and the day behold
I am with thee and will keep thee in all
places whither thou goest and will bring
me again into this land for I will not
leave thee until I have done that which
I have spoken to thee of and Jacob
awaked out of his sleep and he said
surely the Lord is in this place and I
knew it not and he was afraid which is
exactly the right response and said how
dreadful is this place it is none other
than the house of God and this is the
gate of heaven and Jacob rose up early
in the morning and took the stone that
he had put for his pillows and set it up
for a pillar and poured oil on the top
of it and that's that's a more important
thing than you think and we'll go into
that a little bit more deeply because up
to this point in this story there isn't
anything really
there isn't anything that's really
emerged to mark a sacred space right
there's no there's no cathedral there's
no Church there's nothing like that but
here's this idea that emerges that you
can mark the center of something that
and that's important and you mark it
with a stone
and stones a good way to mark things
that that are important because the
stone is permanent right and we mark
things with stones now like we mark
graves with stones for example because
we want to make a memory and to carve
something into stone to carve a stone
and then to carve something into stone
is to make a memory and to use stone is
to make a memory because stone is
permanent and to set it up right is to
to indicate a center and so that's what
happens and pours oil on the top of it
which is kind of offering and he called
the name of that place Bethel but the
name of the city was called Las at the
first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if
God will be with me and will keep me in
this way that I go and will give me
bread to eat and raiment to put on then
a tenth of what I earned I will give him
I missed that that's interesting too
because now there's a transformation of
sacrifice right because until that point
sacrifices have had been pretty
concretize dit was the burning of
something
whereas here all of a sudden it's the
offering of of productive labor per se
like a tithe because it tithe is a form
of sacrifice and so there's an
abstraction of the idea of sacrifice no
sacrifice it's really important that the
idea of sacrifice gets abstracted right
because it should be abstracted to the
point where it's it's used the way that
we use it today which is you know we
make sacrifices to get ahead and
everyone understands what that means but
the sacrifices are generally some
combination of psychological and and and
practical so we're not acting them out
we're precisely we're not dramatizing
them at ritualizing and we actually act
them out in our in the covenant that we
make with the future and we do that well
unless we're extraordinarily impulsive
and aimless in our lives and have really
no conception whatsoever of the future
and are likely to sacrifice the future
for the present which is it what he saw
does right then we make sacrifices and
you got to think like the idea of making
sacrifices to make the future better is
an extraordinarily difficult lesson to
learn
it took people god only knows how long
to learn that you know like we have no
idea it's not something that animals do
easily chimpanzees don't store leftover
meat you know they just and neither do
wolves they just a wolf can eat about
thirty pounds of meat in one sitting and
that's that's where the idea of wolfing
it down comes from they're not hiding it
saving it for later you know they can't
do that so they can't sacrifice the
present for the future so this is a big
deal that this that this happens now I
want to tell you a little bit about the
idea of the pillar because it's it's an
unbelievably deep idea and it Orient's
us in ways that we still don't it's
still orienting us in ways that we don't
understand and in fact it's actually the
mechanism by which we're oriented or and
if it's lacking then we become
disoriented and so I'll show you some
pictures and describe them first okay so
first of all there's a walled city so
let me tell you that you could think
about that as an archetypal human
habitation maybe it's a reflection of
something like a fire in the middle of
the plain or the forest or the jungle
hello everyone hello everyone where we
go
good to see all of you so first question
well I guess I could catch you up on
what's been happening first in case
you're vaguely interested most of you
probably know or some of you know
anyways about what happened at Wilfrid
Laurier University this week or two
weeks ago teaching assistant named
Lindsey Shepherd was interrogated I
would say by the typical suspects the
kind of postmodern neo-marxist that I've
been talking about hauled her into an
inquisition and proceeded to rake her
over the coals for having the gall to
show a video that featured me about a
year ago on a Canadian TV show called
the agenda they accused her of violating
the criminal code essentially and the
Canadian Human Rights Code under the
provisions of Bill c16 which was the
bill I warned about last year and
accused her of transphobia and making an
unsafe environment and then they accused
me of being Hitler which was really
quite interesting because I've never
been accused about being Hitler so I
modified my my Kermit puppet here which
see you can probably see that I guess
and I've done a response video which I'm
going to launch pretty soon so this is
Hitler the Frog and the spokes frog by
the way and he well this is what we've
come to so all right let's answer some
questions I'm going to start with pigeon
hole which is the site that allows
people to vote on questions and so the
top flouted question is how do you I did
you testify a rejection of identitarian
ism when a pillar of the neo-marxist
strategy is to demographically replace
the indigenous people of Europe London
it's less than half ethnically English
okay so let's take that question apart
first of all it isn't self-evident to me
that it is specifically a neo-marxist
strategy to demographically replace the
indigenous peoples of Europe and I don't
think that's the strategy anyways even
if that's the outcome because you have
to distinguish between strategy and
outcome the strategy and principle is to
bring in immigrants to balance out
declining birthrate now I'm not saying I
agree with that I'm just saying that
that's what the strategy is and then the
next part of the question is predicated
on the assumption that identitarian ISM
is necessarily the answer to the problem
of the problem that's being identified
which is characterized as excess
immigration first of all we'd have to
figure out exactly what identitarian is
a means because it isn't clear if it
means radical right-wing ethnic
nationalism I don't think that that's
going to be particularly constructive if
it means having a sensible discussion
about what the appropriate limits might
be on immigration and to think about
that over the long run and also to have
a serious discussion about the degree to
which say Islam and and the West the
values of Islam and the West are
actually commensurate then that has to
be obviously has to be done but so I'm
afraid that to answer that question I'd
have to know more about exactly how
these terms were being were being
defined especially with regards to
identitarian ism because it's a vague
word and so that's all I can do with
that I lose my ability to think straight
or intelligently in confrontational or
unfriendly social situations any
suggestions for adaptation or
improvement well a couple I suppose one
is is that when you get nervous in this
kind of situation that you're describing
what often happens to people is they
start paying attention to themselves
they get self-conscious so you know
let's say I got self-conscious all of a
sudden
this QA what would happen is that I'd
start paying attention to the questions
and the screen and what I'm doing and
I'd start paying attention to how I was
feeling and to the nervousness and then
I'd start to get aware that I was not
responding properly and that would make
me more nervous and then I would get
more aware of that and that can just
shut me down entirely and that's
happened to me now and then in a lecture
and sometimes almost happened when I was
talking to Sam Harris the first time I
paused for a long time and then became
aware of the pause and then anyways what
you have to do in a situation like that
is it's not so much that you have to
stop attending to yourself because if
you start thinking I should stop
attending to myself then you'll just
think about yourself more what you have
to do instead is pay more attention to
the situation and to the people that
you're talking to so you have to
increase the degree to which you're
attending outwardly and that'll stop you
from attending inwardly that's a very
effective technique you can practice
that generally speaking every time you
get nervous start paying more attention
and that'll that'll that'll help you out
a lot yeah it's really good suggestion
for social anxiety in general is that if
you see most people but not everyone but
most people have enough implicit social
skill because they were reasonably
socialized when they were children so
that they do know how to act in social
situations but they get anxious and then
that interferes with them implementing
what they know just like if you're a
pianist and you get anxious and
self-conscious while you're playing
you'll forget what you know because
while you've activated a different part
of your brain if you can remember to pay
attention and you can direct your
attention outward and you attend hard
enough then what will happen and try to
put the other person at ease and try to
ask them questions then that'll kick in
the automatic because you're paying
attention to what the person is doing
into their facial expressions and all of
that that will
clue in the automatic and implicit
knowledge that you have and make things
much more smooth and and and anxiety
free so attention really attention
really plays a huge role in regulating
anxiety I would Laura tasks I would love
to hear you do a lecture series on
raising children properly is that
something you would consider well in my
new book mmm-hmm I've written a chapter
on that called don't let your children
do anything that makes you dislike them
and I've laid out a bunch of I've laid
out a philosophy of care and discipline
that's predicated partly on a French
philosophical legal notion which is do
not multiply rules beyond necessity it's
sort of like a legal equivalent talking
sir and an English common law principle
is which is use minimal necessary force
and I think the union of those two which
is don't have too many rules
but make sure that you properly enforce
the ones that you do have is a good
start for how you might consider your
attitude with regards to raising
children the other thing you have to
figure out is exactly what's your aim
and you know one of the aims that people
have had most recently pushed by
clueless psychologists I would say is
that you want children to have high self
esteem and that's actually a large part
trait neuroticism anyways but but and it
can be modified to some degree Jerome
Kagan has done some very interesting
work on that but
the best thing to do I think the best
thing to orient yourself towards with
regards to children is that you're
trying to make your child your children
or help your children to be delightful
in the eyes of others and so that means
they have to be reasonably well
socialized and that really takes place
between the ages of 2 & 4 because what
you want for your children is that when
they go out into public when they're
away from you or even with you for that
matter what you want for your children
is for other people to genuinely like
them because if they behave reasonably
and they attend properly to adults and
they know how to play with other
children then wherever they go they're
going to be um unless they encounter
someone truly malevolent they're going
to be welcomed with smiles and open arms
and that's not gonna be fake because
almost every human being actually likes
children if they're reasonably behaved
and so your job is to make your children
highly socially desirable because that
opens up the world to them so there
that's not a lecture series but it's a
little lecture looking at myself
honestly John says I'm deeply envious
and resentful of others happiness how do
I turn this around well John I would say
you've started to turn it on around
already because you have at least come
to the conclusion that you're deeply
envious and resentful of others
happiness so you do have the damn
problem diagnosed so one of the things
you might do is figure out what you
would like instead like how would you
like to feel about the world you know
because you're implying that being
deeply envious and resentful isn't for
the best so let's assume that you would
rather be pleased about other people's
successes and not envious well you know
the first thing you might think is well
maybe you have to do some writing or at
least some thinking it's like maybe the
alternative would be to happy be happy
about others success and happiness well
maybe you should start by thinking about
why you might be happy about their
happiness it's not like happiness is a
zero-sum game you know it's not like
it's not and I believe me I'm taking
your
seriously and I think that what you're
saying characterizes plenty of people
and I think that you're being deeply
honest noticing it happiness isn't a
zero-sum game you know lots of people
can be happy at the same time and do you
really want to live in a world where
other people are less happy would in
what possible manner would that be
useful and good for you in the medium to
long term it might make you feel you
know grudgingly satisfied you know in a
dark way temporarily but it's not a very
good long term strategy so I would say
you got to think it through
you know what how is it that you would
like to view the world how do you think
that would be best for you I mean as if
you were taking care of yourself like
you like you're someone who deserves to
be taken care of think about how you'd
like to have the world how you'd like to
view the world and one of the ways you
can do that too is to think about some
people that you admire and try to figure
out how they look at the world or even
ask them you know because maybe then you
can find out what it is about your
thought patterns that are driving you
down this sort of dark road so why are
you now Francoise Sade orange asks why
are you know hiding the amount you
receive from patreon I found it very
motivating to see the amounts skyrocket
and felt glad to be part of this as if
you were an artist I now feel more like
I'm buying a product and I find it less
appealing yeah well it's one of those
things where I'm kind of damned if I do
and damned if I don't you know and I
don't know what's correct I guess I
probably got tired of the sort of more
left-leaning let's say radical
left-leaning press people jumping up and
down on me every chance they got because
people were donating money for for
services that is particularly rent you
know that I render essentially for free
you know there must have been 10
articles in the last week following the
Lindsay Shepard incident pointing out
that I'm somehow being manipulative and
and
evil in a capitalist sort of way for
daring to allow people to donate money
to help support what I'm doing and it
gets kind of tiring and so I don't know
I just and I guess I also thought that
maybe there's a part of it that's like
well I wouldn't exactly call it bragging
but because it's not but that's about
good enough I mean it was an appeal to
privacy I suppose in part to I don't
know if it's the right thing I could do
a poll on Twitter and find out I guess I
did that for some other things this week
so anyways that's that's the answer to
that user and okay says I Love You Man
keep it up well that's a pretty good
question and I'm trying to keep it up
I'm actually feeling quite a bit better
I was actually happy today and it's been
so rare for the last while that I could
hardly even recognize what it felt like
so but I'm definitely feeling better I'm
getting some energy in the morning and
so I I'm really happy about that so
thanks anyways I appreciate it thoughts
on the radical left and their
superficial view belief and value on the
environment how is this influenced by
their own raw emotions inviting
questionable immoral and dangerous
actions despite good intentions well I
don't really buy the whole good
intentions thing I mean I think that
it's really hard to have good intentions
like John the question I just answered
you know John said looking at myself
honestly I'm deeply envious and
resentful of others happiness well if
you listen to the Lindsey Shepherd
recording at Wilfred Laurier University
and you listen to the professor's and
that the administrators I think that
it's a it's it's absurd to start with
the presupposition that they have good
intentions I don't think they have good
intentions at all so but you know we
could give the devil let's do and say
that there are people on the left end of
the spectrum like like there are on all
parts of the spectrum who are trying to
do good things but having good
intentions and figuring out how
do well in the world our good intentions
are only the beginning and people are
always influenced by raw emotions and
fuzzy thinking and it's hard to think
critically and it's hard to plan
strategically and it's hard to to
intervene in the world in a way that
doesn't cause trouble which is partly
why I recommend to people that they
start local you know you can't even
trust your own good intentions to some
degree because you have to test out what
you do when you have good intentions and
see if it actually produces the result
that's intended but I wouldn't make the
case to begin with that especially on
the radical end of the left I think it's
unbelievably motivated by resentment so
how does one save a marriage when it
seems that there is no longer attraction
both physically and intellectually
there are kids involved which is the
main reason for wanting to save the
marriage huh well alright I know a
couple of things about that I mean the
first thing I would say is that if you
haven't had any intimate interaction
with one another for quite a long period
of time that can put both people into a
stagnant state where desire starts to
slip away what what sex therapists
recommend under such conditions is to
well essentially start in some ways
start dating again so you could ask your
partner to go out to a movie or
something like that and you know maybe
when you come home you could you could
neck for a little while like teenagers
that's probably a word that no one uses
anymore but kind of pull back and you
gotta agree say not to engage in full
sexual activity for a while but to tease
each other and to play a bit even if
you're not attracted you have to act act
it out for a while and hopefully you can
get the motor running again the other
thing I would say is that you guys might
want to sit down and make a joint plan
it's like what because a marriage is
like a story that two people are acting
out simultaneous
and you have to have shared goals and
because you're both rowing the same boat
let's say and if you don't have a
destination in mind then well maybe your
rowing in circles or maybe you're just
standing still so I would say work hard
to put some romance back in the
relationship you know you could say to
each other look let's try this for six
months and just see how it goes
we'll have two dates a week for the
first month we won't have any sex but
we'll play around and then you know
we'll see how that goes and and but
we'll try it out for them for the whole
for the whole six months there are
reasons to save a marriage I mean it's
hard on kids divorce is really hard on
kids and it's hard on the adults
involved too so what I would say you
have to negotiate an agreement and you
you know you could try the future
authoring program both of you what I
would recommend for example is that you
each do the future authoring program
separately so that's at self authoring
com because then you both have a life
plan and then you could sit down and
read each other's future authoring plans
and see if you have some things in
common and then see if you can figure
out how to support each other with
regards to each of you obtaining what
you want
so Paul Moloney asks you edited out a
disagreement with Camille Paglia what
was it no no that's not the case
there was a piece added it out but it
wasn't because there was a disagreement
it was because there was some glitch in
the video or something like that
generally speaking and you know I can't
say this with absolute certainty but I
do and so does my crew do everything we
possibly can to leave the videos alone
except for getting rid of things that
would be of no interest to anyone that
are mistakes so there was no
disagreement are you interested in
coming to Australia yes I've been
invited a couple of times but it hasn't
worked out yet but my book will be
published in Australia I think sometime
in January as well and I imagine that
all be coming there at some point in
order to
talk about my book and so on Trey says
how can a person go through the future
authoring process of imagining a future
for yourself as though you or someone
you care about when you barely don't
care about yourself or even hate
yourself yeah well I would say that go
through the exercise anyways and and act
as like try to extend to yourself some
courtesy you know sometimes you have to
act something out before you can start
to believe it and so I would say sit
down and pretend that you're your friend
you know Trey the probability that
there's something so wrong with you that
you don't deserve any regard whatsoever
is zero you know so and I would say if
if you just can't get it together you
know maybe you're depressed and maybe
you need to go talk to someone because
you don't have to be depressed you talk
to a physician you know there are
treatments for depression if you happen
to be depressed and if you actually hate
yourself then it's a possibility that
that's what's going on I don't know how
old you are but you know there are
effective treatments for that sort of
thing you might want to find out if
there's actually something wrong
physically or or psycho physiologically
you know because you don't have to
trudge through life absolutely miserable
their antidepressants for example work
really well for some people not for
everyone but for some people so okay
were the Nazis left-wing that's a good
question it depends see the problem with
any question that says is a B is a
equivalent to B is that it depends on
how you define a and B right and I'm not
trying to weasel out of the question I'm
very very serious about that the Nazis
regarded themselves as National
Hi, everyone.
I'm going to talk to you
today about a book that I'm
publishing in January of 2018.
It's called 12 Rules for
Life: An Antidote to Chaos
and it's going to be published
by Penguin Random House.
I'm going to tell you how it
came about first and then I'll
describe the book's
contents and then I'm going
to read you a little bit of it.
OK.
In 2012, I did a Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation
program called Say
No to Happiness.
And in that program,
I critiqued the idea
that happiness was the proper
goal of life, claiming instead
that it's much more useful
and effective perhaps
even for producing happiness
to look for meaning
and responsibility in life.
Anyways, I received
the following email
as a consequence.
Dear Dr. Petersen, your
comments on the CBC program Say
No to Happiness were both
thought-provoking and
challenging.
They had me asking
bigger questions
and that is always
tremendously appealing.
To be perfectly
honest, some aspects
were harder for me to
understand than others,
but I was left
wanting to know more.
Have you considered writing
a book for a general,
rather than academic, reader?
I'm a literary agent and
co-owner at the Cook Agency.
We have experience
with academics
interested in writing
for a broad audience,
working with them to remove the
scaffolding that is required
in academic writing
and helping to make
their work more accessible.
We specialize in selling
authors to international markets
and developing their
writing careers.
You can find out more about
us at www.cookagency.ca.
I look forward to
hearing from you.
Sally Harding.
So a literary agent
represents an author
and attempts to
market their books.
And so they can be
extraordinarily useful people.
And in return for that,
they get a percentage
of the book's profits and that's
how they make their living.
So it's a difficult
job, especially now
because the market for
books is very complicated
and increasingly
restrictive, I would say,
to a few extremely
successful authors.
Anyways, Sally got a hold of me
and I'd thought for a long time
about writing a more popular
version of my first book called
Maps of Meaning.
And I actually produced
almost a complete manuscript
that was let's call it a
simplified version or--
I wouldn't say simplified
exactly, more--
well, I tried to make
it more accessible.
But I was never
really happy with it.
I never really felt that it
got its legs underneath it,
I suppose.
And maybe that's because I
was duplicating something
that I'd already done.
I was thinking very hard
about what to do about this
and how I might approach it
because Sally was interested
and I thought it
might be a good thing
to try to write a book for
a more general audience.
And we talked for a while
and we discussed a few ideas.
This was back in 2012.
And I mentioned to her that
I had written something
for Quora, which is
an online website,
obviously, where
anybody can post
any question and
anyone can answer it
and then the questions
are voted on.
And Quota's quite
interesting, I would say.
And I had written a
variety of answers
because I was playing
around with it.
And some of them,
as it always is,
attracted much more
attention than others.
And somebody posted, I
think it was a young guy,
posted this question, what
are the most valuable things
everyone should know?
And so I answered it.
I listed, as it was,
42 rules to live by.
And some of them were kind
of amusing, I thought,
and some of them
were dead serious.
Anyways, it became very
popular on Quora and as of now,
it has 174,000
views and 2,500 up
votes, which makes it one of
Quota's most popular answers,
as it was soon
after I posted it.
And I thought, well, people
really liked those rules,
there was something about
them that appealed to them.
So what if I write a
book based on the rules?
And so I'll read you the rules.
OK.
Maybe you'll find
them interesting.
Tell the truth.
Do not do things that
you hate, which I think
is a variant of
telling the truth
because you have to act out the
truth, as well as telling it.
Act so that you can tell
the truth about how you act,
that's obviously related
to the first two.
Pursue what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.
If you have to
choose, be the one
who does things instead of the
one who is seen to do things.
Pay attention.
Assume that the person
you are listening to
might know something
you need to know.
Listen to them hard enough so
that they will share with you.
Plan and work diligently
to maintain the romance
in your relationships.
Be careful who you
share good news with.
Be careful who you
share bad news with.
Make at least one thing better
every single place you go.
Imagine who you
could be and then
aim single-mindedly at that.
Do not allow yourself to
become arrogant or resentful.
Try to make one room in your
house as beautiful as possible.
Compare yourself to
who you were yesterday,
not to who someone
else is today.
Work as hard as you possibly
can on at least one thing
and see what happens.
If old memories
still make you cry,
write them down
carefully and completely.
Maintain your
connections with people.
Do not carelessly denigrate
social institutions
or artistic achievement.
Treat yourself as
if you were someone
that you are
responsible for helping.
Ask someone to do you a small
favor so that he or she can ask
you to do one in the future.
Make friends with people
who want the best for you.
Do not try to rescue
someone who does not
want to be rescued and be very
careful about rescuing someone
who does.
Nothing well done
is insignificant.
Set your house in perfect order
before you criticize the world.
Dress like the person
you want to be.
Be precise in your speech.
Stand up straight with
your shoulders back.
Don't avoid
something frightening
if it stands in your
way, and don't do
unnecessarily dangerous things.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Do not let your
children do anything
that makes you dislike them.
Do not transform your
wife into a maid.
Do not hide unwanted
things in the fog.
Notice that opportunity
lurks where responsibility
has been abdicated.
Read something written
by someone great.
Pet a cat when you
encounter one on the street.
Don't bother children when
they're skateboarding.
Don't let bullies
get away with it.
Write a letter to
the government if you
see something that needs
fixing and propose a solution.
Remember that what
you do not yet know
is more important than
what you already know
and be grateful in
spite of your suffering.
So those were the 40-odd rules,
and people were pretty happy
with them.
And then something odd happened.
So a friend of mine is a
novelist, Greg Hurwitz.
And Greg wrote a book
that's become very popular
called Orphan X. And
one of the characters
in that book, the female lead I
would say, an off and on again
wrote romance interest
for the main character,
posted these rules on her
fridge and so they were
peppered throughout the book.
So that was kind of an
interesting development,
I thought.
And then because they
were so popular and Quora,
I talked to Sally
about the possibility
of turning them into a book.
And so my original vision
was to write 42 short essays.
I thought that would be--
and I was going to
call the book 42,
which I thought was quite
funny because if you remember,
the answer to life, the
universe, and everything
from Douglas Adams was 42.
A computer calculated that.
So I thought it would be
amusing to write a book called
42 that contained
answers to life,
the universe, and everything.
But when I started
writing the book,
it turned out that I had more
to say about each of the rules
than I had originally
envisioned.
And so I first cut it down
to 25 and wrote some essays,
and then I cut it down to 16.
And it was still
too long, and then I
cut it down to 12,
which turned out
to be a good thing anyways
because if you write a book,
you should write way more
than you're going to publish
and then cut.
Because that way, you're
only left with what's best.
So anyways, I wrote
for about three years--
well, no, it's
more than that now.
I guess it's almost five
years because I just
finished the book in September.
So it took about four
or five years to write,
and I was writing
pretty regularly.
What I'm going to do is read
to you a little bit of it,
I think.
This is the book here.
That's a galley copy,
and a galley copy
is a preprint of
a book so that you
can get some sense of
what it looks like.
It's got some nice
illustrations in it, I think,
by this comic book author
named Ethan van Sciver.
So that's kind of a rough
one on chapter three,
"Treat Yourself Like Someone You
are Responsible for Helping."
Ethan is a comic book artist,
he's a great Illustrator.
And he put each one of my kids,
I have two kids, one of them
in each illustration
sort of contemplating
the complexities
of life, I guess
that's how you
might subscribe it.
So that's one illustration.
I'll show you another one.
So that's my son,
Julian, there looking up
at the great statue of David.
And David, of course, is
an inspirational statue.
It's a representation
of what you could be.
And that's rule
three, make friends
with people who want
the best for you.
And I think I'm going to read
some of that to you right now.
Each rule is divided
into subsections--
small subchapters, let's say--
and I'll read you one of those
so you'll get some
sense of the book.
Rule three, make
friends with people
who want the best for you.
The old hometown.
The town I grew up
in had been scraped
only 50 years earlier out of the
endless flat northern prairie.
Fairview, Alberta was
part of the frontier
and had the cowboy
bars to prove it.
The Hudson's Bay Company
department store on Main Street
still bought beaver,
wolf, and coyote furs
directly from the
local trappers.
3,000 people lived there, 400
miles away from the nearest
city.
Cable TV, video games, and
internet did not exist.
It was no easy matter to
stay innocently amused
in Fairview, particularly
during the five months of winter
when long stretches of 40 below
days and even colder nights
were the norm.
The world's a different place
when it's cold like that.
The drunks in our town
ended their sad lives early.
They passed out in snow
banks at 3:00 in the morning,
froze to death.
You don't go outside
casually when it's 40 below.
On first breath, the arid desert
air constricts your lungs.
Ice forms on your eyelashes
and they stick together.
Long hair wet from the shower
freezes solid and then stands
on end, wraith-like of its own
accord later in a warm house
when it thaws bone dry,
charged with electricity.
Children only put their tongues
on steel playground equipment
once.
Smoke from house
chimneys doesn't rise.
Defeated by the cold,
it drifts downwards
and collects like fog
on snow-covered rooftops
and yards.
Cars must be
plugged in at night,
their engines warmed
by block heaters or oil
will not flow through
them in the morning
and they won't start.
Sometimes they won't anyways.
Then you turn the
engine over pointlessly
until the starter
clatters and falls silent.
Then you remove the frozen
battery from the car,
loosening bolts with stiffening
figures in the intense cold,
and bring it into the house.
It sits there sweating
for hours until it warms
enough to hold a decent charge.
You're not going to see out of
the back window of your car,
either.
It frosts over in November
and stays that way until May.
Scraping it off just
dampens the upholstery,
then that freezes, too.
Late one night going
to visit a friend,
I sat for two hours on the
edge of the passenger's seat
in a 1970 Dodge
Challenger jammed up
against the stick shift using
a vodka-soaked rag to keep
the inside of the
front windshield
clear in front of the driver
because the car heater had
quit.
Stopping wasn't an option.
There was nowhere to stop.
And it was hell on house cats.
Felines in Fairview had
short ears and tails
because they had lost the
tips of both to frostbite.
They came to resemble
arctic foxes, which
evolved those features
to deal proactively
with the intense cold.
One day our cat got
outside and no one noticed.
We found him later,
fur frozen fast
to the cold, hard concrete,
with no lasting damage
except to his pride.
Fairview cats were also at great
risk in the winter from cars,
but not for the
reasons you think.
It wasn't automobiles
sliding on icy roads
and running them over.
Only loser cats died that way.
It was cars parked
immediately after being driven
that were dangerous.
A frigid cat might think
highly of climbing up
under such a vehicle and sitting
on its still warm engine block.
But what if the driver
decided to use the car again
before the engine cooled
down and the cat departed?
Let's just say that
heat-seeking house
pets and rapidly
rotating radiator fans
do not co-exist happily.
Because we were so far north,
the bitterly cold winters
were very dark.
By December, the sun
didn't rise until 10:00 AM.
We trudged to school
in the pitch black.
It wasn't much lighter
when we walked home just
before the early sunset.
There wasn't much
for young people
to do in Fairview,
even in the summer,
but the winters were worse.
Then your friends mattered
more than anything.
So that's a little section
of 12 Rules for Life.
I can tell you
what the rules are.
It's foreword was
written by Norman Doidge.
He comments a little bit
about the political turmoil
that surrounded me
over the last year,
although the book itself is very
apolitical with the exception
of the chapter on
skateboarding, where
I go into the ongoing,
polarizing battle between I
would say the radical
left and everyone else.
But other than that, it's
not a political book.
So the table of
contents includes
rule one, stand up straight
with your shoulders back.
That's actually a
story that centers
on lobsters to a large degree.
I have a proclivity for
talking about lobsters.
Rule two, treat yourself
like someone you
are responsible for helping.
That's something
that people don't
do very well because they're
not very happy with themselves
often.
Rule three, make
friends with people
who want the best for you.
That's the chapter
I already read.
I read the first part of it.
And it's about trying
to organize your life
so that you're
surrounded by people
who support you when you're
trying to do what's right.
It's very important.
Rule four, compare yourself
to who you were yesterday
and not to who
someone else is today.
Because if you're comparing
yourself to someone else,
I mean, first of all,
you don't know very much
about the life of the person
you are comparing yourself to;
you don't know it across
all of its dimensions.
And second, people
are very different
and so comparing
yourself to someone else
is kind of useful, I
guess, when you're young.
But as you get older and more
singular and more particular,
it becomes increasingly
less useful.
Better to compare yourself to
a previous version of yourself
and work for
improvement in that way.
Rule five, do not
let your children
do anything that makes
you dislike them.
That's probably going to be
the most controversial chapter,
I would say.
It's a chapter about discipline
and love and respect.
I guess that's probably right.
Rule six, set your
house in perfect order
before you criticize the world.
Yeah.
Well, that's a
rough chapter, man.
I'm trying to
explain the mindset
behind people like the
Columbine High School shooters.
And so it's a harsh chapter.
Rule seven, pursue
what is meaningful
and not what is expedient.
Expedient is what works
in the short term,
expedient is what's easy.
Meaningful, instead, is what
sustains you through tragedy,
let's say.
Rule eight, tell the truth,
or at least don't lie.
Yeah.
Well, it's not that easy to
tell the truth because who
knows about the truth?
But you can learn
not to say things
that you know to be false.
And if you stop saying things
that you know to be false,
then your life
will improve a lot.
It simplifies it and it puts
you in alignment with reality.
And you should be in
alignment with reality
because there's a lot more
of it than there is of you.
Rule nine, assume that the
person you're listening
to might know
something you don't.
That's a good one because--
and this is even true when
you're dealing with people that
don't like you because they may
offer you criticisms
that are valid--
many that aren't, too, of course
because maybe they're just
trying to take you down a bit.
But if you get a
criticism that's valid
and then you can fix
that error, let's say,
that'll stop you from running
nose first into walls,
and that's generally
a handy thing.
Rule 10, be precise
in your speech.
Yeah.
Well, you have to be
exacting in the way
that you subscribe
things and the way
that you think because
otherwise, you live in the fog
and you won't get what
you should out of life
or what you need out of life.
And by need, I mean what will
sustain you so that you don't
become bitter and resentful.
Rule 11, do not bother children
when they're skateboarding.
So that chapter is about I would
say our society's hyper concern
with safety and its
fundamental antagonism
to exploratory behavior,
especially among boys.
Rule 12, pet a cat when you
encounter one on the street.
Yeah.
Well, that's about trying to
orient yourself towards life so
that even when you're in
the middle of a crisis
or a tragedy, you can find bits
and pieces of experience that
are positive and sustaining so
that you can stay positively
oriented towards your own
existence and towards existence
itself.
So anyways, that's the book.
And it's coming
out January 23rd,
although it's
available for preorder
at Amazon.com or Amazon.ca
and several other places.
I'll put links in the
video description.
If you're trying to figure
out how to orient yourself
in the midst of the chaos
that constitutes life,
then you might find some of the
things that I wrote in 12 Rules
for Life Helpful.
So I hope that that was
interesting and goodbye
for now.
hello hello can I have everybody's
attention please we're gonna be starting
soon all right so first of all thank
everybody for coming I really appreciate
seeing all of your faces here makes me
happy and it's kind of a sign that we're
in the process of reclaiming sanity on
our campus that you guys all showed up
to this so thank you thank you I'm just
gonna lay some quick ground rules for
the event so first of all I want to
thank Center first out study a liberal
democracy Leadership Institute and
undergrad political theory Association
for all their support after this I'm
going to give the mic over to Professor
over menko and he's gonna announce dr.
Peterson Photography is allowed but no
flash photography please no signs are
allowed besides a regular sheet of paper
Petersen is going to speak until 8 p.m.
after which we will have a short Q&A
until 8:30 and everybody's going to line
up on this side I will be holding the
microphone actually we might not be able
to use microphone since we only have one
okay we should have a microphone for
questions starting at 8:00 I'll have you
all line up down here and we will be
over at about 8:30 and after the Q&A
event you guys are all free to leave so
thank you very much here's professor
Albert Mako
[Music]
[Applause]
well good evening and welcome to our
talk today which is called political
indoctrination on campus I am Richard
Avram Iancu associate professor of
political science and co-director with
John Sharples the English mental
gentleman right here from the history
department we are the co-directors of
the Center for the study of liberal
democracy the center along with the
young Americans for Liberty and the
undergraduate political theory
Association organized this lecture today
if you'd like to be in the loop
regarding other events you can look us
up on the intertubes and like I said our
talk today is called political
indoctrination on campus and I'm
grateful to welcome John a dr. Jordan
Peterson as our speaker this evening dr.
Peterson is professor of psychology and
clinical psychologist from Toronto
Canada he cut his teeth as a professor
of psychology at Harvard University and
now is a professor at the University of
Toronto where hopefully he enjoys the
full protection of a robust tenure
tenure policy he's the author of two
books maps of meaning which is on my
nightstand right now and 12 rules for
life an antidote to chaos dr. Peterson
is also the author or co-author of over
a hundred scientific articles on issues
such as alcoholism aggression and the
neurology of political consciousness as
I understand the titles because I didn't
read 100 articles in 2013 dr. Peterson
began recording his lectures personality
and its transformations maps meaning the
architecture a belief and uploading them
to YouTube which have been very popular
I will admit publicly that I listened to
many of his podcast this past summer
while on long training runs they don't
do much for pace but they keep you going
for a long time dr. Peterson made
something of a public splash in 2016
when he made a couple of YouTube videos
criticizing Canada's bill c16 which adds
gender expression and identity as a
protected class under the Canadian Human
Rights Act dr. Peterson argued that a
person could be prosecuted for refusing
to use preferred pronouns a similar law
has recently been passed in California
which of course raises the issue of
forced speech and the First Amendment
after these videos dr. Peterson acquired
some notoriety his YouTube channel has
gathered more
four hundred and fifty thousand
subscribers and his videos have received
more than twenty five million views as
of October 2017 his classroom lectures
on mythology were turned into a wildly
popular thirteen part TV series on TV
Ontario dr. Peterson also has a biblical
lecture series on Tuesday evenings which
are almost always sold out and if any
reason to move back to Toronto for me
that would be one of them finally I
learned that like me dr. Peterson hails
from Alberta I assume he's a right
thinking man and Dustin Edmonton Oilers
fan ladies and gentlemen dr. Peterson
[Applause]
thank you very much for inviting me can
you hear me at the back yeah it's good
all right well we might as well get
right into this so I want to go as
deeply underneath the problem as I can
possibly manage tonight so I'm going to
marry some of my ideas about what you
might describe is the grammatical
structure of belief with some more
overtly political analysis concentrating
on what actually what constitutes
ideology because one of the things that
I've been trying to figure out and I
guess this is part of my attempt to
wrestle with some of the actual problems
that the post modernists opposed because
I don't mean as people or as thinkers I
mean conceptually because you always
have to give the devil his due so to
speak and there are elements of
postmodern thought like the idea that
there's an infinite number of
interpretations for any finite set of
facts that actually happened to be true
and there aren't they're quite
problematic and it's it's for good
reasons as well as bad reasons that
post-modernism has become such a
dominant strain of thought and so it's
necessary to take it seriously and I've
been trying to one of the things I've
been trying to figure out is is there a
reasonable way of distinguishing
philosophy from an ideologies and the
Pope the post modernist answer to that
is basically know that it's ideology all
the way down like the turtles all the
way down you never escaped from the from
the grip of your of your viewpoint in
some sense and and there's some truth in
that but there's not enough truth that's
the thing and one of the hallmarks I
would say of both post-postmodern an
ideological thinking is the proclivity
to reduce very complex phenomena to
single causes but anyways so we're going
to we're going to go underneath things
as far as we possibly can so the first
thing that I'd like to point out is
or like to discuss is the actual problem
that were that we're all trying to solve
in some sense including the ideologues
who claim to have the let's say
interests of either the working class or
there were or the oppressed uppermost in
their in their imagination in their
heart or in their intellectual concerns
and there's absolutely no doubt that
there is oppression and and that there's
no shortage of suffering in the world
and I do think that's not only the
fundamental the fundamental reality of
the world and and this is an existential
theme and it was developed at least to
some degree by Martin Heidegger and
Heidegger had a concept that he called
throne Ness which is an interesting an
interesting idea and throne Ness is is a
brief description of the arbitrary
nature of human being or even of being
itself and the arbitrary nature it can
be his the word he used for that which
is a German word can be translated in
other ways it can be translated as
abandon or dereliction or dejection
which obviously are much harsher words
than mere throne this throne this is
more of a detached term but what it
means is that it's a characteristic of
human conscious experience to be
underpinned by arbitrary realities that
have nothing to do in some sense with
your choice as a being and so some of
the elements of being thrown are that
you're born at a certain time rather
than a different time that seems like
it's an irrational fact that's how young
would describe it Carl Jung as it's an
irrational fact because there's no real
way of accounting for it from from a
causal perspective not not subjectively
speaking and you're born a certain race
and you're born with a certain level of
intelligence let's say although that can
be impaired certainly with enough effort
and you're born in a certain culture
with a certain language and at a certain
socio-economic in a certain
socio-economic class and with a certain
degree of attractiveness and those are
things that are all handed to you in
some sense they they make up the
in some sense they make up the axiomatic
structure of your being and some of the
more advantageous and others are
disadvantageous and you're stuck with
them and that really is a problem
partly because life in and of itself is
a problem and a problem of suffering but
also because it seems quite evident that
well or at least that you could make a
strong case that the the talents and
catastrophes of life are by no means
equally distributed and so in some sense
there seems to be an intrinsic we might
regard it from the perspective of the
standards of human justice and perhaps
human mercy as well as something
intrinsically unfair unjust about the
structure of existence itself now I like
the exact existentialist take on that
because what the existentialists do is
attribute that inequality and injustice
and say unfairness to the structure of
being itself and pose that as the
central problem of life and I find that
very realistic I like this painting by
Van Gogh I think it does a very good job
of expressing that you know he's an old
man and he's obviously sorrowful and and
you know he's not rich as you can tell
by his shoes and like it's rough and and
he's a nexus of oppression and perhaps
Oh a nexus of oppression in that he may
have served as an oppressor but also
someone who's suffering and oppressed as
a consequence of the conditions of his
life and so then the question might be
well why is life like that and that's
where and what might be done about it
and that's where the differences really
start to arise so we can start from the
perspective of the fact that life
presents a universal problem to those of
us who are alive and conscious now there
are various what would you call the
Metta theories that account for the
existence of this suffering my
interpretation of the story of Genesis
essentially which in some sense
describes the introduction of suffering
into the world is that what what seems
to happen in the story of Genesis is
that human beings originally emerge is a
mythological rep
so it's a deep fictional representation
that's one way of thinking about it
keeping in mind as you might that
fiction can be more true than truth
which is partly why we're so attracted
to it because fiction distills truth and
presents it in a much more concentrated
form than than a mere description of
everyday reality and in the Genesis
story there's a there seems to be an
association between the development of
vision and self-consciousness and the
awareness of death and the awareness of
good and evil those things happen pretty
much at exactly the same time and the
consequence of that awareness of or that
self-consciousness is a dawning
awareness of vulnerability you remember
in the story of Genesis when Adam and
Eve opened their eyes or have their eyes
opened as a consequence of falling prey
to temptation the scales fall from their
eyes and they realize that they're naked
and then they immediately cover
themselves up and of course the question
is what does it mean to realize that
you're naked and there's a variety of
complex quest answers to that one is
that well if you're naked a common
nightmare is to be naked in front of a
crowd and the reason that that's a
nightmare is because well people don't
like to have their full vulnerability
exposed to the judgmental eye of the
crowd and for good reason like everybody
has what would you say it may be an
inbuilt sense of shame about their
fundamental inadequacy in relationship
to the difficulties of life and so the
story of Genesis which i think is a
foundational story well I don't think
it's a foundational story it's obviously
a foundational story foundation story of
Western culture suggest that it's
mankind's knowledge of its own nature
that leads to not only to suffering but
to work you know because once you
realize that you're vulnerable and that
that vulnerability never really goes
away
you always have to prepare for the
future because even if you solve the
problems that are right in front of you
this moment that doesn't mean that
you've solved the plethora of problems
that are likely to pop up for you
tomorrow and next week and next month
and next year and and that in some sense
are beyond your ability to finally solve
so but there's a different viewpoint I
think that comes
of the Marxist perspective and I'm going
to talk to you about Marxism and
post-modernism both of which I regard as
variant strands of the same ideology and
as I said I'll define why I think
they're ideological and the the the
thing that strikes me so clearly about
the Marxist perspective is that the
finger is always pointed at inadequate
social order as the root cause of
suffering and that just seems to me to
be I don't know it's it's so naive that
it's difficult to understand why people
can possibly fall for it maybe it's
partly because there's some hope
embedded in it right
there's an idea that well suffering
might be transcended if we could just
organize our societies properly but it
seems to be number one that that's
highly unlikely and number two as
Dostoevsky pointed out even if we did
organize our societies so that no one
had anything to worry about from a
material perspective so everyone let's
say had enough bread and shelter that
were the kind of insane creatures that
would blow that apart and fragment that
sort of static utopian perfection just
so something strange and interesting
might happen and I think that's a really
that's a really devastating critique and
you know no Dostoevsky formulated that
back in the late 1800s he had thought
through the consequences of communist
utopia before it even manifested itself
as a political force and I think put his
finger on exactly at least one of its
primary weaknesses so you know if we
were delivered from suffering it's not
necessarily clear that we would be happy
about that because one of the things
that does characterize human beings is
this intense desire for experience that
transcends the normative you know and
people will go out and look for
difficult things to do just for the sake
of doing difficult things they climb
mountains and they engage in extreme
sports and they put their lives in
danger and there's no technical reason
for that and it doesn't seem like a very
intelligent thing to do from the pure
perspective of self-preservation but
we're certainly capable of it and the
problem the Marxists seem to lay the
reason for suffering at the foot of
inadequate social structure and but they
go farther than that they also describe
the social structure as it exists and
this is where the idea
the patriarchy is derived as far as I'm
concerned as something that is
necessarily an upper class or an
oppressive class against the oppressed
class and what the people who fit in
those different categories can vary with
classic Marxism it was the rich against
the poor or the poor against the rich
right the burrs was C against the
proletariat and that's been transformed
I would say by the post modernists using
a fairly self-evident sleight of hand
into identity politics where the
oppressed oppressor narrative just takes
different forms according to the
identity that happens to be plugged into
the same mediational structure and what
seems to happen as a consequence of that
and I mean there's pretty good data
about this with regards to the genesis
of intense intergroup conflict one of
the things that predicts intense
intergroup conflict like the conflict in
Rwanda and certainly also happened in
Nazi Germany is that genocide all
activities are often marketed as
pre-emptive strikes against an oppressor
class right and so that would have been
the Jews in Germany and in in Rwanda the
same narrative emerged it's very common
to to dichotomize this society as
oppressor and oppressed and then for the
oppressed to rise up and take out the so
called oppressors even before anything
of any of any particular violence occurs
because of this enhanced sense of
victimization and the moral high ground
that it seems to provide the logic being
something like if we're being oppressed
and we have every right to to defend
ourselves so to speak even against
threats that are only in some way
imaginary now I don't want to get to
cut-and-dried about that because you
know it certainly is the case that there
isn't a political or economic system in
the entire world that lacks corruption
and so the idea that this the social
structure is in part corrupt enough so
that everyone who is embodied in that
social structure doesn't necessarily
have an equal chance to manifest their
gifts say and rise to the top is
certainly true because human beings are
completely incapable of producing
perfect social structures for a variety
of reasons our own blindness the fact
that we inherit structures that we don't
really understand that are all demented
and bent in one way or another and so
there's always an element of truth to
critical claims that if we just got our
act together better from a social
perspective that everything would be
more fair and just but to say that is
not to simultaneously justify the claim
that all the reasons that human beings
are suffering and that life is unfair
and unjust is because the social
structure is corrupt and oppressive
right you got to think in multivariate
terms if you have any degree of
intelligence at all and for any complex
phenomena there's generally a multitude
of causes and they are not easy to
differentiate I mean that's partly what
social scientists is do is to take a
look at a complex outcome suffering
certainly being one of those and to look
at the potential contributors of
multitude of factors now it's very
difficult because those factors are not
easy to categorize and they overlap and
so on and so forth but you have to be
pretty what would you say
motivated and stupid I would say both at
the same time to use a univariate
hypothesis to to talk to to account for
a complex phenomena I don't care what
the phenomena is and so that's another
hallmark of ideological thinking is that
the causal story collapses into a single
dimension you see that often in
psychopathology 2 where you know people
who get obsessive about something can't
shake like a particular idea that
possesses them paranoid people are like
that and people who have eating
disorders especially anorexia are like
that is their entire value structure
collapses into the dimension of thin
equals beautiful and good and it's very
rigid and black and white and it does
them absolutely no good so now some of
the problems with with the Marxist
perspective seems to be that victimhood
the sense of enhanced victimhood tends
to produce an intense sense of
resentment and that's a very bad idea
because resentment is a very toxic and
violent emotion it's also very
grateful which is one of the things I
Who's a professor at NYU and I have him here for a bunch of reasons
Jonathan is an extremely interesting researcher. I've been following his work on disgust and political belief for
Literally for decades he was one of the first people who
started to do serious research on disgust which is its own emotional system and therefore very much worth attending to
But we also have some other
interests in common Jonathan also
Started this institute called the Heterodox Academy
Which is attempting to bring back a reasonable diversity of views or what he regards as a reasonable diversity of views to
University faculty and and campuses and discussions, so I first met Jonathan
It's gonna be just about 30 years ago
25 years ago in
2014 yeah I'm sorry it was in 1994 was in 1994 yeah yeah right right so yeah
You came to do a job talk at Harvard to for an assistant professorship position
and I had been aware of your work on disgust then and and
Agitated hard for them to hire you because I thought it was of great significance
Which turned out to be exactly the case, so what do you remember about that?
I Remember I was so excited to have an interview at Harvard. It was my only interview. If I didn't get that job
I had no job for the following year, and it was a very strange day in which I didn't feel particularly
Welcomed or wanted, and then I had my session with you in which it was this guy who was it he had it
He actually got a job at Harvard, and he was studying Jung which is like almost taboo
And he was talking about dreams and creativity
And so I just that was the really bright that was the bright memory of the day was our hour-long conversation
Yeah, well I was also really interested at the time man now in in the biological basis of behavior right and so and and in
in the relationship between fundamental motivational systems and thought because
Obviously our thought is grounded in fundamental motivational systems and your work on disgust
Which maybe you can tell the viewers a little bit about was really interesting to me because it was an emotional system that
Hadn't been studied much. I mean you were really one of the pioneers in the in the psychological study of disgust
Well the way to explain it is that Paul Rozin, my advisor at Penn is
The pioneer in the study of disgust, and he'd studied it as a food-related emotion
he'd written a bit about it being a moral emotion and I was a graduate student at Penn and
I was interested in morality, and I was reading the Bible and I was reading
anthropological accounts of different countries and different cultures and at the time morality was all about
Reasoning, about harm, rights and justice so Lawrence Kohlberg was the leading figure in the field and because I was looking at morality across cultures
And when you look across cultures
It's not just about fairness and harm and rights, it's about menstruation and food taboos and skin lesions
And it's very physical, and I was you know why why do so many
Societies why is it like the normal default way of being is to somehow bring the body into morality?
Why is that and so I just happened to be at Penn where the world's expert in
disgust was I went to talk to him and that started one of the best collaborations of my life and
What it led to is is a broadening of the of the moral domain basically, there's a sort of Western
Secular approach that you see in Western philosophers either morality is about harm and utilitarianism
It's minimize harm, or it's about rights and principles
Immanuel Kant and
a
Much better way psychologically, I think about morality is virtue ethics. It's just a lot of stuff
it's just we have just a lot of stuff that we judge on and
This led me eventually to realize that people on the left and people on the right
Care about different stuff everybody cares about harm and fairness
But the stuff about keeping you know boundaries around the group build a wall protect the group hold the group together
hate traitors
You know everybody can do that
But right wing morality builds on these additional additional foundations of these additional emotions and foundations
So that work on disgust that I was just beginning to talk about then when we first met in
1994 led eventually to what we now call moral foundations theory and with my-- with about five or six
colleagues if you go to yourmorals.org
You can take our test you can learn all about it
But it led to the perspective that
Ultimately was I think the right perspective as the cultural war was heating up and as left and right
We're essentially becoming like different countries different cultures
So so it's not obvious on
first
Consideration why disgust would be a moral emotion so you know most of the work
That's done. That's outside of the disgust realm
I would say is predicated on the assumption that the reason that conservatives in particular
But perhaps people who are more authoritarian in general draw boundaries around their territories
Because they're afraid of the other
But that isn't really that isn't really how it plays out as far as I can tell because conservatives for example are less neurotic than
Trait in the big five traits sense than liberals although. It's um
It's a minor difference
But the disgust issue seems to be particularly relevant, so so can you tell us a little bit about why disgust per se?
Well first conservatives are a little less neurotic
But they also at if you do very low level perceptual experiment just like a puff of white noise in the ear
People who react more strongly to that to any sort of very low level threat are more likely to vote Republican in this country
So they're you know there are all these interesting personality differences that lead to different politics, but as for why disgust?
So I'm I'm a Durkheimian. I would say I love the
Sociologist Émile Durkheim, and I'm also a social psychologist
So I'm always thinking not about people as individual utility maximizers
But people as members of social groups people who are totally focused on
Belonging in their social groups and people who have some pro-social motives about keeping the group together
About doing things that are good for the group, so as I try to argue in my book The Righteous Mind. Yes
We're selfish
There's no doubt that we often will do things to advance our own self-interest at the expense of others
But we're also really group-ish which means we'll do all sorts of things to advance our group at the expense of others
Basically, we're tribal. We evolved as a tribal species and we're doing we have all this software. I would say oh, there's all these
predispositions
predispositions for life in in tribes that are battling other tribes
And that's why it comes out so easily if you look at the way boys organize themselves when they get a fraternity
The hazing rituals when you look at the way
It's especially clear in boys the way street gangs organize themselves girls tribalism is a little different
But I would say this is and that's why again. I love the Jungian approach of archetypes there's something
There's just this weird stuff that is pan-human
Even if it comes out slightly differently around the world there really is a human nature
And it comes complete with a whole bunch of like pre-designed ideas, so there was a new article
I think it was published in Nature. I'll try to find a link for it. It's about a year old
That was based on
high-resolution imaging of
Neuronal connections, and it's actually reviewed in Kurzweil's book How to [Create] a Mind
I think that's the name of it
And so it turns out that the cortex is made out of these columnar structures that are pre-organized units of neurons
And they're replicated across the entire cortex. It's basically the same structure and like the
The older let's say Connectionist idea was that neurons that fire together wire together right that's happening of course
That's pretty standard neurology, but the the columns are already pre-wired, so it's actually columns that fire together that wire together
But there's but there's even more with the high-resolution scanning, so it turns out that underneath the columnar structure there are these pre-built
Highways that are connected connective tissue that are pre
pre-prepared so the columns have the option to
connect to the to the underlying highway, and then that highway can connect to other columns, so it's as if
Implicit in the brain organization, and this is at the cortical levels say nothing of subcortical organization. There's already
preexistent
Likelihoods that certain neurons will fire will wire together. Yeah, so and and what else is cool is that this is actually
architecturally quite
Regular, so they found that the these super highways are arranged in lines, and and and and in
At right angles to one another so it's almost like a three-dimensional structure of wired cubes that underlies the neuronal structure
So that's some neurological evidence for the archetypal idea, so let me just explain to explain to the viewers here
Why this isn't just some like
psychological geek conversation
This is actually really relevant to a lot of the things that we'll be talking about and that your audience probably cares about
because one of the most contested ideas in the social sciences is the idea of innateness and
Yeah, the idea is well
If something is innate then it can't it can't vary across societies, and if it varies across societies
then it's not innate and if gender varies if
Masculinity or femininity vary across societies then it's not innate
It's socially constructed
But that's the wrong understanding of innateness
The definition that I use comes from Gary Marcus who was actually a neuroscientist here at NYU
He says innate doesn't mean hardwired is almost nothing interesting
That's hardwired innate means structured in advance of experience
But then experience can still revise it and boy does that work for gender for almost everything
Yeah, that's right almost everything that we're not a blank slate about anything and something I used to tell my students at UVA I taught
At UVA for 16 years is you know everything's a social construction
masculinity femininity
Cancer the Sun death everything
There's a social construction for you won't find a society that doesn't have thoughts about these things
but the fact that societies have social constructions tells us nothing about whether there's not also an
Underlying biological reality and in almost all cases there is well otherwise we wouldn't be able to communicate which is one of EO Wilson's
Comments right when I mean Wilson is the entomologist to study ants at Harvard and also wrote number of books about
Sociobiology that got him in trouble with the radical leftists
And he said even if we could communicate with ants there would be nothing to say to each other because their
Fundamental mode of being in the world is based on
Motivations and interests that are so different from ours that there wouldn't be any structure for communication
And you can kind of tell that with regards to the animals that we make friends with right
We're much more likely to make friends with animals who has a who have a fundamental biological and social nature
That's very close to ours like dogs because we can basically speak their language even though not completely
A mammal language of love and you know I miss you, and I want to play you yeah, that's right
Yeah, exactly and that bonding. Yeah, okay, so back to discuss back to discuss so
So the fundamental thing that I learned from Paul Rozin is to see us as these amazing omnivores
This is part of our survival strategy even more than other other Apes
We are just brilliant omnivores, and we have the Omnivore's Dilemma, which is we've got to be interested in all kinds of new stuff
We're not tied to any place we can roam on to a whole new continent, so we're interested in stuff
But stuff has all kinds of toxins and microbes so we have to be careful about that stuff
And so these motives have to be in tension
And this is actually an interesting way to understand the left-right difference you have to have both motives
But if so imagine two siblings one of whom is set more towards trying new stuff seeking out new stuff
And the other is a little more fearful
Then we're like whoa no let's you know let's not try that let's stay with what's tried-and-true
I mean that's progressivism and conservatives, and that's the origins of it
And if you look at kids behavior at the age of two or three it does predict
How they'll vote much later not hugely, but there is a clear prediction there, so
so disgust is part of a regulatory system about our engagement with the world and whether we are just sort of out there and
You know we we seek out variety and diversity
We think diversity is just a great thing or whether we want a little more order structure predictability
conservatives are neater than
progressives if you take photos of their rooms
You know you can actually you know cleanliness and organization you can predict how they vote
Disgust it turns out what's really cool about disgust in modern politics is if you look at all the different things that we're fighting over
Especially in this country our culture wars over. You know going back a few decades
You know sex, drugs, the flag, immigration all of these things
I have a study with my colleagues which was led by Sena
Koleva in which we asked all these cultural war attitudes of people and we also had their scores in the disgust scale
But one of the foundations of morality is sanctity and purity and it relates to disgust
What we found is that if you know if you know
What people's left-right how they place themselves in a left-right scale you can pretty much predict where they fall out on most culture war
Attitudes except for those that load on or implicate sanctity or purity so what I mean is
flag-burning, okay
Do you think you know do you think that people should have the right to burn the American flag or the country's flag as an
Expression as a political action. What do you think people just give some answer on a one to seven scale and
People on the right think you know more like they say no people on the left with yes
People who score high on loyalty are more likely to say no people who lower on it
Say yes, and that's even taking account of where they're on the left-right dimension, but here's the cool thing
It's only if you add in the purity or sanctity thing that you can really understand
What people are doing because some people see the flag not as just a piece of cloth
They see it as having some innate essence some something sacred about it
Which must be protected and so so this is
They think of it as a unifying center. Exactly, that's right
So if there's something sacred and this is that this is the central piece of my work around
Politics and morality is the psychology of sanctity
If you hold something sacred then your team circles around it and it's only
Those who circle around with you and sometimes literally circle around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca
They literally Circle the Kaaba circling is a very primitive ancient
It feels right to circle something, but even if even if you do it symbolically or you all bow at the same time
That binds you together. Children do that with their mothers when they when they engage in exploratory behavior, right well
They use their mother as a center of the world and children differ in the degree to which they'll move outward from their mothers
So they move out until they they they trip over there their uncertainty threshold
Is it a distance like it's a distance?
And so so the more exploratory kids who are lower in negative emotion will go out farther before they come back to their mother
So the mother's a center
And you know that that would be associated
Symbolically with the idea of the center as a motherland or potentially as a fatherland
That's right that makes sense so this way that we're we are incredibly symbolic creatures
we're not just out to make as much money as we can we're
Symbolic and social creatures and this psychology of sanctity or purity has become really
Not just on the right. It's always been important for
Especially religious conservatives, we're beginning to see it even on the campus left
and this is why I think we see some of the odd things we see on campus that the
Campus must be kept as a sacred and pure space
One of the things that really alarms me about what's happened on campus the last couple of years is that
The older idea we had that it's a place for contesting ideas
It's a it's a zone of enormous choice people can take what courses they want to say what they want it's kind of a wonderful
free-for-all with some with norms of respect it's now becoming much more of a religious zone where the perimeter of the campus is the
Boundaries and within it's there are almost they're blasphemy laws basically
And I really started noticing this when you look at the videos of the Middlebury
protests when Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury and
As everybody knows he was shouted down so the students are chanting and they're chanting in unison
And it seems like a religious revival meeting and they're swaying and they're saying their sacred you know racist, sexist
Anti-gay, Charles Murray, go away. It's like a ritual incantation
So that all-- to define the space as safe, and it's safe and look I'm the maternal warden
So far all this happening is they're binding together
They're moving at you know synchronous movement and call and response so it it's using a lot of tropes from religion and religious worship
But here's the cool thing
When the administrator I forget who it is comes on to say
okay, we have moved we're moving the talk and
Then you hear a couple people screaming out "off campus, off campus"
And he says to another location on campus, and there's like oh no no
Because you know look no one had to go to this talk so everyone could have just stayed home
And the students did succeed in shutting down the venue, so they could have declared a victory
But it's not a full victory unless he is physically off the campus
We can't have him speaking on campus because that defiles us that pollutes us
We must shut that down, and that's where I started saying wow this is like full-blown
psychology of religion, Durkheim, sanctity, purity, blasphemy
And that I think you know that doesn't describe most students that that describes a sort of the core those who
Really have their identities wrapped up in this movement. Okay, so so with disgust
I wanted to I wanted to ask you a couple things about that so you
Know the Big Five research into political differences basically shows that the liberals are high in trait openness and low on trait
Conscientiousness, and the Conservatives are the reverse
but we've fragmented conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness with a Big Five aspect scale and
Orderliness is strongly associated with disgust
So so right, right?
Right exactly it does sound a lot like Freud
but it but it also is in accordance with your observations that conservatives have neater spaces for example, so
So now in-- and their meetings start on time-- yes, and yeah exactly right right so
So then the the nexus for political beliefs seems to be openness. So that's that exploratory tendency that you talked about
exploration of ideas and creativity and low
Orderliness and so then I thought well why in the world would why would the political nexus go across those dimensions which are some
Relatively uncorrelated then I thought and this is in keeping with your work on disgust is that it's an issue of
Borders which of course seems more or less self-evident in the wake of Trump's election when he talked about borders
But you might say
And I think this is reasonable that the conservative is someone who wants the borders between
categories to remain intact no matter what level of analysis
so it's borders from the highest resolution level of cognition all the way up to the actual physical borders of
rooms, towns
States, countries all of that so the borders should be thicker and the reason they want that
Now there was a paper published in PLOS ONE. I don't know if you saw it it was a couple of years ago
It was a mind-boggling paper
It should have been like front page news as far as I was concerned and what the researchers did was between countries and then within
provinces or states within countries they correlated the level of
of
Frequency of infectious disease with authoritarian political beliefs and
Found a walloping correlation was like 0.6
It was one of the highest by that for those of you who don't know social scientists never discover anything
That's associated with anything else at a correlation of 0.6
Other than heritability right other than heritability yes
and so what they found was that the higher the prevalence of infectious disease the higher the probability of of
Totalitarian or authoritarian political attitudes, and then they controlled for governance because one of the questions was was this top-down
authoritarianism or bottom-up authoritarianism and the answer was that it was bottom-up okay, and so I thought about that in -
from two perspectives
Simultaneously at the time, okay, so we identified disgust sensitivity with orderliness
So it's a a fundamental sub trait, and I was reading this book that was called Hitler's Table Talk
And it was a it was the recordings of virtually everything he said at dinner from 1939 to 1942 - yeah
so it's a spontaneous utterance assay and
It's full of discussions about Jews and gypsies and all the people he tormented, but what's really interesting is all the language is disgust
It's not fear so so Hitler's basic metaphor was that the Aryan race
And country was a pure body and that it was assaulted by
Parasites right and then I remembered what happened to the Native Americans when the Europeans showed up and shook hands
What happened was that 95% of them were dead within 50 years right because of smallpox and measles and so that
That border issue that separates conservatives from liberals. Let's say as the Conservatives say
The novel is potentially contaminated. It's not so much that it's dangerous. That's different. That's fear
It's contaminating and the Liberals say hold on a minute if you make the borders too thick then information can't pass through. Exactly
So that's the Omnivore's Dilemma right there. Right right and and then since we have a biological
Architecture on which our cognitive platforms are erected
We have the same attitude towards abstract information, which would be ideas that we do to
things like food or illness
This right right and so we can think of an invading idea or a polluting idea or a contaminating idea. That's right. Now
I'm a big fan of George Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By
That we yeah
We use our bodily our
Bodily schemata to think about abstract things like politics and like what our policies should be about borders and immigration
There's a Canadian psychologist, Mark Schaller, he and his colleagues have developed what they call an account of these the behavioural immune system
Yeah, right that we don't just try to you know
Microbes killed probably many more of our ancestors than did lions and tigers and bears and so whoever can keep themselves and their children
From being exposed to fatal illnesses wins the evolutionary game and so a lot of that is
Judging carefully about people is he dangerous, is she dangerous and that's both for sexuality, for contact, for all kinds of association
So yeah in a lot of ways our emotions and our bodily interactions structure
how we think and feel about about social interactions
Well even with the black death in Europe
I mean so the black death occurred in Europe when the Europeans started to move around the world and they brought back rats that were
Infected exactly so so what you saw there was both of those forces at work at the same time so the European expansion
produced a tremendous
Interchange of ideas from all around the world that's globalization
But it wiped out somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of the population at the same time
So wouldn't it be good if in every society or every organization we had some people who specialized in
Specialized in saying "hey, what are the opportunities?" and then we had other people who specialized in saying "well
But what are the risks?" and it just so happens that a lot of people have trouble doing all that in themselves
When we have systems that are well constituted with people who have different
Personalities and different motives and goals we actually can get better outcomes. We can have a discussion between them
Yeah
well
That's exactly why that
it's it's for that precise reason that
That I've been so interested in free speech as a as a value because well even on the economic front
it's pretty obvious if you look at things economically that the
entrepreneur types who start businesses are lumped in with the liberal creative types
We've done a lot of work on the prediction of entrepreneurial behavior and ability and it's openness. That's the big predictor
It's not the only one its openness an IQ fundamentally but for managerial and administrative
expertise it's oh
It's IQ and conscientiousness so the Liberals start businesses and and but they can't run them
Because their their their interest's flipped, and they don't have the organizational ability and the Conservatives can run them
But they can't continue to transform and expand them it yin, and yang yin, and yang, yeah
so so
One more thing about what happened in Nazi Germany
That that's very relevant and interesting because it's it's useful to get these motives right you know
first of all if if something disgusts you if something if you're afraid of something then you run away from it or you freeze
But if something disgusts you you try to burn it or kill it right you try to get rid of it or
Expel it that's that's right though. You want to get it away and destroy it
What so when Hitler first came to power he
Put in a bunch of public health schemes like he had vans that went around and screen people for tuberculosis
then he went on a
factory cleanliness
campaign
So the factories were supposed to be tidied up
And he washed, he bathed about four times a day by the way, he was also a great worshipper of willpower which is associated with
Orderliness and seems maybe to be associated with disgust sensitivity in some way that isn't yet understood
Yeah, yeah
I don't I don't understand that connection either
so they he convinced factory owners in Germany to get rid of the rats and the mite and mice and the and the
Insects in the factories and also to clean them up and beautify them
But the gas they used to clean up the factories was Zyklon-A and
It was the variation of that gas, Zyklon-B
That was then used in yeah, so you could see this ramping up, eh. So it was yeah absolutely
So it was public health, then it was
Social cleanliness, then he went into the asylums and cleaned them up
And so it was just this expansion of of who was contaminated and who was impure
and I think also his fascination with fire and his use of fire symbolism was also associated with that with that appeal to
purification because the whole idea of purification by fire is a very ancient idea so
okay, so
so how did your work on disgust change the way that you looked at things
Fundamentally, I mean you gave some indication of that already, but what else has it changed
so
since I was coming out of a
Psychological literature that was very focused on on sort of secular
secular ethics about justice and fairness, and then I began studying disgust and
Looking at the broader moral domain that almost all societies have
That then also led me to think about well. Okay, if disgust is a reaction to things that seem to be
Degrading so an interesting element of disgust is this notion of degradation there are always these vertical metaphors
In which disgust brings us down and and disgust it so a lot of some religious practice and Judaism and Islam
and and Hinduism is about preparing your body to approach God and
Purification and so that led me to think well if there's an emotion which is about seeing our lower, base or animal
Biological nature is there an opposite emotion is there an emotion of that we feel when we see some manifestation or a higher
Nobler nature, and I was just beginning to think this when I moved to UVA. I got my first job at the University of Virginia
1995 and I read the set of Thomas Jefferson's letters and in one letter he describes
He describes the feelings you get from reading great fiction
He advises a cousin of his that he should buy fiction for his library. Not just you know serious works of law and philosophy
And he described he says doesn't he describe the feeling of
Of having your sentiments be elevated does it not dilate your breast, give you an open feeling in your chest
When you see these acts of beauty and kindness and gratitude. I thought wow that's exactly it
And so because I've been studying disgust. I then started studying its opposite, which I and some others called moral elevations
So there's kind of vertical metaphor of elevation and degradation-- maps onto the body too with regards to-- that's right high, low
clean, dirty
yeah, it's a beautiful pairing and so having this language of elevation and disgust just really has helped me see a lot of things I
Just I could just see a lot of things happening it allows me to like
even you know manipulate like if I'm applying for a grant proposal like I get very good at like having an
elevating ending you know to
to end with a notable uplift
And so it just broadened, it just broadened by thinking about morality and this was around 1995 and so again
It just prepared me so that
And I'd already been to India by that point I spent three months doing research in Orissa in eastern India
So it just broadened my thinking and that's what allowed me
Finally to understand conservatives because I had always been on the left. I hated Ronald Reagan
I
Thought Republicans were stupid and evil and it was only when I'd gone to India and really tried to understand a traditional
religious
Hierarchical, gender stratified society tried to understand it in their terms
They didn't try to just bring in my own my own Western left. You know left-leaning perspectives
That I was and this was all under the guidance of Richard Shweder, my postdoc supervisor at the University of Chicago, where I did a postdoc
It was only then that I was able to
Sort of get inside their minds and their moral system and see that there were alternative moral worlds
They each had their own logic and that was the metaphor I came to it. You know the time
You know The Matrix movies were very popular so the metaphor, The Matrix as a consensual hallucination
Made a lot of sense. It's waking up with the idea of just speaking with moral matrices
Which every different moral matrices. That are grounded in biology
They're biology in the sense that gives us the potential it's like the building blocks of this matrix
Can't be just anything that comes it comes from our
experiences our embodied experiences and again George Lakoff is the master of that thinking and so it was only then that
that I was able to now listen to conservative talk radio and
Christian religious radio and see rather than just saying oh those stupid terrible people say like oh wow yeah
You know I can see that they're striving for a certain virtues. Right right so you started to understand their metaphorical language essentially
That's right, and that was like kind of like my you know I know great awakening or scales falling from my eyes
But you know since well it took a few more you took a number of a lot more years
But eventually I kind of just like pulled out the implants from my eyes
And I stopped seeing everything so through a partisan lens
And I'm not on any side now and just trying to understand what the hell is well. It's really useful
It's really useful to understand that there are
Actual reasons why people see the world differently and that you can't just easily say that one is right
and the other is wrong because
The Liberals are correct when it comes to borders that if you thicken them too much and diminish the information flow
You risk making the society so static that any radical
Environmental transformation will sink it it's the case
But the Conservatives are right in that you pay a big price
with regards to newcomers and new information with regards to risk to exposure to
contaminating, well to contamination period but also to
contaminating ideas and so then I've always thought you know the the
Environment itself moves back and forth like a snake in some sense and what we're trying to do is stay on the center of its
back
And the only way we can do that is by people
By having people pull to the right and say be careful and people pull to the left and say well
Yeah
but be open with that dialogue and the the
exchange of information that that dialogue allows we can maybe specify the center of that moving target and stay and stay
Well and stay on the back
Yeah, okay, so that's a really complicated metaphor with the snake
But I think it's a perfect way in to what's going on on campus and to why viewpoint diversity is so important because that's I
agree exactly with what you just said and
So what I the view that I've come to in studying moral psychology, is that we is that humans are
ultra social Apes
We we evolved to live in these small groups that are fighting with each other
We evolved to have these low-level animistic religions. That's our steady state. That's the way we were for at least 100,000 years or much more
probably closer to a million in some form
So that's sort of our design. That's what we were designed for in a sense
and
In that sense where as individuals were really kind of stupid tribal creatures designed to do post hoc reasoning
But if you put us together in the right way with the right checks with the right the right systems
The the whole can be vastly smarter than the components that go into it
Which is true of the brain - the brain is composed of neurons each neurons really kind of a stupid little switch
But you put them together in the right way, and you get something really brilliant and in the same way
I don't know all the history here, but my understanding is that science begins or
the culture of science the scientific revolution begins in Europe
In the 17th century as you begin getting you get the printing press so people can share their ideas
but you get communities of people who are challenging each other's ideas and
That's what makes it so brilliant is that is that people have to do their best
We're really bad at disconfirming our own ideas
It's very hard to make it's very hard to do that, but you put your ideas out there and then
Everyone else is motivated to challenge them and so if you put us together in the right way the truth comes out and so adversarial
systems of law
Journalists know this they have to listen to both sides
Scientists know this social scientists should know this okay, what happened well
The Academy has has always leaned left in the 20th century
But leaning isn't the problem
So people think oh viewpoint diversity. We need we need everybody we need Nazis. We need every view. No we don't need everybody
What we need is no orthodoxy
That's what's fatal
orthodoxy
so if you have if you have to field like sociology or
Social psychology in which it's two or three to one left to right that's totally fine with me. That's totally fine
Because if someone makes some claim, that's just like ideologically blind
Someone will say you know common sense other evidence that you've missed and then the system works
But what what I learned when I started down this road in 2011 I gave a talk
at a big conference of social psychologists
I gave a talk about this problem that we're losing our diversity that I
Could only find one conservative in the entire field. I gave a talk on this
and
And
So what I've learned since then is that
The ratio in psychology was between two to one and four to one left-right all the way up to the early 90s
We've gathered together all the studies we could find so all the way up to the early 90s
It's only three or four to one left or right which would be okay?
but then between 1995 or four and 2010 it goes to
14 to 1. You do you have any idea why and why that time? Yes, so
So you get the same story whether you look at
republican-democrat ratios or liberal-conservative
They're they tell the same story so the two the big things going on there are one
Is that the Greatest Generation which had a lot of Republicans
so a lot of men go off to World War Two, they they're on the GI Bill they enter the Academy in the
1950s a lot of them are conservative or republican
So you have a lot of them
but in the 60s and 70s one of the main reasons to go to grad school in the social sciences is either a)
To stay in school to escape the Vietnam War draft or b) to fight for social justice and against racism
so in sociology and psychology in particular in political science
Maybe I'm not sure you get a huge influx of left-leaning people who are there to pursue
Social justice, so you know the motives are fine, and if it was balanced to be totally fine
but
As you get these young junior people on the Left come in in the 70s and 80s
And then you get the older people that are more politically balanced retiring in the 80s and 90s
By the time you get to the late 90s, it's all Baby Boomers. And so do you get a
Do you get a positive feedback loop developing in there? Like you said it's like three to one
It's okay
But maybe when it hits four to one it goes to like twenty to one? Then you said exactly so you so
Then you start getting hostile climate so I wrote a review paper on this with
with Joe Duarte and Phil Tetlock and Lee Jussim, Jarret Crawford
and
And we
So we reviewed everything that we could find we concluded that
Most of what's going on is self selection that is people on the Left, and we're open to experience they're always gonna
Get self selection, but then there's really good evidence that there's also hostile climate
I mean, it's it's undeniable now that if you are not on the left in a grad program
There's just constant little subtle or not so subtle reminders that you don't belong and look in the Academy
We're all about saying hey, if there are subtle hints here and there you can't succeed right
I mean, that's what we do for a living is we say that little things will stop people
Well little things are put in the way of anyone who doesn't fit politically
And so you do get hostile climate you do get overt discrimination
There's evidence of that and then there is also
It is part of the story here that what it means to be a conservative in the 90s and especially two thousands has changed so
It is true that
You know that that conservatives were not in any way anti-science
until much more recent times now actually all sides are anti science about different Sciences, but
in America the the right wing the Republican Party had
on itself it's uh so people are taking
it seriously that's good it's good I say
that but you're the one who has to deal
with the pain and the pressure so yeah
well I'm in a permanent state of being
freaked out so then I woke up this
morning with all these ideas that I
wanted to talk to you about all right
okay so let me pull up the emails that I
sent you
yeah okay so one of the things did you
want to talk for us just to just to get
our idea straight or what maybe I can I
also want to comment on some of the
things you wrote go ahead one of the
things one of the difficult things by
the way are you recording this already
yeah like you know we say after well
then maybe you should then maybe you
should speak first because that way when
I talk about the the kind of the
questions that I have especially in
regards to the cross the cross is really
complicated it's a complicated it's like
it's it's one of its meant to be to be a
mystery and so the way it's presented to
us it it kind of breaks all the
categories in a way and so or it unites
them together you can rather see it that
way and so it's difficult to it's
difficult to talk about the cross
because it's both totally on the inside
you know it's the center of the world
it's the access of the cosmos it's all
those things but it's also you know at
the edge of the world because even in
the story it's brought outside as
crucifixion happens outside of the city
it happens on the Mount of the skull and
also there's a there's a verse in the
songs that says that the just will never
hang on a cross and so I will never hang
on a tree it doesn't say cross but no
the just will never hang on a tree and
so there's a there's an aporia in the
cross which is that Christ is the just
who's hanging on a tree so that's
actually one of the reasons why Jews
have never accepted Christ as the
Messiah because they can't deal with the
absolute like paradox of having you know
the the the perfect man hanging on a
tree and so it's like how does the
but but for a Christian it's really
bringing together that the extremes you
know I talked about that before well I
think that Christ really isn't the top
of the hierarchy but is really the
stretching out of the hierarchy from the
from the top to the bottom yeah yeah
okay so so all right so we'll get to
that all right yeah yeah because I think
that's a that's that's an interesting
way of conceptualizing the potential
solution to this problem yeah okay so
Derrida had this concept of
undecidability right there were these
things that existed on the margins that
didn't fit into a category system yeah
and we've talked about that before and
that seems to me to be very much
associated with the idea that I
developed in maps of meaning of anomaly
mm-hm
yeah and the anomalous is the monster
and the reason the anomalous is the
monster is because there's a very large
number of things that won't fit into any
category system doesn't matter what the
category system is there's the things
inside the category system or the
category and there's the things outside
and there's a multiplicity of the things
outside yes and so the monster image is
an appropriate image to represent that
because that monster is a chimera that's
made up of parts yes exactly
okay and you always have to confront
what stands outside the category system
yeah and it looks to me like we use our
predator detection and defense systems
as the first defense against that the
first reaction against that yeah because
it's it's an archetypal reality that
there are things outside the category
system yeah
but it's actually and I think that in
terms of phenomenology I would say I
don't know maybe you can actually you
couldn't eliminate this in terms of
evolutionary biology because I'm not an
expert in that at all but it seems that
there's both the the predatory aspect
where it's where the the the the monster
the anomaly is seen as something to
defeat but there's also there's also an
aspect which is the desiring aspect yeah
right right well that's the dragon with
with the gold yes or or the siren the
siren no the monster itself like there's
something about
siren and about the the idea of Lilith
for example in Jewish mythology this
notion of like that or the or the the
Incubus you know the idea of the female
demon which lures and brings you out of
yourself and kind of makes you kind of
waste your seed and in a Christian in
like a religious idea where it's as if
there's a there's something about the
outside of the foreign or the which
elicits a desire to move out towards it
I think you kind of talk about that when
you talk about this notion of the snake
that appears let's say about amongst a
group of chimpanzees yeah yeah yeah
that's the fascination of the unknown
and neurobiologically that's associated
with the positive aspect of exploration
yeah so that's yeah so yeah it's a
paradoxical situation because if it's
unknown you want to be afraid of it
because it might eat you but because it
contains new information let's say you
also want to approach it yeah and that's
really I think it's important especially
now in our in like our situation to
understand the desiring aspect could you
because it you can explain a lot of the
strange phenomena that you know that
turn around sexuality in terms of of all
the strange fetishization of sexuality
into into you know sometimes it's
opposite you know like the weird the
weird scatological fetishes that people
have in like the strange like it's as if
there's something about the the outside
or the monstrous or the the discarded
which can also in a certain instance if
people who let themselves go will pull
them into a desire relationship with
that well one of the things you do find
is that sexual release like orgasm is
potentiated by novelty mm-hmm so that's
a good example of that yeah yeah and if
you kind of go down that route it can
lead you into there's no limit kind of
to where it can lead you and and and it
can explain I think it can also explain
kind of like now we are in this weird
paradoxical situation in terms of
society where since the sixties people
have been telling us you know that in
emphasizing that aspect the idea that
novelty
we'll increase pleasure let's say yeah
bring you further into pleasure but then
realizing that if you go down that road
now we're kind of realizing you know
it's like oh now we're surrounded by
sexual perverts and we're wondering why
we're surrounded by sexual perverts it's
like well maybe you led them down that
road and that road doesn't necessarily
lead to just sunshine and rainbows like
it leads to very dark places which
include a lot of violence and a lot of
of an exploration of animosity and and
and a mixture of desire and hatred and
all those those very strange things that
people kind of let themselves fall into
yeah well you might say that that's in
some sense the story of fucose life yes
exactly
I mean yeah we've talked about that
before that if if you look at foo codes
if you look at fucose life he's almost
like a microcosm of what's happening
today in terms of his he's like radical
exploration of power and sexuality but
also like the idea of the constant
stranger and the constant anonymous
anonymity of sexual encounters I think
that for sure I see him really as a as
someone to look at in terms of
understanding you know the the tone of
what's happening today yeah yeah it
seems to me to be the case and it's
interesting too because Foucault Derrida
didn't care for each other no and you
know Foucault basically regarded Derrida
as a trickster as a word e-excuse me as
a wordy trickster and yeah but they
there are their ideas fall into
alignment with regards to the notion of
the excluded as far as I can tell yeah
well the thing that the difference I
would say with the III find getting that
more useful in terms of you know I've
talked about this in my different talks
about this notion that what's upside
down can be turned back on its head hair
back on its feet and I think that data
is more useful to to play that game
where you can use him and some of his
categories to include them in a larger
frame let's say so that his ideas are
included in a more complete vision of
reality because he has like he really
shows the real his way of thinking
really shows the real deigned the real
problem of post-modernism like that you
know you talk about that off
like how is it that there's this
contradiction for example his philosophy
has been described as like the
philosophy of hesitation you know and
that makes total sense because you know
when you're faced he has this notion
that you're faced you know
and in this slipping and sliding
analysis of the world where all the all
you know reality is multiplies itself is
deferred you know that that things
always point towards the future so you
never know exactly what something is
because it keeps changing and it keeps
it keeps slipping into something else
right and so that actually leads to
which is true things yes exactly and but
that actually leads to this this this
hesitation and if you've ever seen an
interview with the ADA you'll see it in
his in his demeanor he's constantly
hesitating he's hesitating to speak
because he's always kind of like he
doesn't know he realized that he doesn't
know the total implications of what he's
about to say all the time so he's always
like he's he's like he's constantly
cautious and cautious and cautious and
so it seems like that's actually what
should be normally derived out of the
the kind of postmodern idea that that
meaning cannot be contained
whereas Foucault he really he really
used the kind of inverted idea of truth
that you have the truth of the marginal
where you can use marginality as a
weapon to destroy the let's say the the
current order you you think okay so you
think that's more attributable to
Foucault than to Derrida I think so well
did he that does it too but what he does
it's weird because he'll use the
marginal to kind of deconstruct the the
center let's say but then he'll also
kind of in a st. in the same way he'll
also say he'll also heal like reverse it
and then annihilate his reversal so he
end up really in this slippery slope
where you don't even know where you're
standing and and so in my opinion that's
useful because it helps you to see the
the actually kind of in the end it
points back towards logos it points back
towards logos in the sense that we can't
like you like we talked about you can't
live in a world like that okay so that's
so that's that's exactly what I want to
develop today yeah so okay so the first
thing that I thought of today is that
okay so we have this issue of
undecidability from Derrida's the thing
that doesn't fit in the category yeah
okay now and we know that if you have a
category there's way more outside the
category than there is inside the
category because otherwise if the
category isn't very useful right right
and so Derrida talks about that as and I
think Foucault to at least alludes to it
is that that they kind of make the case
that the purpose of the category system
is to exclude and then they make a
political case out of that as well and
the thing is is the purpose of a
category is to exclude it's to exclude
an infinite multitude yeah because you
can't deal with an infinite multitude
and so you have to simplify the world
you have to categorize the world in
order to act on it yeah so then the
ultimate question has to be something
like by what principle do you or what
principle guides your categorization of
the world and that seems to me to point
back to the logos in exactly the way
that you just described because then I
would say the logos is the divine
principle of categorization something
like that oh there are two there are
actually two ways to do it there there's
I think that I talked about it talked
about talked about this in Vancouver
it's like there's either there's three
possibilities there's either the logos
there's either absolute dissemination
which is this kind of the the the idea
that something will just kind of
dissolve it dissolves into uncertainty
and and it's important to understand the
result of that the result of that isn't
that it'll just stay in this kind of
shaky uncertainty the result of that is
that something else from the outside
which has solidity is going to ran
through it and I think that's something
that did he didn't account for you know
for example I don't think they accounted
for
for Islam for example it's like he
thought well if we're all if we all if
we're all kind of in the slippery slide
a situation without firm identities then
we have no reason to fight right that's
kind of like yeah right that's like the
positive infinite number of reasons to
fight yeah maybe
exactly maybe we have an infinite number
at the fight but he didn't see like that
something on the outside which has
strength will this then just come right
through that in terrible actually I am
absolutely well I
he thought he he was probably
Eurocentric in his outlook yeah
hilarious it is it's really hilarious
yeah it's really hilarious okay so
alright so we talked about
undecidability alright sort thing about
undecidability that we need to mention
which makes it more complicated is that
undecidability also has to do with time
and so it has to do and this is
something actually that that you have in
common I think with data which you might
read funny to say but the idea that you
that something let's say you talked
about that in example you said like when
when when Ford created the car yeah
she didn't know what it was because yeah
that that the the the that's a the
totality of what the car represents is
is is manifesting itself in time
manifesting itself in like urban
landscape in the way we understand
economy and in a way it's always the the
like the ramifications were so big that
you could never know what a car is
that's not that's called that's what
Deena talks about in terms of of the the
deferral of meaning in time so there's
that you of difference in terms of um
you know like like that there's
categories in that they're defined by
their opposites and by their their outer
categories but then there's also this
idea of time that makes it more
complicated to yeah well what that means
is that what if they is depends to some
degree on the spatial and temporal
context within which you're interpreting
it yeah you could see that way yeah yeah
I had a dream about that at one point I
I don't know if it's a digression I
don't care I'll tell you anyways so I
dreamt this is such a strange dream I
dreamt that there was this ball floating
above the Atlantic Ocean and it was just
zoom in long about you know six feet
above the surface just cruising along
and it was so powerful that it was
accompanied by four hurricanes one in
each quadrant surrounding the ball it
was a little ball away and that was the
first part of the dream the second part
of the dream was a like a view of
satellites and a bunch of scientists who
were monitoring the hell out of this
thing trying to figure out what it was
the sir
scene was this thing was trapped in a
room it was like in a Victorian Museum
case you know a wood case with glass and
it was sitting up there like suspended
in midair inside the case this a ball
the same ball yeah this so they captured
it and so then it was in the room the
room had no doors or windows and in the
room there was the President of the
United States and Stephen Hawking and so
that and then the room was made out of
titanium dioxide I remember that from
the dream which turns out to be the
stuff that this the hull of the Starship
Enterprise is made out of and something
like that nothing like that yeah yeah it
was something like that and so the idea
was that this intensely powerful thing
had been put inside a category system
right so it was inside a museum display
case and then there was the president
there a sort of representation of social
order and Stephen Hawking he was a
representation of disembodied intellect
uh-huh and then there was the room
itself which had impenetrable walls they
were like six feet thick so we it was
like we got this thing and then then I
was watching it it turned into a
chrysalis
so obviously which is something that can
transform right exactly and then it
turned into a meerschaum pipe it took me
about a year to figure that out it was
an allusion to that famous painting by
Magritte right yeah this is not a pipe
this is not a pipe you know that
Foucault FC like quite a bit yeah yeah
yeah and then it shot out of the room
like there was nothing there interesting
yeah that's a great dream Wow it was a
great dream man and so and it does
allude to this idea that you can't
capture the thing in permanently in a
category system because it shifts and
turns yeah yeah so okay so so fine so
we're on board with that all right so
now the category has to exclude because
reality is so complex that you have to
categorize it because otherwise you're
swamped yes good metaphor for it yeah
and I said something that the postmodern
is that I didn't totally see the the
extent to which that could be all right
right absolutely I think he put I think
he thought that order was a lot more
solid than it was yeah
so so or than it is so then I was
thinking okay so now in with identity
politics you have the politics of the
excluded alright so so then you have
people excluded because of race or
because of gender or because of sexual
identity or whatever and one of the
problems we've seen with that is that
the number of excluded keep multiplying
that's why you get that extension of the
letters in the LGBTQ acronym right and
there doesn't seem to be any limit to
that and the reason for that is there is
no limit to the number or excluded
because it's the cake the category of
excluded is the category of all things
that don't fit in the category system
and that's an infinite set right yeah
okay so but then I woke up this morning
and I thought well we could do we could
calculate that mathematically so because
because of I was thinking about the rise
of intersectionality and then because
the rise of intersectionality is
actually the reoccurrence of the
individual within the collective ideas
of postmodern neo Marxism because you
might say well I'm excluded cuz I'm
black or I'm excluded because I'm a
woman and then someone puts up their
hand and says well those two categories
don't include black woman they don't
include the intersection of the of the
two categories and that there's no
reason that black and woman is more
important than black woman okay so then
I thought all right so that's fine so
the problem is is that you start to get
smaller and smaller numbers of people as
exemplars of the categories that are
excluded and then so then I thought well
hello everybody my name is Angelo and I
am your emcee for the evening and on
behalf of the UBC free speech club we
would like to welcome you and thank you
for attending our third dr. Jordan B
Peterson event now I know you're all
very excited to hear the man so I'm
gonna keep these opening remarks very
short the UBC free speech Club is
devoted to the sanctity of Liberty in
our society and the necessity to keep
Liberty safe from those who want to
destroy it within just the year our club
has grown to over a thousand members and
is now in the process of incorporation
so that we may continue to bring
speakers and host events such as this
one
none of that would be possible without
dr. Peterson who has inspired countless
students all over North America to start
speaking up on their campus and in fact
this club sprung up around the same time
when dr. Peterson publicly came out
against the bill c16 that was just over
a year ago and since then his philosophy
of cleaning your room and sorting
yourself out has bettered and influenced
the lives of countless people he's an
accomplished psychologist professor and
author his book maps of meaning is an
analytical window into the myths and
cultures of humankind and now he has
written a new book it's called twelve
rules for life and antidote to chaos and
is available for pre-order on Amazon
with the release date of January 23 2018
and on that note on behalf of the UBC
free speech club we would like to
introduce you all to dr. Jordan B
Peterson
[Applause]
well thank you very much for that that's
that's quite something all right
there's a house Mike great I don't need
this one okay well then let's just move
it out of the way great so I'm gonna
talk to you tonight about the
ideological nexus of post-modernism and
Marxism and I want to get into it fairly
deeply so you can have a thoughtful
thoughtful talk and then discussion
afterwards so it's a confusing topic
because it's not obvious by any stretch
of the imagination why post-modernism
and and Neel Marxism or Marxism proper
would be aligned because post-modernism
is an anti grand narrative philosophical
movement and Marxism is a grand
narrative and so the fact that those two
things seem to coexist in the same space
needs definitely need some explanation
and it's a very tricky thing to get to
the bottom of so we won't get to the
bottom of it but we'll get farther to
the bottom of it then I've got before
and hopefully farther than many of you
have got before so let's see what we can
figure out here so I'm gonna start with
some some definitions hmm I'll return to
them as we continue you know with
philosophical movements then they're
often not named by the major thinkers in
the movement they're sort of named
afterwards the name covers a very large
range of ideas and actions and
perceptions like it's not that easy
people talk about existentialism for
example it's not that easy to come up
with a one paragraph summary of what
constitutes existentialism my sense for
the existentialist is that it's a it's
it's fundamentally a movement that's
predicated on the idea at least in in
this psychological sense that you know
Freud tended to attribute human
suffering and mental disorder to
hood trauma it's more complex than that
but that'll do for a for a quick
overview but the existentialists thought
that there was enough suffering
intrinsic in life so that it wasn't
insanity that was the question it was
sanity it was how was possible for
people to be sane and and and and let's
say normal for lack of a better word
given that there was brutality and
malevolence intrinsic in life and the
fact that you had to rise up as an
individual and and stand in relation to
that relationship to that is part and
parcel of what constitutes
existentialism there's all sorts of
different people who were thinkers who
were existentialist some of them
atheistic some of them deeply religious
like Dostoyevsky but so it's not I'm
using that as an example to show you how
difficult it is to bring a set of
thinkers under one umbrella you're bound
to oversimplify but we'll go ahead and
oversimplify post-modernism you can
think about it as an attitude of
skepticism irony towards and rejection
of grand narratives ideologies and
universalism including the idea of the
objective notions of reason that's a big
one human nature that's a big one social
progress absolute truth and object of
reality all those things being
questioned I kind of think of the head
Joker at the top of the postmodern
hierarchy as Derrida Foucault is often
mentioned as are a number of other
people here's some other attributes of
postmodern thinking there's a
recognition of the existence of
hierarchy that's for sure and there's an
echo of that idea the recognition of
hierarchy and the term patriarchy
because of course patriarchy is a
recognition of hierarchy now it's a very
particular kind of recognition but the
post modernists also tend to define
hierarchy as a consequence of power
differential and so the world they
envision as far as I can tell is
something like a it's a sociological II
Hobbesian nightmare
so hobbes thought of the philosopher
Thomas Hobbes thought of
the natural state of human beings as
every individual in some sense at the
throat of every other individual so that
the basic state of man mankind
unlike the Rousseau lien state of say
virgin innocence and and and the
primitive garden of paradise was an
all-out war of everyone against everyone
else and that that required the
imposition of the social order to keep
peace essentially so it's a it's a
fairly dark view of of humankind
Rousseau on the other hand would think
of people as intrinsically good and the
social order as intrinsically tyrannical
you can actually think about Hobbes and
Rousseau in some sense of as as as
opposites that need to be paired
together in order to get a relatively
comprehensive view of human nature
well the postmodern view is like the
Hobbesian view in some sense except you
want to replace the individual with with
with pyramids of of social organization
so hierarchies of social organization
that are based on group identity and
that the landscape in which those
pyramids exist is one of unbroken enmity
and inability to communicate so it's a
very dark view as far as I'm concerned
and I think it's fundamentally wrong and
in many ways I mean it's right in that
there are groups of people and there is
some difficulty in communication between
them and that power is in the element in
the formation of hierarchies but you
can't reduce hierarchy or group
relationship to those premises it's too
simplified because people also cooperate
we're also not groups many many of us
belong to many groups so it's to the
actual situation is far too complex to
reduce it to that degree to reduce it to
that degree even though you can come up
with a good explanatory story if you do
so it doesn't capture the nuances and
they're not just nuances it doesn't
capture the essence now the thing is is
that when you make the presupposition
that the reason that hierarchies exist
is because of power then essentially
what you do is turn every hierarchy into
a tyranny and so if you if there is
hierarchy then you assume it's a tyranny
well that's really the patriarchy the
patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as
tyranny and that's also just not true
except in pathological hierarchies so
for example we know from the
psychological literature that the best
predictors of long-term life success our
intelligence and conscientiousness
in in Western countries at least well
that's what you'd hope for right more or
less if you want it even to set up a
society even if you weren't particularly
smart or hard-working you might want to
set up a society where intelligence and
hard work we're good predictors of
success because then the people who were
smart and hardworking would produce a
bunch of things that you could have if
you could trade for them and of course
that is actually the situation that most
of us are in so and of course the other
thing about people who believe that
hierarchies in the West are only
composed of of power and tyranny is that
their own actions belie that because
whenever they make a decision to
interact with that hierarchy they
attempt or to make a purchase or to make
a trade let's say or to obtain a server
a service of any importance let's say a
medical service they are going to
definitely act as if there are less and
more competent people within that
hierarchy and seek out the ones that are
more competent obviously which you don't
do if if the hierarchy is only composed
of tyranny and power there's no point
looking for competence but anyways in
the West and in functioning societies
the hierarchies are basically predicated
on competence and not power and and you
might say well that's pretty naive it's
like no actually it's not very naive I'm
not saying at all that inappropriate
power plays don't play a role in
corrupting hierarchies of competence
that happens but generally what happens
is if the hierarchies of competence get
corrupted enough by power then they
crumble because they can no longer
function so and though you know the
evidence that our hierarchies of
competence work is everywhere because
everything around us works all the time
ayaan Hirsi Ali tells that to to
interesting stories in her book infidel
which is a great book by the way she
came from Africa and and from a country
that wasn't very functional and when she
came to Holland
said there were two things that really
amazed her and this really struck me
because you know now and then you get
lucky and you can see the the world you
live in from an outsider's perspective
right you get to see through someone
else's eyes she said the first thing
that knocked her off her feet was
waiting for a bus in in Amsterdam and on
the you know she's standing at the bus
stop and there's a pole there and
there's digital sign on the pole and the
digital sign says when the next bus is
going to come and counts down and then
when it hits zero the bus appears and
she just she just she absolutely could
not believe that that would happen that
there could be a sign that told you when
the bus would come and that it would
change and the bus would actually appear
and you think well yeah no that's a
miracle man that's an absolute miracle
it is it is you've got to think that
through you know the amount of timing
and organization and and and reliability
mechanical reliability and sociological
or social organization and dedication on
the part of the bus drivers in the
entire company and the organization of
the whole city in the state to make that
possible is absolutely beyond belief
especially when it's time to well
perhaps not the second but to ten
seconds or something like that that is
absolutely beyond belief and her
inability to comprehend that was the
correct response and then the other
thing she was amazed by was that you
could go talk to policemen and they
would help you that was just that was
just a no-go for her because for her ik
her experience was policemen were there
to shake you down and and hurt you and
so you think well you know
well I won't I won't dwell on that point
any longer the point is is that it's
absolutely ridiculous blind to make the
assumption that the hierarchies in
functioning Western democracies are
fundamentally predicated on power and
tyranny and then you know I can use a
biological example to which would place
me outside of the postmodern realm of
argument because the post modernists
don't believe in biology but but they
act like they do because they all die so
so this primatologist named well I'll
tell you two stories okay cuz these are
these are really useful so the ones
about rats and I got this story from yok
panksepp who was a great neuroscientist
he wrote a book called effective
neuroscience which by the way is on my
reading list that's on my website it's a
really good book affective neuroscience
he's a great scientist he was one of the
people who he learned that he learned
that rats laugh they laugh out
ultrasonic li-like bats so if you're
gonna you tickle them with a pencil
eraser they laugh but you have to record
it and then slow it down and then you
can hear them and you might think well
rats laugh like what would be a big
grant for that what kind of idiocy is
that it's like no no no just don't don't
don't get ahead of yourself here you
know he was showing that that that
capacity for social interaction for
social interaction that was mediated by
physiological touch mmm-hmm activated
the same excuse me activated the same
circuits in rats that a dozen people and
that those are actual biological
circuits and that we share them even
with rats now rats are quite similar to
human beings as it turns out I could say
especially post modernists but I won't
and and and so the fact that that you
know that little rats giggle when you
tickle them is is actually
extraordinarily important he also
identified surprising I've been talking
too much lately he also identified the
primary play circuit in mammals and
that's a big deal too from a scientific
perspective that's like discovering a
new continent like discovering a whole
brain system that people really didn't
know existed that's a big deal
so here's a little story about rats so
young rats like to engage in
rough-and-tumble play especially
juvenile males it's also the case for
puppies if you've ever had a puppy
dogs are like that they like to wrestle
and it's one of the things that male
human beings tend to do with their
offspring and it's a really really good
thing like rough-and-tumble play with
children really help socialize them
because
helps them figure out the difference
between touch and even rough touch and
pain you know cuz one of the things
you're doing when you're rough and
tumble playing with the little kid is
you know you throw them up in the air
and you wrestle it around
I built my I had two couches when my
kids were little that were sort of face
to face so we built this little
wrestling ring and I used to go in there
and pound them half to death every night
you know
so they loved that I mean they get so
excited about that they love that so
much it's just crazy but the reason for
that is like you're stretching out their
bodies and you're showing them that they
can't put their thumb and your eye and
you're teaching them to be graceful and
and and you're teaching them the
difference between something new that's
happening to the body and something
painful you're really teaching them to
dance and it's this really complicated
physiological dance that that is
indicative of a socialized being and
that's partly why women like men who can
dance by the way because it seemed shows
that you can pay attention to someone
else first of all that you're
coordinated but even more importantly
that you can take the fact of your
coordination and coordinate that with
someone else's coordination so and
that's very primal and physiological
it's built right into your body
and rough and tumble play helps without
a lot anyways rats also like to rough
and tumble play for much the same
reasons and sort of sort of pretty much
all social mammals so you can tell that
rats like it see how do you know if a
rat like something well he'll work for
it and one of the ways you can figure
out if a rat wants to work for something
is that no you get him in a state where
maybe he's desperate for whatever he's
working for and you can put a little
spring on him and figure out how hard he
pulls to go somewhere he knows where
he's going to get that and then you can
measure the force that he's willing to
apply and that gives you a rough
estimate of his motivation or maybe
asked a bar press like a you know like a
coke cocaine addicted rat to to receive
the reward and you can count rate of bar
pressing and you can get an estimate of
how excited the rat is to go do whatever
it is the rats going to do and so
panksepp used to put rats
he'd pair them one rat against the other
in kind of a play arena not a very big
thing and and these were juvenile males
and they would work to do that okay so
they liked it and
and maybe one rat was 10% bigger than
the other and then when you paired them
the big rat would beat the little rat
because 10% weight advantage was enough
to make the bigger dominant okay so then
they established basically dominance and
Submission you might think about that as
a power relationship and to some degree
it is but it's more complicated than
that and this is very important so so
the rats play together once and the big
rat pins the little rat really very much
like wrestling those rats wrestle just
like people wrestle and if you pair them
together then the big rat can pin the
little rat okay so now you got dominant
rats subordinate rat roughly speaking
and but then you see if you stop the
experiment there you'd think while the
rats play to establish dominance and
Submission but the thing is is that rats
don't just play once they play many many
many times and that's also the case with
human beings is that you don't just play
once you play many many times and there
is a difference between the rules of a
game and the rules of a set of games and
that's so unbelievably important so you
keep that mind because we'll return to
that so anyways the next time the two
rats get together the little rat has to
ask the big rat to play because the rule
basically is subordinate entity asks
dominant entity to play and so the
little rat does what mammals do to play
you know they kind of put their paws
down and put the rear end up bit up in
the air you see dogs do that and unless
you're completely clueless you know that
that doesn't mean he's going for your
throat means he wants you to whack him
on the side of the head so he can sort
of pretend to bite you you know it's
it's pretty obvious if you've played
with dogs and children so and I make
that comparison because dogs and
children understand each other right
they're pack animals they follow the
same basic rules they know how to play
they can become friends otherwise you
wouldn't have them as pets I mean the
dogs not the children so anyways the
little rat asks the big rot to play and
the big rat things yeah yeah okay they
will play they wrestle and you pair them
multiple times well if you pair them
multiple times what you find is that
less the big rat lets the little rat win
thirty percent of the time the little
rat
won't ask the big rat to play anymore
and that do you think well who cares
what like why is that important it's
like it's really important that's a
really important discovery because it
shows you that that even rats have a set
so our next speaker certainly does not
need any introduction he is the man you
cornered by his seat he is the man you
cornered in the foyer and he is the man
you cornered outside the bathroom so
please put your hands together for dr.
Peterson
[Applause]
so I was kind of perplexed about what I
was going to say today because I'm not a
media expert by any stretch of the
imagination but I was speaking with
Jonathan paggio this morning because
he's staying in the same same era B&B as
my wife and I and he suggested that I
talk to you about my experiences with
media over the last year and I thought
well that's a that's something I know
about so it's always good when you're
talking to people to talk to some talk
about something that you know about
that's actually a really good tip for
public speaking right if well it's
really true you have to remember that
you should know about three times as
much about the topic as as you need to
talk about the topic and then you have
places you can go and you know you can
wander around a little bit and be a
little spontaneous so that's really
useful and but then I also thought that
makes sense because nobody knows
anything about the situation with
regards to the media now and so we're
all feeling our way and so because the
technological transformations are so
rapid and you know they're going to come
one after the other in the next 10 years
I don't think we can even imagine what's
coming down the pipes and we're all
struggling to keep up and you know we
don't even know how much of the current
state of more radical political
polarization is actually a secondary
consequence of technological
transformations that we don't understand
because I was thinking today about you
know about Facebook and about Twitter
and about YouTube and about the idea
that people are in an echo chamber and
I'm not really sure that's the right
metaphor I think we might be in an
amplifier rather than an echo chamber
you know on I've thought for a long time
that when I'm when I'm thinking about
the effect of the individual I read
something that Solzhenitsyn said at one
point and I think he was citing a an
ancient Christian theologian who defined
the universe as a place that's whose
circumference was nowhere and whose
center was everywhere and I really like
that idea it's I think it's actually
relatively true from a technical
perspective like from a physical
perspective but Solzhenitsyn pointed out
that each of us was to be regarded as a
center of the cosmos and and that
have the power that's associated with
that and I've thought about that a lot
because there's something about it
that's a that's it's either obviously
true or it's true enough so that we all
acted out when we interact with each
other because we treat each other like
conscious beings who have a destiny and
who have choices and who make choices
that are important and who make choices
that can be good or bad or even good and
evil we all act like that so we act that
out and I was thinking that you can
think of Network models in that way you
know you can think of human beings as
like nine billion dots in a row and
there's no connections between the dots
and then you sort of like a dust mote in
the wind and who the hell cares what you
think anyways and you don't have any
impact on things or you can recognize
that you're at the center of a networked
system and that you know you know a
thousand people or you will in your
lifetime or perhaps more than a thousand
people and then they know a thousand
people so you're separated by one person
from a million and two people from a
billion and that's a much better way to
think and we are seriously networked
together and we're networked together
more now than we ever have been and so
one of the things that that might mean
is that the choices you make are
amplified and distributed not only far
faster than they ever have been but with
far more impact and you know one of the
things that Carl Jung pointed out was
that he had this idea that when science
that that elk you know alchemy is the
root of science in some sense it's this
dreamlike substrate out of which science
emerged and but alchemy was kind of a
weird at mixture of religious thinking
and scientific thinking because those
two things haven't been differentiated
back when there were alchemists and you
believed that what had happened in in
Europe at least first was that the
scientific end of alchemy blew up and
expanded at an exponential rate and that
led to this advanced technological
civilization that we have but that the
moral dimension that was embedded in the
religious symbolism didn't develop at
all and so we're in this unstable
situation where we're far more
technologically proficient than we are
wise and that that's actually a big
problem because obviously the more
powerful the tools you generate the more
intelligent ethically you better be or
things are going to really
are going to go to hell in a handbasket
very very rapidly you know I had this
thought I think I shared it a little bit
last night that you know in the next
five years six years we're gonna develop
pretty viciously intelligent AI systems
and that's already happening you know I
mean they're monitoring YouTube and
they're monitoring Facebook and they're
monitoring Google and they're trying to
make ethical decisions these AI systems
and the problem is is that the ethical
presuppositions of the programmers are
being embedded into the infrastructure
of the net and that's a hell of a thing
to think because it means that for
better or worse we're building automated
intelligences that reflect our own
morality and we better be very careful
about what our morality is if we're
going to automate it because automated
systems are incredibly powerful so so
that's that's kind of that's where we're
at at least to some degree in terms of
the new technological transformations
with in in communication technology you
know it puts each of us at the at the
center of a wide web of connections and
makes the consequences of our moral
decisions much more immediately manifest
to each of us it kind of begs the
question to like how should you behave
on Facebook and how should you behave on
Twitter I think Twitter drives me a
little bit crazy you know I'm on it a
fair bit I'm not sure it's a good thing
and I tend to distribute things that are
alarming let's say in some sense maybe
they are alarming ideological or
ideologically they're disturbing and I
was thinking about that today in
preparation for this talk and I wasn't
really sure that was necessarily a good
idea because there are a lot of alarming
things happening all the time everywhere
obviously and now we can share all of
them always all the time and so that
means that instead of hearing about one
alarming thing a day you're hearing
about like 500 alarming things a day and
so then you know what are you supposed
to do about that is that does that
indicate the state that there's a state
of emergency well you don't know because
you don't know how to calibrate the
information so I was thinking well maybe
the right way to behave on Twitter is
only to forward good things that are
happening you know because there's lots
of good things that are happening but I
actually don't know the answer to that I
have no idea and I don't think anybody
else does either I do know that there
are studies with regards to Facebook
that show that the more time
you spend on Facebook the more depressed
you are and that it looks like it's a
causal relationship rather than just a
correlational relationship and it seems
to have something to do with the fact
that Facebook is one of those platforms
where everybody puts up an advertisement
for their life right it's like Here I am
with my new girlfriend in the Bahamas
being happy and Here I am in a mountain
being happy and it's like it's not you
like miserable with a cover over your
head unable to get out of bed you don't
you don't you don't broadcast that you
can think well that means you're
presenting people with a falsely
positive view of your life and then they
compare their lives to it and they come
up short and you think well that's a
kind of deception but by the same token
you don't stop random strangers on the
street and tell them how miserable your
life is right they don't want to hear
about that they they want to see a
facade of normality in in in you know
just casual day-to-day interactions and
so part of pro-social behavior is only
to put what's at least you know
normative and good forward so it doesn't
matter I mean so I don't think that's
necessarily deception but the mass
consequence of that is something that we
don't understand at all
and so well so with that sort of
introduction I'm gonna kind of walk you
through my experience with social media
and let's say the old media for lack of
a better word and I'll try to give you a
balance to count and to tell you well
and to see if I can draw some
conclusions about what's happened I mean
my life for the last year has been so
busy that I haven't had proper time to
reflect on what's been happening and
even if I did I wouldn't I'm not exactly
sure I would be able to understand it
anyways because it isn't sure I'm not I
don't think I have a framework of a
reference within which to put it so I
started working for this company called
television TV Ontario about 1516 years
ago I had talked to a producer his name
was what action Berg
he's a immigrated Polish Jew and a
really smart guy and he phoned me up at
the University and one of the things
that distinguishes me to some degree
from my colleagues is that I'll talk to
the press and that I'm actually not
afraid of them or distrustful of them
like a lot of my colleagues not all of
them are
like they're critical of the press
Hartley in an arrogant way and partly in
a defensive way they say well they
always get it wrong it's like well first
of all there isn't that they and they
don't always get it wrong and you know
they'll also shy away from the press as
if they're being intruded upon when the
truth is generally speaking the ideas
that they're putting forward aren't of
sufficient interest in draw public
attention anyways and so but I talked to
audit for a long time and he invited me
to go on a couple of shows and then then
I ended up on TV owes the agenda which
is a pretty good public affairs show
it's one of the few I would say deep
news shows left that that are on normal
broadcast TV and you know they go into
issues in some depth although they've
fragmented that up a bit in recent years
and I became a fairly common guest on
those shows and people seem to like what
I was saying which always surprised me I
mean but but it was good because you
know it must be pretty damn horrible to
put yourself out in the public eye and
face primary criticism for what you're
doing I think that would be unbearable
in some sense unless you were very very
strongly constituted and then well that
went on for a while and modak was
running this series called big ideas
which was actually quite prescient you
know so he had lecturers come to Toronto
and and he had all pretty much all the
major public intellectuals in the world
over a period of about five years or six
years or so come and deliver bare-bones
lectures of this sort fundamentally and
he'd taped them and put them on TV you
know and and that was sort of unheard of
the production quality was well high but
not over produced weren't multiple
cameras and edits and an intelligent
commentary from people in the background
it was purely content driven you know
and it actually got pretty popular on on
iTunes and you can still find the
lectures there but TV Oh couldn't they
they they pulled the show even though
their primary mandate from the
government was to educate the public and
this was a very low-budget show with
very high quality Minds that people were
actually watching and downloading a
on iTunes but they they didn't seem to
take the non-standard media with any
degree of seriousness and you know
that's kind of a common human attribute
which is that if you don't know about
something you don't take it seriously
right and it's because if you don't know
about it well it's just gray and fuzzy
right to you
you have no differentiated knowledge so
it's easy to oversimplify it and I think
part of the problem with the classical
media let's say trying to make a
transition to the digital age is that
they have no idea what the digital media
is like I was watching an MSNBC clip the
other day about this robot I think her
name is Sophia who who has a fairly
advanced degree of artificial
intelligence and who can manifest pretty
realistic human facial emotions and it
was a four-minute clip and at a
30-second ad at the beginning of it and
you couldn't skip the ad and I thought
there's a real arrogance on the part of
the MA MSNBC people to put that on
YouTube because anybody who's familiar
with the YouTube let's say culture knows
that well you get to put a 10-second ad
on and then you get to skip it after
five seconds if you want like you can't
ask people to pay 30 seconds of
attention for four minutes of content it
violates the norms and so it had only
had about 12,000 views and that's a
really interesting example of Marshall
McLuhan's idea that the medium is the
message right as you build a new
technological infrastructure and it's
sort of like the old thing because
YouTube is sort of like a TV network but
it's also not like a TV network at all
partly for example because when you put
something on YouTube it's permanent
that's way different than broadcast TV
like it's RIT seriously revolutionarily
different and so and it's also the case
to that and then this is a strange thing
and I don't think the classic media
understands this either is that YouTube
people don't like high production values
in fact they're very cynical about them
and I think that's because they've come
to identify advanced editing and glitz
as markers that the information is
actually being manipulated which of
course it is now for better or worse I
mean editing doesn't have to be
manipulating but it certainly can be and
so and besides that a lot of
more tech-savvy people that watch
YouTube can duplicate those sort of
special effects in their own home in
half an hour so they're not that they're
they're no longer markers of the kind of
competence and technological prowess
that would signal the sort of competence
that you could trust so so what YouTube
viewers seem to like is basically
ordinary people more or less trying to
have an intelligent conversation about
something confusing and important and
indeed the the attention span that
people are willing to devote to that is
actually quite remarkable for for a
medium that was nothing but cute cat
videos say five years ago the fact that
like a lot of my lectures and like Joe
Rogan's podcast like three hours long
it's like what the hell people weren't
supposed to have that capacity to pay
attention in this era of fragmented
attention you know and Rogin I don't
know if you know this or not he has a
hundred and twenty million downloads a
month now
so that's 1.5 billion downloads a year
and so the last time I saw him and that
was with Brett who just spoke I I asked
him what it was like to be the most
powerful interviewer the world has ever
seen because I think he probably is if
you think about it in sheer numbers I
mean maybe Walter Cronkite back in the
60s had some comparable influence but he
said I just don't think about it and
like what what the hell is he supposed
to think about it
because no one knows what to think about
that and so he just has the
conversations and posts them and away he
goes but he has no idea what role he's
currently playing in society and we
don't have proper metrics for measuring
it and we don't understand it at all so
anyways I did these big idea lectures
with with woad ekend and they were
ranked on on the TV old channel and the
five lectures or six lectures I did all
ended up in the top 20 which really
surprised me but was an indication that
there was something about what I was
talking about that for which there was a
market and now there's there's some
reasons for that I think you know when I
I wrote a book from 1984 to 1999 called
maps of meaning and a lot of the things
I talk about come out of all the reading
I did during that period cuz I was
reading and then
same amount and thinking really non-stop
16 hours a day like the only way I could
stop myself from thinking was to go
workout with weights I couldn't shut off
my my concern with the issues that I was
dealing with and I was spending about 3
hours a day writing and I did that every
day for 15 years and that was the
consequence that was the book and the
writing also helped a tremendous amount
because it helps clarify your thinking
writing you know because actually you're
smarter when you write because you can
externalize your thoughts and then you
can you can use your working memory to
analyze what you've written instead of
remembering the thought and so you're
externalizing your memory you can
analyze what you thought you can refine
it you can reorder it you can edit like
mad with a word processor which is also
a very new thing to editing is very
difficult if you have to do that with
pen and paper with a typewriter it's
like forget it you you get your first
draft and that's it and so but what I
was doing with maps of meaning was I was
trying to solve a problem and the
problem was it was the problem as far as
I was concerned that underlie the
conflict between the Western world and
the Communist world essentially and that
problem was well the reason it was a
problem was because we were so highly
armed even as we are now and of course
that problems manifesting itself once
again with North Korea that might render
everything we're talking about
completely irrelevant right we because
we don't know which catastrophe is the
one most worth worrying about but I was
interested in the conflict between the
Communist way of looking at the world in
the western way of looking at the world
and I think I actually had a postmodern
concern with that because one of the
things I was curious about was well the
world is susceptible to a multitude of
interpretations and opinions and the
communist interpretation is ones form of
interpretation and the Western
capitalist democratic form of
interpretation is another form of
interpretation and is there any grounds
on which you can determine that one of
those is superior to the other or more
correct than the other or is it a matter
purely of opinion and social
organization or maybe even warfare to
determine who's going to be the victor
maybe there's no other
determining who's going to be the victor
of an actual conflict it's certainly
possible and so I started to look
underneath belief structures and I
didn't know you could do that really to
[Music]
thank you very much
hahahaha thank you very much for showing
up again that's a really good to see
everybody here so one of the things that
I've been realizing as a consequence of
going through these stories is that the
degree to which they're about
individuals is quite remarkable and I
think that's really telling you know one
of the reasons I prefer Dostoevsky to
Tolstoy is because Tolstoy is more of a
sociologist he's more interested in the
relationship between groups of people
this is an oversimplification because
obviously Tolstoy is a great author but
I like dusty husky better because he
really delves into the souls of
individuals and I think it's remarkable
the degree to which all of the stories
that we've covered so far in Genesis are
about individuals and they're quite
realistic which is quite remarkable -
they're not really romanticized to any
great degree because all of the people
that are regard as regarded let's say as
patriarchal or matriarchal figures in
Genesis have no shortage of ethical if
no shortage of ethical flaws and also no
shortage of difficulties in their life
and the difficulties are realistic there
they're major-league problems you know
like familial catastrophes and famine
and war and revenge and hatred and all
those things it's not a it's not a
pretty it's not a pretty book and that's
one of the things that makes it great I
mean that's one of the things that
characterizes great literature right is
that it doesn't present you with a
whitewashed view of humanity or of
existence and that's really a relief I
think because as you all know because
you're alive there's no such thing as a
whitewash existence like you're to be
alive is to be in trouble
ethically and existentially I've been
reading this book recently
I'll talk about it a little bit later
it's called better never to have a bean
and it was written by a philosopher
in South Africa in Cape Town name
Benatar that's his last name and he
basically argues I think it's a specious
argument and I think it's artificially
constructed but he basically argues that
because life is so full of suffering
even good lives are very much full of
suffering that it's wrong to bring
children into the world because the
suffering outweighs the good even in
good lives and it's actually wrong it
would also be better not to exist for
exactly the same reason and my sense in
reading the book is that he came to that
conclusion and then wrote the book to
justify it which is actually the reverse
of the way that you should write a book
what you should do when you're writing a
book is you should have a question and
you should it should be a real question
right it should be one you don't know
the answer to and then you should be
studying and writing like mad and
reading everything you can get your
hands on to see if you can actually
grapple with the problem and come to
some solution and you should walk the
reader as well through your process of
thinking so that they can come to the
well not necessary to the same
conclusion but at least track what
you're doing and I don't think that's
what he did I think he wrote it
backwards but then and so I was thinking
about it a lot because that's actually a
question that I've contended with in my
writing there are Memphis da Philly and
our satanic figures for example in girth
is Faust and also Ivan in in that in the
brothers karamasoff who basically make
the same case you know that existence is
so rife with trouble and suffering that
it would be better if it didn't exist at
all and the problem I've had with that
there's a variety of them but one of the
problems I've had with that is what
happens if you start to think that way
because what I've observed is that
people who begin to think that way that
isn't where they stop like that they get
angry at existence which is what
happened to Cain as we saw in the Cain
and Abel story and then the next step is
to start taking revenge against
existence and that cascades until it's
revenge against well I think the best
way of thinking about it is revenge
against God for the crime of being which
is I think the deepest sort of hatred
that
can entertain and and and when you're in
the grip of a really deep emotion like a
really profound emotion right at the
bottom of emotions you're in something
that's like a quasi-religious state and
that's more or less independent of your
belief saying a transcendent deity I
mean you can be in a profoundly
emotional state that's as deep as it can
be and it can have religious
significance without that necessarily
signifying anything about a transcendent
being you know but but then I was
thinking you see the problem with that
argument is you can gerrymander it
endlessly you know because first of all
how do you measure suffering and how do
you measure happiness it's like how do
you assign weights to them and god
there's just no way of doing that you
have to do it arbitrarily and so you can
make an argument that the suffering
outweighs the happiness you just wait
the suffering more heavily than you wait
the happiness and that's the end of that
you know and so that's that's a problem
but I think there's a deeper problem and
I was reading this other book while back
as well which was written by the guy who
ran the human genome project and I don't
remember exactly what it was called but
it was something like a scientists case
for God is something like that and one
of the things he referred to which
didn't strike me as hard as it should
have to begin with was the he thought
that one of the phenomena say that
justified a belief in a transcendent
being was something like the moral
intuition of human beings that you know
we have a sense of right and wrong and
you know it's certainly in what happens
in Genesis in the story of Adam and Eve
is that that that story announces the
coming of the sense of right and wrong
right the knowledge of good and evil and
it isn't something we ascribe to animals
it's something that's unique to human
beings animals can be predators and you
know and they can be gentle and and you
can have a relationship with them but
you never think of an evil cat or you
know or an evil wolf even though they're
you know they're predatory about human
beings we have this capacity to judge
between good and evil right and wrong
and it's really an integral part of our
being and I think you can make an
evolutionary case for that a biological
case for that as you can
make a biological case for most of what
is relevant about human beings because
we're biological creatures but we don't
really understand the significance of
that like what happens in the story of
Adam and Eve is that that's that
realization not coming to the knowledge
of good and evil is actually represented
as a shift of cosmic significance right
it puts a it puts a permanent fracture
in the structure of being and you know
if you think of human beings as
insignificant ants on a tiny dust mote
in the middle of an infinite cosmos
cosmos that cares less for us then who
cares fundamentally if human beings have
the knowledge to distinguish between
good and evil but if you give
consciousness a central role in being
and you can make a perfectly reasonable
case for that because without
consciousness there's no being as far as
anyone can determine so it may be much
more central than we think and and I
really don't think there's a
counter-argument to that like not a
solid one you can state that
consciousness is epiphenomena land and
that the world is fundamentally
materialistic and it doesn't matter that
there's consciousness you can state that
but you can make an equally credible
case the other way and certainly our
lived experience is that consciousness
is crucial obviously and we treat each
other as if most of the time we're
valuable conscious beings and we
wouldn't give up our consciousness even
though it's often consciousness of
suffering and so then I think another
problem with the book is that it's it's
sort of predicated on the idea that life
is for happiness and I don't think
that's right and I don't think that's
how people experience life and I might
be wrong but it seems to me that people
experience life as something like a
series of crucial ethical decisions it's
something like that I mean when I just
can't imagine maybe I'm being naive
about this but I can't imagine that I
can't imagine another being that's like
me in in most senses that isn't
constantly wrestling in some sense with
what the next proper thing to do is it's
not like it's obvious it's not bloody
obvious and it
doesn't mean you'll do the right thing
because you don't law lots of times and
you know that by your own judgement
right because you're making mistakes all
the time
sometimes you don't know what you're
doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe
it isn't and who's to say that isn't
what I'm talking and what I'm talking
about when you know that what you're
doing is wrong and you go ahead and do
it anyways people do that all the time
and that's also extremely peculiar you
bloody well think that if you knew it
was wrong and you told yourself that it
was wrong that that would be sufficient
so that you just wouldn't do it but that
isn't what you're like at all you know
and you can tell yourself something is
wrong a fifty times and you'll do it the
51st time and then you'll feel you know
like like you deserve to feel probably
and but it doesn't stop you and so so
then I think the other problem with the
viewpoint the idea that the suffering of
life eradicate sits utility is that it's
predicated on the idea that happiness or
lack of suffering even is is the right
criteria by which to judge life and I
don't think that's how we actually
experience life I think what we do
instead is put ourselves through a
series of excruciating moral choices you
know when one of the things that that's
really significant about the biblical
stories and I think about the the entire
implicit philosophy you know that's
embedded in the stories is that that's
how life is presented in in the stories
is all of these individuals first
they're individuals - not groups and
second they're agonizing over their
moral choices all the time all the time
and they have a relationship with God
and but it's not a it's not a directive
relationship exactly even for the people
to whom God speaks directly which I
suspect is not something you'd exactly
want to have happen is it's there's
still even the fact that they have a
direct relationship with God doesn't
stop them from being tormented
continually by their moral choices and
so the world is presented as a moral
landscape not as a not as a place that
justifies itself by happiness it's
presented as a moral landscape and
people are presented as
preachers who traverse through the moral
landscape making ethical decisions that
determine the course of the world and
that seems to me to be right and that's
not a that's not the same as happiness
by any stretch of the imagination it's a
whole different category of being and
you know and then I thought that through
a lot and I think well we do make
choices and what we do is contend with
the future you know and that the future
seems to appear to us as a realm of
possibility that's a more accurate way
of thinking about it then then that the
future presents itself to it to us as a
realm of determined things it's it's
presents itself as a realm of
possibility and there's good choices in
that realm and there's poor choices or
even evil choices in that realm and
we're negotiating continually deciding
which of those choices we're going to
bring into being that seems to me to be
phenomenologically indisputable and we
certainly treat each other as if that's
what we're doing because we hold each
other responsible for our actions you
know with some exceptions and that we're
deciding each moment whether to make
things better or worse and that seems to
me to be correct and I think that that's
what these stories illustrate they don't
say that directly you know although I
think it gets more and more explicit as
the narrative unfolds but and then part
of the realism of the stories is that
the people aren't the people that are
being presented are by no means good I
mean maybe with the exception of Noah no
one seemed to be a pretty good guile
they did he did get drunk and you know
and and end up naked exposed to his sons
and so forth and but I mean he isn't
talked about a lot as a character it's a
pretty compressed story but Abraham I
mean Abraham had plenty of problems not
least of which was in his inability to
leave home and then you know his lying
about his wife and their there's all
sorts of mistakes and then Jacob who
were going to talk about tonight is an
even more morally ambivalent character
he's especially at the beginning of the
story he's
it's it's he isn't the sort of person
that you would pick out especially if
you were a hack writer you wouldn't pick
him out as the hero of the story he does
a lot of things that are really pretty
reprehensible
and takes him an awful long time to
learn better and yet he's the person
who's put forward as the father of the
12 tribes of Israel it's from this
flawed person that the people that that
may be that whose story you might say is
that the fundamental constitutes the
fundamental underpinning of our culture
it's it's from this deeply flawed
individual that that group emerges and
so you might think of that as a relief
to because you know you're no knight in
shining armor you know with with a with
a pure moral past I mean people make
mistakes of catastrophic proportions
non-stop you know and that also means
that these stories put forward something
approximating hope because in their
realism in their moral realism they
present heroes I suppose the heroes of
renown right the patriarchs of old let's
say who are realistic people who have
fits of anger and rage and who are
murderous at times and who are deeply
deeply embroiled with family dispute and
and who who have adulterous affairs and
and like they do all the terrible things
that people do and the weird thing is is
that God is still with them and you know
it isn't obvious what that means or even
if it means anything but it's very it's
not disputable as far as I can tell that
a were conscious and that consciousness
is a transcendent phenomena which which
we do not understand and that the
landscape that we traverse through is
moral like every story you ever watch
anything that grips your imagination on
the screen or in the theater like any
story that grabs you is a story of moral
striving it's just not interesting
otherwise right the person has to be
confronted with complex moral choices
and then you see the outcome and you
know the good guy doesn't
and the bad guy does it badly and things
don't go so well for the bad guy
generally and if it's a bit more
sophisticated than good and the bad are
in the same individual and that's you
know that's a more compelling story but
so we could say well let's we could make
the assumption that it might be
worthwhile thinking of the world as a as
it has been thought of classically as a
theater upon which the forces of good
and evil continually strive for
dominance and I for the life of me
especially after I started reading
deeply into 20th century history and all
the terrible things that happened in the
20th century and all the terrible
unbelievably incomprehensible things
that people did to one another
I just couldn't see seeing things any
other way is realistic you know because
I don't think that you can immerse
yourself in 20th century history without
coming to the conclusion that evil is a
reality and if it's a reality that it
depends on what you mean by reality but
it's fundamental enough reality for me
and if it's a reality then I don't see
how you can escape from the conclusion
that the cosmos as we experience it at
least is a place of moral striving and
well that's one of the things that's
really illustrated in the story of Jacob
and and I found that quite striking so
so the last time last lecture I ended
with the Abrahamic stories with the
death of Sarah and that was Abraham's
wife and so we're gonna continue from
from there remember Abraham had a son
Isaac and he was asked by God to
sacrifice his son which we talked about
in in some depth and I was attempting to
make the case that you know the idea of
sacrifice was one of humankind's great
discoveries because it meant the
discovery of the future essentially but
it also meant the discovery that the
future was something that you could make
a bargain with and that you could give
up something now something impulsive
some pleasure even a deep pleasure in
the moment and you could strive and
hypothetically you could make a covenant
a bargain with the future and if your
sacrifices were acceptable and that
seemed to mean an ethically acceptable
you had to sacrifice the right thing
that that vastly increased the
probability that not only you would be
successful let's say but that your
descendants would be too and I don't
think that that's an irrational
proposition I mean you have to leave in
it a bit with the realization that
sometimes you know you get sliced off at
the knees no matter what right because
life has an arbitrary element and and
that can't be tossed out but building in
the arbitrary element will say you still
want to think well what's your best bet
given a certain amount of randomness and
it seems to me that conscious self-aware
sacrifice and proper ethical striving is
your best bet and you know there's
another idea that well I've always
explained it when I've explained it to
people I've always used the movie
Pinocchio as an example you know that
when Geppetto was trying to make his
puppet into a self-aware and autonomous
moral agent which is what he wants above
all else you know he aims at the highest
good that he can conceive which is the
star that he prays to essentially and
hopes for the transformation and there's
also something in that that's
unutterably profound and maybe that is
somewhat independent of the idea that
you
have to believe in God I would also say
that what it means to believe in God in
the old testament is by no means clear
and that's something I also really want
to talk about tonight it's not obvious
what it means and well Gepetto what he
does at least is aim at the highest good
of which he can conceive you know and
that that's actually in a philosophical
definition of God upon occasion that God
is the highest good of which you
conceive and you know that's different
than the idea of a transcendent being
precisely but it's in line with it's in
line with certain interesting
psychoanalytic speculations this is one
of the things I really liked about Carl
Jung you know
Jung was so radical a thinker it's just
beyond belief like I've read a lot of
anyway okay guys well let's go for it so
gerrae
you're gonna bring us up to date yeah
so obviously a lots been happening since
since we we last spoke on this issue and
to some extent I guess what surprised me
was not the amount of lawyers and
paralegals and licensees that have not
only reached out but apparently written
to the Law Society on this statement of
principles issue but more importantly
the public I'm getting a lot of outreach
from the general public and you can look
at the the comments on the YouTube video
that we put up the general public is
concerned and they are very much
watching in terms of the legal actors
lawyers paralegals they I understand
there are a lot that have written to the
Law Society the types of people that are
reaching out to me are a broad
cross-section of the industry very
experienced lawyers very well
established lawyers constitutional
scholars are are doing their thing but
I'm also getting paralegals who sense
that there's a problem and they're also
writing one of the things that I think
has been interesting through all of this
is that the tone of the comments that
I'm or the feedback on getting has
migrated in first instance it was a
issue with okay yes this compelled
speech idea is sounds objectionable
those same people and some new people
are beginning to reach out and that and
the commentary is changing to some
extent it is now that they're beginning
to examine the underlying report itself
and they're coming to me with questions
about well what does it mean that that
the there is a systemic discrimination
and racism within the legal industry and
what's interesting is I've actually got
racialized licensees that are beaten
that are beginning to not only reach out
but also publicizing their opinions on
these things and and they're starting to
grapple with that larger question of
well what does it mean when our industry
is systemic
discriminatory so people are becoming
aware there's an awareness that's coming
about and I think a lot of that has to
do with with the media that's been
coming out in tandem with with what we
did on on YouTube yeah so the well in
the problem with the systemic racism
charge is that well it's vague that's
for sure and then it targets everyone
equally in some sense within the
profession and requires systemic
adjustment that's the other thing and
obviously has to be supported with hard
data and it isn't self-evident that the
data to support that claim is is valid
by I would say by any stretch of the
scientific imagination so I've had a
great deal of feedback as well from from
both lawyers and the general public and
they are of a mind I think as Jared
described about their concerns over the
forced speech aspects of this
requirement I think we should make note
of the kind of response that has been
generated from supporters of this policy
in response to the kinds of concerns
that have been raised and a lot of those
people who are insisting that this is a
legitimate requirement are saying that
well you know although it's called a
statement it is not forced speech it
simply governs conduct and if I might
I'll just read out a quote attributed to
the treasurer on this question that
appeared in the law times the treasurer
was quoted as saying with respect to the
statement of values this is a conduct
obligation to recognize that we have to
commit to these values and it's not a
speech obligation or a thought
obligation now just on the face of it
that statement seems strange to say the
least to say that what we have to do is
to commit and yet that's not are there a
a thought proposition or a speech
proposition today even you have to
commit
in a statement that indicate that you
have right so it begs the question of
what's the definition of commit Oh
correct yes and and the way that they're
portraying it is that this is simply a
an articulation of the obligations that
lawyers already have and both the rules
of professional conduct and and in the
Human Rights Code which which is clearly
not the case nowhere in the rules of
professional conduct or in the Human
Rights Code is there any obligation upon
anyone to promote anything well and also
if if we if you already have that
obligation then why is it necessary to
add this additional layer of let's call
it obedience yes well let's just let's
just note the the two the two
contradictions in the portrayal of this
on the one hand it is described as not a
big deal there are no immediate
sanctions to follow you don't have to
send the statement in you just have to
write it you just put it in your own
file so we're not worried about it it's
it's it's it's no big thing why are you
so concerned about it and on the other
hand they are emphasizing how central
this is to the project that they have
set out and and and there are many
people who have suggested essentially
that if you are not willing to do this
statement and indicate you are agreement
with a certain set of values then you
should not be allowed to be a lawyer and
practice in Ontario great well that
certainly seems to be the endgame and my
sense is being watching this that
because of the public pressure they're
backing off to some degree in their
public statements by moving forward into
the future at some indeterminate date
the actual sanctions that will be
applied so that right now from a public
relations perspective it looks like this
isn't a draconian measure and might as
well also remind people that mean they
might wonder while I'm here my concern
when I first encountered this was that I
know and I know with that sinking
feeling you get when you can predict the
future accurately and you don't like
your prediction that
if the Law Society prevails with this
that the rest of the professional
organizations in Canada will follow in
lockstep very very rapidly and will end
up in a situation where every
professional in Canada is required to
pen a statement of principles that are
essentially required by by their their
colleges espousing a particular
political and not only political but
philosophical and worldview philosophy
or risk losing their licenses and I mean
I know in the legal in the law society
already you have to there's a
requirement that you have to undertake
training in relationship to equity
diversity and inclusivity right that's
part of what they're requiring well
let's just read that out one of the
recommendations in this roster of
recommendations that convocation has
passed is recommendation nothing and the
third part of recommendation nine reads
as follows the Law Society will require
each licensee to complete three hours of
an accredited program focused on
equality and inclusion with within the
first three years following the adoption
of these recommendations and one hour
per year there every year thereafter
which will count towards professionalism
hours for that year so in other words it
is exactly as you described Jordan there
will be training now so that you have
the right attitude about these matters
right and I can just imagine what that
training will be like so MOU well there
was some commentary in the underlying
report about unconscious bias training
and and I know Jordan that you've you've
had some discussions about that and some
of your your public works yeah well
there is absolutely no evidence
whatsoever that unconscious bias
training produces the results intended
first of all the relationship between
unconscious bias say as assessed by the
implicit association test which is a
pathological misuse of a psychological
instrument even the people who designed
it have grudgingly admitted that there's
there a relationship between those
implicit prejudices so to speak which
aren't even recognized universally by
psychologists as implicit prejudices the
relationship between them in any
behavior is very very small it accounts
for very little of overt behavior and
then the evidence that you can train
people out of those unconscious biases
is zero so this is this is misuse of
science and education at every level
from a scientific perspective it's the
inappropriate politicization of a very
new line of inquiry in social psychology
and if the people who designed the IAT
in my estimation had an ounce of of in
what would you say intellectual
integrity they would denounce the misuse
of their test because it doesn't fit the
requirements that psychologists have
laid down for validity or reliability
and that's partly why it's not
admissible in court for example so well
the committees that are selecting our
judges currently are being put through
unconscious bias training and so I
questioned whether or not the Law
Society will will heed the warning that
you just put out there but yeah it's
very unlikely and and so you know I've
already decided that with regards to my
clinical license if I was required to
undertake this kind of reeducation
program and to pan a statement of
principles of that sort that I just give
up my license so the only way I'm doing
that so the public that's the one thing
I wanted to let you know is that you're
not alone Jordan the the the the
groundswell of public feedback that that
I'm seeing and receiving directly into
my office has been significant people
recognize exactly what we talked about
on the last video that that the legal
industry and lawyers in particular are
supposed to be that that bulwark against
this type of overreach and so they
really very much there's a there's a
large segment of the population that are
worried they see that if the lawyers
fall down then the rest will fall can we
just make a note of one argument that
has been made in favor of the statement
which is that you know lawyers are
already subject to a a set of ethical
obligations and this is just one more an
extension of the same kind of idea but
there is a significant difference
between the kind of ethical obligations
that exist which are essentially neutral
non
political obligations that were late to
the way that our adversarial
adjudication system is supposed to work
so just for example every lawyer has an
ethical obligation to avoid a conflict
of interest you can't represent both
sides in a dispute because that would be
contrary to the way our our adversarial
system is supposed to function that
doesn't that doesn't make any sense you
can't represent both sides in a dispute
but that ethical obligation doesn't have
political content doesn't matter whether
you are a socialist or a conservative or
a classical liberal or anywhere on this
political spectrum the the if you are
functioning in this legal system it only
makes logical sense that you must
proceed without in the absence of a
conflict of interest which is this
substantially different proposition than
the proposition that these requirements
are based on which are as as Jordan that
you mentioned earlier these are
politically charged and have substantive
political content in them the law
society is essentially saying that
unless you adhere to a certain ideology
that you are not fit to practice law
well it's also an admission that this is
and this is I think the more perhaps
even the more dangerous element of this
is that to undertake re-education with
regards to your political beliefs
surrounding or even factual beliefs
surrounding equity diversity and
inclusivity is to act out by implication
the fact that you need that re-education
because you're part of the problem of
systemic racism and you know it's very
it's very psychologically significant to
act out an admission of your guilt
because what happens is generally
speaking is that people then
retroactively Lee alter their self
images and start to wonder about such
things you know because they're either
cowards for for going along with thee
with the requirements or liar's for
producing a statement of principle that
they don't actually agree in or they
start to tilt their beliefs in the
direction that's required by that
demands and that's usually what happens
and so and I'm quite convinced that the
people who do this sort of thing who
make these requirements know that and
that it's a it's a manipulation on their
part to tilt political belief overtly
and so it you can't act these things out
without it having psychological
consequences and and consequence it's
moral consequences let's say so it's
like very intrusive the the other thing
Bruce it's important to remember is I
mean the dichotomy between belief
thought and conduct currently lawyers in
Ontario are subject to the rules of
professional conduct and and I right now
we have an obligation to act in a
certain way and to refrain from acting
in other ways and one of the rules of
professional conduct is you know thou
shalt not discriminate and I don't think
anybody would argue with that in that
out shall act in accordance with the
with the human rights regime and and
associated codes across Canada nobody
could argue with that
but this statement of principles is
crossing the line into thought and
opinion and and one of the
recommendations I would note in the in
the report is recommendation number one
they're actually proposing to review and
amend where appropriate the rules of
professional conduct the paralegal rules
of conduct and commentaries to reinforce
the professional obligations of all
licensees to recognize acknowledge and
promote principles of equality diversity
and inclusion now I find that
fascinating because you're gonna you're
going to amend a rule of conduct to to
include all of a sudden a an affirmation
of thought and to insist upon promotion
as well because obviously very
ill-defined yes so with let's just go
back to the words just just to make this
point so again I'm going back to a a a
quote attributed to the Treasurer in the
law times piece he says this the
statement of values is an obligation to
promote equality diversity and inclusion
generally which is nothing more than the
obligation lawyers have already but when
you go to the rules of professional
conduct it says a lawyer has special
responsibility to respect the
requirements of
rights laws enforce in Ontario and to
honor the obligation not to discriminate
on the grounds of race has to be place
of origin color etc etc that's exactly
as you just said Jarrod this describes
an obligation to observe the law and
though and this law consists of
prohibitions that is the obligation that
lawyers are under no doubt about it that
they must do so but that is not include
an obligation to endorse and it is not
include an obligation to promote right
and we should also point out just in
case it needs to be said that none of
the three of us disagree with the idea
that people shouldn't be discriminated
against for reasons that have nothing to
do with their competence agreed agreed
if not what this is about and it might
also be useful to talk for a moment also
about the word equality use equality has
two competing legal meanings and and the
law society has not defined which one of
them they mean explicitly but it's clear
by implication which one they mean and
the two choices are formal equality or
substantive equality or support equality
of results and the two things are quite
different formal equality simply means
that the same rules of conduct apply to
everybody regardless of background of
wealth
lineage of heritage and so on same rules
apply to everybody in the same way
equality of results means that everybody
ends up in the same place and and note
that these two ideas of equality are
diametrically opposed and inconsistent
with each other because if you have
formal equality applying the same rules
to everybody because everybody is
different you're going to have different
results for everybody if you insist upon
the same results from everybody that
means you need different rules for
everybody for them to end up in the same
place so you cannot have both formal
equality and substantive equality
together and traditionally the rule of
law has included the notion of formal
equality right you have a properly
functioning rule of law that means you
have the same rules apply to everybody
without regard to who they are well the
problem with it with equality of outcome
which is now often termed equity is that
you can group people each individual in
the multitude of different ways and it's
impossible to produce equality of
outcome across all those different
dimensions of the comparison so it's a
never-ending struggle to produce
equality of outcome it's it's
technically impossible and and societies
that have tried that have had well it's
been absolutely catastrophic and their
noses terribly divisive it is also
contrary to that fundamental legal
proposition that justice is blind
justice is supposed to be blind to all
of those personal certain
characteristics that one has whether
it's race or color or gender or wealth
or background or lineage or or political
connection whatever it happens to be a
properly functioning judicial system
doesn't take account of who you are it
simply takes account of the rules that
exist and tries to ensure that that rule
those rules are enforced equally in the
same way with an even hand against
everybody and this so-called well the
data that has been generated is also
predicated on the implicit acceptance of
an equality of outcome doctrine because
the fact that every group isn't equally
represented at outcome is in the data
point that's being used to indicate
systemic racism that's right yeah and so
the so then you also think well what if
you what if you're in a situation where
as a professional and an informed
professional you don't agree with the
with the conclusions drawn from the data
set that there is indication of systemic
racism I mean is that now a belief that
you don't get to have because if you are
forced to write this statement of
principles and alter your conduct then
you're acting out the proposition that
you accept the conclusion that the
reason there are some differences in
representation across groups is because
the enterprise is the whole legal
enterprise is systemically racist and
thereby you're also thereby admitting
your own culpability in relationship to
that
and the corruption of the entire legal
system and that me that you should be
required to admit to that if you don't
agree with it and that's the arc of the
commentary as I mentioned at the outset
is that it started in one place and the
feedback I'm getting now is very much in
that place that people are beginning to
question okay what does it mean the
findings of this report for me
personally and for my industry and and
what does the data say say and people
are digging down on it in fact I just
read an article the other day that said
that there's actually been a doubling in
the representation of racialized
licensees within the industry between
2011 and 2014 you know that's not
something I think a lot of people
Who I regard as a genuine modern-day heroine and a role model for all individuals who desire to speak and embody the truth?
I'll tell you a little bit about her before the discussion starts
Ali born in 1969 is a Somali Dutch American author and scholar
She's received international attention as a critic of Islam and an advocate for the rights and self-determination of Muslim women

former devout Muslim Hirsi Ali left the faith and became a vocal critic of Islam
particularly in its radical forms she collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh in 2004 entitled submission
The film depicted the oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law sparking controversy and threats of death
van Gogh was in fact stabbed to death by Muhammadu Buhari a Moroccan Dutch Islamic terrorist later that year
Hirsi ali maintains that quote Islam is part religion and part a political military
doctrine the part that is a

2010 and most recently heretic
2015 where she calls for a reformation of Islam and the defeat of the Islamists
In 2005 Hirsi Ali was named as one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world
She's also received a free speech award from the Danish newspaper
Jyllands-posten the Swedish Liberal Party's democracy prize and the moral courage award
Her critics accuse Ali of building her career on the denigration of Islam and Muslims
Questioning her right to speak authoritative Lee about Islam, and the Arab world and portraying her as the embodiment of the Western colonial
civilizing mission discourse I
Guess you'll be able to render judgment on that yourself after watching our discussion
The first thing I'd like to say is
Thank you very much for agreeing to do this video. I'm very happy to be talking to you
I've been nervous about it all day actually
Oh please don't be nervous
Anything new she tells me to do.
I see I see, okay, okay, so well
I sent you some questions the other day and
I thought that I would first of all ask you
I read your recent paper the one that you wrote for the Hoover Institute called the challenge of Dawa
And so I thought maybe I'd ask you if you would to begin with just to tell people
If you could give them a brief summary of what you were attempting to accomplish with that that might be a good way to start
So what I was trying to accomplish was to get the attention of
our society especially the government
To the ideology that underlying is the outbursts of terrorism the misogyny against women
homophobia this demand by Islamists who wants to kill and eliminate all homosexuals
The outburst again
of the increase in anti-semitism the persecution of Christians
trying to kill people like me who are apostates who are ex-Muslims and
Draw attention to the venues where these ideas are disseminated these are in schools
It's in the mosque. It's in the madrasa It's in the neighborhood
And it is authorities, you know, imam's
sometimes its Parents
These professionals who say that they are theologians who are telling young people as young as
kindergarten age
how to hate and what to hate and once we understand Dawa once we understand
This commitment to get into the heads and hearts of
People the ideas of radical Islam, then I think that we will be able to deal
Better with the terrorism and symptoms which are the outcomes of it
Dawa is the call to radical Islam. Jihad is an extension of Dawa
that's what I'd like to say Jihad is an extension of Dawa
and for me jihad constitutes the violence the terrorist acts and the political violence thats used to make
that's intended to change
Society but will never be able to eliminate Jihad unless we eliminate Dawa
Okay, so, and what exactly would you say is the relationship between, Dawa
And and jihad, you're formulating it
By the sounds of it that Dawa is the precursor to jihad and are the concepts reasonably separable
And and I guess a subsidiary question of that would be we're talking about radical Islam
But of course many of the people who are watching are going to be, it's going to be difficult for them to
distinguish between moderate Islam and radical Islam
And I'm also curious about your feelings about exactly that distinction and how such a thing might be pursued
So my approach to it is there is one Islam, but there are three sets of Muslims. There is one Islam
That is unreformed and that one Islam
Consists of different components it has a religious component
It has a political component, a social component, but it's all-encompassing
Now if you look at the different sets of Muslims what you see is one set of Muslims who just adhere to the religious
prescriptions, and they see being a Muslim as something private and when they're confronted by others about
The political activists or the bad things that other Muslims do - they invoke the Quran. They invoke the Prophet Muhammad
He's the founder of Islam by mentioning on his life in Mecca
these are the early days when he first started with religion in he is fight persuade people to come to his God and leave theirs and
using along (war and power?)
But then there's that other set of Muslims. I call them the medina Muslims
They're the ones who are waging Jihad they are the ones who are engaged in Dawa
They're the ones who have the objective of subduing the entire world to Islam
They are the ones who hate homosexuals to hate women and who hate non-muslims and to say that it's their
duty to
Die converting people to Islam
I call them the medina Muslims
because they invoke the Prophet Muhammad's life and example and legacy in Medina and
then there's a third group
I call them them the modifiers or the reformers
These are Muslims who are standing up to the medina Muslims
Who are saying within Islam as a civilization, as a culture, as a religion, as a political philosophy?
We have a theological problem, and we have to deal with that theological problem
So this for me these are the three different sets of Muslims
The problem are the medina Muslims they are the ones who are engaged in Dawa. Now we want to differentiate between Dawa and jihad
For the medina Muslims, the Islamists will tell you is, well we first start with Dawa
We call you to Islam, and if you reject it
Then you are an enemy of Islam and the fact that they use violence is your fault you are to blame for it because
in their reasoning which is secular
They are not going to try and convince you with good argument on why Sharia or Islamic law is good for you
good for women, good for non-muslims
Good for gays they are not going to try and bother doing that. They are going to tell you, this is what is in the Quran?
This is what Muhammad said
I am informing
And if you refuse, and this is steps to inform to persuade to call you to invite you,
then they apply force and that force, the application of force, that is Jihad.
But Jihad really, for Medina Muslims means, it's a holy-war against non-muslims
it is to convince non-muslims, convert or die.
There is this other status of purgatory
you know where you have to pay discriminatory taxes
And we lead a life of second-class, third-class citizens if you will. Look at the Christians who live in Egypt
Christians who live in Pakistan Christians who live in other Muslim majority countries it's that kind of status.
So the Mecca / Medina
Distinction seems to be very, I would say both complicated and problematic because so
So tell me if I'm wrong ok because my understanding is that?
Mohammed spent most of the part of his life that was associated with the establishment of Islam in
Medina and not in Mecca and that it wasn't until he went to Medina that Islam actually became a force so back in Mecca
Although his doctrine appears to have been let's say more peaceful
It was also much less successful as a, as a both a religious and a political movement
So then he left Mecca and I believe under pressure from the inhabitants at least to some degree
Moved to Medina and then that's when Islam became more
more rep more
Revolutionary and expansive, and so what do you see, now I know that it isn't
universally accepted among the Islamic community that that Mecca / Medina
distinction is a reasonable one to make because of course the presumption is that there's an essential unity of thought across the doctrines, but
But given given your interpretation, and I've read the similar interpretation among other among other people
Do you see, what you see as hopeful within the Islamic community with regards to bridging the gap between the, say the earlier
works so to speak of Muhammad and the later, the later more
Revolutionary element of the, of his actions and his faith. Is there a way that that can be reconciled
Well, so dividing Muslims into make a set of Mecca set of Medina and modifiers
That's not of course an official
Distinction it's not accepted anywhere. You really want to get to you-know-who
Which individuals, which Muslims
Are at war with us and should we be worried about, what about the vast majority of
Peaceful Muslims, what about these other Muslims who are speaking up, you know, what kind of labels
Do you want to give them? If you study the works of the Islamists what you will notice
I was raised as a Muslim what I think that was the first thing that I noticed is that they're selective, and in their selections
who justify their actions, they rarely invoke Mecca
Or Mohammad's legacy in Mecca
Because as a Muslim if my sister tells me "Ayaan, you've missed a prayer you need to get up an pray"
Won't involve some verse for Mecca and say oh come on
My relationship with Allah is intimate and unique
It's none of your business to tell them what to do
And then she would come up with some other Haddith or some other verse, saying well
But it's might duty to command right and forbid flaw and on and on it goes
So this is the within a Muslim family, but then the Medina Muslims, they extend (???), so it did strike me
And I'm not the only one the other scholars like Muhammad (???) there are many other scholars
Who are Muslim, who believe that they must see a way of preserving Islam
As a tradition, as a culture, as a civilization and at the same time putting to bed this violent
Human rights? violating concepts within Islam
If you try and do that then you're going to see, you're going to make a list of all
The concepts
The derees that we really don't have any problem with, like people being told to pray five times a day or
visit Mecca or fast in the month of Ramadan and all sorts of, you know, religious rituals
I really don't have a problem with that and when I look at where all of that's concentrated
That's in Mecca, it's in the early days. In Medina, as you said, then it turned into a political philosophy, it becomes a military creed
Mohammed wages wars, he leads them, he elects others to lead and that's exactly when Islam becomes
Successful and Islamists of today are trying to, they're trying to emulate that power
And then say so explicitly, they write it 
 and they are proud to be
You know to be emulating Mohammed in this way, so that's I think
When you say, you know, the Mecca / Medina is problematic. I think any kind of
Classification that we apply in social sciences has its problems
But one sort of simplifies because it focuses our attention where it should be
Okay, so you see this as an externally applied
Category system essentially, that's useful. That's useful for, outsiders who are trying to assess the situation
To determine who it is that you're dealing with that might be regarded as an ally and who it is that you're dealing with that might
Be regarded as a foe so to speak and that would be on the more militant end of things
That's a reasonable way of looking at it?
That's reasonable. That's a reasonable way of looking at it, but also if you take the moderate versus extreme classification or categorization
That has become commonplace
It doesn't tell you when we look at moderate we think of people who are not using violence
Whereas if you look at Medina you will see that there are
hundreds of thousands of Muslims
Who do not apply violence now
But who do preach violence and they do preach the Medina legacy and they believe that Sharia should be
Instituted and in places where they get, where you get a majority of these non-violent Medina types
then suddenly they start applying and enforcing sharia law.
So I think in the terms moderate and extreme are just not good enough
They don't cover the...
Right well and they also don't they don't also seem to bear any relationship to the internal dynamics of the faith itself so that that's also problematic
okay, so
You have to keep going back to the theology have to keep going back to the internal debates among Muslims
on how to move, how to move on and how to relate to the rest of the world.
So I personally think Mecca and Medina is much more useful as a tool, as an external conceptual framework for understanding the
Problem we face with Islam, then extreme versus moderates and all the 
other, you know, all the other terms that we have
Okay, so let me ask you another question about that then so, see one of the problems that I've had because I've been trying to look at
The potential for a true relationship between Islam and Christianity you know to the degree that I understand Islam or Christianity which of course
There's plenty to understand about both, so it's no easy thing to manage, but there is this claim as well that
that's widespread and rather vague that that Islam is in essence a religion of peace and but when I look at the
historical data say stemming from the Medina
The Medina time and then moving forward and the fact that Mohammad was definitely someone who engaged
personally in warfare and in an expansionist warfare
It's not an easy thing for me to make the leap to to
Comprehending or being able to accept the claim that the fundamental doctrines of Islam are peaceful
Or are associated with peace because it looks to me like there's an element of it. That's quite militaristic, and I've also thought that
Let's say, there's a religious element to Islam, and I mean this is not an original thought obviously, there's a religious element Islam
But there's also something that's clearly more like a political movement and more like a governmental movement
And that's also
Complicated by the fact that there isn't any clear separation between church and state in Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell so
When we hear claims that, or when claims are made that Islam is essentially a religion of peace
Then that doesn't seem to be the case with the Medina end
Of the theological discourse or the actions that emerge thereof and then part of the problem is how do you reconcile that with the
Contradictions in relationship to the earlier as you say Meccan doctrines
And it isn't clear to me how that can be done so...
Medina muslims see Islam as a political creed that the believers should enforce, are obligated to enforce so number one they argue
In that conditions they fight, that Muhammad in Mecca did not give the Meccans a choice
He didn't say oh you can have your gods like
and you know, I have my God. His message was you guys are worshiping false Gods
These are idols, you live in a time of ignorance, and I have come as a last messenger
To convey to you
you know, the light
and enlightenment and come with me
Now what is peaceful in his actions in Mecca, it's not the message that is peaceful
it's the fact that he didn't apply force, he didn't put together a militia and
Attack the Meccans that which he described as a polytheists and unbelievers
in Medina he does that.
As in Medina, as he wins war after war
The numbers of Muslims increase, and these are people who come to [be] Muslim by force
Then he says everywhere where people accept Islam
That is peaceful. So the definition of peace in Islam is only after you accept Islam as long as you refuse to
abide by Islamic law or
Accept to be subdued by Islam, you are at war
That's why they the Medinans make this distinction between the house of Islam, feasts
And the house of war, (right) and the house of war is everywhere where there are infidels
And it's the job of the Muslims in the house of peace to convert them
So it's a religion of peace insofar as its final utopian aim is the cessation of conflict?
but it's the cessation of conflict in part as a consequence of conquest
Absolutely
Ok yeah, yeah
Well that was more or less how I understood it so
When the claim is made that it's a religion of peace, then that isn't precisely
It's it's a sleight of hand in some sense with regard specifically to that phrase
There are individuals, [the] ones I described as Mecca who are saying
When they say Islam is peace what they really want to say is, I am a peaceful individual
And I have no problems with other religions and
I do not want to be engaged in any politics of any sort or to link politics with religion, please leave me alone
Right right right and that I would say would be the majority of Muslims worldwide
I'm not sure you agree with that
But it seems to me that it isn't
Self-evidently the case that the majority of human beings are violent and warlike and so my sense is is that
given the essential peace
peacefulness of most people they're going to take a look at the Islamic doctrine and extract from it those elements that are
Supportive of that more individual peace, but that still leaves open the question of exactly
What the doctrine means as a set of
motivational principles and that seems to be a big part of the current problem and also the need for
Current discourse what I would hope is that it would be possible to undertake a dialogue with Islam
Let's say between Islam
and the West or between Islam and
judeo-christianity and to find within Islam itself the seeds that would enable that dialogue to occur so that some sort of long-term
Negotiated conceptual and practical peace could be attained, but the more I've read about Islam the more difficult
It is for me to understand how that might be managed especially because of its
well, because of the warlike tradition that emerged from Medina and then moved outward at a staggering rate from that
and also the thing that's quite disconcerting to me, I mean
It's not like Christianity hasn't been rife with internal divisions like that between the Protestants and the Catholics
But I mean it also was the case that
What you might describe as the civil war that's been occurring within Islam
More or less started, as far as I can tell, more or less started the day that Muhammad died and has never stopped since then and
That also seems to be, well obviously it's a problem for the Islamic community itself
But it also seems to be a problem, an increasing problem for the West because we can't not be tangled up in that
Yeah, we have to share the planet with one fifth of humanity
And it's very clear that things have to change and that is duty of Muslims to change the theological
underpinnings of their religion
And as far as I'm concerned. This is being pushed by those that I call reformers or modifiers. (Yeah)
And these are Individuals, who maybe now a little bigger in their groups
They're forming groups, and maybe even being led by some nation states, the leaders of countries
Who are pushing for that change
The big question is are they going to agree on what to change, so what is inbuilt into Islam is this idea
that you cannot argue with God. You cannot unsubmit
And edit to the Quran and it's the same thing you know Mohammed was
Is seen by Muslims as infallible (Yeah)
As someone who never made a mistake so it's an uphill battle for those Muslims inside Islam, who were seeking
modernization, who are seeking reform
to
Agree on, you know, how to edit God how toughest to pursuade Muslims to accept
a truly peaceful
(Right) and a truly tolerant idea of religion that separates religion from politics respects the rights of women
respects the rights or people of other faiths and people within Islam who want to leave their faiths, so
How do you get the theological underpinnings for that? (Yeah)
That's the big button within Islam.
Well yeah, and the danger there too
Is that, I mean, when that sort of thing is attempted, often, reform from within a religious community, one of the dangers there is that
Instead of reforming it peacefully all you do is add another sect to the conflict
Yeah for us secular people it seems from from a distance, It seems kind of easy to say well why don't they just separate
Religion from politics and then people 
who want to be religious, they can be religious
But to look at it that way is simplistic because
Then you get people who want to be religious, this Medina subset, who want to say
For a medina Muslim, an expression of his Muslim-ness is to convert you to Islam
(Yeah) to kill me as an apostate. It's to get women to cover up. It's to keep warning us about life after death and all of that.
It's the thing that's that made me, I would say nervous to some degree from the perspective of someone
who analyzes totalitarian ideology because the thing about
Totalitarian ideology is it tends to be totalitarian, right? It's all absolutely
all-consuming and (yeah)
That's that's why
also when I've been assessing because, I've done a fair bit of research into comparative religion and done my best to
Expand my knowledge base
And I've always had a hard time
With Islam in that regard because it's difficult for me to extract out the purely religious elements and to compare them to
Let's say religious sentiments that have emerged across, across humankind in all sorts of different times and eras and to separate that from the political
Doctrine and sometimes I'm tempted to think more that
Islam
You know, broadly and vaguely speaking, is something much more like a political movement than it is in fact like a religious movement
It is a political theory and it's a political movement it started out
Even in Mecca in the early days come to my god, which was a political message
It wasn't just a religious message (Right) even in the early days in Mecca it was absolutist, Islam by its nature is
Absolutist because it seeks complete and total
Submission of the individual to God and in Medina Muhammad then came around with a political
blueprint for how society ought to live the relationship between the individual and God
The relationship between men and women, husband and wife, the relationship between parent and child, the relationship between the government
the kalif
However you want to pronounce it
And the subjects and their duties, it has a court system
It has a military system. So from it's very beginnings
Islam was more of a political theory than it was
A religion as we understand religion today. Jesus Christ founded his religion within an empire the Roman Empire existed
Before and what he was talking about was all religion
Whereas Muhammad founded an empire we forget that.
Yes right, that's a very important distinction
I mean it really might be the crucial distinction, so to speak
Definitely the crucial distinction, and there was this Empire and this empire grows and declined and fell and those who feel that
They have inherited that legacy, they want to go back to the days of empire
(Yeah) they want to go back the days when, you know, Islam was supreme and
They want to do this in the 21st century when wanting all kinds
it's not just that you can't come on horseback and invade
An existing empire in decline like the Byzantine or like, you know, old Rome and
Some of these Indian empires that they took over, you could just take things it's not like that, but they're driven
They're convinced
They have this legacy,
and they're not afraid of death.
and that is key because, and here's why I keep going back to Dawa
all Muslim children learn that life on this earth is temporary
(Yeah) That it is transitory and that there is something in the hereafter. This is no point in investing in this life
Except in a religious sense, so for the Medina Muslims
It really becomes easy to recruit and inspire into their ranks
Muslims who have already been taught that
They've only got to work for the Hereafter
there are problems with Islam, and I think if, once we understand of course the basic elements of
Mohammed's role, the role of the Quran, the role of the Hereafter. All of these things and what Sharia law really means
And then we get to the Dawa part this is how do they manage to teach?
Young people how do they manage to teach all of these thousands and millions of people, who is subsidizing this?
Countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait etc. Once we understand that I think then
It makes our job as westerners, western governments, whatever, easier.
Let's talk about the Saudis for a minute, the elephant under the Western carpet
I mean I understand that in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the 1970s one of the things that
Dictated American foreign policy was the desire to maintain stable oil production and I can understand that although I think it was short-sighted, I can
I can see the logic in that
But it's very difficult for me to see that in any possible way the Saudis can be regarded as true allies of the West
and so I don't understand why we have the
Relationship that we do have with the Saudis given first of all that we're pumping
literally trillions of dollars every, about every decade into their economy and then given that they practice a particularly pernicious
Form of, I would say viciously militant, Islam and second, or third I guess that is, is that they're pumping out
Propaganda that pushes this Wahhabi viewpoint in massive doses everywhere in the world
I mean
I don't understand and maybe this is also part of your perplexity with regards to Western attitudes towards
towards the complex problem of Islam, I don't understand why
The West doesn't do more to put a stop to that and so what are your thoughts about that how does it look to you?
I'm perplexed
I believe that the Saudis have put the United States and other Westerners under their spell
And someone has to come along and break that spell
I mean I agree with everything you said
Within Saudi Arabia there are, I believe, at least three forces, the royal family, who I believe
Now they want to be more secular and more modern
They want to go down the path of the UAE
Then there is the clergy.
Incredibly powerful, maybe even more powerful than the royal family, because
The Clergy in Saudi Arabia
They have the power to put into people's, you know, heads and hearts
the Wahhabi doctrine
and so, They're all about.. in Saudi Arabia
The people who decide what's right and what's wrong
Morally, are the clergy. (Right) They are that powerful. And then you have the tribes the various tribes who obviously
depending on their size
Can either empower the royal family or the clergy or both. There's a dynamic there
that is very interesting to watch, but in that sense
Saudi Arabia has used and has indulged and accommodated the clergy, not only to establish
this Wahabbi doctrine, which is pure Medina legacy, Saudi Arabia is a theocracy (Yeah) its pure Medina.
Not only inside the borders of Saudi Arabia, but across the entire world.
(Yeah) and now I think we the United States and other countries need to demand
From the Saudi royal family because they're the ones who are the political,  at least
The political individuals that we deal with and sit across from at the table, to demand  and say you know we need a divorce
Between the house of our south and the house of our (???)
Because these clergy people are really destroying the planet
They, you just, you have to think through what these people have done in South Asia in Africa
All over the world it's the duty of
Theocracy like Saudi Arabia to commit a part of its wealth to the spread of Islam
(Yes) and to the strengthening of Islam, that's pure Dawa that is through institutions
And this is this is their foreign policy we probably could refer that to a soft power
That's where the soft power goes, but that if you look at what is happening all these terrorist
activities across the world
People wanting Sharia back all of this Saudi Arabia is behind it, and I think it's time that (Yeah) we wake up to that.
Yeah, okay, so let me run a theory by you. It's kind of a two-fold theory so one is that
there's a paternalistic attitude in the west towards the Saudis that stems from perhaps events that were as
Far back as a hundred years ago, and the paternalistic aspect is to underestimate them as enemies
Right, because you say well we could say well
We need the oil and we're gonna stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather not have chaos in Saudi Arabia
And so a known dictator is better than unknown chaos and I mean we saw
Some proof of that perhaps in what happened with Libya, but so the idea would be
There's nothing sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis to justify us
destabilizing their regime especially when we're particularly dependent on their oil. And then underneath that would be an
Underestimation of the danger of ideas and also especially when ideas are combined with money, it's something like that
So because the Saudis in some sense
I think are fighting what you might regard as a stealth war against the West and they're doing it by convincing
Upcoming generations of the rightness of their particular viewpoint, and so they're in it for the long haul in some sense
And I think we're radically under estimating the danger of that
They're waging and idealogical war and we're not (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They're waging and idealogical war,  we're not, I mean you have to think of when the Soviet Union was around
If we hadn't done anything in response if we had only viewed that in economic terms or in military terms, yeah
And that is our way, not just Saudi Arabia there is Qatar there is Kuwait
There is even Iran, you know, these countries are waging an ideological war and we are not because here
They believe well, It's religion and religion is protected and you know we don't talk about religion
That's one thing we believe
We're under the spell of these
incredibly charming Saudis that come to attend our
Universities that have their embassies here and business leaders and that we are sure as their more westernized than we are
Yeah, well you can tell that by how they treat their women
Yeah, so in a way, I think again
I just keep going back to saying we are under some sort of spell
And at some point you know someone has to come and break that spell (Yeah)
through more globalization, through you know
As Saudi Arabia opens up to the world economy we really see with our eyes, what goes on inside their own country and inside
Not just Saudi Arabia, all these other countries
It's the American people, the Canadian people, Western people who should say no
To this and demand from their governments that they engage with Saudi Arabia in a different way.
Yeah, well one of the things I really can't figure out. Maybe you could shed some light on this too
Is that you know of all the things that women's political movements should be doing in the West is
Demanding, as far as I can tell, that the Western countries
Let's say led by their male rulers stop treating the Saudis like are they're our allies, and I cannot understand why there hasn't been
Concerted pressure put on Western governments by women who are concerned, at least in principle, with the
equality and freedom of women around the world to
stop treating the Saudis like they're our allies and so, that's another thing that perplexes me entirely and the
Cynical part of me thinks that the feminists who are more or less hell bent on the destruction of the Western
Patriarchy, adopt the attitude that the enemy of my enemy is my friend
And so they're willing to put up with what the Saudis do
But I don't think that's a sufficient explanation so, like, and I mean you can view our
culture so to speak a little bit from from the outside position because you've moved in as an immigrant and and that gives you a
Viewpoint that that it's much more difficult for someone within it to share and so like what do you see as driving the
Absence of pressure, let's say from women on governments in relationship to these, I would say, reprehensible dictatorships
What's going on?
So the feminists who are pre-occupied with
Western patriarchy, with the white man's patriarchy, what I see is that they have
first of all that's all that they're focused only they do not talk about discuss raise the issue of
men of color and the patriarchy of men of color, of immigrants of
the nations and countries men in nations and countries outside of the West.
Number two these femenists have also bought into the identity politics
They've bought into cultural relativism
They've bought into Multiculturalism
And all these things are bad for women bad for Western women and bad for all women
So if you believe, take multiculturalism for instance, that all cultures are equal and that
One person of one culture, the white culture, should have nothing to say about the culture of Islam or, you know,
Since it's, they're all sort of equal then
They feel that they can't use
their institutional power
To pressure our government to address the patriarchy of the outside
They believe that if black women and Muslim women and, you know, women of color if they wanted to get out of
Oppression then they should organize themselves that's what they believe.
What I find ironic though is that sometimes when we do organize ourselves?
I am organized with other ex-Muslim women to talk about the misogyny, that's
Subjected to women in the name of Islam
I get it from white femenists
White feminist atheists, and that to me is the biggest puzzle ever
I know well I think that the treatment that you've received at the hand of Western feminists to me
That's something that's just absolutely...
it leaves me absolutely speechless because
Not only me, it's all of us who are fighting...
Again like just only two ex-muslims, but they're black women who are fighting for their rights and they all get shut down
So we were talking about your treatment at the hands. Let's say of Western feminists, and like I read infidel
I Don't know, very shortly after you published it which and I loved that book man as soon as I read that I thought
Well, I you know use...
Which book which book? I missed that.
Infidel
(Infidel yeah) yeah, yeah, you know I thought it was remarkable
I thought your comment or your comments on viewing Western culture from the perspective of an immigrant that was hungry for
genuine education and and your comments on your experience
With the efficiency of the Dutch state say and you're sort of amazement
at how well it worked that was just, I thought that was so remarkable and clear-headed
And I thought when I read Infidel
I thought, well look this woman is immediately going to be a hero to feminists everywhere because she's removed herself from this
oppressive state and moved out into the world and become a powerful figure when what was the
Probability of that it was like zero, you know, and then you suffered as a consequence of your beliefs
And and you stood up forthrightly for them, and I thought if you wanted to find a feminist hero that you're certainly
You're certainly in the running man for exactly that, and then to see how you've been treated
Is just, it just makes my jaw drop you know that your dis...
Especially what Brandeis did, it was Brandeis right where you were offered an honorary PhD and then they revoked it? That just (Yeah)
that was one of the, I think that was almost as reprehensible an act of cowardice as the West's basic abandonment of
Salman Rushdie after the fatwa was put on his head and about equally dangerous
(So)I think it was multicultural
I mean what I...
You know my message my life story who I am it's a
Defiance of the prevalent trends of today, it's against relativism. I believe that Western values are
superior to Islamic law and Islamic values now to say that is to blaspheme in the temples of
multiculturalism today right and, I think I
(wrote it for a lot of people?) because it wasn't about what they think should happen for
victims of misogyny I think it's all about the dissonance that my words and my life and
My beliefs the kind of dissonance they put these women in because if you're going around saying well
It's horrible to be an American woman ,and the misogyny in America is worse than that in Afghanistan
And I can't rather I say no it's not
(Right) you know, I, I'm
Im sort of Interfering with their worldview.
so today I'm talking to two of my
compatriots I suppose in this ongoing
discussion in Canada about free speech
issues including compelled speech and I
met Jared brown and Bruce party
Jared's a practicing lawyer and Bruce is
a professor at Queen's University in the
law school there and I met them both
when we were when we manifested a mutual
interest last year in bill C 16 which we
all regarded as a piece of legislation
that was infringing on the rights to
free speech of Canadian individuals in a
manner that hadn't been ever attempted
before and more recently the Law Society
of Upper Canada soon to be known as the
Law Society of Ontario has put forward a
requirement for all of its members so
all of the lawyers in Ontario to produce
a document of principle that we all have
been talking about the three of us have
been talking about that we regard as a
another but far more egregious example
of compelled speech so I'm going to let
Jared introduce himself and say a little
bit about who he is
he testified with me at the Canadian
Senate last year and Bruce party also
testified at the Senate on Bill c16 and
Bruce was also the lawyer that I debated
he played devil's advocate at Queen's
University of some of you watching this
will be familiar with that video so
Jared oh let you introduce yourself and
then Bruce and then Bruce Bruce recently
wrote a column for the now she will post
on this new requirement by the Law
Society and so we're going to let him
begin the discussion proper on to you
Jared I'm an everyday litigator I'm a
commercial litigator in Toronto I've
been practicing for about 15 years doing
increasingly more and more human race
tribunal work things like that and
obviously stepped into the breach on c16
and as far as I can tell I may have been
the only practicing lawyer that
actually spoke out against the
legislation there were certainly a lot
of lawyers including the Canadian Bar
Association that were arraigned in favor
of the legislation but as far as I can
tell boots on the ground I think I was
the only one so I've got a pretty benign
practice but but certainly have taken up
the fight of people Bruce thanks for
well this this issue arose for me a
couple of weeks ago when I received an
email from the Law Society and all
lawyers get these emails to do various
things but this was different because it
announced a new requirement for this
year now Jared I think was aware of this
developing but before I was but but like
many other lawyers in the province this
is was the first indication that this
new requirement existed and essentially
the email said but one of the things
that said amongst others was that every
licensed lawyer now is required to draft
and submit what they are calling a
statement of principles and that
statement is is required to express your
agreement and the value you place on
inclusion diversity and equality and the
fact that you will actively promote
those values and that's me just sprung
off the screen as a radius example of
forced speech of the same kind that we
were talking about under ability 16 but
but worse this one actually requires you
to make a full-fledged statement that
will be subject to their approval in
order to maintain your license in other
words this is not a matter of it being
suggested to you that you might also
want to do this this is a condition of
your ability to practice law in the
province of Ontario so this destruct me
as a matter that needed to be a
publicly I needed to be discussed
amongst lawyers in the province because
this is a a slow march to a dark place I
think and that's where it all began
yeah well it was concerning to me when I
encountered this I mean I'm the member
of a college as well a college of
psychologists and my sense of this is
that if the lawyers fall stand and and
go along with this the probability that
this will be required of every
professional in Ontario and then very
rapidly every professional in Canada is
extremely high because if the lawyers
who are you know a relatively
disagreeable Bunch and who are very
familiar with the law and with common
law in general are willing to have their
political beliefs dictated to them by
their college then the probability that
the rest of us will be able to withstand
that I think is extremely low well as
strong a strong independent bar is
always supposed to be the defense or at
least one line of defense against
tyranny or against government overreach
and and by having the lawyers through
under the guise of their regulatory body
being compelled to speak or or share
opinions it's obviously something scary
and I think it's something that lawyers
should wake up to and they need to push
back against compelled speech which was
obviously the issue on c16 is a
particularly nefarious infringement and
intrusion yeah well I mean it's one
thing to put restrictions on what people
can say I mean I know you can't insight
someone to crime for example but it's a
completely different thing to require
people to espouse a particular political
stance especially when when it's being
reviewed by what's essentially an
arbitrary committee and and when the
punishment is socha as draconian as us
potentially losing your right to
practice and that that's enforced as a
mandatory like the first step was to
make that mandatory rather than as a
suggestion and so let's let's just
emphasize at this point the distinction
between restrictions on speech which
which are not good things and hour
debatable and so on but this is a
category impression this is compelled
speech this is a requirement that makes
you say something you may not agree with
and as I mentioned it'll be in the
column a statements from the Supreme
Court of Canada and maybe I'll just read
out one of those just just to make the
point because even the court has said
explicitly that that this is this is not
on in a in a free society you're here
the words of the Supreme Court forcing
someone to express opinions that they do
not have is to Tala terian and as such
alien to the tradition of free nations
like Canada even for the repression of
the most serious crimes which of course
is not in question here yeah that was
sorry Jordan that was that was the
cornerstone of not only the opinion
piece that I I put up on my website
about c16 but also in the cornerstone of
the presentation that was made to the
Senate is that this is a particularly
egregious infringement on freedom of
expression you're having to mouth
opinions and ideas that may not be your
own and the government is forcing you to
do it and obviously in this instance
you've got your regulatory body which
which holds your license in your ability
to carry on the livelihood in the chosen
profession that you're in telling you
that you've got to start voicing these
opinions so Jared wouldn't we talked
before to one of the things that you
pointed out and Bruce you had commented
on this as well is that you know the the
Law Society Administration theoretically
did some background work before deciding
that this was a necessity and they
produced a report essentially
proclaiming that the law people who are
practicing law in Ontario are
essentially racist in their orientation
which is why this this racist and
perhaps misogynist as well which is why
this piece of administrative let's call
it law or requirements has come into
practice but it isn't obvious that their
own data support that conclusion I mean
you can easily read what they wrote as
pretty providing pretty compelling
evidence that the legal profession the
demographics of
legal profession for what that's worth
you are transforming quite rapidly and
so the the thing that concerned me as
well from a psychological perspective
about this sort of thing is that lawyers
who agreed to participate in this
process are basically admitting their
racism and misogyny on a conscious and
unconscious basis as their by convicting
themselves like they're they're guilty
to begin with they and they don't have
an opportunity to prove their innocence
and by by going along with these
requirements they're basically admitting
through their action that the
accusations that are being thrown at
them both individually and as a
collective are are not only accurate but
require immediate remediation yeah well
I mean the the Rekha or the requirement
that's being rolled out right now is the
result of a I think it's about a 58 page
report that had 13 recommendations that
were passed by convocation which is the
governing body of the Law Society and
the report itself was entitled
strategies to address issues of systemic
racism I mean that statement on its own
is saying that our industry as well as
the law society organization itself is
systemically racist and and clearly
that's a to me I'm you know it's a very
bold statement and one that I think
requires some level of scrutiny you know
that the group that came up with this
report is an esteemed group these are
all highly respected well accomplished
individuals and and you know there is a
body of data that they've produced as
well as some qualitative anecdotal
stories as to some of the the issues
that are being faced by by what they
call racialized licensees I mean the
data is something that a lot of people
aren't going to look at but I do
encourage people to look at it and and
see what what the basis on that finding
that we're a systemic ly racist industry
and an obviously profession I encourage
people to look at it study the report I
can assure you that most most lawyers
won't 58 pages
something that happened back in December
but it there's there's a lot of shocking
information in there and there's
obviously some shocking findings but ya
know it's it's got me concerned because
my my industry has now been deemed
racist by the body that governs it yeah
one of the things that's really
appalling about that and I think and
also about the requirements for the
statement of principles is that there's
a pronounced ideological bent to them
and the first is the idea of systemic
racism because the way that you prove
systemic racism is is I would say let's
say call it questionable method
logically to say the least because the
basic concept is is that you divide the
population up by racial ethnic and sex
based identification which you can do in
a very large number of ways by the way
and then you compare any organization to
that population-based division and if
the the ratio of individuals categorized
in the general population isn't the same
as the ratio of individuals in that
profession then you can automatically
make a case for systemic racism and
that's a very very weak methodology no
credible scientist would regard that and
I go we would regard that as proof of
anything and worse I can't imagine that
anything any claim like that would stand
up in something resembling a court of
law if you know if it was possible to
take a group to court because there's
all sorts of reasons why there might be
differential representation in a group
and that and that is assuming that
that's what the data shows and in many
respects this actually not what this
data shows so I take your point about
the methodology but but even so even if
you accept that methodology it's not
crystal clear that that's what the
numbers actually suggest when I get back
for a moment to your to your implication
point I mean I agree that that the
requirement to make this statement in
this context essentially could be
interpreted as though you are required
to make a confession about what it is
you've done wrongly in the past and what
it is you will do now in the present
to correct it as an individual and there
is also the the trouble that once you
have written the statement so as to
comply with the requirement then you
have on the record a statement of what
it is that you believe and thereafter
your future actions can be compared to
that statement so as to show that you
are not acting in compliance with what
you have said you believe or that on one
occasion or the other you haven't been
telling the truth so some some I've
heard some lawyers say in response to
this requirement that oh well so this is
not a big deal because I'm just gonna
write the statement they'll put it in
the file
and sit in some corner of the law
society computer and who cares it's no
big deal
but it actually it is a very big deal
because there they are hurting you
towards both a certain way to think a
certain way to express yourself and in a
certain restriction on your behavior and
your expression in terms of how you what
you say you believe in in the future
about this kind of law and right but
also you're subscribing to this idea
that the system is racist that the that
the industry and the profession
themselves are racist and that to me
that implies hopelessly corrupt and that
shocks me and I don't think I want my
industry advertising that unless of
course you know we've got an issue here
and and it's not entirely clear to me
from reading the report that we do but I
mean Jordan may have some comments
obviously about writing writing a
statement and a declaration and what
that means but I just find that you know
having to affirm in a statement that our
industry is is hopelessly corrupt is
it's not something I'm willing to do at
this point well over the last year is
that apologizing or admitting guilt to
ideologue this is an unbelievably
dangerous thing to do
because all it's taken as as Bruce
basically alluded to is a statement of
guilt and you know the other problem
from a psychological perspective is that
and this this there's a very clear
psychological literature on this so know
if you have a particular
set of philosophical positions let's say
principles let's call them and maybe
your principles are something like
excellence meritocracy and honesty which
strike me as a better set of principles
for lawyers than diversity and equity
and inclusiveness not that those aren't
you know in in certain context and
carefully defined also important if you
write a statement of principle
especially one that's going to have to
pass muster then what will happen is you
will bring your beliefs and your actions
in line with that statement of principle
you'll do that unconsciously and there's
a bunch of reasons for that and one
reason is is that you've now made a
coherent and credible argument in favor
of that set of principles and you will
find that convincing because
articulating yourself in that manner
actually changes your character and the
second is is that it puts you in into a
position that's that's that's often
being described as cognitive dissonance
which is one of the most famous findings
in in psychology and cognitive
dissonance is the unpleasant feeling
that you get when you're holding two
opposing beliefs let's say at the same
time and you notice that and so the
cognitive dissonance here would be well
I'm just gonna write this statement of
principles what difference does it make
however that is a statement of
principles and so it's it's
intrinsically dishonest and and
character damaging to craft a statement
of principles with which you do not
agree and so then you can either regard
yourself as a coward and a liar or you
can bring your thinking in line with the
statement of principles and that if the
latter thing is what people tend to do
and so and then the idea that this is
just gonna sit in some musty file drawer
that's completely that's completely
naive in my estimation because basically
what's happening and I've seen this
happening with the creep of ethics
committees on the university campuses is
that once you decide that you're guilty
and that you're going to abide by a new
set of principles it now becomes
incumbent on the law society as a matter
of the intrinsic logic of the of the
movement to do things like check you out
on a year
your basis to see how your attitude and
behavior is actually in keeping with
your statement of principles it's not
just gonna hang there in the air it's
gonna be in the forest yes and that is
part of the transition I would say from
the Law Society regulating competence
regulating values I mean it used to be
at one point that the law study was
there to make sure that you had the
skills to be able to practice law and as
time has gone on they're there they're
overseeing is more and more in the area
of what it is that you think and whether
or not that thinking is appropriate and
one good comparison of this is the the
case involving the Trinity Western law
school the the graduates of that laws
because it is a private let's go out in
virtue and they require all their all
their faculty and students to sign on to
a pledge that contains certain values
they promise not to do certain things
like have premarital sex and all kinds
of other things the Law Society on the
basis I think that it is inappropriate
for an institution to impose values upon
to people within it have said that they
will not license graduates from that law
school
now you might agree or disagree with
that perspective but it is hypocritical
now that what they have done is the same
thing essentially except with the
different set of values they have indeed
impose a sentence on the people within
their own institution it's just that
they haven't chosen different values
which means that their objection to turn
your question was not really at all
about the imposition of the values they
just don't like the values the attorney
Western chose right yeah well it's
pretty ironic that the argument would be
made that an organization doesn't have
the right to impose its values on its
own it's voluntary participants which we
should point out because you certainly
don't have to go to Trinity Western or
signers agreement there's lots of law
schools you can go to whereas in this
particular situation you're basically I
mean to say that a gun is pointed to
your head is too dramatic obviously but
it's no joke to be faced with it with
the threat of losing your license and
also to have to undergo what would
essentially be a bureaucratic
Inquisition and those are not pleasant
those are seriously not pleasant if you
if you fail to comply no one there's
other there's other parts of us before
we leave turn your weapon can we just
underline what you just said which i
think is very important which is that
that the law society is essentially an
arm of the state it has coercive power
given to it by the state to license
lawyers and it is the gatekeeper so you
have no choice whereas as as you said
during the the association with Trinity
Western it's entirely voluntary if you
don't want to go to that school you
don't know that school and so it's it's
it's it's ironic in the extreme that it
is the law Society which is that which
has imposed such a requirement in
circumstances that is much more
objectionable than the Trinity Western
situation
yeah well it's it's quite it's quite
disconcerting to me to say the least
Hi everyone so
I'm making an announcement today, and I suppose you might regard it as an advertisement
So I'm warning you to begin with because I don't want you to waste your time if you're not
interested in listening to a description of the newest thing that we've created so we
Just put up a website called understand myself calm, and it's a personality assessment for individuals
And it's based on a personality model that was developed in my lab about
Ten years ago by dr. Colin D. Young and
Lean dr. Lena quilty dr. De young is now a professor at the University of, Minnesota
And it was based on some ideas that I had been developing with another former student of mine dr.
Daniel Higgins who's a partner with me and this enterprise along with my former graduate supervisor dr. Robert Peel from McGill University?
It's based on the Big Five personality model which measures extraversion
which is a positive emotion dimension and is associated with gregariousness and
enthusiasm and assertiveness and sociability and that sort of thing and
A trait called neuroticism which is basically negative emotionality
Which is associated with a proclivity towards anxiety and emotional pain?
Agreeableness which is compassion and politeness and so agreeable people are I would say broadly speaking rather maternal in their orientation
They tend to care more for others than for themselves
They're more cooperative than competitive whereas so-called disagreeable people are more competitive and more
Brusque I would say and perhaps more straightforward and more able to stand up for themselves as well
Conscientiousness is another one of the dimensions. That's orderliness and industriousness and
the last dimension is opens to experience which is a combination of interest in ideas, which is often known as intellect and
Interest in aesthetics and which is associated
let's say with creativity and that's the dimension that's also most highly correlated with IQ we developed the big five aspect scale in an
Attempt to take the big five so that's extraversion neuroticism agreeableness conch justice and openness to experience
Which are the canonical dimensions of personality?
We developed the big5 aspect scale in order to break down those big five traits each of them into their two most
Statistically robust sub components and we call those aspects
And that's actually become a pretty popular personality model the scientific paper which announced that
statistical division has accrued about
750 citations which is an awful lot of citations by the way for a scientific paper it makes it into a kind of classic
Especially because it's only also only had ten years to accrue
Citations and a citation is when some other scientist refers to the paper in one of their papers by the way
anyways
I've been working over the last couple of years to generate really detailed
personality reports on each of the big five traits and the ten aspects at about seven different levels of
Specificity ranging from extremely low to extremely high, and we think we've produced what might be the most comprehensive and accurate
Personality reports that are currently available you answer a hundred questions in order to complete the personality survey
The questions themselves are actually public access or you could call them open source
They were derived from Lew Goldberg's IP IP international personality item pool
They're the consequence of many many decades of attempts to
Define a set of phrases that most
comprehensively and also most concisely captures the variation in human personality and
So you can find those questions many places on the line, but the reports themselves and the comparison sample of approximately
10,000 people are
Proprietary and constitute the central element of value in in our offering essentially and what we're hoping is that people can use this
personality test site to develop a much deeper understanding of themselves so that they know what they're like especially compared to others and
That they can also compare themselves to anyone else for example who might have taken the test and see the thing about
Personality is that the differences between people actually run quite deep
There's a lot of individual variability, so there are people who are extreme extraverted
They want to spend every moment of their time
Socializing with other people and there are people who are very introverted, and they want to work alone
And they find interactions with with large groups of people or even small groups sometimes quite tiring
And they have to spend a lot of time recovering they tend to be much more quiet. They're not necessarily
Shy because that shyness is more
Consequence of variation on the second dimension neuroticism and so people are high in neuroticism I feel much more anxiety and emotional pain
per unit of uncertainty and stress than people who are very low in neuroticism who are
Often known as emotionally stable and who tend to be quite imperturbable
Agreeable people as I mentioned before are warm and compassionate and and very much care for other people
but are also likely to be taken advantage of and to feel a certain amount of resentment whereas disagreeable people are tough and straightforward and
competitive and out for victory, but can also be somewhat self-centered and harsh and then
Conscientious people are hardworking and dutiful conscientiousness is a really good predictor of long-term life success especially in
Academic attainment where it's second only to IQ and also in managerial and administrative
jobs that require attention to detail and a fair bit of
Responsibility let's say and routine work
Open this to experience
That's the creativity dimension and some people are extremely high and openness to experience
And they want to do nothing but discuss ideas and and spend their time in creative and artistic pursuits
And other people are more conservative because low openness is associated with conservatism
And they're not really interested in novel ideas, and they don't think abstractly that often
And they're they're not out for new experiences or flights of fantasy or imaginative
Exercises or any of that thing there are a lot more concrete and practical
Now the reports that we've prepared not only provide you with information about all of the aforementioned big five traits
They also break each one down into its dual aspects. So there's actually 15 different sources of information
that are contained in the reports and so for extraversion you get a
Description of the degree to which you're assertive, which means forthcoming let's say in public and willing to put your opinions forward
And enthusiasm which is a more pure marker of positive emotion and the capacity to look forward to and enjoy
events and situations
Spontaneously and with neuroticism you learn about the trait aspects
withdrawal and volatility and withdrawal is the tendency to be
Stymied or or stopped. Let's say by fear to be frozen in some sense like a prey animal and
Volatility is an aspect
That's associated with irritability and the tendency to be easily rubbed the wrong way
Let's say and to react emotionally to that and then for agreeableness
There's two aspects and one is compassion, which means pretty much what it says
it's the ability to embody the feelings of others and to react in a caring manner to that and
politeness which seems to be something like
respect for authority and social conventions
and so one of the things you see for example is that liberals are higher in compassion and
Conservatives are higher in politeness even though. They're both
Aspects of trait agreeableness conscientiousness breaks down into two aspects as well, which are quite interesting
One of them is industriousness which is associated with diligent hard work
and the ability to stay task focused without distraction and to work hard and
orderliness which seems to be associated with disgust sensitivity and which is a pretty good predictor of
conservative belief
As it turns out that some elements of conservative belief are associated with higher than normal levels of or higher than average
Let's say levels of disgust sensitivity and the final trait
Division in two aspects is that of openness to experience and it can be divided into openness proper?
Which is essentially a dimension of creativity and aesthetic sensitivity so preference for engagement?
activities that are associated say with fiction or drama or art and
intellect which is an index of interest in ideas and
Abstraction and philosophical concepts and that sort of things so the report produces a very high resolution
Representation of personality and there are very interesting
Differences at the aspect level that are worth
Concentrating on we try to develop a personality test that isn't designed to make you feel good yourself
Although it might you know it depends on your personality but to give you the most accurate and straightforward description of who you are
That's possible so that you can use the genuine information. That's provided in order to maybe organize your life also
understand the difference between
Yourself and other people because you know we often think that the reason that we don't share the same viewpoint is because we have differences
of opinion
but it actually goes a lot deeper than that because
You're very
Perceptions are dependent on the variability in your personality and so it isn't only that people differ in their opinions they differ very much in
How they see the world how they actually perceive the world because your personality
Constitutes a kind of template or filter through, which you organize your perceptions and so
It's very important to understand that there is substantial
Personality variability in the world and that you're often talking with people who see things differently
Than you and a good example of that is the divide between
let's say left-leaning people and right leading people because the left-leaning people tend to be very high and openness to experience and
Relatively low in conscientiousness especially in the aspect of orderliness whereas the conservative types tend to be very high in
conscientiousness especially orderliness and
Relatively low and openness and so those are fundamentally different
Orientations in the world and you could say that the more conservative types the more right-wing types
Are much more concerned with the preservation of tradition and tend to believe that things that have been done the?
Tried-and-true manner in the past are the most reliable
Whereas the people who are on the Left who are more radical are more concerned with the fact that?
The environment shifts radically and rapidly and unpredictably and so we have to be willing to shift with it and so
Those are both valid viewpoints because every element of lived experience has an orderly element and a chaotic element
Let's say and you have to be prepared for both and the purpose of
straightforward political dialogue between people of different personality types is to help determine on an ongoing
Basis how much we should be relying on tradition and how much we should be attempting to transform ourselves
and there's no permanent solution to that problem because things stay the same and
And they do that at different rates at different times so dialogue is unbelievably important
Which by the way is why I'm such an advocate
Let's say for free speech because it's the mechanism that keeps people of different types speaking instead of fighting, so it's really important, so
Anyways the website is called understand myself calm
And you can go there and sign up for the personality test it'll be delivered to you pretty much immediately
After you fill out the questions each question is posed as a phrase
Take you about 15 minutes to
complete the questions
you can only do it once and the reason for that is is that the
Norms that we compared you against so that would be the self reports of the 10,000 other people
Against whom you're compared they were only allowed to do it once and so we have to maintain
Stringent control over that to maintain the validity of the test, and I would say don't do it when you're hungry
Don't do it when you're tired
Don't do it when you're feeling down or in a bad mood about yourself or feeling
Self-critical and don't do it when you're likely to be interrupted or distracted you want to take it seriously
And you want to think about your answers now you're supposed to answer as you are typically not as you'd like to be
And you know you don't want to be either too hard on yourself, or too
good to yourself you want to be as accurate as possible because then you'll benefit most from the
feedback and
Then the last thing I would say is that we've some of you know about this already
but we've also developed a set of interventions called self authoring and that's available at self authoring calm and
What self are thering can help you do is?
reconfigure certain elements of your behavior and perhaps over the long run your personality so
the self authoring suite helps you write an autobiography and and detail out the
Both positive and negative experiences of your past so that you can capitalize on the positive
experiences and figure out how to duplicate them and maybe put the negative experiences to rest and we feel that that's a good way to
reduce
trait neuroticism over the long run and the evidence for that is that writing programs of this sort tend to improve people's mental health and
decrease their negative emotion so and and
stabilize them
So so if you take the personality test and you're not how
for example with your scores on trait neuroticism you feel that you would benefit from some additional emotional stability then the
past authoring program from the self authoring suite might be something worth considering and then
With regards to the other personality traits um the present authoring program at self authoring com is also a personality
exercise of a sort, but what it helps you do is
Center on your
Virtues and your faults using a Big Five model again so that you can identify
What's good about your personality and figure out how to capitalize that on that in the future and so that you can identify?
Where your major weaknesses are and figure out how to rectify those and so that's useful for general personality?
work
I would say and then the last one which we've done the most research on is called future authoring and the future authoring program
Helps you think about your life
and we think about it as an adjunct to conscientiousness perhaps over the long run and
Also as an exercise that could increase positive and decrease negative emotion bias by helping you establish your goals and also
Stabilizing your view of the world so in the future authoring program
You're asked to consider your life along about seven dimensions so friendship
intimate relationships
What you do outside of work with your private life in terms of useful and creative activity or enjoyable activity or social activity?
What you're aiming for in your career?
How you're going to configure your self?
education how you're going to take care of yourself mentally and physically and how are you going to handle your use of drugs and alcohol
Because those are pitfalls that people often
Encounter that tear them down and hurt them badly and so
You're asked to think about yourself three to five years down the road as if you were taking care of yourself
as if you were a valuable person you know because you want to extend that
Courtesy to yourself because you're as valuable on average as anyone else
and you should treat yourself that way so anyways you're asked to design a future three to five years down the road where your
experience along each of those dimensions is optimized, and then you're asked right for 15 minutes about
What your life could be like three to five years down the road if?
You were taking care of yourself the way you should and things were working out properly
so you could imagine that you're developing a vision of the life that you'd like to lead and
Then you're asked to reverse that and to write for 15 minutes
And think about this as well about what your life would be like if you let your bad habits and your characterological
weaknesses take the upper hand and auger you into the ground so that you became you know a failure and bitter and resentful and
Isolated and unhappy and and all of the terrible things that go along with bad luck and and also
missed opportunities and let's call them ethical errors so and then you're asked to take your positive vision for the future and
elaborate that out into a detailed plan where you justify your
Your goals you you describe what those goals. Are you rank order them in importance you describe?
How you would be better and your family would be better and your society would be better if you stuck to your goals you?
make a contract with yourself to determine how it is that you're going to approach those goals and stay on path and
And so forth and so these are quite extensive
exercises and we developed them you might say as an alternative to
lengthy and expensive
Psychotherapy and there's a fair bit of research evidence suggesting that writing exercises of this sort are extremely effective ways of reconfiguring
The manner in which you approach the world and so the research we've done for example
In three different locations now and with with several thousand college students although
this is not a program only designed for college students has indicated that even if you do a relatively poor job of let's say the
future authoring program
And you're a college student it increases the probability that you'll stay in your program by about 25%
Which is a?
walloping
improvement and also has about the same effect on your grade point average and so that seems to be particularly true for people who are
Doing the worst so it's been really effective for
disenchanted ethnic minority males in Holland for example compared to the Dutch national females who
do better than anyone else in the sample that we looked at two years after the
Entire group did the future authoring program the?
ethnic minority males who were underperforming by about eighty percent
And slightly exceeded the performance of the Dutch national women so that was absolutely
Staggering result as far as we're concerned and we also duplicated that at a place in Canada called
Mohawk College showing that the program worked particularly effectively for men again for males who are underperforming
females generally speaking in the academic world and
Especially if they were males who hadn't done that well in high school and hadn't carved out a very specified
Route forward in their academic achievement, so it's an excellent way of getting your act together and so anyways
the understand myself
Comm page is designed to give you a picture of your personality in detail and then the self authoring program is designed to help you
Reconfigure the way that you approach life
And so we're hoping that the combination of those two things are a particularly effective way of bringing high quality
psychological information and advice and help to a very broad audience at a very low cost and at a relative minimum of demands on
Time I would say we do know with the self authoring program that the more you write the better it works
Which is sort of tantamount to saying that the program works better?
In your life gets better the more you think about the future, which really stands to reason, but it's nice to see that actually
Represented and duplicated as part of a scientific research project so anyways
we've tried to keep the programs as reliable as possible as straightforward as possible as
Dependent on your own actions as possible because the writing is really crucial to
Reconfiguring your personality and as widely distributed well, and is low cost as we can possibly manage
We're trying to provide you with accurate
psychological
Information so that you understand yourself and other people better and so that your life can be configured in a manner that I hope is
much more beneficial to you personnel personally and
Helpful to your family and also has a positive effect on the broader society around you because that's a great triumvirate of
Attainment, and it's exactly what you should be aiming for so I would say I encourage you to
Determine who you are and to think about that very carefully and then to determine
Very carefully who you want to be and why and to?
Make a plan you know you don't get the opportunity to do that in school
junior high high school college university
No one ever
Sits you down and helps you figure out where you came from and who you are and what you're doing and you really need to
Know that I should also say that with the understand myself comm site
We're also working on our couples module that will enable the people who have filled out the report to
ask someone else to also do the
questionnaire
And then they'll both get a report that details out their similarities and differences so that they can come to understand
Where they're going to be in agreement and get along and share interests and where they're likely to have
Conflict and what might be done about that and I would say that's at minimum a month to two months away
And we're also going to release a high school version of the self authoring suite so that people can start to plan their lives
when they're much younger and
We'll only ask the high school students to think about three to six months out into the future because when you're that young
That's about the practical limit of your I wouldn't say ability to think forward into the future
But the younger you are the shorter your time horizon
partly because
Well you you haven't been exposed to the world that much and there's you still have plenty to learn so?
But anyways we have a high school version in the works
And so I'll announce that when it comes out and so we all hope that you find these offerings
useful and practical and
And that they help you put your life together so that you can be a solid citizen and a responsible person and as
Emotionally stable as possible and maybe even find some happiness along the way from time to time so that would be really good
hi there
I guess I'm on my son isn't here tonight
so I'm doing this in my relatively
technologically clueless manner there's
one thing I've noticed about getting
older
I have kept up with computer technology
pretty well I would say but I do find
maybe because of the demands on me in
the last year maybe I'm not stupider
it's possible
so anyways hi everyone nice to see you
here looks like I've got the chat
working is everything working looks like
it all right so I'm going to start with
some questions that people sent me
anyways thank you for all be for all you
you for being here by the way it's very
much appreciated it's quite remarkable
as far as I'm concerned that you tuned
in to listen to me talk with you I
definitely do appreciate it so I'm going
to start with some of the questions that
people sent me earlier and I'll keep an
eye on the chat YouTube chat as well so
hopefully the audio is good what about
that how's the audio there guys
so now Adam W Patterson asked me a
question that got 410 votes he said I am
a web software developer are you hiring
or can I volunteer for anything I can
build anything I can automate things I
could simply be an assistant of sorts
thank you for your time well what I
would like to say about that is first
Thank You Adam it's much appreciated and
a lot of people have volunteered their
time to me and their and their
technological expertise and as much as
I'd like to make use of it that simple
truth of the matter is that I'm
sufficiently overwhelmed by the
complexity of my life at the moment that
it's very difficult to undertake a new
collaborative project with anyone I mean
generally speaking before all this
political what would you call it before
all these political events overtook my
life I was already scheduled probably
about six months to a year
you know all my time was already eaten
up and of course the addition of
everything that's happened in the last
year - that has occupied my time to a
degree that is was is really somewhat
unimaginable and so I just can't take on
additional help which is so strange
because you think that help is help and
that it would save time but you know
it's very difficult to enter into a
collaborative relationship with someone
and especially if you want to give them
credit and do things properly so at the
moment I'm afraid that I can't entertain
any such offers even though I'd like to
and there may come a time in the future
especially when I'm hopefully starting
to work more on this online university
project I've got a few projects to
finish up before that the new
personality test which we've just about
dawdled bugs worked out of and also the
high school version of the Future
authoring program are all we're all set
up long before any of this happened so I
have to clear them out before I can
concentrate on a new project and I
finished a book over the last couple of
years - called twelve rules for life an
antidote to chaos which is now available
by the way if you're interested on
Amazon for pre-order and so anyways this
is my round about way of saying thank
you very much but I can't accept more
help at the moment because my time is
too restricted to make proper use of it
so um plays Noren how to use the results
in the new personality test for progress
in life try to compensate some sites
that that received fewer points well at
the risk of sounding self-serving that's
actually why we developed the self
authoring suite was to help people
improve their let's say performance and
mental health now we don't have direct
evidence that will that will improve
personality but I suspect that that
evidence would take a very long time to
accumulate what we do know is that the
self Arthur and suite especially the
future Arthur ensuite helps people helps
University students for example stay
enrolled in university increases
the probability of that by about 25% and
increases grade point average by about
the same and there's good theoretical
reasons for assuming that writing is a
good way of writing about yourself and
about your past and about your future is
a good way of catalyzing personality
transformation because it appears that
personality the human psyche is
organized at the highest level of
abstraction using something like self
narrative and a well-developed narrative
makes a frame for your life and helps
you stabilize your negative emotions and
also experience more positive emotion
because you only experience positive
emotion relationship to a goal and that
can make goal-directed activity a lot
more rewarding so you know it's a lot
easier to engage in activities that
aren't intrinsically rewarding if
they're linked to something that you
really find important and so I would say
if you want to work on your personality
well the first thing you have to do is
figure out who it is that you want to be
and then you have to make a plan and
maybe you have to clean up your past as
well and the self authoring suite was
designed you know quite carefully in
order to help people do that with a
relative minimum of effort not that it's
easy because it's not but a relative
minimum minimum of effort compared to
other technologies let's say and like
like long term psychotherapy and to make
it cost-effective as well so okay so
mm-hmm another question
voted out 77 votes Australia is holding
a plebiscite on whether to legalize gay
marriage I'm against the yes campaign
but only because it's backed by cultural
Marxists I'm curious to hear your views
on gay marriage
well I would be against a to of was
backed by cultural Marxists because it
isn't clear to me that it will satisfy
the ever increasing what would you call
demand for an assault on traditional
modes of being now with regards to gay
marriage specifically that's a really
tough one for me because you know I can
imagine
I can't do anything really other than
spoke platitudes about it I suppose
unfortunately you know if if the marital
vows are taken seriously then it seems
to me that it's a means whereby gay
people could be integrated more
thoroughly into standard society and
that's probably a good thing and maybe
that would decrease promiscuity which is
a public health problem although
obviously that's not limited to gay
people
although gay men tend to be more
promiscuous than average probably
because there's no women to bind them
with regards to their sexual activity
the problem is is that it does seem to
me to be part of a wedge and it isn't
obvious to me that that legalizing gay
marriage has done anything to decrease
the demands that the radical left
neo-marxist types are placing on
traditional society so those are my
views I know they're confused you know
because I'm in favor of extending the
bounds of traditional relationships to
people who wouldn't be involved in a
traditional long term relationship but
I'm concerned about the undermining of
traditional modes of being including
marriage which you know has technically
and and historically being a union
between a man and a woman fundamentally
for the purpose of raising children in a
stable and and an optimal and stable
environment so and marriage has already
taken a fair bit of damage over the last
few decades you know poor people are
increasingly less likely to be married
and that's really not good for them as
far as I'm concerned
hi I'm currently going through a hard
time as a first-time mom with a nine
month old I feel depressed and anxious
and I'm highly neurotic and volatile can
you suggest anything to help me be a
better mom well you know lots of people
have a hard time with their nine months
old I guess the first question would be
are you getting enough sleep do you have
enough help
are you eating enough especially in the
morning you know and you're gonna feel
highly neurotic and volatile too
some degree because well you've been
through quite a physiological trauma and
it's very demanding to have a newborn
baby so the best thing I could say not
knowing you is to make sure that you
have people around that you can talk to
about your baby and that you can and and
that you can take a break when you need
to and have someone spell you I mean
that's often the role that a husband
plays in the first year of a baby's life
is that he can he's supposed to watch
the mother to make sure that she doesn't
get overwhelmed by the demands of the
baby and so I would hope that you're
able to ask for support when you need it
and not to be afraid of asking for
support especially to get arrest and to
get something to eat because that's
really important especially in the
morning other than that I can't tell you
anything really specific unfortunately
given that I don't know anything about
the specifics of your situation if it
gets out of hand you know what you
should go the other thing I should say
is if it gets out of hand you should go
speak with your with your doctor with a
professional because you might have
postpartum depression there's some
dispute about whether that exists and as
an independent diagnostic entity but you
can certainly be physiologically
stressed and if you have a
predisposition to depression then that
kind of physiological stress and sleep
disruption can bring it on
so I would say if it really gets out of
hand don't hesitate to go talk to
someone professional you know it's it
may be necessary to do that because you
don't want to fall too far down the hall
that's for sure so Emma jovanovich says
dr. Peterson I want to thank you because
this isn't a question for what you do
I'm a 22 year old girl and your videos
are helping me so much with figuring my
life out you are alone or helping me be
braver every day well I'm really happy
about that you know what I like your
emphasis on bravery you know because one
of the things that we've learned as
clinicians say is that when you help
people overcome anxiety it isn't that
you make them less anxious necessarily
although I think you can do that to some
degree by having people confront some of
the demons in their past but instead of
making them less anxious you make them
braver and that's not
the same thing right because there's
lots of reason to be anxious the world's
full of uncertainty and fear and reasons
for fear and reasons for pain but to be
braver means to confront those
voluntarily and that's really a good
thing
when will the next Bible lecture occur
October 24th will be three of them
before the end of December and I want to
keep them going into the future they
they've been quite successful I would
say and I would like to go through the
whole book although that would probably
take me the rest of my life but I do
really think it's necessary because it
is the case that the specific narratives
and the meta-narrative that are that are
embedded in the biblical stories and its
surrounding literature are at the
fundament of Western culture and we need
to reconnect with that in order to make
sure that that our culture stays strong
and I don't think it's particularly
strong right now and that's a very bad
that's a very bad thing for everyone it
leads to nihilism and despair and and in
an ability to plan for a meaningful
future and cynicism and all of those
things and that's especially bad for
young people because when you're young
and your life is ahead of you it's the
last the last time that you need to be
nihilistic and cynical it's definitely
not good so
dart pyar 2 says how can you dispute the
theory that Jesus is just a rewrite of
the sun-god myth well I wouldn't
necessarily dispute that theory although
I would dispute the just I mean the
strange things about the biblical
stories and let's say about the New
Testament stories is that they echo
across multiple levels of analysis and
so there is an astrological element to
the Christ story that Jung wrote about a
fair bit in a book called ion which is a
very terrifying book and there are
echoes of the myths of the Sun God and
but the funny thing is and this is one
of the things I can't really understand
about the biblical stories is that they
manifest themselves at multiple levels
of interpretation simultaneously and you
could say that that's merely a
consequence of continual historical
reworking and I suppose that could be
the case but the fact that they manifest
themselves as a personal story and as a
cosmic story and as a historical story
and as a mythological story and that it
all works at the same time strikes me as
as pointing to something that's really
somewhat beyond our current level of
understanding
I can't elaborate on that a lot because
it would take us into places that I
really would rather not go but I do
believe that like there's something
synchronous using Jung's terminology
about the about death and resurrection
story and the synchronous element is is
associated with the fact that the story
echoes across so many levels of analysis
and my sense is that when something
echoes across many levels of analysis
that means that it's approaching
something like a very deep truth so I
know that isn't normally how we go about
determining what constitutes truth but
we don't know everything about how to
determine what constitutes truth yet and
there are many things that we have yet
to figure out and that's certainly one
of them as far as I'm concerned so there
is a sun-god myth element certainly and
parallels between Christ and Horus for
example but that doesn't mean you can
just say it's just a rewrite
I don't think that the I don't think
that that's historically or a
psychologically accurate
have you watched Rick and Morty no I
haven't many people have told me to
watch Rick and Morty although they said
it's very dark and well that doesn't
bother me so much I suppose although I'm
plenty dark perhaps without adding to it
so but I would like to watch it and I
probably will so I would love for you to
do come and do a talk in Montreal well
you never know that might happen I've
been talking to God saw the both doubt a
fair bit you know he's coming to Toronto
November 11th
so we can do the talk that was shut down
by Ryerson back in August so I'm looking
forward to that so what's the best way
to stop drinking alcohol and start doing
my best in my psychology degree it's
affecting my study but I can do very
well if I stop I'm 26
well Paul what I would say is I think
you should do the future authoring
program and you should really
concentrate there's a section in it that
helps you determine what your positive
view of your future would be but another
section that helps you determine what
would happen in your life if your
negative habits got out of control and
one of the things that can really help
you control your alcohol intake is to
really really think through what you're
giving up and where you could be in five
years if you don't get it under control
and proclivity to alcoholism can be a
really vicious thing you know lots of
people get dragged down into the mud by
alcohol excessive alcohol intake
especially if they're sensitive to the
opiate response that alcohol can produce
you could tell that if you when you
drink you know you get alert and let's
say more enthusiastic and energetic and
then you don't want to stop drinking
that's a that's definitely a bad sign
with regards to developing alcoholism so
I would say you need to figure out
something that's that's more important
to you than drinking and also think
through very hard the negative
consequences of continuing it you're at
about the age 26 where you should stop I
mean guys who are going to stop
generally starts slow down pretty pretty
intensely around that age you know get
also treating your psychology studying
as a full-time job can also be helpful
so you know get up at 8:00 morning or
7:30 in the morning and start hitting
the books by 9:00 and put in a 6 to 8
hour date and then even if you do keep
drinking at least you're moving forward
so that's what I can say about are you a
science fiction fan you reference
timeline Starship Troopers in a lecture
and your ideas often remind me of
Harry's Elton's plan from ASA mobs
Foundation series hey well when I was a
kid which is quite a long time ago now I
lived in this town called Fairview
Alberta which was a town of about 3,000
people way too held North 350 miles
northwest of Edmonton and I have this
neighbor across the street across the
alley actually and he had a huge
science-fiction library it must have
been I don't know five thousand books
there 1970s 1960s and 1970s classics
like Heinlein them and Asimov and he
would let me go over there and take like
20 books at a time and I was reading
about a book a day at that point and I
read science fiction like mad probably
till I was about 19 or so and maybe a
little younger than that and then turned
more to classic literature when I got to
college and and also partly as a
consequence of some lessons that the
local library had taught me about what
to read so I was a science fiction fan
I haven't read science fiction for a
very long time although I was pretty
happy with it when I was a kid so
richard van Koppen says yes I have agra
phobia and would love to hear about
anxiety well that's a that's a rough
thing to have egg reform yeah so Agra
phobics get increasingly isolated and
afraid of things outside of their domain
of familiarity and often what happens
with Agra phobia is that people who
develop it or afraid of two things
they're afraid that something is going
to go dreadfully wrong with their health
especially with regards to their heart
so they start to become afraid that
maybe they'll have a heart attack and
that they'll die in public far from a
hospital and that they'll make a fool of
themselves while they're doing it or
well that well they think they're dying
and so it's a combination of two fears
and one is fear of mortality and the
other is fear of social judgment and you
might think about those as the two main
categories of fear that possess people
because one is associated well obviously
with mortality and death and the other
is associated with exclusion from the
group which of course can lead to
mortality and death and so the Agra
phobics get the worst of both worlds
it's often a disease of middle-aged
women but not always and they're often
people who've been somewhat dependent in
their previous lives and then undergo
some traumatic event like a divorce or
the death of someone close and and at
the same time are perhaps experiencing
heart palpitations that are associated
with menopause that brings ideas of
mortality to mind and that can trigger a
panic attack which is very what would
you call it unpleasant experience to say
the least
and then that fear of panic attacks
starts making people avoid and that's
when Agra phobia develops out of anxiety
I've really been trying to understand the underlying psychology of postmodernism and its relationship with neo-Marxism,
and then the spread of that into the universities and the effect on the culture.
And what I would like to start with is a description of your understanding of that,
because I've presented to the people who are listening to me my understanding of it.
But I interviewed Stephen Hicks recently, and he wrote an interesting book called "Explaining Postmodernism," which I liked quite a bit.
It's been criticized for being too right-wing, although I don't think he's right-wing at all.
I think maybe you could characterize him as middle-of-the-road conservative, but I would say he's more like a classic liberal.
But I'm really curious about your views about, well, what— what Postmodernism is first of all.
I know you've— you've identified it with the— with the general tricksters Derrida and Lacan and Foucault.
And Foucault in particular you've talked about.
But I'd like to know what you think about postmodernism and also why you think it's been so attractive to people.
Well, my explanation is that there is no authentic 1960s point of view in any of the elite universities,
but rather the most liberated minds of my generation of 1960 did not go on to graduate school.
I witnessed this with my own eyes.
I saw genuine Marxists, okay, at my college, which was the State University of New York at Binghamton, upstate New York, Harpur College,
which had a huge cohort of very radical downstate New York Jews, okay, who—
In fact, Harpur used to be called Berkeley East.
I saw genuine passionate Marxists with my own eyes.
They were not word choppers.
They were not snide postmodernists, right?
They were in-your-face aggressive.
They used the language of the people.
They had a populist and energy, okay?
They dressed working class. They were nonmaterialistic, okay?
These are people who lived by their own convictions.
They were against the graduate schools, all right?
When I— When I, uh, went on to graduate school, and it became known that I was going to go to Yale,
I was confronted by a leader of the radicals on campus, in broad daylight in front of everyone,
who denounced me for— he said,
"Grad school is not where it's happening. You don't— You don't do that.
If you have to go to graduate school you should go to Buffalo."
Now, I had applied to SUNY Buffalo, because the great leftist critic Leslie Fiedler was there, who had a huge impact on me.
He's practically created identity politics, but without its present distortions, all right?
And Norman Holland, the psychoanalytic critic was there.
I would have been very happy to have gone on to Buffalo, but I needed the library at Yale, so I continued on to Yale.
There were no radicals in the graduate schools, okay, from 1968 to '72, when i was there.
Only one radical, Todd Gitlin, who went on to have a career success, okay?
The actual radicals of the 1960s, okay, either went off— dropped out of college, or went off to create communes, right,
or they were taking acid and destroyed their brains.
Now, I have also written about that,
the destruction of the minds, okay, of the most talented members of my generation through LSD.
It was going on all around me, right?
So, what's happened is the actual legacy of the '60s got truncated.
The idea that these post-structuralists and postmodernists are heirs of the 1960s revolution is an absolute crock, okay?
What they represent, as Foucault shows—
Foucault said, okay, that the biggest influence on his thinking, okay, was Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot," okay,
which was a post-World-War-II play, written in Paris,
that was about the disillusionment and nihilism experienced after Hitler went through, occupied France, right, and all of Europe was in ruins.
It had nothing to do with what—
"Waiting for Godot" has nothing to do with the authentic legacy of the 1960s,
which was about genuine multiculturalism, a movement toward India, toward Hinduism,
a transformation of consciousness through psychedelics, which I did not take, but which I identify with totally through the music, etc., all right?
It was a turn toward the body.
It was a turn towards sensory experience, okay?
Not this "word-chopping" thing, and this, like, cynical removal from actual experience, all right?
That French import, okay, came in, okay, to the graduate schools.
It did not affect any genuine 1960s person.
The real 1960s revolution was about Jung.
It was about a way of seeing the cosmos in mythological terms, all right?
And the Jungian contribution went on into the New Age movement of the 1970s, aside from the universities, all right?
So, who took over the universities were these careerists, okay?
I saw them with my own eyes. I saw what happened. I saw—
I was at Yale when Derrida was being shipped over, okay, to address the, uh, you know, the students— the grad students and the faculty.
And I said to a fellow student, after hearing one of these guys speak—
It wasn't Derrida. It was another one of the theorists.
I said, "They are like high priests murmuring to each other." All right?
This was an elitist form from the start, okay?
It was not progressive. It was not revolutionary. It was reactionary.
It was a desperate attempt to hold on to what had happened before the 1960s sensory revolution.
But this postmodernist thing, okay, this trashing, okay, of the text,
this— this encouragement, okay, of a superior and destructive attitude toward the work of art—
We're going through it, okay, primly, with red pen in hand, finding all the evidence of sexism, check, racism, check, homophobia, check.
That is not the empathic, emotional, okay, sensory-based, okay, revolution of the 1960s, right?
I am sick and tired of these people claiming any kind of mantle from the 1960s. They're frauds.
These people are— What happened in the 1970s was a collapse of the job market in academia, okay?
All of a sudden, jobs were scarce, and this thing was there, the new and improved and shiny thing, okay, to be a theorist.
And people seized on it, okay? It was institutionalized, all right?
And it's an enormous betrayal of the 1960s.
Okay so that- You touched on this idea of "the destruction of the work of art".
You know, and one of the things I really liked about reading Nietzsche was his discussion of "ressentiment" right?
-of resentment and it seems to me that tremendous amount of the motive power
that drives the postmodernist- let's call It- it's not a revolution, uh-
transformation seems to me to be driven by resentment about virtually anything that has any,
well, what would you say... any merit of competence or aesthetic quality,
and I don't know if that's- It seems to me that that's partly rooted in the
academic's disdain for the business world, which I think is driven by their relative economic inequality,
because most people who are as intelligent as academics are,
from a pure IQ point of view, make more money in the private sphere, and so I think that drives some of it.
But there also seems to be this- There's a destruction, an aim for destruction of the  aesthetic quality of
the literary or artistic work, its reduction to nothing but some kind of power game, and then surrounding that,
the reduction of *everything* to something that approximates a power game, which I can't help but
identifying with jealousy and resentment as a fundamental motivator.
Does that seem reasonable to you?
These professors who allege that art is nothing but an ideological movement by one elite,
against the- against another group, these people are Philistines, okay?
They're Philistines. They're Middlebrow, hopelessly Middlebrow.
They have no sense of beauty. They have no sense of the aesthetic.
Now, Marxism does indeed assert this, but Marxism tries to reconfigure the universe in terms of materialism.
It sees- It does not recognize any kind of spiritual dimension.
Now, I'm an atheist, but i see the great world religions as enormous works of art,
as the best way to understand the universe and a man's place in there.
I find them enormously moving. They're like enormous poems, right?
And what I have called for, the true revolution, okay, would have been to make the core curriculum
of the world education, the *world*, okay, the great religions of the world.
I feel that is the only way to achieve an understanding, and it's also a way to present the aesthetic,
because i feel that that that the real sixties vision was about exultation, elevation, cosmic consciousness, okay?
All of these things were rejected by these midgets, okay, intellectual midgets
who seized onto Lacan, Derrida and Foucault. It's a- my career has been in the art school, my entire career,
beginning at Bennington college. So I represent a challenge to this from the perspective of Art.
It is an absolute nonsense, okay, as post-Structuralism maintains, that reality is mediated by language, by words.
Everything that we can know, including gender.
It is absolutely madness, because I'm teaching students whose majors are ceramics, ok, or dance,
or who are jazz musicians, who understand reality in terms of the body, its sensory activation.
So they- See, what happened was something was going on in the art world as well.
I identify With Andy Warhol in pop art, okay? That was what was going on during my years in college.
Everything about Andy Warhol was like, "Wow! Admiration! Wow!"
What happened immediately after that in the arts, 1970's okay, was this collapse into a snide sort of post-Modernism also.
This happened in the art world, and it was an utter misunderstanding of culture, it seems to me,
by that movement in the art World. That Is, oppositional art, in my view, is dead, okay?
-and what post-Modernism is, is a pathetic attempt to continue the old heroism of the Avant-garde.
The Avant-garde was genuinely heroic from the early 19th Century, okay?
We're talking about, you know, the corbeil, the realists, you know?
We're talking about Monet and the Impressionists,
people who have genuinely suffered for their radical ideas,
and their innovations and so on, going right down to Picasso, and down to Jackson Pollock,
who like was- who truly suffered for, you know, for his art.
It was only after his death, okay, that suddenly the market was created for abstract art.
Pop art killed The Avant-garde.
The idea that the Avant-garde continues is an absolute delusion of the contemporary art world,
which feels that it must attack, attack, attack- challenge, okay, the simplistic beliefs of the hoi polloi, okay?
It's somehow the order- What? Excuse me, okay?
From The Moment, okay, Andy Warhol went through and embraced the popular media,
instead of having the opposition to it that serious artists have had, that was the end of Oppositional art, okay?
So, we've been going on now for 50 years: the post-modernism and academes hand-in-hand
with the stupidity and infantilism that masquerades as, you know, as important art galleries everywhere,
this incredible, incredible, you know, its mechanism of contemporary art,
pushing things that are so hopelessly derivative,
and with this idea that, once again, that the art world somehow superior view of reality,
Authentic Leftism Is populist, okay?
It is based in working-class style, working-class language, working-class direct emotion,
in an openness and brusqueness of speech, okay?
-not this fancy, contorted jargon of the pseudo-leftist of academe, who are frauds.
These people who manage to rise to the top at Berkeley, at Harvard, At Princeton, okay?
How many of these people are radical?
They are career people. They're corporate types, okay, who succeeded in-
They *love* the institutional context. They know how to manipulate the bureaucracy,
which has totally invaded and usurped academe everywhere, okay?
These people are company-players.
They could have done well in any field, okay? They love to sit on endless committees.
They love bureaucratic regulation, and so on. There's not-
Not one *Leftist* in American academia raised his or her voice against obscene growth of tuition costs,
which have bankrupted a whole generation of young people.
Not one voice to challenge that invasion by the bureaucrats, okay, absolute fascist bureaucrats, okay,
with- who had a- They're like, uh,  cancerous, okay?
There's so many of them, the faculty have completely lost any power in American Academia, okay?
It's a scandal what has happened. I mean-
And they deserve the present servitude that they're in right now, because they never protested, okay?
When I- My first job at Bennington college, 1976 I was there, when there was an uprising by the faculty
against encroachment by the board of trustees and the president, and It was a huge thing. It Was reported on
The New York Times and so on and we pushed that president out and and there's not been a single
uprising of that kind against encroachment by the trustees and by the administrations,
and all these decades, passive slaves- Slaves! They *deserve* their slavery.
Yep, I couldn't agree more. I've thought the same thing about university professors for a long time.
is that they get exactly what they deserve because they never stand up and say, "no,"
and the fact that- In the United States it's not quite as bad in Canada, i wouldn't say, but the fact that the
students have been essentially handed a bill of indentured servitude here
for their student loans is absolutely beyond comprehension. You know, it seems to me that the
bureaucracy has basically conspired to determine how to pick the pockets of
The Students future earnings right and They do that By offering them an Extended adolescence With no quality control
something Like That so it's a real Bargain with the devil and Antle the abandonment of any Kind of Education Actually in history and culture
All right Think it's gone Along With It that is the
Transformation into a cafeteria
Kind of a Menu okay we can Pick This course or that Course of This course without any Kind of Guidance From the University about
A central core curriculum That teaches you history and Chronology and Introduces you to the basics
Because Oh yeah because our professors are such prima donnas they can Only teach in their little areas so we have this total
Fragmentation okay the Great Art History Survey Courses are being abandoned
Instead of Lincoln Because Why because graduate students are not trained to see the great
Narratives or the net Wheel Because we are taught Now that Narratives are false okay so That's another issue that i'd like to bring up
Because One of The Things i cannot figure out is the alliance between the post modernists and the
Neo-Marxists i can't Understand The Causal relationship There Because the
Tell me if you disagree with This okay because
I'm a Psychologist not a
Sociologist and so I'm dabbling in things that are outside of My Field Of expertise and There Is some danger in that but the center
The Central post Modernist claim Seems to me that Because There's a Near infinite Number of Ways to interpret a complex set of
Phenomena Which Which Actually happens to be the case
That You can't make a case That Any of Those Modes of Interpretation are canonical and so if They're not canonical
If that and if That
Canonical Element Isn't Based in some Kind of Reality Then It Serves some Other Master and so the Master that it
Hypothetically Serves for The post Modernists is nothing But Power Because That Seems to be everything that They believe in they don't believe in
Competence They don't believe in Authority They don't
Seem to believe in an objective World Because Everything is language mediated so it's an extraordinarily
Cynical perspective That That Because There's an infinite Number of
interpretations none of Them are canonical You can attribute It everything to power and dominance
okay so that Does that Seem like a Reasonable Summary of the
Okay it's a Radical relativism Now but the strange Thing Is despite okay and so What Goes Along with that is the demolition of Grand
Narratives and so That Would Be associated for Example with The rejection of Thinkers Like Jung and Eric Norman Because of Course Their
Foundational Thinkers in relationship to the idea that there are embodied grand Narratives That's never Touched but Then
Despite the fact that the grand narrative is Rejected There's a Neo Marxism That's Tightly Tightly allied With
Post-Modernism That Also Seems to shade Into This strange identity Politics and i don't
Two Things i don't understand the Causal relationship They're like The the skeptical part of me thinks That
Post-Modernism Was a Was an Intellectual its Intellectual camouflage for the continuation of the Kind of Pathological
Marxism That Produced the soviet union and that has no independent existence As an Intellectual field Whatsoever
but i still can't Understand How the post modernists can Make The no grand narrative claim
But Then
immerse Themselves in This grand narrative Without
Anyone Pointing Out the evident contradictions like i don't understand that so what do you think about that well i can Only Speak about Literary
professors Really and They Seemed to me almost Universally in the u.s
To be very naive i they Seem to know nothing about Actual History political science or economics
So it is simply an attitude They have an attitude it
Marxism and become Simply a Badge By Which They telegraph Their
Their Solidarity With a Working Class That They have nothing to do with i mean Easy and Generally nothing But contempt yes and the Thing
Is that that the campus leftist are almost notorious for their for theirs Rather snobbish Treatment of Staff and They don't They don't
Have Any rapport With The Actual Working Class members of The
you Know of the infrastructure the janitor The Janitors and you Know even That's even The secretaries there's a Kind of High and Mighty
Aristocracy You Know but There was Just these are People who
Who have Wandered into the english department and are products of a Time When
During The The new criticism may wait When history of history and Psychology had Been Excluded right i Mean My
Ambition okay Was i mean i love the New criticism okay as As a Style of Textual
Analysis right and and that in the new criticism had
Multiple Interpretations
Okay that were possible okay and then They were encouraged in fact one of the one of the Great projects was made in max of
Serious 20th Century Views When you had at Least Books i Adored them in college It was about Jane Austen or about you know
Emily Bronte or about
Wordsworth and They were collections of alternate views of The same Thing the idea that no alternate views and there was no
Relativistic the situational Kind of an interpretive approach is nonsense okay i'm but the point was we needed to restore
History to literary Literary Study okay and we Needed to add
Psychology to it because it was there was Great animus against freud and When i arrived in
Graduate School in fact i actually went into the director of graduate studies and protested The way freud in Freudian were used as
negative Terms Play in a Sneering Way by The Very Wasp professors right so we need to do
Actually It Seemed Like we were moving there came in the Early 1970s Was a Great Period of Psycho
Biography about Great about political Figures okay
so i thought it's happening Let's Say and all of a Sudden It all Got Short-Circuited by This arrival You know of post structuralism and
Post-Modernism in The in the in the 1970s right so i
I feel i'm an old Historicist, okay,
not a new Historicist.  I having i think new Historicism is an absolute scam.
right and it's like- it's just a way- it's like tweezers do you like Just a
Little Bit of This a Little Bit of That a Little Bit of that you make a Little tiny
Salad i guess and I'm some of This Atomized Thing Right it's supposed to
Mean something it's all to me very superficial Very Cynical a
Very distance i like i am i am the product okay of old historicism the German Philosopher
Profession When i was a Child What Was Ejected
Archeology Like I'm everything i ever think about or Say Is
Related to an Enormous time scheme okay from from Antiquity and Indeed from the stone age
and That is the problem with these People: They're mal-educated. The post-Modernists and
Academic Marxist okay are mal educated
Embarrassingly so okay they know nothing before the present. Foucault is
absolutely a joke before the Enlightenment.
Perhaps he might Be useful People to talk about What happens after
Neoclassicism Which by the way he failed to notice okay a Lot of What he was talking about It turns Out to see be simply
The Hangover of Neoclassicism okay
This is how ignorant that Man Was i Mean he's he was he was not Talented as a Researcher he knew absolutely
nothing okay was so you know nothing about Antiquity how can you make any Kind of large
structure large mechanism you know to analyze Western culture Without Knowing about
Classical Antiquity he did not see anything This Was a Person Who had no business
Making Large Theoretical Statements about anything Well Maybe Part of It is that if you if you
Generate an Intelligible doctrine of Radical relativism Then There is no reason to assume that there are distinctions between
Categories of Knowledge or Between different Levels of quality of Knowledge right so
I've seen The same Thing in in the psychology Departments although We Have the?
What Would you call it the Luxury of being Bounded at Least to some degree by the
Empirical Method and By Biology Right It's one of The things that Keeps most of the Branches of
Psychology relatively sane you know because the Real World is Actually built into it to some degree but
If you accept the
Postmodernist Claim of Radical relativism then You completely demolish The idea That there our quality levels That are associated with Education
Because Everything Becomes The same and That Seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable Justification for Maintaining Ignorance
You Know like Foucault i Actually Found Him the most readable of the locka
Derrida Foucault triad You can Read foucault i Read Madness and
Civilization and a Couple of His other Books and i thought They were Painfully obvious you know the idea That
Mental disorder Is in part a Social Construct Is self-Evident to anybody
Who has Even a Smattering of psychiatric training i Mean That the Real Narrow medical Types tend to to think of a
Mental disorder Let's Say As something That might Be Purely Biological They have a pure disease Model But Nobody's Who's a
sophisticated Thinker ever Thinks That it's a
Bit Partly Because medicine Is a Brand of engineering Not a brand of science Because it's associated with Health and the
Diagnostic Categories are Hybrids Between
Physiological Observation and socio-cultural Condition Everyone Knows That and so When i Read Madness and
Civilization i thought Well That's Not radical That's Just Bloody
self-Evident But Well you Know Foucault's Admirers Actually Think that he began you know the entire Turn toward a Sort of Sociological
you Know Grounding of Modern Psychology to social Psychology Was well well Launched in the 1920s for
Examine The Levels of Ignorance of These People Who think foucault Is so original have not Read?
Durkheim They've Not Read Marks of Weber They've never Read urban Goffman okay so in other Words Through to me
Everything Is Foucault Seem obvious to me because i had Read the sources from Which he was Borrowing Without attribution
So i mean Again i know these People i mean i mean in some cases
Knew them in graduate school People Who went on to become these
These Admirers of Foucault
Lacan derrida and I know What Their training Was Their training Was Purely Within the english department That's all They ever Knew They never made
Any Research Outside of That Right and so the idea so they
Foucault is simply This is a Mechanism
It's like a Little Tiny kit by Which they can approach everything in culture and Then and then They put the contortions of language the
Deliberate Labyrinth in Elitist language at The same time as pretending to be a leftist
Okay this is one of the biggest Frauds Every practice so i got a Story to tell you That
you Might Like Because i've Thought a lot about that use of language you know because
Language can Be Used as camouflage and so, Here's the Story i think i Got this from Robert Sapolsky?
So he was talking about Zebras and
Zebras Of Course have stripes and hypothetically That's associated with camouflage but it's it's not a straightforward
Association Because Zebras are Black and White and They're on the veldt Along With the lions the lions are
camouflage Because They are grass colored But the Bloody Zebras are Black and White you can See them like 15 miles away, so ok so
Biologists Go Out to study Zebras and They're Like
Making notes on a Zebra and They Watch It then they look down at Their notes and then They look up but they think oh?
No, no, Which zebra i was looking at so
The camouflage is Actually against The Heard Because of Zebras a Herd Animal not an individual and so
The Black and White stripes break Up the animal against The herd so you can't identify It so this Was a
Quandary for the Biologist so they did one of Two Things One Was
drive a Jeep Up to the to the zebra Herd and use a dab of Red paint and Dab the horns of the zebra or
tag It with an ear tag Like he used for cattle
The Lions Would Kill it
So as soon as it became
identifiable The
Predator Yes
The predators Could organize Their Hunt Around That identify about animal That's Why you know there's the old Idea That
Lions and predators Take Down the Weak animals but They don't They take down the
identifiable animals so That's the Thing is if you stick your Damn hand up
You Get Picked off by The predators and so One of The things that Academics seem to do is congregate together and herd-Like
Entities and Then They share a language right and the language Unites them and
Also Keeps Them as long as They share the same set of linguistic Tools Among Themselves
They're they know that there isn't anybody in the in the coterie That's going to attack them or deeds
Destabilize The entire herd and that Seems to me to account for that impenetrable use of language it's it's it's Group
Protection strategy and It has Absolutely nothing to do with the search for
It's the Search for Security Within a System and not the desire to Expand the system
But it'S to me it's Blatantly Careerist Because It Was it was about
Advancement and It was also about the claim that Somehow
They have Like Special expertise This is a Special Technical language no One else can Understand That Only Only a Weekend But What's absurd about
It absolutely
Ludicrous all Right That These People These These American Academics who are imitating the contorted language of French
Translations From The French okay
When Lack Call is translated into into english Right There's a
Contortion There okay he's what he was trying to do in french Was to break up okay the
Neoclassical
Formulations That Descended From arras scene there Was something that Was going on there Was a Sabotage of The french language going on that Was?
Necessary in france not Necessary in english We Have This long tradition of
Poetry Going back to the shakespearean Chaucer We Have We Have our own language?
Far more Vital Than That Than the french oh yeah the french constrain Their language all The time but my dear?
Facility in Amateurism okay of American Academics trying to imitate okay a
Chance a chinois
okay When like Costumes something in france that is Actually not Necessary and Indeed wrong to be doing in english right the
Other Cynical Abandonment okay of the Great tradition of
you Know of the english Departments i and iii i felt That the true Radicalism Was not about adding on other
Departments okay so we have
African-American Studies and You Know and and and Women's studies and so on the true radicalism would have Been Just to Shatter The
Departmental structure That's What i wanted i feel that Was the authentic revolutionary Nineteen Sixties Thing to do right
Tell It to blend all the literate literature studies studies Together okay
to make Easier to make an interdisciplinary Kind of
Organization you Know closer to the british Model Where a person can Pursue related Subjects Overlapping Subjects
These dip These Depart Mental Models okay are were to me
Totalitarian to Begin With okay separating the language into fiefdom and and and What What this did to create the english What Women's studies Department
Absolutely Out of The air Just Snap Your fingers and create Women Studies the english department had taken a Century to develop okay that Way?
It Was a Huge argument okay within Within Within It right and all of a Sudden to create okay
A department where they
politicize agenda From The start and hey by People Without any training Whatever in that Field i Mean What should Be the what Should be
The parameters of The field Which Would be the requirements of that Field How about Biology
okay if you're going to be discussing gender that Should
Have Been a Number One requirement okay as Part of Any Women's studies department or program but no okay
It Was all Hands off It Was Just the
Administrators Wanted To solve a public relations problem They had a Situation with Very Few Women Faculty
Nationwide at a time When the women's movement had Just started up that spotlight of Attention Was Was on them they want They Needed Women
Faculty Fast They Need to do with the with the women's subject on the agenda fast right so they Just like Poof
Let There be Women studies okay and Now we'll Just hire some women and usually from english Departments you know
Here and there and we'll Just Throw them together you invent it you Say What it is so That's Why women's studies Got
Frozen At a Certain Point of ideologies
okay of The Early
1970s i was
Already in Revolt From It okay i was a precursor in terms of My endorsement of feminism Before It before even Now was created Right
But i couldn't yeah i couldn't even have a Conversation With Any of These Women They were?
Hysterical about The subject of Biology They Knew nothing about Hormones and i i mean i i
Probably Got in fistfights
Over This They What People were so
Convinced That Biology had nothing Whatever to do with gender differences see that also Seems to me to be related
To the postmodern emphasis on power yeah Because There's a There's something?
Terrible Underground Going on there that Is and i think this is the sort of Thing That Was Reflected in the soviet union
Too and the especially in the 20s When there was this idea a Radical idea that You could
Remake Human Beings Entirely Right Because They have no essential nature and so if your Fundamental
Hypothesis is that nothing Exists Except Power and you believe That then that also Gives you the right in some sense to
exercise Your Power at The Creation of the Kind of Humanity That Your
Utopian Vision envisions and Then That has no that and that also Seems to me to justify the postmodern insistence That
Everything is Only a Linguistic
Construct It Again Goes down to the notion of Power Which derrida and Foucault and locke Our so bloody obsessed with and
so and It Seems to me what They're trying to do is to it to take all
All the potential Power for the Creation of Human Beings to Themselves Without Any Bounding Conditions?
Whatsoever right There's no History There's no biology There's and and everything Is a Fluid culture that can be
Manipulated at Will and so i mean in canada there are terrible arguments Right Now about
Biological essentialism Let's Say And One of The Things that Happened Which Was something i objected to precisely a Year ago is that the social
constructionist view of Human Identity has Been Built now into canadian law so there's an insistence That
Biological sex
Gender Identity Gender Expression and Sexual Proclivity Very
Independently With no causal
Relationship Between Any of The levels and so That's in the law and not Only is It in the law it's being Taught
Everywhere it's being taught in the armed Forces
it's being taught in the police it's being taught to the Elementary School Kids and the Junior High school Kids and
Underneath It all i see this terrible
Striving for Arbitrary Power That's associated with This Crazy utopianism and and and
but i still don't Exactly Understand It i don't like i don't Understand That
What seems to be the hatred that motivates It that You see bubbling Up for Example in identity Politics and and
in the desire to do nothing But Let's Say Demolish The
Patriarchy It Kind of Reminds me and this is something else i wanted to talk to you about you know and
You're you're an Admirer of Eric Norman and all you yeah and That's the
Norman Connection is Really interesting cuz i think he's a Bloody Genius i Really like the great mother Is a Great
Book and I'm Really a Great Warning that. Book and also the origins and History of Consciousness
Yeah But That's so interesting i Read an Essay that you wrote
Yes it's always Been staggering to me that that book hasn't had the impact that it Should
Have had i Mean Young Himself in the preface to that book?
Wrote that that Was the book that he wished that he would have Written it's Very Much associated With Young Symbols of
Transformation and It Was a Major influence on my book maps of Meaning Which Was an Attempt to
Outline the universal Archetypes That are portrayed in the Kind of religious structures that you
That You Put Forward but The thing that i really see happening and you can tell me what you think about this in annoyance book?
Consciousness Which is
Masculine symbolically Masculine for a Variety of Reasons Is is viewed as
Rising Up
Against The countervailing Force of Tragedy from an Underlying
feminine symbolically feminine Unconsciousness Right and it's something That Can Always Be pulled back into that unconsciousness That Would Be the
Microcosm of That Would be The Freudian eatable mother
Familial Dynamic Where the mother is so over
protective and all-Encompassing
That She Interferes with the development of The competence not Only of her sons but also of her Daughters of her Children in General and
It seems to me that That's the
Dynamic That's being Played Out in our society Right Now is that there's this and
It's it's related in some Way that i don't understand to this to this
Insistence That all Forms of masculine Authority are nothing But Tyrannical Power so the Symbolic representation is
Tyrannical Father With no
Appreciation for the benevolent Father and
Benevolent mother With no appreciation Whatsoever for the tyrannical mother right and That's that and because i thought of ideologies as
Fragmentary Mythologies That's Where They Get Their
Archetypal and Psychological Power Right and so in a Balanced representation You have the terrible mother and the great mother as?
Knowing Been Laid Out so Nicely and
You Have the terrible father and the Great Father so That'S the fact that culture bangels you have to Death well it's also?
Promoting you in developing you you have to see that as balanced and then You have the heroic and Adversarial individual but in the?
Postmodern World and This Seems to be something That's increasingly
Seeping Out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father?
nothing But The destructive Force of masculine consciousness and nothing but the benevolent
Benevolent Great mother and It's a it's an appalling ideology and It Seems to me that it's sucking the vitality
Which is Exactly What you would Expect symbolically it's sucking the Vitality of Our culture you see that with the increasing
Demolition of
Young men
and Not Only Young men in terms of Their Academic performance Which like They're Falling Way behind
in Elementary School Way behind in Junior High and Bailing Out of the universities like Mad and so and i
Well The Public school Education become completely Permeated by This Kind of my anti male
Propaganda i mean and i need to me public Schools are Just a form of imprisonment you Know right Now they're particularly
Destructive to young men who have a Lot of physical Energy
Now you know i identify as transgender gay Mic Myself away but i do not i do not
require the entire world to alter itself okay to fit my particular The self-image i do believe in
The Power of Hormones i believe that men Exist and Women Exist and They are biologically different i think that i think there is
No cure for
The Cultures ills Right Now Except If men Start standing opera in demanding That They be
Respected As men okay okay so i got a question about That
So so one of The Things we did a research Project a Year ago trying to figure out if there Was such a Thing as
Political Correctness From a Psychometric perspective to find out if there the loose
Aggregation of Beliefs Actually Clumped Together
Statistically and We Actually Found two factors Which i won't go into but then we Looked at Things That predicted adherence to that That?
Politically Correct Creed and There were a couple That were surprising one was being female Was a predictor
The
Personality attributes associated With Femininity so that Would Be Agreeableness and higher levels of negative emotion were also both
independent predictors but so were symptoms of personality disorder Which i thought Was really important Because Part of What i see happening is That
Like i think that Women whose relationship with men have has Been Seriously?
Pathologized Cannot distinguish Between male Authority and competence and male
Tyrannical Power Like They fail to differentiate because all They see is the oppressive male and then They may Have had Experiences that That?
Their Experiences with men might have Been Rough enough so that That differentiation never occurred Because it has to occur
And You have to have a Lot Of Experience with men and Good men do before that will occur?
But It Seems to me that we're also increasingly dominated By a view of Masculinity That's Mostly Characteristic of Women who have terrible
Personality disorders and Who are unable to have Healthy relationships with men Now but Here's the problem you know?
This is something My Wife is pointed Out to she said well men are gonna have to stand up for Themselves but Here's the problem?
I know how to stand up to a man Who's
Whose
Unfairly
Trespassed Against me and the reason i know that is because the parameters for My resistance are quite well-Defined Which is
We talk We argue we Push and then It Becomes physical
Right Like If We Move Beyond The Boundaries of civil discourse we Know what the Next step is ok That's Forbidden in in
Discourse with Women and so i don't think that men can control Crazy Women i don't they i really don't believe it i think That
They have to Throw Their Hands up in in in in what in in it's not even disbelief
It's that The cultural There's no step Forward That You can take Under Those Circumstances
Because if the Man Is offensive enough and Crazy Enough The
Reaction Becomes Physical Right Away or at Least The Threat is there and
When men are talking to each Other in any serious Manner That Underlying Threat of
Physicality is Always there especially if It's a real conversation and Keeps The Things civilized to some degree you know iF you're talking to a
Man Who wouldn't fight with You under any Circumstances Whatsoever then you're talking
To someone to whom you have absolutely no respect but i can't See any Way for Example
There's a There's a Woman in in toronto Who's Been?
Organizing This movement Let's Say Against me and some Other People who are gonna do a free speech
Event and she Managed to organize quite effectively and She's quite?
offensive You might Say She compared us to nazis for Example Which you know publicly
Using The Swastika Which wasn't really something i was all That far in Depth but i i'm defenseless against That Kind of female
Insanity Because The
Techniques That i would use against a Man Who was employing those tactics are Forbidden to me
So i don't know like It seems to me that It isn't men that have to stand up and Say Enough of This even though
That is What They Should do It Seems to me that it's same Women who have to stand up against Their Crazy
sisters and Say Look enough of That enough man-Hating enough
Pathology enough Bringing disgrace on us as a Gender But
The problem there and then They'll Start My little tirade is that most of the Women i know
Who are saying are Busy doing same Thing
Right They're off They have Their career They have Their Family They're quite occupied and they don't seem
To have the time or maybe even the interest to go after Their Their Crazy Harpy sisters and so i don't see any
regulating Force For That That terrible Femininity and It Seems to me to be
Invading the culture and
undermining The The masculine Power of the culture in a Way That's i think
Fatal i really do Believe that i - i too believe these are
Symptomatic of the decline of Western culture and We and it Will Just Go down flat i don't think People realize that you know
Masculinity Still Exists okay in the World As a Code among Jihadists
Okay and when you have passionate Masculinity okay circling the Borders like The huns and the Vandals during The roman empire
That's what i see i see this culture rotting from Within okay and
Disemboweling Itself Literally Now mile an Overview of Why we're having this problem
and It comes from The fact that I'm the product of an immigrant Family all four of My
Grandparents and My mother were born in Italy
so i remember from my earliest Years in This factory Town in upstate New York where the wife of My relatives came to work in
The shoe Factory i can Remember Still okay
