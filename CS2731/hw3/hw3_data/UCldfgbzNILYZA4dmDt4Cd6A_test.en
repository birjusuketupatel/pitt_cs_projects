Since you don't believe in God, you obviously cannot believe morality is objective since there would be no objective standard in which to base your morality. Why then, do you often treat morality as if it's objective? E.g. Believing you're on the "right" side of history, etc.I don't know if this is the place to post this so sorry if I'm wrong but I've noticed as soon as I watch a secular talk video my recommendations become filled with Ben Shapiro and "Femenist rekd" videos as well as the usual text to speak news channels fawning over trump. Is this something that's common? Youtube targeting viewers of independent left leaning commentators and directing them to the alt right? At the present time, the majority of US governors are GOP. Out of fifty states, thirty-three of them are under a Republican. The damage done by them have been immense, pushing and passing legislation that suppressed voters, restricted abortion rights, enriched corporations and punished workers. However, depending on the state you live in, not every Democrat can be trusted. Some potential candidates are quite progressive and support a Bernie or Bernie-esque platform for their state. But others are "bluedogs", or Republicans in a blue suit. Depending on where you live, please choose wisely in who you vote for. Never forget that there's always more than two parties on your ballot in every election, so vote according to your conscience. Disrupt the status quo, but choose wisely. Take to the airwaves, cyberspace, and the streets to promote your candidate and party of choice, especially if it's third party. It's time to shuffle, to make things interesting. Vote, and vote third party, or vote progressive Democrats/BernieCrats!He's obviously not HuWite International news these past few months have me wondering, has Kyle ever talk much about China and Taiwan much even in the live streams or in Kyle &amp; Corin? The last time I remember he talking about it was about Donald Trump's call with the president of Taiwan. I'm assuming not much? Since he thought Taiwan was a rebel province of China (as the CCP would like you to believe). They are more like North Korea and South Korea without imminent nuclear war (for now). It seems China is making preparations for war against Taiwan sometime in the next 4-10 years. This might be something the next president (hopefully Bernie) is going to have to deal with given the Taiwan Relations Act so I think it is kind of important as far as US-international issues go.This guy believes in an ethno-state and that being white gives you the right to do what ever you want. He says he is opposed to collectivism but he also believes that even though a person is intelligent and smart, because of his race he shouldnt be allowed in America. I would like kyle to do a segment on this guy and his hypocricy. I saw Kyles new neon sign, is he planning on changing the name of the show from Secular Talk to The Kyle Kulinski Show?I remember a funny moment when Kyle said something along the lines of "I know his name is McDonnough, I just like to call him McDonut". The names are most probably completely wrong but I just can't remember it and I remember that joke just made my day because of how he said it.

Thank you.Watching TYT live with Kyle rn. Anyone else think he is hot as fuck? His free speech absolutism and consistent principles make me wet. Also his faceCan someone post the invite code? I saw a link for it on an older post but it won't let me join, I think it may have expired. Much appreciated Kyle has mentioned repeatedly that the Trump administration is trying to include some of the worst provisions of the TPP into the NAFTA renegotiation. Can anyone here point me to a source which supports this claim? I did some searching but couldn't come up with any. Thanks!What is truly interesting is at 3:26 when Bernie's bodyguard gets tired of Alex and brings up Sandy Hook, you see at 3:29 Bernie reach out his hand to tell his bodyguard to calm down and not stoop to Alex's level... Bernie is of the best among us...﻿

Same thing about WW3 since 2014.

It is not about chances of making sense. It would never make sense. It is about chances of Putin or Kim-jong Un wanting a really bad and dumb thing.

School shooters tend to write manifestos or make videos about the reasons. The 2011 Norway mass shooter Brevik wrote a whole book. Putin gave dumb reasons about his Ukraine invasion. If he decides to start WW3, he will give just slightly more dumb reasons.

Method of violence matters: Like school shooters probably would not like to kill with timed bombs or poison gas, Putin probably would not like using nukes anywhere or chemical weapons on frontline battles. Kim-jong Un also would try to invade and conquer, which means using artillery shells on defensive positions, not on civilian population in Soul...

Korean war 2 could be part of WW3.

Korean war 2 could have more casualties than WW3 without new Korean war, assuming no nukes and same duration. Border between EU+Ukraine+Norway and Russia is more sparsely populated than Korea border, and other reasons and possible reasons...

Seems likely that ww3 would cost far more lives than second Korean War, but it could be in different order. There is a possibility of korean war 2 being worse than ww3, meaning that low bound for ww3 is lower than high bound for kw2. If they last the same amount of time. These are extremely inaccurate to estimate. Many unknowns.
And has anyone ever tweeted him to make an appearance? Kyle says the the US says it's in Afghanistan because "the Taliban wants to implement Sharia". This is not true. The US does not cite this justification at all. Let's take a look at [the president's own words](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-strategy-afghanistan-south-asia/) for why we're in Afghanistan:
&gt;"In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us"

This is all very public. Why doesn't Kyle acknowledge this? Instead Kyle strawmans the US' reasoning for staying in Afghanistan (stopping Sharia) so he can paint the US war aim as hypocritical. If fighting Sharia really were the US's war aim, then it indeed would be hypocritical and we should leave. But it's not.

Since Kyle cares about facts and evidence, he probably wants some for the existence of terrorist organizations in Afghanistan. Guess what? [There are already 23 in Afghanistan right now](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kabul-afghanistan-capital-under-siege-while-americas-longest-war-rages-on-60-minutes/), while the US is still there fighting.
&gt;21 international terrorist groups are operating in this country. – Afghan prime minister Ashraf Ghani
Imagine how many more would set up shop there if we left? Kyle hasn't talked about these facts, and I don't know why.I just watched the video Kyle did on Dave Rubin's newest Joe Rogan appearance and I just have to say that I admire him for taking something so ridiculous and still having the ability to first acknowledge that it is ridiculous but after that debate it on its merits and disect it point by point.
I coincidentally watched the videos Sam Seder and Michael Brooks did on the same podcast earlier today and while they were hilarious, I have to say if I were to be a conservative or libertarian leaning young person, they would come off as highly unlikeable and smug even tho they are actually right.
And well I just have to thank Kyle for being so reasonable even with lunatics.I feel like this has been going on for months now. I keep getting Ben Shapiro videos recommended to me on YouTube. And no matter how many of those videos I flag as 'Not Interested', they just keep popping up. Wondering if it has anything to do with watching Kyle's videos, as he does talk about Ben Shapiro every once in a while. But even then it doesn't really make much sense because Kyle will only ever talk about Ben Shapiro ever once in a while anyway. Oh well, YouTube's algorithms have sucked for a long time now so I guess I should just get used to it.I have a strong recollection of him interviewing her but I cannot seem to find the video. Does anyone wanna help me out?Now Juctice Kennedy has retired, so you think the Democrats will filibuster till the 2020 election? Free Speech was on their platform and when were were not looking it was eliminated.  This is on the platform of Brand New Congress.  

## Racial Justice

**It seems nowadays that our elected officials are more concerned with denying racism than actually addressing the rampant inequality plaguing communities of color. Brand New Congress will finally address the injustice that denies people of color the opportunities and rights they deserve.**

**Our nation was founded on slavery and genocide, and we have never been able to escape that legacy.** 

The SJW are taking over our left-wing libertarian movement. If you push the Trump-Russia conspiracy theory smoke screen that is set up by Hillary then you’ve lost my respect! You are no longer a real fighter, you’re a compromiser but it’s about integrity not purity! Case:  Me.

I never said anything banworthy.  I didn't attack people personally.  All I did was contribute conservative commentary and was critical of the left wing.  I asked for a reason for my ban.  None was given.

I was banned.  I would love if Kyle did his show on YouTube in conjunction with an iTunes podcast. They have video podcasts, I don't see why Kyle can't make it happen Spending a fair amount of my time on "political Youtube", I frequently stumble upon Videos like: 
"Ben Shapiro Reveals The Lies In [...]" 
"Steven Crowder OWNS [...]"
"Ben Shapiro Destroys [...]"
This type of video usually works by this strategy: We see a rather right leaning commentator introducing us to the subject, telling us that he needs to debunk the lies/ craziness/ silliness of a particular segment/ speech/ person. This introduction is followed by a simple pattern: A few seconds of a clip is played, to which the commentator then presents his arguments. For the viewer it appears to be a debate in which the commentator has an infinite amount of time, while the commented person can never respond to any arguments. Long story short, the segments usually appear quite convincing and one sided. 
It seems to me that, for people not familiar with political substance who want to get a basic orientation, these type of videos are the easiest to access, and drastic in the way they shape perception of and sympathy for different political actors or commentators. There is no easier and faster way to get someone to agree with you as a person and to build a connection between "the left" and lies. The ability to specifically chose bad and unclear material of people, who are otherwise acting and talking much more intelligently, to represent your political opponents, increases these possibilities.
Of course Kyle is doing something similar on air, by showing/ playing a short videoclip, and afterwards commenting on the shown. But for me it lacks the sort of impact, the feeling of an easily won debate, as well as the ability to hook newly interested people with the title alone. 
What do you guys think? Do you prefer the content as it is, or do you also wish for Kyle (and other left wing commentators) to use the mentioned approach? I think it would avoid the 50% rule that he normally applies to the question whether or not he should "debate" other political voices.Any cool political  books, u guys could recommend 

Thanks https://youtu.be/KnNWsGcU_ScI sort of just realized that this Freudian theory sums up why Trump won the election, and why republicans win elections in general. The republicans appeal to the id, which makes up our basic primal instincts of aggression and xenophobia, which humans have always used to keep themselves safe from immediate danger. The democrats attempt to rouse the super ego of the voters, which is the moralizing part of our psyches that give pushback to our ids. However, our super egos are simply less potent than our ids, and are essentially only used to dilute the extreme decision making proposed by our ids. It is ultimately our egos that balance these three competing forces, and it seems to be the most powerful in people who are successful decision makers. The ego is our capacity for realism and critical thought that protects our self interest in the long run, rather than the immediate present, like the id. If democrats were not corrupt corporatists, and they ran Bernie Sanders style progressive politicians that are realists about our corrupt system, I think they could appeal to the ego of the American people, which instinctually would take precedent over our the draw of the id. I think the majority of people do know what's good for them, when it comes to making decisions that propagate their own personal success. We need common sense, realist liberal politicians that are actually willing to fight the dangerous reactionaries on the right. Otherwise I think humanity will fall victim to the effects of an unchecked id, which will be the end of ushttp://www.wbur.org/npr/558788556/george-w-bush-slams-bigotry-politics-of-populism-that-led-to-trump-sanders

^^in which our public radio equates trumpist bigotry with sanders "populism"I'm trying to turn myself into Kyle Kulinski. I figured that if I drink enough seltzer, that I would gain his wisdom and political knowledge thus giving me the ability to ace all my classes. I drink a seltzer a day and I can already see the transformation take place. The seltzer is giving me magical powers one might not expect. 
-It has given me the ability to read the cover of a book, and know all it's contents before I even read it. 
-It has given me charisma that is so powerful, that my YouTube comments and Reddit posts are getting more likes because I have harnessed the power of the seltzer. 
-it has made my knowledge in politics grow so much that not even the president can 
match the wisdom I have gained through the seltzer with his own.

I'm hoping if I drink two or three seltzers a day, I would become the most powerful man on earth, and give me enough charisma to win the presidency and enact a policy that would replace tap water with seltzer thus giving everyone the ability to harness the power of the seltzer.I know David Pakman and the Humanist Report... Any other?

And yes, I know TYT, but they say stupid shit too often, can't watch it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj8LYgwW-Jw 

[Though I find him interrupting earlier rude, but I can see why. It's also comedy gold.]Anyone see Kyle destroy that conservative on drunken peasants tonight?like the show, like how he represents both sides, but i would like to practice my spanish while catching up on the political news. does anyone know of a show with a similar layout and nonbiased host?Before I start...I have been subscribed to Kyle for over 2 years. I like him and watch Kyle and Corin all the time too. But there's some things I can't stand/

1. Healthcare- Kyle always cites a Harvard study that said 45k ppl die due to lack of healthcare, but it came out in 2009. Almost TEN years ago. This was before Obamacare, which love it or hate it covered 20 million more Americans. I think his numbers are just outdated. This is important especially since he always makes the moral argument as to why we should have single payer healthcare. He also always brings up how Medicare only has an overhead cost of 3 percent, which is true. BUT on national level this number would go up and sometimes administrative costs help with the delivery of care so it's not totally fair to bash on it.
2. Taxes- At 5:15 in the video titled: Charlie Kirk: Trump Gave Us 'Relative World Peace" Kyle says that 83 percent of the tax cuts will go to the top 1 percent. That will only be true in 10 years. Right now the middle class is seeing cuts

"In 2018, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, the top 1% of income earners would glean 20.5% of the tax cut benefits — a sizable chunk, but far less than the figure that’s preferred by Democrats. And in 2025, that percentage would be 25.3%, with the top 1% (those earning above $837,800) getting an average tax cut of $61,090. Just two years later, in 2027, the percentage of tax benefits to this income group jumps to 82.8%."

3. Venezuela and Bernie Sanders- I love Bernie and voted for him in the primary but there's some stuff about him we should know about. He praised Venezuela in 2011.

"These days, the American dream is more apt to be realized in South America, in places such as Ecuador, Venezuela and Argentina, where incomes are actually more equal today than they are in the land of Horatio Alger. Who's the banana republic now?"

EDIT: This point can be debunked 8/2/18

Also, Bernie drives a 180k$ sports car. I like him but even as a fan, this is bad optics for sure.

4. Kyle always says we are \*currently bombing eight different countries. Which ones? I feel like he's counting countries we bombed years ago.

I get the feeling he just read this headline and also counted Niger after that botched raid.

"U.S. Bombed Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia in 2016"

[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-bombed-iraq-syria-pakistan-afghanistan-libya-yemen-somalia-n704636](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-bombed-iraq-syria-pakistan-afghanistan-libya-yemen-somalia-n704636)

EDIT: Removed the AOC one. She says silly stuff but I was being too hard on her.  Like saying 200 million Americans make less than 20k a year on Trevor Noah's show. Saying that unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs in an interview with Margaret Hoover on PBS. Saying that the upper middle class doesn't exist anymore. Saying Shapiro was "catcalling" for asking to debate her. I'm nitpicking here but she also sounded very unsure of herself when talking about Israel/Palestine but gave a decent answer. I'd vote for her over a corporate Dem in a heartbeat, but she still says silly stuff And you don’t want to understand this because you have an Antichrist spirit and love to bash people of faith which as Jesus said “by their fruits you will know them”! He said that he is going to appear there a few days ago and I was trying to figure out how I could watch him without a TV with fox news.  Any advice?Holy shit, Kyle absolutely wiped the floor with them in this discussion. The first time he was on Fox he seemed less aggressive and for the most part let people talk over him. He gave ZERO shits this time and became this fact spewing machine.

I don't think the guy on the left gave ANY form of data during that entire discussion.On Aug 4 Secular Talk posted a video titled " Neocon Bill Kristol Considering 2020 Run For President" in which he urged his supporters to create a petition on [Change.org](https://Change.org). That Petition has been created in a very awesome way by Ant Del of Chicago, and the game is on! Please take a moment to sign the petition, and according to Kyle, it will be promoted on Secular Talk!

Kyle's call to action: [https://youtu.be/DolI3vYQhHQ?t=150](https://youtu.be/DolI3vYQhHQ?t=150)

The Bill Kristol Petition: [https://www.change.org/p/bill-kristol-for-president](https://www.change.org/p/bill-kristol-for-president)

# 

https://i.redd.it/68dldlncjce11.jpg1) He agreed with them that the policies that progressives are pushing were far-left which could’ve allowed them talk about Venezuela which I’m glad they didn’t cos Kyle would’ve had a stoke. Like he’s said before the policies his pushing like Medicare for all, free college, New New Deal aren’t really that radical and are pretty moderate in a conventional political spectrum because he doesn’t call for the overthrow capitalism and plus he didn’t mention the hammer of how every other post-industrial country has universal healthcare 

2) He didn’t call out the bullshit strawman in the clip of the progressives being fiscally irresponsible and ignorant of tax rates and should’ve call out how Trump’s tax plan gave out 81% of the Benefits to the top 1% and how the the top 1% own as much wealth as about the bottom 80% of something like that. He should mentioned how tax increases on the rich are a way of redistributing the wealth to the bottom. Plus like AOC said on TYT before people always question how the left will pay for things but never asks the right how will corporate welfare or endless wars be paid for. A lot of medicare for all advocates cite that, yes, taxes will have to be raised to pay for medicare for all. Note that you now don't have to pay premiums, co-pays and deductibles, and you replace those payments with an increase in your taxes.

Obviously this means poor people pay the less / nothing in taxes, middle class pays maybe a little less / little more or the same overall in taxes and the wealthy pay a large amount more (because even a 3 or 5% tax increase on millions or billions of dollars is obviously a lot more than they were previously paying in private healthcare premiums, even for top tier plans).

But what about pitching medicare for all, based entirely on raising taxes on people in the top end income brackets?

I haven't heard this pitch made at all. I'm curious. Can anyone out there take a stab in the dark, given current estimates of healthcare costs under a single payer system, what would income tax have to increase by on the top 2 tax brackets (people making basically 200k+ single, 400k+ couples) to in order to pay for a medicare for all system (Given of course the 2 to 3 trillion dollars saved overall from cost savings and all the normal talking points)?If Kyle is going to do these shows I think he should also engage in some literature. I've read bits and pieces of it over the years, it's beyond silly. I think Kyle needs to take it down, maybe a chapter per stream. Anyone else up for that?What did the fixer do? Transfer all files from the physically functional hard drive to external storage like USB stick?

Was the hard drive solid state or spinning? Was the OS Windows, Linux or mac OS  etc...Just proves that the establishment wing is in bed with the SJW wing.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJIt4uv9x4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJIt4uv9x4)https://i.redd.it/bj0iryrzrcf11.pngI think Cenk and Kyle are the biggest left progressive voices on Youtube, and Shapiro is the biggest on the right. As you probably know, Cenk already debated Shapiro at Politicon last year. I thought Cenk lost mostly because he started to insult the crowd, but both made good points and I loved the back and forth between the two. 

If Kyle were to ever debate Shapiro, I think he'd do better than Cenk as he's not as emotional and SJW- assuming it's just the two of them in a room (plus a moderator) without an audience clapping at every other sentence. 

With Shapiro attacking AOC this week, I think it's more likely than not that we see Kyle and Ben finally meet up this year. 

Does anyone else want to see this happen? The notion that Venezuela and Scandinavian countries have parallel economic policies has been repeatedly asserted by Kyle, Jimmy Dore, and a  slough of other progressives.

I love Kyle, but why does he assert this? Doesn't he know the difference between capitalist and post-capitalist states?If the choice between a Justice Dem and corporate Dem is so obvious, why don't the JD have more success?But, I mean... Space Force!

Let me be clear, probably a bad idea.

But who else kinda wants a Space Force?

We could distract him from his stupid fucking border wall, and maybe get some cool science shit out of it.     Plus, Space Force!I myself would identify to a slightly right leaning libertarian, but I always enjoy watching Kyle and David (Pakman)'s shows, just to make sure I get both sides of the news. However, after almost a year of watching both shows, both David and Kyle seems to agree on most points, but are heavily divided when it comes to Russia.

Do you think the whole Russia shtick has some truth to it, or is it just another MSM hysteria?Kyle just put up a video covering Tucker Carlson. The problem here is there is a segment like that on Fox everyday. It’s what they talk about when they don’t talk about Russia. There are real people tuning into this and believing this. I’ve been shot down at college debates because I’m a “socialist” I don’t identify as a socialist nor do I agree with it but Fox News says I am one so who cares about facts. Everyone on both sides gets riled up about the word Nazi being used all the time but I’ve heard socialist get thrown at people a lot more and no one seems to bat an eye. Acronym derived from some current understandings or from something it should be, including joke definitions that would fit some common sentences.Given the Russiagate narrative has been taking an interesting turn of late, I wanted to see what the thoughts of the people in this sub have regarding RT news?

Does anyone know Kyle's position on them and specifically how they are being portrayed by western media? Do you believe they are a "propaganda" wing for the Kremlin such as many are saying?

Any other information or thoughts you may have are appreciated as I am trying to get opinions on them for multiple places.and how come it’s not in the TYT app even with pid membership?He needs to get it on Spotify or Pocketcasts or something. It'd be great if I could just say "This is so sad. Alexa, play the Kyle Kulinski Show." whenever I wanna get woke.

Seriously though. Blogtalk Radio is annoying as hell to use, and the audio quality is awful.The only arguments I hear against sanders/Cortez that sound valid are ones revolving around economics claiming that their policies will bankrupt America and so on. I would like to know if there’s any merit behind these claims or if not why they are wrong?Kyle, before you do a video in response to Trump's tweet about South African farm killings, please read these two articles:
https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-statistics-farm-attacks-murders-sa/

https://mg.co.za/article/2018-03-23-00-radical-right-plugs-swart-gevaar&gt;	Disclaimer: 
Hello all together, I am German and English is not my first language, so I ask for forgiveness if I use the wrong word now and then.

&gt;	I watch American news for two reasons: first, I understand the language. Secondly, at the moment American politics is like a reality show for us, it doesn't really influence our lives, but is very entertaining in contrast to the boring German politics, where in 2015 there was the disscusion, where Merkel is to receive the Nobel Peace Prize because of her refugee politics or rather her husband for his achievements in the field of quantum chemistry...
End of Disclaimer

I would like to highlight two topics, the first is sad and the second a little amusing.

The first is, as the title suggests, the distinction between democratic socialism and social democracy:

You may not know this, but Germany was once divided into West Germany and East Germany.  In the East there was socialism and in the West there was social democracy, or as our constitution calls it, social market economy.  In between there was a wall.  At this wall were soldiers who were ordered to shoot anyone who was to flee from east to west in the head.

I would like to say to all those who say that this is only a semantic difference that they should say exactly that to the faces of the relatives and friends of these victims!



The amusing topic consists of two points and has to do with Karl Max:

Maybe you know these two German guys: the philosopher Karl Marx and the PR-man Friedrich Engels. Marx is in the line of Hegel. That explains a lot. At the moment we have officially "Marx Year" in Germany, since he was born 200 years ago. This leads to many small local Marx discussion forums, some of which are even broadcast in the capitalist mainstream media.

Both Marx and Engels were sons of relatively successful and wealthy capitalists. Marx has written the thick books like "Das Kapital", Engels has written small summaries for the "stupid" workers and bored Bohemians. 
 
When Marx was asked about his idiology at the end of his life, he said: "I don't know what I am.  But I certainly know I'm not a Marxist!" ;)

The second point is that Marx only recommended communism for very advanced societies. He said that technical progress is only possible through capitalism. But capitalism will eventually lead to four to five monopolistic companies that own everything. And it was only at this point that this company was expropriated - Russia, you did everything wrong in 1917!

However, today the Chinese chief idiologists use exactly this argument: since China is still a developing country in their eyes, you have to play hardcore capitalism in order to be able to counter glorious communism in the future.  According to Marx, you have no other choice! ;)


TL;DR: socialism in east Germany, social democraty in West Germany. Wall in between. Many dead refugees.1) Where he reacts to a pastor preaching some fundamentalist thing and saying "Well glory"

2) Where he talks about how poor white conservatives see themselves as undiscovered millionaires and blame poor people of color for keeping them down

3) I don't think this is on his channel, but Kyle went on someone else's show, and near the beginning they talked about how conservatives define the word "establishment" differently. The other guy sounded like he had an Australian accent. When he explained how he thought they defined it to Kyle, he said something like "Dude, I've never thought of it like that but tht makes so much sense" or something.

If you know what these videos' titles are or can link them I much appreciate itEurope needs to drastically and immediately change its immigration policy.

First of all, I am a progressive atheist. I adopt these labels because I put objectivity over feelings. I care about what is true rather than what I *want* to be true. I wish it were so that we lived in a happy world where the free market gave everyone a fair chance, and that a magical being had a plan for the good of all of our lives. These assertions are fantasy.

Conversely, I would love to believe, as many other liberals seem to have deluded themselves into thinking, that people of all different religious and cultural backgrounds could coexist in close quarters, without causing massive problems. This claim is equally fantastic. Immigration into Europe has been disastrous, and this can be irrefutably proved by a simple analysis of the numbers.

There have been 10 major terrorist attacks in Paris since the beginning of 2015. No modern US city has experienced this degree of frequency in mass killings, and we're the 'shooting spree' country. Tourism to Paris - which was a critical part of the city's economy - has gone down 30% due to fear of terror attacks (amidst other possible factors too, such as the common complaints that the city smells of human urine). Countless other attacks have occured in other European nations.

Terrorism, however, is not even the tip of the iceberg. Rates of forcible rape and other sex crimes in Sweden tripled between 2011 (when the influx of migrants started) and 2015, and yet Sweden has continued to take in more migrants since. My personal friend from Germany recently visited the US, and she tells me that as a 19 year old girl, she's terrified of going out at night because she knows that refugees are on the prowl and regularly grab young women, but she's scared of worse. Going back to the topic of Paris, certain taverns and restaurants in the Paris metro area deny women service and entry, as such public independence of women is unheard of in their culture. Don't take my word for it, look up the videos where French female journalists go inside these restaurants and are immediately shouted at by multiple men to leave. (Side note: the chances of American feminists talking about these issues is roughly negative one-thousand percent... Mansplaining, manspreading and dirty language are much bigger priorities.)

London recently reported a crime rate almost as high as that of New York City. This might not sound alarming to us Americans, as we take for granted that inner cities are dangerous. But what Americans don't understand is that this is not the case in other developed nations, or at least, didn't used to be. Luckily, there's still Japan and South Korea. Speaking of South Korea, the threat of mass migration from Africa and the Middle East isn't just alt-right propaganda, as some wish to claim. Earlier this summer when South Korean parliament was considering allowing a ship full of Yemeni refugees in to the country, thousands of South Koreans protested for the security of their country carrying signs with messages such as "we don't want to end up like Europe" and "fake refugees go home right now."

If you think there are no repercussions to a democracy, you are dead wrong. 40% of British Muslims want Sharia law to be at least partially enforced by the UK parliament. With 2.6 million British Muslims, That's over 1 million of them. And if you think Islam has nothing to do with rape, terrorism, and public segregation, you're an idiot. But if you think Islam has nothing to do with Sharia law... there are no words to describe your willful ineptitude.

Western civilization is the hearth of the ideals of liberty, equality, secularism and other virtues of the enlightenment. If we allow it to fall, then there is no beacon of hope for the rest of the world. I'll leave you with the words of Christopher Hitchens, who lived his whole life slaying religious people's bullshit.

"Islamophobia: a word created by fascists, used by cowards, to manipulate morons."I’ve recently been having discussions on r/subredditcancer with users. Unfortunately many users just seem to be illogical/oppressive people angry they got banned for legitimate reasons. However some of them were banned for illegitimate ones which is serious, thus why I comment there.

This means a lot of the users there are very aggressive, illogical, and will denounce your argument with insults and not 1 substantive rebuttal. And yet other users will buy right into it when none of it makes logical sense.

What is the most effective way you have found of combatting this Ad Hominem behavior when having discussions?So a few months back my youtube auto played an episode of Secular Talk, and it was an older episode with the bookshelf in the background, and I think half way through the episode Kyle goes on a tangent about the protestant work ethic and how alcoholics actually significantly helped the labor movement push for the 40 hour work week, weekends off, etc. I thought it was really interesting, but of course I didn't save it and now for the life of me I can't find it again. Anyone know what I'm talking about?Which Kyle and Corin was it where Kyle was doing a Harvey Weinstein's Jewish mother impression? In the beginning of the the 2016 democratic primary most of democrat voters have never heard of Bernie sanders but by April a majority of democratic voters knew who Bernie sanders was that when the media started to aggressively attack Bernie sanders as a non realistic candidate. This actually worked for the main reason being that the progressive didn't have a good popular media websites and social media like the right wing trump supporters had example being Breitbart which had over 70 million visits per month. Infowars website was breaking over 20 million visits per month. This are incredible amounts of reach so when the meanstream media attacked trump supporters it was basically useless because the rightwing media could counterattack easily and reach enough audience to get the message out but this is not the case for progressives that were being attacked the Mainstream media. The progressive could not reach the democratic base. i have a personal experience with this when the primary in Georgia was happening i saw 10,000s of pro hillary signs and i asked the hillary supporters why the were supporting hillary over Bernie and they all said that she was more experienced and that bernie plan was not realistic the same thing media is feeding them. this will mostly likely occur again in 2020. what do you guys thinkI actually had a little bit. Upon hearing about the "troll factory" all I could think was does anyone actually buy this? Who really thinks Trolls had any significant impact? Then I remembered Correct the Record, a PAC that supplied Clinton with what is basically the equivalent of these Russian Trolls.

Thing is they were mostly used in the context of bernie v hillary in the primary, but I wonder if there are CTR Trolls still shilling.

Any thoughts /findings?The fact is this:  You guys are losing on the issues.  The Russia investigation is going nowhere, you lost every special election, you're not getting Medicare for All or Universal healthcare.  You're not getting gun control.  Trump's travel plan is going through.  The Wall is in the process of construction.

So all you have left is to cry like snowflakes.  The fact is this:  I'm a moderate, but I side with Republicans because you guys are against free speech and expression.  You can't handle that, so you attempt to suppress the voices of your opponents.  

So please, block me from this subreddit so I can claim victory on my YT channel by putting a screenshot of the screen as I am doing with the discord.  Or don't, and I'll happily do a daily review of the posts on this subreddit and gain subscribers off of your inane stupidity.

The fact is this:  You're going to have to pay for your own college, your own healthcare, and your own government programs.  Attempting to put a muzzle on conservative voices does not help you one bit.  

Or, you can do what I am happily willing to do with any of you, including the buffoon Kyle himself, and stand toe-to-toe with me in a battle of ideas and understand why exactly you are wrong.  I don't care either way.

If you want to seeMost states have elections today. I nearly forgot but went out to cast my ballot. Don't forget! Bernie is a very very smart man. He knows the difference between Socdem and Demsoc. This is a dude who quotes Eugene V. Debs, a socialist who ran for president and got 4th place while in a jail cell and also was a co-founder of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), he reads and retweets Jacobin magazine, a socialist magazine, and he even was friends and had a relationship with Green Anarchist and Libertarian Socialist Murray Bookchin

Bernie simply comes off as a social democrat simply because he needs to water down his policies a bit, but he stands for socialist beliefs. Free health care, a living wage, free college.I know this is a left-wing subreddit, but I'm curious as to who y'all would vote for who's to the right of you politically.

I live in Virginia, and I bit the bullet and voted for Gillespie in the recent election, mostly to spite the Democratic Party, but also because I *really* liked Gillespie's proposed ethics reforms, as well as his favorable stance on restoring voting rights to ex-cons (I voted for Northam's running mate, Fairfax, because he was in favor of it as well).

Bonus points will be issued inverse to how libertarian your pick is.It seems like Kyle would rather have people remain in poverty rather than go to the city with jobs.  Pollution is INFINITELY better than living on a rice patty or other type of farm for your entire life, but in the name of environmentalist stupidity, Kyle is for regulations for developing nations.

We talk about Naziism being a major problem, and most of it is sadly coming from the left wing.  Fact is that while Israel has made some mistakes, it is a far better nation than any other in the Middle East, and has been a wonderful partner to the world and a tireless worker and contributor to UN efforts (what exist).  Fact is that Israel is tolerant of diversity, even moreso than Western nations.  Not only do Israelis tolerate Arabs, but they serve in the government at higher rates than their percentage of the population.

And you want to talk about apartheid?  Liberals love to pick on Israel, yet ignore the blatant apartheid conditions in south Chicago, which actually do rival those of South Africa when it was prevalent.  South Chicago's conditions are more miserable than any part of the nation, yet liberals don't talk about it.

Yet they have the gull to talk about Israel, a nation that tolerates people of all backgrounds, which has a higher atheist population than the United States and treats their secular populations well.  Here's an idea, try to be an atheist in Palestinian administered territory and see how far you go.  Go uncovered and act freely as a woman.  Better yet, let's wait and see if they ever take the destruction of Israel out of their documents.  

Leftists are antisemitic Muslim apologists these days, and this is what Sargon has hit a nerve about and he is right about.Granted his actions that we know of this point aren't as bad as trump or Moore, but I still think he should resign or should be called to for the sake of consistency.I've increasingly become disillusioned and disenchanted by the left's obsession with moralizing. By that, I mean the tendency to fall on emotional appeals and "cuz it's right" argumentation. Pakman touched on this to a certain extent in his video about racial IQ differences - people on the left don't want to even look at the data, because "das raycis". And as we all know, if something's racist, it *can't* be true? Right? Well, no. Something being racist doesn't *necessarily* make it false. A black dude getting lynched isn't wrong because it's a racist act. It's wrong because as a society we condemn murder, and murder is condemned because if civilization condones murder, you create a society wherein trust breaks down between its individual members because nobody is safe in such a paradigm; we sacrifice the freedom to murder in exchange for the security that comes with keeping others from murdering you with impunity.

I recently watched the first *Kingsmen* movie, and in it, Samuel L Jackson's character tries to kill 99% of the world's population in order to save Earth's ecosystem. He's not *wrong* - because that *would* save Earth's ecosystem. It's just "wrong" from a moral standpoint. Which, again, doesn't disprove the villain's thesis.

Where am I going with this? Well, so often, I see the left engaging in moralizing that effectively constitutes nothing more than fart-sniffing virtue-signalling. I catch flak all the time from other people on the left, because I'm in favor of strong borders and merit-based immigration polices. "You raycis!" is not a rebuttal of my position. All it is, is highfalutin name-calling. The Young Turks are especially guilty of this. So many of their hot takes on various news stories are nothing more than pretentious finger-wagging and pearl-clutching. And I can't stand it. I would prefer actual critical thinking to kneejerk accusations of racism, sexism and other thought-terminating cliches.

I can't stand how very religious it all is. It's a manifestation of the modern progressive's lineage, which goes back to (and perhaps this might surprise some of you) New England Puritanism. Yes, the same Puritans who established the theocratic Massachusetts Bay Colony and killed people for witchcraft in Salem. The Puritans went on to evolve into abolitionists, as well as suffragists and prohibitionists. You can draw a historical line from Puritanism to progressivism. It's really not hard to see it - the archetype of the moral busybody is alive and well, and the drive to change society towards some vision of progress has clear theological parallels. Perhaps that's why I'm not surprised that Ben Dixon has started escalating his advocacy for liberation theology. He's wrong, but at least he's honest.

Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think moralism has any place on the left. It's not rational, but emotional. It's the fuel that powers the sort of SJW atavism that so many on this subreddit claim to be opposed to; Kyle claims to be opposed to them, and yet he speaks their language. I first became politically aware back when Bush was still in office, and back then, I remember the left being so much more anti-authoritarian, so much more edgy, and so much more unapologetic than they are today. That's because the left has become a church. That's why I prefer to hang out with right-wing, shotpost-y types these days. I didn't join the left to be lectured to about how I'm a bad person - I already do that to myself.

Anyway, rant over. Tell me if my frustration resonates with any y'all, or if I'm just being incoherent. I get the feeling that this sub might be more sympathetic than, say the Pakman subreddit - which is honestly a stronghold of the sort of left-wing moralism that I'm talking about.Exciting news.  Kyle will be the special guest on the Drunken Peasants milestone #420 episode.  Where he will be riding on a Sybian sex chair.Guys this next 2 weeks we will see a draconian tax bill be put to a vote, a neck and neck senate special election that could go blue and destroy Donald Trump and Steve Bannon, both in ego and other ways, AND a vote for the future of net neutrality, yet again. All fellow ST fans, get motivated! Call and email senator Flake-Az, Mccain-Az, Murkowski-Al, Collins-Me, Corker-Tn, and Johnson-Wi.

But first thing’s first. If you want to join in this endeavor, you should be a huge cynic when it comes to journalism and the media in its modern form and hopefully have unique and bold thoughts on where it should go in the future. 

This site will be an attempt to do journalism and online content differently. No robotic reporting. No recycled stories. No weak voices.

Instead, we will publish thoughtful pieces in a heavily curated and digestible form—whether they be on culture, religion, politics, video games, war, travel, or anything else on our mind at the time.

The site’s ambition isn’t to strike gold with the masses. We just want to bring cool shit to people who struggle to find a media outlet that speaks to them.

Engaging, challenging, and deeply interesting content is the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth priority and, in turn, a dedicated, niche following will surely come. 

So if you happen to be a badass writer, content creator, reporter, editor, website designer, videographer, etc. with a unique perspective and who wants to do something positive in the world, PM me. 

Let’s do this shiz.


Some desired traits: “I don’t give a fuck” attitude, don't take yourself too seriously, speak and act like a normal person, don't feign objectivity, offer regular hot takes on issues, have a passion for awesome journalism in the vein of Hunter S., Jeremy Scahill, Matt Taibbi etc.Saw Kyle's segment [Study Implies What we Know About Drugs Could be Wrong] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK0EFlW_mm8). Because of the massive idiocy of kyle in this particular segment , I felt the need to correct this very wrong interpretation.

A balance of neurotransmitters in the brain is needed for a proper high functioning brain. Let me tell you what happens when there is too much dopamine in the brain

According to the British Journal of Medicine, increased dopamine in the limbic system is linked to suspicious personality, paranoia and withdrawal from social situations. Drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, cause buildup of dopamine, which leads to drug-induced psychosis or schizophrenia. 

High levels of dopamine in the brain are also found in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who also show impulsive behaviour. Prominently all drugs remove the inhibitions, cognitive, social and others. While that helps in creation, it only helps in creation if it is in small bouts. If you remain high all the time, you lose connection with reality and spew just utter nonsense which may be fast and unheard of but may make absolutely no sense. 

Dopamine also plays a major role in addictions, such as drug, food, alcohol, tobacco, sex and gambling, according to the Journal of Neuroscience. Dopamine forms the pleasure -
 reward  and learned behaviour pathway which is the mechanism of addiction development. Basically, Dopamine release causes pleasure, the pleasure gives the person high, he wants more of it and more often so he learns to increase the frequency and amount of the drug/food/sex/gambling etc consumed to gain more pleasure, This is psychological dependence or cravings. This continues until the person becomes physically dependent on the substance - he gets tremors, seizures and even heart rate abnormalities (aka withdrawal symptoms) as a result and can die. Addictive personalities have been found to have more Dopamine in their brains.

Dopamine also inhibits prolactin from the pituitary. Too much dopamine has been linked to menstrual disorders, delayed puberty, infertility and decreased immunity as per the Journal of Immunology.

Dopamine also helps excrete sodium and reduce levels of insulin. So if too much Dopamine exists n your system, you would be more prone to Diabetes and Salt wasting syndrome.

While maintaining sufficient dopamine levels is beneficial for mental health and physical functioning, too much dopamine can create dysfunction.

What Kyle's study says, I believe. is that Human brain has developed in evolution in such a way that the neurotransmitters are balanced when there is a net higher amount of dopamine in the brain. Unilaterally increasing dopamine will create imbalance and hence have negative effects.

Also, walking in bright sunshine in nature also increases dopamine levels while keeping you within the confines of reality. Which is also why a lot of artists take pensive walks. I would much rather advocate that than getting and staying high all the time.﻿

Hey man, I am all for legalizing weed, but I am all against peddling misunderstood information.David Pakman was recently “invited” to have his podcast on Spotify and man it is a whole lot better than dealing with Blogtalkradio. 

Can everyone tweet @spotify @kylekulinski and ask for Secular Talk to join in on Spotify? #seculartalk

Would be awesome! So im torn between keeping on supporting justice dems or switching over and just supporting the individual candidates, what should i do? How much of the US economic system is being held up by the economy that the "interventions" create at this point? It can't be quite as easy as "just pull out," there are probably a bunch of arms manufacturing deals that only make sense if those arms are being used, contractors being hired that only make an ROI if they still have a warzone, military objectives being budgeted so their success recoups the cost of previous failures, etc.

How much of US industry is caught up in various military ventures? Is pulling out of these countries a even an economically safe thing to do, or am I overestimating the size of the military -industrial complex?I just discovered [DTube](https://d.tube) today, a YouTube-like platform which allows viewers to directly donate to the creator. Therefore, the platform isn't dependent on ad revenue from third-party companies. 
I think it would be great for Secular Talk to try the platform out, as it lowers the hurdle to directly supporting my favourite independent news channel. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odpdV4QUWqY) is an explanatory video on the platform. 
What do you guys think? So if corporatist neo-liberals are "centre-left", and the commies/anarchists/SJWs are "far left", can't we democratic socialists and social democrats describe ourselves as "mid-left"?If you try to go to - https://usagym.org/pages/aboutus/pages/board_of_directors.html

It will redirect to - https://usagym.org/pages/index.html, yes I know this could be due to the "changes" incoming*, or what I thought was a higher than usual amount of traffic wanting to see or record who was on this board now, possibly for the years the abuser was shielded by them.

*Edit: fixed typo
Hey all! I recently wrote an essay on Bernie Sanders, as well as the parallels between Rome and modern America. I'd love for you guys to check it out and let me know what you think!

You can find it at: cuckadoodledoo1453.tumblr.comEvery time some case of corruption pops up or the donors of a specific politician's campaign are listed, it is always framed in a negative way. I think this is counterproductive.

I instead suggest to actively praise politicians for getting sizable contributions from corporations in a smart way. This will introduce an element of competition: For example, when a Senator schemes to net a corporation a Profit of P Dollars for a bribe of B Dollars, the ratio of the bribe to the profit (B/P) should be published. Politicians receiving higher B/P ratios should be praised more.

There are many advantages of this strategy:

* It is now advantageous for a corporation to pay a politician higher bribes, because the very act of the (high) bribe will boost their chances of actually being elected and getting shit done (for the corporation). So bribe prices go up.

* When politicians have more money (e.g. one donation is enough for several campaigns), they will more likely think twice about accepting a bribe, which will also drive up the bribe prices.

* Accepting less instances of bribes will also make the politician more poular, because of less instances of scandals and getting more shit done for their actual constituency, because doing their actual work would now conflict less with positions »lobbied for« by corporations.

* When bribe prices rise significantly, e.g. when politicians want 50% of the profits, as opposed to the measly four to five figure Dollar amounts they receive now, bribes will get less efficient and therefore other options might turn out to be more attractive to corporations.

So now everybody go praise the Republicans! (And also the Democrats)So about this nonsense. The GOP in michigan is have been reported to be thinking about legalizing recreational marijuana in order to reduce voter turn out. That's kinda fucked up with their motives but at the same time , weed, so I'm split. It's a great change, for the wrong reasons.I respect what he does, and he does do some good work, but I feel as if he comes across as a bit smug, self important and his tendency towards incrementalism is a bit irritating. Also in general I feel as though his show pales in comparison to Secular Talk. How do you guys feel about the recent tweet posted by Sadiq Khan. Will pushing new knife control legislation reduce the murder rate the same way new gun control legislation would? If not, why would he tweet such a thing? äéíöü kind of shit. on all his videos. why???LISTEN.

There are more Ben Shapiro videos on Transgender people and data than just his 'why arent you 60' video. I actually was hoping that Hbomberguy would make a debunking video on this I want to bring this Information out, just in case. Knowing you, I think that you will find also more arguments. I hope that these videos and articles are a good help for you to start. Ben Shapiro needs a good take down and rebutal on his claims about transgender people and data. Also his question 'why arent you 60'  is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid. The more accurate comparison would be maturity of someone, you know like foe example 10 year olds which brains are mature faster than others, and have a brain of a 40 year old or the other way around, adults who still have the brain of usually a 5 year old. PLEASE Kyle, i know you can to this, please debunk Ben Shapiro's (and others like steven crowder, black pigeon speaks maybe?) claims about Transgender people and data ONCE AND FOR ALL &lt;333
It's seriously starting to fall into Alex Jones territory. Asserting with no evidence that the chemical attacks in Syria must be false flags, willful contrarianism on Russia, and moreover the *constant* fearmongering about World War III happening any day now.

Has he never cracked open a history book about the Cold War in his life? He makes it sound like we've never been closer to WWIII than now, when the shit that went down during the actual cold war, with our spies killing theirs, our planes shooting down theirs, on and on for decades, makes all this look like child's play. To say nothing of the fact that Kyle constantly makes Russia out to be 100% innocent in all this, like they're not escalating at all, like Putin wants nothing but to be left alone, when he's just as imperialist if not moreso than the US federal government. 

Personally, Kyle lost all credibility in my eyes on this issue when he told Cenk in the Russia debate, in no uncertain terms, if Putin invades Estonia, we shouldn't try and stop him. Like that's when it dawned on me that Kyle is a full blown isolationist and that our allies really don't mean a damn to him, and that he may even have some kind of Russian sympathies. 

Anyone else? Wondering what sources you all are considering when lookinging for info on the chemical attack in Syria? And how you are weighing out the difference in the information from parisan biased sources, or the differences between western media sources and non?

I'd love to be able to play the entire show as a single video that the clips are taken from if anyone knows if those are kept somewhere.

Even if it was something that was just for patreons, I'd be totally down for that.What is the stance of justice democrats on bitcoinPersonally, I'd swear on my copy of the *Bhagavad Gita*. I'm not a Hindu, but I enjoyed reading it. It's thousands of years older than the Bible and ***way*** more interesting and better-written.

Second place for me is the young adult novelization of *Jurassic Park 3*. Not for any symbolic or esoteric reason. Just to troll people who think you have to swear your oath on a Bible.

Third is *Might Makes Right* - a genuinely terrifying book that advocates for violent social Darwinism and sociopathy; one part of the book is specifically dedicated to condemning Christ for his pacifism (which is the part of the book I actually agree with, for the record). Again, mostly just to troll, and because I happen to own a copy.Kyle often talks about how America's overton window has shifted far to the right over recent decades. So, how do we push the overton window back to a more sane position? 

This issue I see in the way of this goal is the same one that JD faces, erasure by the mainstream media. I don't think I've ever seen a TV pundit talk about how far to the right America has shifted. 

Maybe activists can go out to where on the ground reporters are and start bringing up issues that get erased by our media. They'd be unable to ignore us then.It is evident that there is an effort this past year to stifle views and thoughts, on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube and even Shopify. Generally, tech giants are clamping down on content and heavily enforcing content policies. 

What does this community think of such developments?It was good while it lasted, I guess.As it is likely obvious by my username, I do not find kyles arguments compelling for atheism. However, I do watch the show to challenge my own views, and I do make an effort to meet atheist arguments at their strongest points. I think Kyle should do the same and I suggest he have the YouTuber mathoma on the show. If he has debated a religious person I'd be happy to look at it.I swear to you, I was on the David Pakman reddit and saw a link to one of Kyle's thumbnails and it straight up looked like a screen cap out of a south park episodes.

This is even before we get to his presentation which can vary from mild to totally animated and manic.

Am I wrong here?     I'm new to Reddit. I've just subscribed to a bunch of left wing and right wing subreddits to post this. I've listened to Secular Talk for years. Kyle was my hero in High School, and I would constantly debate conservative teachers with a lot of Kyle's substance. This is going to be super lengthy but I ask for anyone to read all of this. This pertains to the social justice antics that are destroying liberalism. We've seen it with how JD has fallen apart. I have a story that happened to me that perfectly embodies how toxic this really is. Please read it all of it, and if anyone responds I will provide photos, and all the documentation mentioned in this text. I'm providing a link to what I've written.First, his twitter was reportedly inaccessible for hours. Second, the US navy tweets out his name in quotations (deleted 2 mins later, supposedly a mistake while auditing the trending terms).

Sheesh, interesting stuff. Wonder what the hell happened. Still awaiting a statement from Twitter.Jerusalem is an accursed place. Since the death of Moses and Aaron, the seat of Judaism has been nothing but marinated in the blood of the innocent, from civil war, conquests, and religious fanaticism. While there is no harm in defending one self from persecution or invasion, it is another matter entirely in instigating religious persecution and oppression. The Heavenly City has been a hell for generation upon generation. If any people are to worship freely and in peace, the only way to protect freedom of worship and keep it peaceful is if the state was entirely and completely secular. However, the current societies vying for control of the City of God are the Muslims and the Jews, the Palestinians and the Israelis. They are fighting for religious domination, for their faith to control the walls and the streets, while using faith, persecution and fear as an excuse to commit horrific crimes beyond imagination against one another. Such villains naturally embrace divine government. Indeed, the British screwed both Arabs and Jews by making conflicting and contradictory promises in order to govern the region better, by intentionally pitting people against each other that has, since Israel’s independence, lived on to this day. No cause, said Camus, merits the killing of innocents, regardless of whether one’s side is just or not. If God is to exist, and he is just, he would only favour individuals who were righteous, regardless of their faith, over those who were evil yet feigned piety. To favour someone over their religion, regardless of their actions, words, and intent, is supremely unjust, and to make one religion an official religion of the state, or to cater to only the faithful of all religions or of a certain kind of religion, codifies injustice. This is why secularism is the only solution, for faith mixed with power isn’t just unjust, but renders faith meaningless. It would be if Gandalf was given the Ring of Power, he would become more frightful and terrible than that of the Dark Lord Sauron, for Gandalf, bearing the One Ring, would see his actions as doing good, regardless of means or consequences. Time and time again, religion established as an official state doctrine or faith has permitted horrors and wars never needed. Secularism isn’t new, and the reasons for cutting power out of the hand of faith has been exhausted by men greater and older than I. The point is: in order to save the City of God, we must save the city from God. No official doctrine should dominate other than that of reason and necessity. God has no place in the halls of power. But neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis are willing to hold Jerusalem without establishing their faith as the official religion. So Jerusalem must be free from both if it is to be saved. It should not remain as an international city, either, for the world cannot control a single spot in the world, and would rob this “Holy” City of its freedom and for any chance of peace. Every nation has its own agenda, and Jerusalem should not be some neutral ground for nations to settle scores. It must therefor go down the same path as the Holy See, the Vatican in Rome, and unlike it, become a sovereign, free, independent secular republic of its own. Religious houses can be not destroyed but either dismantled carefully and relocated for the sake of preserving culture and history, or secularized. The Holy Mount must never belong to either the Muslims or the Jews. Any area of land claimed by both parties deserve to be owned by neither. Government should neither condone or condemn any religion or its freedom of worship, and on a related tangent, to ensure peace reign, no one should be allowed to carry, own, sell or transport any weapons except those in government. It should never spare any faith of any taxation nor sanction or impose any tithe. Nothing related to religion. Nothing for religion. Nothing by religion or against religion. If Jerusalem became a secular country of its own right, it would swiftly become a truly divine city, blessed with peace and prosperity and open to all to worship freely. This must go hand-in-hand with the sanctity of human dignity and of civil and human rights, including freedom of speech. Only the lowly, the poorly educated, and the fanatical are willing to murder other people over differences in opinion, however petty or absurd. There will always be lunatics claiming Jerusalem as theirs. It belongs to none of them.Hello all,

I'm looking for the video where Kyle says something to the effect of, "If you know nothing about anything, if you suck at everything, then apply for a job as a democratic political strategist."

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!Dress up as Ted Cruz and only say "MEH I'M TED CRUZ MEEEEEEEHH"Usually even people who are not professional communicators manage to make clear if they mean a hypothetical 2-choice situation, but not Kyle

It is possible to speculate about 100-choice situation being a 2-choice situation, but does it make sense is a different question. If that kind of speculation is done, it should be really clear that it is hypothetical and in reality there are many options besides 2. Kyle is really unclear about that. We as audience can make best possible interpretations of everything Kyle says, but he really has sounded like he may think that with Putin and Un there are only 2 options: Stupid threatening + higher risk of war or stupid fawning + lower risk of war. If that is a false impression of what Kyle thinks, he as a professional communicator should be more clear.

Also, about meetings, it is historically inaccurate to claim that usa and north korea can not communicate and negotiate without meetings, let alone presidential meetings. That is another huge false dichotomy. End to Korean war and many other deals were negotiated without top leaders meeting.Someone recommended this show to me but I can't find it in pocketcast? People work hard for their money and don't want to see their taxes raised to help someone else. Their thinking is," If I work 45 hours a week, I should be able to keep as much money as I can."

They also say that taxing the rich too much is dangerous as they are the ones that create jobs in this country, which is true to a degree. Also, rich people already contribute a majority of tax revenue in the US. They could leave the country if things get bad enough.

Just playing Devils advocate here. Thoughts?I think she'd be a great candidate. Good looking, well spoken, experienced, has some progressive views, also has some Trump-like views (Syria and Terrorism), and is an Iraq War veteran. 

The problem is...she's got almost no name recognition. Bernie didn't either, sure. But he also didn't win. 

SO...thoughts?WHO WOULD’VE **T H O N K**https://thinkprogress.org/ben-shapiro-facts-dont-care-about-feelings-daily-wire-trump-conservative-hypocrisy-99ecd0a7940d/amp/


Run through what other “conservative think tanks” have said and you’ll get the same results. Vile pigsBernie Sanders

Pros- Progressive, Experienced, Will run a policy based campaign, Honest compared to other politicians, Consistent views, Played ball with the DNC despite them screwing him over, Has crossover appeal, Did well in polls vs Trump in May 2016

Cons- Too many people see his plans as pie in the sky, he's not aggressive enough IMO (too much of a "nice guy") not the greatest debater, age will be an issue for some (79 by 2020)

&amp;#x200B;

Gabbard

Pros- War veteran, Woman, Good looking, Young (offsets Bernie's old age), Tougher on immigration and terrorism then Bernie (more like Trump), Anti-Clinton, Decent Experience (Vice chair DNC and in Congress for 5 years)

Cons- Some Dems don't like her, she's slightly to the Right on Immigration, not very well known 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to say it but as much as I wish this would happen...I don't see Bernie running again. If it does happen, I see them winning the Rust Belt, and the White House. 

&amp;#x200B;If Kyle does not address the overarching scheme of the debt based money out of nothing printing, he is in the last resort also unconsciously apologising for the system. He only occasionally and superficially mentions the ruthless evil of the fiat imperialism whose value is backed up by nothing other than military force. America is a barbaric empire which is in its structure not ethically superior to rome, ruthless exploitation of weaker nations which are puppeted. We must push Kyle and other figures harder to cover people´s activism and organisation against the system, untill people realise this incredibly imoral reality.I have 0 clue what he's talking about. So you might not know, but Ann Coulter will still be at Politicon. More specifically, she will do an "AMA"/Town hall style event (I guess), called "Ask Ann Anything", on Saturday, at 1:30 pm, in Civic Hall. Interestingly, the link to this ([https://politicon.com/session/ann-coulter-vs-kyle-kulinski/](https://politicon.com/session/ann-coulter-vs-kyle-kulinski/)) still has this as her debate with Kyle.  


Just FYI because some of you might have some questions you want to ask her.This is just not appropriate or relevant. So I like her overall. From what I can tell there is no evidence she used her heritage to get a leg up in her career. And clearly she has a native american ancestor.

However, it is completely rediculous that she listed her ethnicity as native american for law school. I have more Pakistani heritage then she does native american, but if all my grandparents were white then how could I possibly justify labelling my ethnicity anything but white?

Idk thats my opinion, idk if its controversialIs he aware of crypto currencies in general ? Why hasn’t  he talk about them yet ?So I’m just getting into politics, and a point Kyle brings up a lot is corporate pac money and how it corrupts politicians. Theoretically, what’s to stop a politicians from taking donations, then turning on their donors once they get into office?  source: [https://youtu.be/m4j1IRsUqcs?t=5004](https://youtu.be/m4j1IRsUqcs?t=5004)

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/9q2uqt/video/7j1twvuuyit11/playerJust wanna notify anyone interested that Gina Annunziato is live streaming Kyle's panel.It seems like Kyle likes to laugh at people who always say "Venezuela, but what's the proper response to that?

Why is Venezuela an exception?Anyone who was at politicon should share some of the fun interactions or stories they have. It would make for a very fun discussionAfter seeing kyle and charlie agree so heavily on the issue of saudi arabia, the death penalty and putting wall street crooks in jail was very satisfying. I am willing to bet that if these two put their differences aside and did a non partisan campaign on any particular issue they agree on, they would reach so many people, especially those who usually wouldn't be willing to hear out the others argument.

They could probably be a major starting point for achieving unity in the US.

EDIT: just to specify not a presidential campaign, but a movement to cause change on one particular issueI heard some talk about kyle being on rogan but I haven't seen any information on it. Is this a thing that is happening? I really enjoyed his last podcast. If it is happening is there a set date for it? I couldn't find anything on his twitterFor the most part the debate was pretty reasonable and I didn’t have many issues, outside of her refusal to agree on some of the solution to her concerns, even though she agreed the current system isn’t working (namely Medicare for All). 

But the thing that got to me was: you spend the segment prior (rightfully) shitting on Saudi Arabia for their horrendous acts, and talk about how they’re awful for conducting attacks on Yemen + their own citizens, not to mention Khashoggi. 

But when all of a sudden the conversation shifts to Israel, now it’s absolutely wrong to criticize because we mustn’t partake in anti-semitism?? 

I found that extremely disingenuous at best, and kind of offensive if she was seriously making such a connection. If critiquing Israel makes you an anti-semite, so following that logic critiquing Saudi Arabia makes you an anti-Islamic person. Which I completely and categorically disagree with. 

I genuinely believe that, not only just Saudi, but all the Muslim countries, are not conducting themselves according to the teachings of Islam — based on my studying of the religion. So I’m right there arguing against them. But how can you genuinely make the claim that talking about one country, which is the main Jewish country, is absolutely not allowed, but then have no problem talking against another country, which is the main Muslim country? 

I genuinely believe both SA and Israel are in the wrong for how they are treating Yemen and Palestine respectively and US shouldn’t back either of them. And even though Israel isn’t as bad on their citizens, as SA has been to theirs, they aren’t saints by any means and certainly are open for criticism. So that really got to me how you can just shut down the debate using anti Semitism, unless she thinks it’s ok to be anti-Islamic but not anti-Semitic (which I don’t think she is, she didn’t give off that type of vibe to me)I was at Politicon and left the Scottie vs Kyle debate slightly early to go listen to the other debate (they overlapped by half an hour and early on it looked like Scottie was gonna agree with what most of Kyle was saying).

I was so impressed by Seders debate skills and extensive knowledge, and I also have some slight new respect for Kirk’s debating skills. But Seder finessed the shit out of him. Listening to the debate I was so lost O was embarrassed by my lack of knowledge on the housing crisis. Kirk was throwing so much at Seder, and Seder was not only keeping up, but calling him out any time he said something wrong (which was frequent).

I think a lot of people are hard on Pakman and Seder cause they think both are “establishment” but I don’t think that’s the case: they’re pragmatists and will do whatever it takes to push progressive policy. This was evident from the lefty ideologies Seder was pushing during the Kirk debate and “Should We Be Socialists” panel.

I’m always gonna be a Secular Talk fan and that was probably the main reason I attended Politicon, but I have newfound respect for Seder.

If you haven’t yet I highly recommend you watch the debate[Seder vs Kirk Full Debate](https://youtu.be/Ak0WRuy3jPs)I happened to pause at the 6:14 mark of Kyle's second Joe Rogan appearance, and THIS happened...When people say "don't meet that leader", some people hear that as "don't negotiate with that leader", when what is usually meant is "negotiate without meeting".

Some people see difference between phone call, video call or letter as opposed to physical meeting, as semantic or inconsequential, when others see that as substantive and important.

When communicating with text, 5 people can consider every word and comma. Then 2 or more translators can consider how to translate that. Then send the text in both languages. Use both miles and kilometers, and both place names and grid coordinates to reduce risk of confusion.

Cuban missile crisis was negotiated without meeting.

If there is meeting, different question on how high level. Should it be some career diplomats, presidents or something in between, needs to be decided case by case.
\&gt;Sam asks Politicon to debate someone with a big YouTube following.

\&gt;Politicon staff: "How about Steven Crowder?"

\&gt;Sam agrees to the debate.

\&gt;Politicon staff: "Great! Steven is interested in a debate".

\&gt;Days go by without Politicon staff mentioning Crowder in conversations.

\&gt;Politicon begins throwing new names to Sam.

\&gt;Sam: "Wait, what's going on with the debate with Crowder? What date is that going to be on?".

\&gt;Politicon staff: "Umm.. Can we have a phone call?".

\&gt;The Politicon staff calls Sam to ensure there are no emails released regarding what they're about to say.

\&gt;Politicon staff: "Somebody got "cold feet". Steven Crowder ghosted. He literally stopped responding to our emails".

Sam talks about this on his show today at 1:04:10 below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccOF4hJLkyk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccOF4hJLkyk)I ask because I think he would make a great candidate in 2020 or 2024 if Bernie doesn't run (as AOC will still be too young) and height is positively correlated with a candidate's success, with the "golden range" being about 6'2 - 6'4. I know it's stupid that shallow appearance related stuff like that is a factor, but nonetheless it is.  Regardless, he should definitely run if he gets the chance, but it's good to look at all the variables (even the silly ones) that affect his chances, if nothing else, just to get excited about.He seems well spoken, has progressive credentials, is a war veteran, and is a democrat winning in a deeply RED state. And as crazy as it sounds, his accent would help him attract voters from the South.

What do you all think of him?

&amp;#x200B;I have an upcoming debate next week in my government class where I will have to debate a bunch of conservatives. I am a Social Democrat on the Populist left and most of my class is filled with Republicans including the teacher so it is hard being by myself. I do it however to give insight to the independents.  I have a few holes on how response to certain things.

For example I believe in Medicare for All. The right believes that Healthcare is a privilege for the rich. They say that working hard will buy you the best Healthcare. If Healthcare is given to everybody "there is no incentive to keep working." They also mention that the same applies to Food stamps, and Free College. "That if given these for free, no one will work for it, and it is devalued."

How can I respond to this from my platform?Why are there so many people that seem like they hate knowledge? Then go on to consider themselves as free thinkers? I literally got in an argument with my brother because I’ve been reading books about economic theory. As we were arguing he said that I think I’m so smart and better than him just because I used the word subjective while we were arguing and he didn’t know what it meant. Has anyone else had experiences like this? It’s so frustrating that younger people about my age (19), don’t want to have substantive conversations. 

Also if this isn’t allowed on this sub, may you please direct me to the proper sub to have this discussion? Thank you. On nthe Secular Talk discord, as some of you know there is an admin named Lilith.  I used to go to that server, and had virtually no contact with her whatsoever.  I left the server for months, come back, and I see all kinds of stuff about me in the Discord history.  I see people doxxing my name, including my real name, some old phone numbers and quite possibly even a former or possibly actual address.  From my perspective, I'm thinking "WTF, i haven't even been on this server in a long time and people have been talking about me for months!"

I soon come to figure out that someone was using my name and impersonating me, and thus was the reason people continued to mentio nme and was what led to the doxxing.  Later, I figure out that this person impersonating me was also doing nasty stuff to Lilith.  I won't go into details here, but it involves harassing her relentlessly, making vile threats, and forcing her to take drastic measures to evade them.

She has said, repeatedly, constantly in the chat I was doing this DESPITE me providing evidence, despite me providing a logical account, even going way out of my way to offer help and trying to deter the person doing it.

A while later, I leave the server permanently on my own accord and find another politics server that I've been residing on for months.  Done I was with the libtard servers like David Pakman and Secular Talk.  I found my own political home.  I figured I was done, but of course it's never like that.  Polar Seltzer, a member, starts inviting me to DM groups full of members from both servers.  I kept leaving the group and he kept inviting.  Eventually, I decided to stick around and talk.  At first it was innocent trolling, but then I come to figure out multiple things.

\#1 -- Polar Seltzer was in on the impersonation of me, but he was not actually the person.

\#2 -- A person, unknown, but who now appears to me as Jim Comey, but was cloning Miravus (a David Pakman mod) was the one impersonating me, sending the horrible images to Lilith and harassing her to no end.  Not only did I find out how mentally sick and deranged this person is, but I saw some of the sick images he posted as well.

\#3 -- I find out others in on the act as well.  I know of at least one othe rperson who knew who it was the whole time but never bothered to share the information.

\#4 -- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I find out that this information was already known by her and by the server at large.  At no point was a retraction issued.  At no point did I get an apology.

So why am I writing this?  To say without dispute that all of these factors mean that Lilith is the most garbage human being on the planet.  I don't wish what happened to her on anyone, but to not only refuse to listen to any evidence, keep saying she had "proof" that I did things that I never did, and to spread this information as lies to everyone on her server, David Pakman, and Justice Democrats.  She is a liar.  She does not deserve a job on this show, or any show, for her role in defaming a person and causing mental distress through her actions, actions of ignoring doxxing on her own server of individuals, ignoring threats of violence toward me on her server, and ignoring evidence that she based all of this on.

That's all I have to say.  Sorry to have wasted any time you spent reading this, but this is something that has to be out there, because it is wrong.So I dunno if you guys have ever heard of [Louis Rossman on Yotube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUaJ8pDlxi8) He is a macbook repair master and is constantly railing against the shady business practices of Apple. Watch the video for more. **Just to give you a recent example;** *This kid brought his macbook to Rossman cause the screen was flickering and going blank. Apple told him they need to replace the GPU, motherboard and likely the display... for $1200!! Rossman pointed out that the macbook in question doesn't even have a GPU for starters. He ended up scraping a little corrosion off a $20 connector and the problem was fixed!*

Anyways, hearing about how Kyle's macbook has shit the bed a couple times in the past month, I REALLY wanna get him hooked up with Rossman because I know he is getting hosed by Apple and chances are they might not fix his macbook's actual problem. I tweeted both of them and Rossman did respond saying he'd love to help, I just don't know if Kyle looks or bothers to check alot of tweets he gets. Rossman is right in NYC so Kyle wouldn't have to send his macbook out to Apple for a bullshit repair. 

Maybe if more of us blow up his inbox with similar messages he can actually get his macbook fixed. Seriously though watch a couple of Louis' vids and you will see how Apple fucks people over regularly.How fucking likely is it that right-wing Trumptards who spread this "false-flag" horseshit such as Paul Joseph Watson and Sargon of Akkad are gonna apologize for misleading their audiences? Because, if you look at their comments' sections, there are plenty who still believe that he was a Democratic pawn or a paid Soros actor, and it's only the "fake news media" claiming he was a Trump supporter. They won't; because they have no respect for truth, they just want to pander to their audiences and keep that Patreon money flowing.In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jojB0hgqIxY) debate, two teams of two argued for and against the motion “Progressive Populism Will Save the Democratic Party”.  The Against Team were two milquetoast, middle-aged wonks that looked like they were picked at random from some Washington D.C. lobbying firm or think tank.  Even despite that they managed at times to be more charismatic than the For Team, even though the For Team argued for popular issues and against boring talking points about electoral strategy.

The woman on the For Team was very flat despite being the youngest of the debaters.  She was passionate when she spoke about how the Democratic Party needs to include marginalized groups and workers, but she didn’t exactly raise the roof when she talked about how to draw those groups into the party and make them vote for the Democrats.

The guy on the Against Team was at times aggressive but he didn’t manage to pull it off properly.  Instead of coming off as the person fighting for the little guy against the “but muh polling data” nay-sayers, he came off as grumpy and inarticulate.

Now, the outcome can’t be blamed solely on the For Team.  The moderator seemed a bit biased in favor of the Against Team, and the audience was so milquetoast that they could at times be mistaken for a retirement home for former liberal political consultants.

In the end the For Team lost 11 percentage points after the second vote, and the Against Team gained 34 percentage point.  With an audience like that I guess it was inevitable that the For Team would lose [1].  Still, there was massive potential for improvement on the For Team.

[1] It was a bit funny how “centrist” the audience was: a whopping 40% were undecided on the question at the start of the debate.

I just want to let people know about [what's going on](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849868/eu-internet-copyright-reform-article-11-13-approved) in the EU Parliament. Both of these will make people pay for certain websites and to auto-filter content. This means, that if you're a content creator, your content will automatically be deleted, which can be horrendous.

I know it got passed last month, but there is one last chance that it will be revoked in December or in January. 

I know this is an international topic, but it will be good for others to know that Articles 11 and 13 will take down any creativity on the internet! It's bad enough we got Net Neutrality, but this will be worse. There is currently a [campaign](https://www.saveyourinternet.eu/about-this-campaign/) going on. I hope this gets brought up since I have not seen this talked about in any American outlets. 

I brought this up during the September Secular Talk(ing Smack) Podcast and tried to send him a tweet regarding more information, but he never replied. I'm hoping I can get in contact with him some other way but idk. I'm American, but I have many friends in Europe, so the issue's very concerning for me.I'd say ecstacy, 'cause every show he can go from 0 to 100 and back in one segment.I just recently downloaded Kyle's show on CastBox and the audio was really bad, bad enough that I just shut it off when I skipped ahead and checked other episodes to find it's always terrible. This isn't an issue with any other podcasts I've tried, like David Pakman, JRE, RadioLab etc. What's up with that?I think Kyle is spot on on the vast majority of issues, but these tariffs are a disaster. They benefit the 200k steel workers and fuck over literally everyone else. Starting a trade war with our fucking allies is absolutely retarded. Honestly it seems like Kyle is illiterate when it comes to trade.

His views on trade pretty much boil down to "protectionism good, free trade bad."

His video on Trump's tariffs is probably the worst one he's ever made. Especially the implication that you're not really left wing if you don't support this, and the idea that the US could avoid a trade war with "diplomacy" somehow.Alex Jones should be banned just from the Brian Stelter video. I don't care if he wants to talk about fema camps or chemtrails, but he crossed the line with the Stelter video. Then he pushes the boundaries with the Parkland survivor slander. YouTube should ban any creator that does such a thing. You are NOT granted 1st amendment rights on YouTube. No, countries from Norway to black sea are not Russian "sphere of influence". Some countries chose to join nato and it was not unfair to Russia to take them. It would have been unfair to those countries to let Putin prevent them joining.

Using the analogy of hypothetical russian troops in Mexico or Cuba is flawed. First of all, don't decide by analogy. Secondly, if we are arguing about analogies, there were russian troops in Cuba and Kennedy started naval blockade only when nukes started coming too. Cuba crisis was wrong, Kennedy should have been passive. Russian troops were in Cuba for decades, but without nukes, and no one freaked out like Putin is doing. Mexico does not want russian troops, but if it wanted them and they came, most USA could do about it would be rearranging troops inside it's own borders.

Question about defending Baltic states and Poland if Russia invades is actually question about defending EU (and other countries), because that defending can start at Baltic states and Poland instead of deeper in EU territory.

Did nato break treaty by putting troops in Baltics? No because treaties about nato troops in Baltic states were nullified when Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014. The nato move is about ground troops. As incompetent, sick and bad as Trump is, he is not going to start any war with the few troops there, so it is not "escalating". The troops are there ready when Mike Pence, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or whoever takes over.

Lastly, usa or nato are not giving military aid to "ukrainian rebels" or "rebels in Ukraine", but to the government of Ukraine.

I know these things just by following media and not even every day. 
I am just curious, I watch both and wondering if anyone else does tooSo basically my grandma is like any other old person who distrust the system. She is willing to learn about progessives and our cause because she believes in the basic tenets to being a progressive. ANYWAYS Im looking for the best videos of kyle, you know the ones where he get heated and just yells at the establishment. Those are his best videos I think to share with people. Any help would be nice, I want to send her the best videos.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia_device#Exit_International%27s_euthanasia_device﻿

In another stunning example of Kyle talking out of his ass about things he knows nothing about, he made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgYuspfRlZY) video about Oklahoma's plan to use Nitrogen Gas to execute an inmate.

He fails to bring up the fact that while [it is deemed unfit to euthanize certain species of animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation#Euthanasia_of_animals) those animals aren't humans. It is popular among the terminally ill as an [exit strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation#Suicide) because it is a "peaceful, reliable" method of suicide.

It saddens me that Kyle has to lie and make things up to try and push a narrative that can be pushed using only the facts.Just saw the picture of the Austin bomber and I've gotta say I'm pretty disappointed in Kyle for what he did. Was there any reason for it? Doesn't anybody know ANYTHINGBoth of these stories were pretty big, and definitely more relevant than Michael Moore saying "Democrats should be the party of the working class." Yeah, no shit. He's been saying that for awhile now. 

"Atheist kicked off of Egyptian TV", yeah that's shitty, but in comparison to those events, who cares? I saw the x-post from thedavidpakman sub about Kyle. I honestly only just heard of Kyle and Jimmy Dore recently and had not heard of Pakman or Seder so I downloaded their shows in castbox

What do you all think of Pakman? Is his show better if you are premium or watching via YouTube vs listening to a podcast? It didn't seem to go very deep and the segments were short and fragmented. The main thing I didn't care for was the constant commercial breaks. It's so excessive I almost thought it was a joke. I also didn't need the random call-ins and questions about his social media trolls.

A few people mentioned that they like Kyle's energy/passion more than Pakman's style but Pakman was more thorough and nuanced in his analysis. I would agree with the former but not the latter based on what I heard. Am I missing something?

Side topic but what is the joke about Seltzer and Kyle? I saw it mentioned in that thread

Thanks
Is the shirt drive I heard about a month or so ago still happening? And where can I get the secular talk bracelets? Do they still exist? Who here has watched Sahil Habibi's The Progressive Voice? Thoughts about him and his show?Is it just me or is there a lot of left-leaning people missing the point by a mile when it comes to the new season of Roseanne. This show has always handled the issues of the day from the perspective of a blue-collar family, expect that last season. If the character of Roseanne was real, she probably would have voted Trump. That fact does not make the show pro-Trump propaganda, but that seems to be the current narrative with the left.

My guess is that show will not just touch on the dynamic of a family split on politics but will touch on families they did vote Trump who is now being abandoned by him.Blogtalk radio has a very bad interface and the audio quality is subpar. I think the show would be great if it was streamed on twitch or youtube.Do not bother with images if they do not inform about anything that people do not already know.

If you show a face, it's width and height in pixels should be at most 1/4 or quarter of the image width and height.

Repulsive people means something like D Trump, Putin, Kim jong Un or the latest mass shooter. Of those, only D.T may be well known enough to not need showing for the 1000th time with a generic picture unrelated to the subject. Audience may still need education about who the dictators are, but mass shooter pictures are not necessary, at least not after one showing. Dictators and mass shooters are not physically repulsive, but D T is also that, so it would be better to pixelate or blur images of D T at least in thumbnails, when such image is shown (because it informs about something that has happened).

We need more flowcharts, mindmaps, venn diagrams and graph plots. Sometimes graph plots can be symbolic and direction giving expressions of thought, even without any data, as long as they are clearly indicated as such. Also, emoticons and groups of emoticons for expressing thoughts visually.

Sometimes the best (thumbnail) picture would be a piece of map centered around the location the story is about or where it happens.
Accept Jesus MLK was left wing and born again, so we’re the greatest figures in the progressive movement and this is for a reason! I'd like to watch a video or read his tweets about it. I was bummed that cenk never did a post mortem. I was wondering if kyle did. The great mind of Jordan Peterson knows many things . One of the prime examples of what he knows is how to take away the violence in society. How do we do that? Well, telling women to sleep with all the angry violent men to keep them calm! Forced societal monogamy . Like , what a great mindset. It’s not like that means we are literally using women’s bodies as a tool as a means to an end! Such a sane position!!!!! https://youtu.be/manPzDf_t5kTitle speaks for itself.  I hate his nasally voice and the fact you can kind of tell he’s not good with people in real life.I support Palestinian independence. By extension of this exact reasoning (this is the controversial part), I support the goals of the IRA. Northern Ireland is a nation of people with a shared history and culture who are entitled to self-governance, autonomy, and unification with their relatives in Ireland. Americans shit on the IRA without even stopping to consider that they're fighting for the exact same thing we did in the 1770's: independence from Great Britain. I understand that Northern Ireland is not nearly as bad of a humanitarian disaster as Palestine is, and is therefore less urgent, but I take the same stance on both issues.Hello, I'm Ephrom Josine. I'm trying to get a (hopefully) up and coming left-wing news outlet called "The Ephrom Report" off the ground. We currently have a website (http://ephromjosine.blogspot.com/) and a YouTube page (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTYYischB6xY7bCvFRtT-Pg). I would like to go to the fan group of one of the biggest leftists in the US (at least online) for help. If anyone is interested please comment. I am constantly being recommended to watch #walkaway videos. I have no interest in watching these videos because i know that these people don't have anything to say that i haven't heard before. What is odd about it though is that these videos appear on completely unrelated videos sometimes non political videos and very few even broke 100,000 views some of which didn't even break 10,000 views. Is anyone else experiencing this?In his latest video Kyle is arguing that the hacks were a good thing because they hurt Hillary politically, and exposed information on her corruption. While we should advocate for transparency, and against the rigging of elections broadly speaking, in what world can we justify cyber terrorism as a means to achieve such things? The hackers didn't just obtain her emails, they also stold thousands of voter's information and were attempting to change the voter rolls. It really speaks to someone's lack of political saviness when they're basically arguing that we should let foreign governments conduct cyber warfare on our country as long as the right information gets out. For months he's called anyone who saw validity in the Trump - Russia story a "corporate democrat." It was a childish strawman argument that degraded the quality of his show. Now he sees the investigation as legitimate, but with this insane caveat. It's also incredibly annoying that he can never seem to find sources or fact check before shooting his show. He's constantly tripping over himself to find the right information or details of a story. I used to watch for news and a progressive slant, but now I can hardly make it though a single piece of his content.I hear Kyle talk about populism a lot, but I don't know if he knows what he means by that, nor do I see any examples of it being successful. Anyone have any examples?Then, when asked why god would choose secular and atheist person, answer would be "god works in mysterious ways". That "argument" "works" for anything.

What are the logical consequences of some religious thinking applied to anyone?I don’t think Russia should be number one talked about thing for the dems. I think the Democrat party should focus on 1, Medicare for all 2, affordable health insurance 3, quality jobs and or basic income. The main focus should not be Russia. That being said, I’m tired of Kyle saying it’s a nothing burger. Obviously something is going on and I don’t know why Kyle is so dismissive of the issue.Well i have seen numerous remarks from arrogant sycophantic Republicans claiming that Alexandria is a gift to the Republicans and even some conspiring that the Republicans rigged the Primary to advantage a weaker candidate (which is bullshit by the way.)

Now if you couldn't tell this is all very similar to what i mentioned in the tittle, and if i am being honest it is a massive sign that are guaranteed victory soon enough.

They say that these ideas are way to radical for the mid west to ever vote for them despite the fact that ideas like for example a federal job guarantee has a net approval in all of the mid west states. https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jobs-guarantee-supplementary-photo-3.jpg.png

So let these Partisan hacks scoff at us. We will have the last laugh.Kyle always says to use Scandinavia as an example when conservatives play the Venezuela card. However some conservatives have already adapted to this argument, for example Stephen Crowder. He has frequently used a quote from the Danish Prime minister claiming that "Denmark has a market economy not a Socialist economy" and this really does go to show how insanely dishonest Stephen Crowder really is since he is taking the dishonesty of labelling medicare for all, Public College ect socialism and then when you show examples of what he calls socialism working he shifts the goal posts because they don't fit the actual definition of Socialism.

There are other counter arguments to the Scandinavia argument like the fact that they don't have a minimum wage, which is technically true but instead the Unions are so well backed by the governments that wages are essentially determined by the Unions which is more progressive than a minimum wage.

Also there is a claim that Denmark has a flat tax which isn't even half true. There is a flat council tax yet there is also an income tax which is a progressive tax.

The main point is that when Kyle claims that the only counter argument is the homogeneity argument, he is wrong and he needs to better re-enforce his arguments and its not hard it just takes a decent amount of fact checking.Kyle stated that Barbara Lee was the only vote against the war in Iraq. What he meant was she was the only vote against the Authorization of Use of Military Force Against Terrorism, which is what we used to get involved in Afghanistan (and several other conflicts since) but not Iraq. 156 members of Congress voted against the war in Iraq including Bernie Sanders. Just wanted to clarify.I hope to see Jordan and Kyle have an interview together! I’m making a compilation video of conservatives making the Venezuela straw man argument and I’m wondering if anyone has links to one I might’ve missed. I’ve got 2 Alex Jones one, the McCain one from the view and the one from that B-list infowars guy. But if you guys have any links to commentators making that argument please lemme know. Thanks! can yall imagine the RAGING erection that kyle must have underwent when Noam Chomsky came on Democracy Now! and literally said the exact same thing he's been saying for the past few years regarding Russia?? That shit probably shattered a tableHere are some article's / videos who are already done against Ben Shapiro's claims about Transgender people and data:

Ben Shapiro needs a good take down and rebutal on his claims about transgenders. 
Its important to know that hormone therapy, SRS, FFS (and so on) are mainly to reduce gender dysphoria, not suicidality or at least not mainly suicidality. Ben strawmans the entire topic into that transgender medicine is about to reduce suicidality and suicide attempt rates. Its like you would say that anti depression medicine is to reduce suicidality, which is not. Its to reduce depression. It CAN help (if you are even suicidal), but mainly its to reduce depression. The same for gender dysphoria - its mainly to reduce gender dyhsproia. 

REDUCING GENDER DYSPHORIA &lt;

That is the entire main purpose behind hormone therapy, SRS, FFS and so on.

Also his question 'why arent you 60' is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid. The more accurate comparison would be maturity of someone, you know like foe example 10 year olds which brains are mature faster than others, and have a brain of a 40 year old or the other way around, adults who still have the brain of usually a 5 year old. 

And please go on Hbomberguy's curious cat and ask him if he would do a debunking video on thisEssentially, my idea is to create a Youtube video essay channel that is the progressive version of 1791L--check it out if you don't know what it is.

I already write progressive, non-partisan political essays but would like to transform my future writings into visually-appealing narrated videos.

At the moment, there seems to be a hole in the market for this type of thing. So if you want to work together and produce something cool, informative, interesting, and challenges the status quo and the insanity of modern American politics, let me know.

P.S. If you want to take a look at a few of my writings and the type of positions I hold, check out my Medium profile: https://medium.com/@ben_johnsonOne thing I hear Kyle say in every foreign policy story he covers is that the US is "We're bombing eight different countries right now!". The eight he is referring to are Afghanistan, Iraq,[40] Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan,[41] Libya,[42] Syria, and most recently Niger. Niger is the latest country he added to his list, denouncing the action in multiple segments.[43] 
So this is actually an incorrect statement. First, let's talk about Niger. The problem is, Niger's government only authorized armed US drone flights, and no US strikes have yet taken place. The move was intended to allow the US the ability to kill ISIS and al-Qaeda should the need ever arise in the future.[44]

Next, Kyle includes Libya. The last time the US bombed Libya was [2 months ago](http://nytimes.com/2018/03/25/world/middleeast/us-bombs-qaeda-libya.html), and it was a targeted strike against al-Qa'ida militants (totally legal according to the 2001 AUMF) which didn't kill any civilians. Other than that, we haven't bombed Libya in over a year and there's no ongoing campaign.

On Pakistan, the last time the US bombed Pakistan was [4 months ago](http://nytimes.com/2018/01/24/world/asia/pakistan-us-drone-haqqani-network.html), and it was a targeted drone strike against the Haqqani network, a Taliban and al-Qa'ida ally. It killed  "The militant commander, Nasir Mehmood, who was also known as Khawari, and two of his aides", and no civilians. Other than that, there have been no other bombings this year.

Regarding Yemen, the last US strike there happened [2 months ago](https://theintercept.com/2018/03/26/yemen-drone-strike-civilians-war-on-terror/). This one apparently killed civilians, but it was supposed to hit al-Qa'ida, which is legal according to the 2001 AUMF. There have been no other strikes in 2018.

About Iraq, ISIS no longer controls any real territory there, although there are some remnants left. As you can see by [this chart](https://airwars.org/data/), US bombing has basically stopped there, and it has dwindled down to very little in Syria as well (since ISIS is on the verge of being defeated there too).

So if Kyle's wrong, countries are we really bombing? The answer is 3: Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia. In these countries, we are bombing ISIS, al-Qa'ida, and the Taliban. The reason why I decided to bring this up is that saying "we're bombing eight different countries right now" is a little bit disingenuous and does not correspond with the reality of the situation. I think it would be great if Kyle checked up on these wars, which were a pretty big deal a couple of years ago but have largely wound down recently. I just wanted to make sure Kyle was correct on the facts.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTrnE7ig2Ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTrnE7ig2Ok) 

I hope Kyle covers this interview from CNN. This is a prime example of establishment media press. "How do you pay for it??" https://www.thenation.com/article/waiting-for-steven-pinkers-enlightenment/

Now i know you might be asking "why attack a huge figure in the world of skepticism and atheism? Especially a liberal."

First off Pinker is a libertarian. The kind the CATO Institute pushes. At best he's a traditional classical liberal that was dominant pre-New Deal. I'm sure Pinker doesn't deny this, but it's a common misconception.

Second of all if you look at passages in his most recent hot selling book "Enlightenment Now" the guy is almost completely opposed to political activism (the exception being armchair #Resistance slacktivism). He believes in what Francis Fukuyama termed "the end of history." Pinker believes that liberal democratic values have insured technology will solve all our problems and society will only continue to go in an upward trajectory. Everything's good here, nothing to see behind the curtain!

The stats and interpretations he uses for everything getting better is questionable. Like keeping the bar for extreme poverty so low that it doesn't include anyone with a job in a factory hovering over suicide nets. Not to mention the fuckloads of ways Americans have seen their budgets getting tighter and tighter and have far less job security and more anxiety.

Or the fact green technology thats cost competitive with fossil fuels already exists! Technology has done its job in advancing enough to combat global warming. What's missing is the political will to replace fossil fuel based companies.

And he ignores that most of societies improvements came from activism. How the fuck do you think we got a weekend? Radicals protesting for better conditions.

​

Steven Pinker is a capital "I" Intellectual in the service of power. His endorsement by Bill and Melinda Gates (biggest charity scammers in the world and responsible for astroturf campaigns to bankrupt public schools, replace them with charters and ruin the lives of teachers) should tell you all you need to know. Pinker is in service of power and wants the political and economic system to remain untouched by progressives, democratic socialists, marxists and anyone that wants drastic reform.

It very nearly ruins his channel for me. Almost every time he wants to explain an opposing view, he resorts to the most obnoxious, half assed, over the top cartoon voice he can think of. It hardly ever even matches the type of person that would typically have that ideology, he just does the first one to comes to mind and goes with it, and he always comes across as unbelievably stupid and childish. Which is a shame, since I don't think he is. He never tries to accurately impersonate anyone, he just goes for over the top every time, and it's just insufferable. I realize I'm repeating myself at this point, but I'm really sick of this, I can barely watch his videos anymore because of it.Republicans keep saying “the average American saves x amount of $ on the tax cuts! Aren’t we so great!!”... which is a true statement on paper. The “average American” is the key part of that statement. And it’s true. But using an average when talking about this is WAY misleading. The people who made over 75k a year is who benefit from the tax bill. That in no way is the most common American. The top wealthy in this country skew the numbers! Here is a better example of this: Did you all know that Michael Jordan and I have an average of 3 championship rings! It’s a completely true statement... He has 6... and I have 0. They are making it sound most Americans are making over 75k a year. When that isn’t true. Why is Kyle Kulinski not a much bigger part of TYT and a regular host on the main network? A lot of the criticism of TYT by the left who generally are progressives but still have understandable issues with TYT, are solved with SecularTalk. In my 3-4 years of watching TYT I think I've only seen him as a guest on the main show like 2 times, if that. 

I've been listening to the TYT network since 2015 off and on. When I first found them I loved them, and I still generally like half their segments, but oh boy the other half... Some segments have me cringe so hard, to downright disagree with their premise / generalization / over-exaggerated reactions disproportional to the substance, etc. So I would take breaks from TYT but there's really no other source from my research that covers news in a non-bias way (TYT definitely is biased of course, but I'd rather bias against corporate than for, if I have to pick)

My friend who also watches TYT from time to time, but also shares the same issues that I have with them, told me to check out Kyle Kulinski's show. And I had seen his videos being suggested a few times on youtube, and I saw the clip of his Fox News segment where he absolutely murders them, but I never really checked him out until my friend suggested I do.

From the first video I watched of his a few weeks ago, I legit have stopped watching anything else. I used to surf youtube and jump between politics / sports news / random things, etc. but for the last few weeks I have just been straight binging on his videos. He's incredible man I am so shook I didn't check him out sooner. His breakdown of the arguments, his calling out both sides even Bernie when he sees fit, etc. all have me so engrossed in his videos. I literally find myself nodding my head the whole time saying WHY TF DON'T ANALYSTS ASK THESE QUESTIONS ON TV?

I genuinely think he should be way more popular overall,  but especially so in the TYT network. They gotta promote this guy way more and have him on the main show way more often imo. I genuinely think I was part of the crowd who considers themselves very progressive, but I put up with TYT because that's really all we got right now, so the alternative is what? mainstream media? no thanks. But I can say now that I found a source who I very clearly finally agree with, and the joy in finding this type of channel is immense I had to share my thoughts.Kyle seems to have repeatedly shown to believe that Bernie Sanders is a shoe in for the Primary if he runs in 2020 which is also very likely to happen. However over the past week i am beginning to have rising concerns that the Primary may be taken by a centre left Corporatist like Kamala Harris or Cory Booker. I'f it wasn't obvious these concerns came to rise when Booker and Kamala were both trending on twitter for saying words to Brett Kavanaugh, it is so fucking clear that they were just virtue signalling to boost support for 2020 but it fucking worked and people ate it up, however i didn't think much of it as twitter is quite biased to establishment dems. Yet  several days later i was seeing progressive channels like Sam Seder Fawning over Booker and Harris "Destroying" Kavanaugh by telling him he's a meanie head. They are spreading this toxic idea throughout the progressive community that Booker and Harris are "ok" and it needs to halt now. 

CORY BOOKER IS NOT OK 

KAMALA HARRIS IS NOT OK

I can't let either of them win because if they do they will not fight for m4a and will instead be haggled down to public option-ish or maybe a slightly more progressive version of Obamacare either way will be weaponized by the republicans and will result in another tea party and another trump 8 years later. I think we need to make our selves very clear on that position that Harris and Booker are not OK and are trojan horses to our movement so i think we need to be more vocal.I would love a video discussing kratom. What you use it for,  it’s uses in general, where you get it, etc. Kyle always says 45k ppl die every yr because they don't have healthcare, which was a 2009 study. So the number is likely MUCH lower than that but still way too high for a country like the USA. And since MFA SAVES money due to lower overheads costs, no copays and deductibles, I think it's a no brainer to have universal healthcare. 

I also agree with paid maternity leave, since literally every other country has it. 

For free college, I think we should work on making college cheaper and not free. And it was much much cheaper 25 years ago. Too many people can get a Stafford loan, which causes colleges to jack up prices. I think adjusting interest rates could fix this. I think a college degree would lose its value if everyone had one, despite how great it would be to educate our country. Low Point: Doesn’t push back against war monger cunt evil piece of shit Richard Clarke for wanting to stay in the Middle East or else “it’ll become a safe haven for terrorists again.”
By killing and displacing 1000x more ppl than terrorists do without us being in their countries.

High Point: Calls out Bush for campaigning with Republicans and says just being better than Trump is the bigotry of low expectations. And that the republicans are the same as Trump. One in the same.The only people who i have heard supporting Warren in 2020 are Establishment dems thus if she runs she will actually split the establishment vote more than the progressive vote.Hey Everyone, I am a big fan of Reuters given their impartial and factual style of reporting. I follow u/reuters to see all of their new posts. From what I can tell it seems the account has either been stripped or deleted. Is this not the official user account of Reuters? Or was the official user account of reuters actually censored?

  
Any information anyone has is appreciated.So i'm a British Secular Talk fan, and i love kyle's US analysis, because he goes into incredible detail, showing both sides of several nuanced issues. I've always loved kyle for that. But he's recently made ANOTHER Corbyn video, and i really wish he'd stop it.  

Kyle's nuanced breakdown's of situations/issues is almost patented. He's brilliant at it, but i've never seen him properly tackle Corbyn with a balanced breakdown. He's always been very superficial, and incredibly partisan.  

I understand that an American might not be 100% informed of a British situation. But i'm only complaining because Kyle keeps talking about Corbyn, whilst continuing to be very ignorant.  

There are many problems with Corbyn, and Corbyn's Labour party, aside from the 'Antisemitism scandal', which even i think is a BS scandal. But that's my point. Corbyn and Labour are an unelectable party, for many, MANY nuanced reasons. And Kyle is very clearly ignorant of that.  

I wouldn't mind if Kyle disagreed with me, and gave me one of those 'Kyle Patented nuanced breakdowns'. But that's not what he's doing. Instead he's just doing one-sided lazy superficial analysis. I can watch any left wing channel if i wanted that. This isn't what i watch Secular Talk for.  

I'm not hating the opinion. Just his consistently lazy coverage of this particular issue.

Edit: Deleting a dumpster fire of mine in the comments. It's just kinda of a disgusting insult-slinging mess from both of us. It's not worthy of keeping.While I agree with some of his points, I think he is out of the loop when it comes to teen usage of e-cigs. Being a sophomore in college, juul use is rampant. I'd say the majority of young users did not start with tobacco, they definitely started with juuls. They are like a status symbol almost, i find the culture around it very odd. My girlfriend in high school and all of her friends juuled. I really just dont think he understands how big it is among young people considering he is like 10 years out of the loop among those who are in high school and college. I even once saw a group of 13 year olds walk into a gas station and try to buy a juul, it's disgusting. Anyway, sorry for my purely anecdotal rant, but thats just my two cents.I need some help with this one.

Basically both my parents have been republicans my whole life. Ironically, even I used to be hardcore libertarian (until I turned 16). It's actually interesting because my mom, when you break it down, actually believes in things like raising the minimum wage and free college and gun control. My dad, however, is a different story. Just screams socialism at everything. It's rather annoying. My mom will vote for who I convince her is the best candidate, because she's a good person and I think she knows what the right thing to do is, especially for me.


I am mostly concerned with the universal healthcare debate. I am 100% for it. That being said, my dad actually gets health insurance from where he works. He's a detective for public defenders. Plus, I live in Illinois where taxes are already sky high. So, when we talk about a net savings in taxes after passing universal healthcare, I'm afraid that it won't apply to my family and it'll piss them off. 

My hope is that because I live in Illinois where taxes are already so high, we'll barely feel a tax increase as opposed to others. Anyone have any thoughts on this?This came to my notice several days ago with the Jake Tapper interview of AOC. She did not handle the interview very well and it made her look bad and i think anyone who says otherwise is simply in denial. She very clearly tried to obfuscate the question and Jake Tapper didn't let her get away with it. 

Ok i have to make this very fucking clear, the military spending argument is a bad argument because the military spending doesn't even come close to the estimated cost of M4A i see their point but it is way to easy to shut down, also it buys into the framing of the idea that M4A will cost money, and not only that but it is sort of a whataboutism if you ask me. 

The only answer that will work is "Medicare for all will SAVE 2 - 17 trillion per decade" and it will work wonders. I think we need to champion this claim as it is 100% true and if it isn't it is because it is biased to the conservative side. The only problem is that progressives never seem to make this argument. Not only do we need to make this argument over and over again until it becomes a universally accepted fact.

So every time an interviewer asks a progressive "How are you going to pay for Medicare for all" the response should and must be "Medicare for all saves 2 to 17 trillion per decade" not only when asked we need to say this when ever we have the god damn chance any time a smug prick like Ben Shillpiro asks this on twitter i want to see the reply section flooded with "Medicare for all will save 2 to 17 trillion per decade" i want to see this on campaign ads i want to see this on rally banners i want to see this every where and then the framing of interview questions. This ties into another post i am wanting to make about assertiveness that i will probably make later.This has frustrated me to no end. Not just the question of, "How are we going to pay for it?", but also the response of the average progressive to this question. When it comes to the average progressive on something like Medicare for all (M4A), you usually hear: "It will save us money". "Our administrative costs would be far more efficient". "It doesn't matter how we pay for it". "We print our own money, so we can afford it". While some of those are valid points, a lot of citizens in the U.S are fiscally conservative when it comes to economics. We need to appeal to these people using some actual numbers. In a recent Reuters poll, M4A had the support of 70% of the American people. Knowing how we're going to pay for these programs does actually matter for the health and well being of our country. People need to know how we'd pay for these proposals so they know how it will affect their daily lives. When you have media outlets like Fox News saying, "We'd need to double all taxes to pay for M4A" that can really scare and push people away who aren't informed about the facts and revenue streams.

Here's how we can pay for all of Bernie Sanders’s popular proposals.

**\*\*\*Permanent spending proposals\*\*\***

**Medicare for all:**

In 2016, public spending (federal spending) on healthcare was 65% of the $3.3 trillion we spent on healthcare ($2.145 trillion). If you factor in the annual Medicare for All number without accounting for the annual percentage increase, you get a cost of $3.2 trillion annually; so factoring in the 2016 payment of $2.145 trillion for M4A, we'd already be paying around $21.45 trillion of the $32 trillion for the program. The cost would be around **$10.55 trillion** in new taxes over the next 10 years or **$1.055 trillion** every year. Here's how we could generate that revenue.

• A 7.5 percent income-based health care premium paid by employers would raise **$390 billion** annually. An employer’s first $2 million in payroll would be exempt from this premium protecting small businesses throughout the country.

• A 4 percent income-based premium paid by households making above $29,000 would raise **$350 billion** annually.

• Returning to FY2014 discretionary military spending would raise **$196.5 billion** annually.

.• Establishing a 1% wealth tax on the top 0.1% of households which would target incomes above $21.5 million would raise **$130 billion** annually.

Total revenue raised: **$1.0665 trillion**

Revenue left over: **$11.5 billion**

&amp;#x200B;

**Paid family/medical/maternal leave:**

Cost: $319 billion over 10 years.

Revenue: 0.2% payroll tax would raise **$31.9 billion** every year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expand Social Security:**

Cost: $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

Revenue. Raise the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax cap from $128,400 to $250,000. This would generate **$120 billion** every year, give seniors an average of $1,300 more a year in their Social Security checks, and this would make Social Security solvent until 2078.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tuition-free public colleges:**

Cost: $750-800 billion over 10 years.

Revenue: A tax on Wall Street speculation (0.5% tax on stock market trades, 0.1% fee on bonds, and a 0.005% fee on derivate trades) would raise **$55 billion** annually. The remaining annual **$20-$25 billion** cost would be left to the states to fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*Temporary spending proposals\*\*\***

**Eliminating $1.5 trillion of student loan debt:**

Cost: $1.5 trillion.

Revenue: Reverse the **$1.9 trillion** dollar Trump tax cuts. After student loan debt has been nearly eliminated, this revenue could go towards other programs, tax cuts, or deficit reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

**$1 trillion investment in infrastructure:**

Cost: $1 trillion over 5 years.

Revenue: Paid for by closing the loopholes that allow profitable corporations to avoid paying taxes by shifting these corporate profits back to the U.S from the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens. This would generate at least **$200** **billion** annually. The revenue could later be used for other programs, tax cuts, or deficit reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*Closing\*\*\***

The next time you get asked the, "How are we going to pay for it?" question, feel free to use these numbers and revenue streams as a source of funding to answer that question. A quick reminder on M4A's $32 trillion price tag since it's the elephant in the room. If we had applied a M4A system in 2016, current revenue streams for public healthcare spending would already cover 65% or $21.45 trillion of the $32 trillion cost over 10 years. So we'd only need to come up $1.055 trillion in new taxes to fund the program. In 2016, that new additional public spending of $10.55 trillion over 10 years would have replaced $12.2 trillion+ in private spending; amounting to savings of trillions of dollars when you factor in annual national healthcare expenditure increases.

I’m a fallen human being Jules like you! Just trying to get something positive out of this, even though it was unlikely that she would win. She lost more counties than the previous Dem challenger in 2014 and he wasn't even Progressive!

Voter turnout was a bit higher (around 30%) but she still did poorly =(

 What can we learn from this? Just got back from holiday and noticed kyle hasn't uploaded for 3 days, what did I miss?? We robbed the middleeast primarily because of its oil ... i think the frensh or britains started this shit. I think they say fuck 'em as well and they have much more reason for it. But yes i agree.Military industrial complexOkay. I thought you were talking about a specific organization They dont even try half the time, their argument against anything socialist is "people are gonna become lazy!!".He likes big butts and he can not lie. 
His viewers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in his face!
He get sprung!Kyle used to have the full show up as a podcast. I haven’t listened to the podcast in a long while (or any podcast for that matter) and I just checked my podcasts app and I guess he stopped uploading the show as a podcast. But I agree. Sometimes I just want to listen to his show in full without having to go to another video.Look on www.blogtalkradio.com that's where he broadcasts his show in full... Daily Noon to 2 or 3p. Older shows are posted there as well. Quality is not that great but you get used to it.I get his radio show as a podcast. I use pocketcasts though. Required some tinkering with the itunes link. Honestly, I don't think Kyle wants to make those kinds of videos. He's all about laying out the facts and sharing his opinion/arguments in a rational way. What right wingers do is share facts/spin bullshit that justifies their irrational and often emotional arguments/take downs. Sure, Kyle gets emotional/passionate with his commentary sometimes, but he tries his best to make sure that the commentary is based on the facts and accurate information. They're doing two different things and Kyle is honestly good at doing what he is doing now. I doubt he'll do a good job making the kind of videos that right wing youtubers/commentators do.

That being said, I do think there are some left wing youtubers who do try to do the the kind of impactful, "easily won debate" type videos on Youtube. For example the Progressive Voice (who is a bit of an up and coming progressive youtuber) has been making content like that where he specifically goes after right wing youtubers/commentators and tries to debunk them. Thanks for replying! I will check out Progressive Voice!
I'm not sure though, that making those kind of videos implies the need to be non-factual and emotional in your appeal. It might just be extremely useful to chose segments of right wingers like Crowder and then take them appart with factual and serious arguments, but from the position of power that is created by the type of video that you are doing. Having a real reply and attack on specific right wing content might just be the key to win the battle for the  sympathy of the masses. Especially, because you could catch the viewers of Crowder and PragerU and others directly, because they will feel provoced to watch videos that directly attack their favorite content creators. 

I definitely agree with you on all of that stuff but I voice Kyle is mostly a independent guy with little backing from external team members. The regular videos crowder makes are done with full team behind it with a script and badly done research plus those awful skits. 

Anyways, don’t know the hell im trying to articulate but yh its a shame reactionary right wingers get easy views doing hit jobs.

U should also check out humanist report if you haven’t yetI think Kyle is above getting into clickbaity feuds, if he started doing videos of that nature it would damage his credibility Indeed, if he would do non-factual propaganda that surely would damage his credibility. He could, on the other hand, simply use his ability to argue with facts, but combine that with the mentioned approach of directly attacking and commentating right wing segments from a position of power. I just don't see people, who are used to watch and like Crowder and others, switching to Kyle as easily, without seeing him directly "own" or "debunk" their former favorites.*Giant of the Senate*, by Al Franken isn't very partisan, and isn't about policy.  Instead, it's about how Franken, a comedian, learned to be a Senator.  If you've ever wondered why politicians don't talk like regular people, or wanted to learn about political Dynamics in the Senate, this is the book for you.

I am a conservative, and would recommend it highly.  The audiobook version, narrated by Franken himself, is the best version.**A BRIEF HISTORY OF NEOLIBERALISM**, David Harvey.
The title pretty much says it: The history, facets, criticism and consequences of the "common-sense" economical position since the 1980s. And, luckily, quite a nice read!It's not necessarily political, but you should check out Jordan Chariton's (TYT Reporter) book, Corporate Conjob. It's a book that goes over his background as a journalist and goes over the experience he had covering the 2016 presidential election, the DAPL, Flint, and other news stories. He also talks about what is wrong with the mainstream media. The downside to his book is that he's releasing it online chapter by chapter. He's at chapter 3 right now.

Despite that downside though, I think it's a really good book and encourage you to check it out.What actually happened. LolThis tactic only works superficially and initially. These videos lose their impact very quickly, especially now that all the worst operators on Youtube have copied this tactic and they're totally overusing it.

It leads the viewer to expect some radical rhetorical or intellectual smackdown but the video almost never contains such a thing - because that's just extremely hard to pull off and is really only possible in certain circumstances - and so it can't deliver on its promise.

 It's still fine in rare cases, though, like when an ideological opponent (say, Bill Maher) has been genuinely exposed or has just made an indefensible, wrong-headed, self-destructive argument.Our Revolution and Rules for Revolutionaries. The first is Bernie's book about the campaign. The later was written by Bernie staffers about grassroots organizing.Read Kalr Marx’s journalsYeah good questions. Kyle already has politics101 because he has covered so many topics since the start of his channel. If you search for something specific and put 'secular talk' with the question, a video covering said topic would come up. I would also want to know how to contact him via email. Fuck you, Kyle.

Kyle is trying to convince his viewers by putting it in the most outlandish terms possible that this whole Pizzagate thing is nothing more than the absurd allegation that Hillary Clinton is literally prostituting children out of a pizza restaurant. As you've seen the video I linked to, that is not what Pizzagate is about. There is a lot more to the story than that. What Kyle wants to do is reduce it to something absurd, so it becomes unimportant and laughable to investigate. He and the rest of the Justice Democrats are all backed by George Soros. Kyle's handler George Soros donated thousands of dollars to Comet Ping Pong before the widespread allegations of this elite pedophile ring began. So he is bought and paid for to push an agenda, to convince his viewers that this is all a big nothing burger, same with Cenk Uygur and TYT. Meanwhile there has been no investigation into any of this, because [the D.C. Police department is in on it as well.](https://youtu.be/GQVRRSHH7LE) :/ see you make sense until you say they're backed by Soros, then you lose all credibility. Maybe they're saying it's a "nothingburger" because there is objectively no solid evidence, and not because they're plotting against the rest of the world. Why would a news outlet cover conspiracies? 

Sure some of these events in the video should be investigated, no doubt, but a lot of it looks less like "child sex ring" and more like everyday Washington corruption. 
 [Oh they're backed by Soros alright.](https://youtu.be/Kmy9kdH9y-Q)The video I linked to which you haven't watched provides proof.I've watched this before, it's nothing. If you controlled a media outlet and tried to write a story on this, you wouldn't be able to because none of it is evidence, just circumstances. There's a big difference my man. You need to sell out to Big Seltzer immediately. They're just LOOKING for someone to give all their sweet 1st Amendment protected free speech "contributions" to, someone to prop up to do their bidding. You'll also need to do quite a few lesbian porn videos.You need to paste the .rss feed url into the pocket casts search bar if anyone was wondering how to do this.It depends on your relationship with Big Seltzer. Simply drinking it does not automatically make one Kyle Kulinski. Big Seltzer has the power to make one him though.
Would be curious what it is among Bernie supporters and Stein voters.Which is why if she runs again she will get crushed in the primary! Hillary Clinton fuck you.This is the best thing I read on Reddit today.The Jimmy Dore Show is pretty good. I second the Jimmy Dore showTim Black, HA Goodman, Styxenhammer666The Jimmy Dore Show is the shit. The Progressive Voice is alright but mediocre editing tbh (to give credit the host is about 16-17 years old). TJ Kirk and the Drunken Peasants. In fact, Kyle will be doing a debate on dp tonight. Check it outJimmy Dore, Chapo Trap HouseI second that. But as far as political channels go I'd say kyle jimmy dore and pakman are the best YES! It was too easy, Kyle kept shooting fact after fact. I have to give credit to the guy who kept quiet when Kyle was arguing against himBenjamin DixonJimmy Dore and Benjamin Dixon are probably the closet politically. Someone like Sam Seder might be worth watching as well.
What when?https://youtu.be/Jj8LYgwW-JwDavid pakman I ran into razorfist a while ago and yea I'm all for shitting on sjws and his movie reviews seemed fun.  And then the election rolled along and the nonstop trump dicksucking is embarrassing Redacted Tonight with Lee CampNever heard of it, gonna check it out.Jimmy Dore I know, this Benjamin... I'm gonna check him out.I used to watch TJ and the DP podcast, but at this point they are in that group of Youtubers who just talk about irrelevant BS and SJW, so they can get views from a right wing audience.Progressive Voice is a like a drama channel. He's amazing my dude It was a savage beatdownI felt kind of bad because he's clearly not an asshole. Like he was a good sport as Kyle roasted him. Compared to someone like Crowder, who's wrong about politics AND is a horrible person, razorfist isn't that badI hear what you're saying,  but you're gonna suck gop dick that hard it's gotta be called outnah.  I get annoyed with DP sometimes but they're pretty balanced in who they criticize and they're pretty solidly left wing politically.  Yeah that great although I thought Kyle could have been a bit more classy towards Razorfist debating wise.Yeah, they are left wing. I just wish they would stop talking about SJW and this kind of thing.

A year a ago I used to like watching SJW getting owned, but that got old. Little bit more to the left but if that's straight, listen to the Chapo Trap House podcast.  There's clips on the AndroidPolitician channel on YT.  Another podcast I dig is This Is Hell but I don't think there are too many clips on YT.Nah, Kyle knows how it goes these days with debates, especially with conservatives. You have to go all in or they just don't respect you. When the left get it right, they show they have possession of the facts and that's always been the case. Razorfist's Coulter-esque hyperbole and pseudo-smart aleck riffery needed a smackdown. I'm glad he got it.Isn't really hard to take down such an intellectual lightweight Democracy now is really good. A lot more of a traditional news format thoughYou mean the obscure right wing podcast. It was a massacre. Kyle needs to debate someone who is a better debater and has a bigger following, like Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, or Stefan Molyneux. They use a lot of the same talking points but they would be more of a challenge for him.Kyle absolutely trashed him using logic and common sense. I had watched some of Razorfist’s rants earlier in his career and found him kind of entertaining, but for a little over a year, his videos became more pro-Trump, and his super-contrarian attitude about movies and games became extremely annoying. 

I saw his review of Blade Runner 2049 (he claims to be the biggest Blade Runner fan in the world) and it was one of the worst reviews I’ve ever seen. His points about why he thought the film was bad were ridiculous: Ryan Gosling used to be a teen idol (so?), Ridley Scott didn’t direct it (at this stage in Scott’s career, many people would consider that a GOOD thing), the CGI was bad (arguable, but it wasn’t), and he called Denis Villeneuve a “studio hack” (anyone familiar with Villeneuve’s filmography would not say that). Point is, if you’re not familiar with the art of filmmaking, maybe you shouldn’t review movies. (I understand Blade Runner 2049 is not for everybody)

Anyways, Razorfist isn’t as slick as he thinks he is. Just because he delivers his opinions in a quick, reference-heavy Dennis Miller style doesn’t make him smart. He's a real dude who doesn't flip flap on issues. That's why I love him!Because he wasn't Hillary? Come talk about Big Seltzer with us.  We love them!  /me accepts oversized sponsorship check.This is Kyle warming up! He doesn’t debate much so he needed the practice "Bernie only appeals to the fringe 92% of Democrats" - [Peter Douche](https://twitter.com/AngryBerner/status/904945929123389440)I wanna say it was the second to most recent one. In the episode from last week, Kyle briefly does the impersonation as well.jordan peterson is overrated retard I agree somewhat.

The establishment corporate Democrats will never give up their stranglehold on the party. You can even see that they have colluded with the media to not cover Bernie via leaks that came out.


I just wonder how many times the corporate Democrats have to lose before they decide to run a progressive?Can't stand Peterson, hopefully they don't just uncritically accept all his BS.This guy is so desperate to be the new Sam Harris, and if things carry on the way they are, he will be. You already have a number of his atheist followers calling themselves Christian Atheists. That's how dogmatic these folks are. Some humans just need a totem pole, I suppose.I don’t like his political views too, but he is an expert in clinical psychology and behavorial sciences. I am interested in psychology, so I watch his lectures. 

Also, h3 did not stay on the topic of sjw’s and social issues. They talked about psychology, so I would recommend you to watch it. Yes, they have the /r/enough_sanders_spam reddit where they aren't exactly hiding they are CTR. They still own many subreddits on here like /r/bluemidterms2018 and pretty much shill for idiots like Joe Manchin. &gt;I don’t like his political views too, but he is an expert in clinical psychology and behavorial sciences. I am interested in psychology, so I watch his lectures.

Good for you!

&gt;so I would recommend you to watch it.

Nah, I'd find it much less painful to stick needles in my eyes and ears.If Bernie runs with the Democrats again, he would lose. The man needs to run Independent in 2020Weird, I never really thought that they had much control/power compared to the_donald.Dave Rubin is such a boob[You need to find ways to spend your time that aren't generating fake drama.](https://i.imgur.com/SH4IF6t.png)Hey its global warming skeptic! You're really fun to troll. By the way your content is god awful, and thats why you have very few subscribers. Good luck with "the battle of ideas", but I'd consider getting a job instead of wasting your time on a channel thats going nowhere.You need to figure out better ways to spend your time than begging me to pay for your college and healthcare.I'm not begging you to, I'm asking you to consider that college and healthcare are positive investments (investments is a key word, look it up if you don't know what it means) that pay off greatly for the country in the future. Educated healthy people go on to produce for society. It's quite simple, which is why I'm surprised you haven't grasped it.

Your quality of life is what it is today due to doctors and engineers created through socialized public education! Hahahahahaha. You are daft, mate.Incorrect. Bernie Sanders is the most popular politician in the country by a large margin, with massive crossover appeal. If the primary was held again, I don't doubt he would win at this point in time. By 2020, he will have only spread his message farther. His favorables and poll numbers have been the best for a while and I don't see why that would change. People already know what he's about because he tells you and exudes it every time he speaks.

Remember, Bernie Sanders is the most popular politician in America.

What you're saying is that the things that make him popular will suddenly not in 2020. That's simply not the case.Okay, great.  If I feel like you worked hard and earned education funding, I may decide with my spare money to contribute to your education if I choose to do so with my money.  That's the beautiful thing about choice.  I get to decide whether you're worth it or not.

But you're essentially begging me to do it.  It's kinda hard to act macho on a Reddit thread on one hand when you're begging for my tax dollar contributions on the other, isn't it?  

Don't be a pussy, get a job and pay for your own stuff.  You think I'm your daddy or something?Hahaha, you're the one trying to act tough pal.

"Don't be a pussy, get a job and pay for your own stuff."

'Grrr I'm strong, Must do everything on my own. Cooperation is lazy.'

Sorry my friend, there is this thing called the social contract and its the price you pay to live in polite society. As of right now, the social contract does not require you to pay for ones healthcare or college. The current debate is whether it should.

I don't know if you've looked at any public policy polling, government-insured healthcare as a right is supported by even a plurality of Republicans. The debate is shifting, and we'll see who wins in 2020.

For now, be glad! You're side is in power and the laws won't change. Sorry to say the social contract may change within your lifetime, though.

Keep in mind, I'm not asking you for your money insomuch as telling you how it could be better spent by the government. We wouldn't even have to raise your taxes if we just decreased military funding, but I assume you're also against that? Haha. You can disagree, and that's what debate and legislation is for my guy.

Do you support defunding all public education K-12? That's the logical conclusion of your libertarian argument.I'm not sure how "pay for your own shit," is acting tough.  I'm saying it's funny that you're begging for all this money from me to pay for your stuff.  It's just a thing of being an independent person, you know, taking care of yourself rather than asking me to take care of you, that kinda thing.  

It's not really a macho thing. It's called being an adult, you know?  That time when mommy and daddy no longer pay for your stuff?  That phase of life?

As far as a social contract, you're being a pussy about it, so let me give you a more direct meaning.  You want the government to force me to pay for your stuff.  You're begging me to accept this government force because apparently you still want a mommy and a daddy when the current parents obviously won't let you live with them.  

Using PPP just adds to the laughter of the whole thing.  PPP is a far left leaning poll that predicted on election day that Hillary Clinton would, for example, win Michigan by 5%.  I guess that goes to show you that you shouldn't trust polling from leftist entities.  

I am for a minimalist government.  That is, the smallest possible self-preserving government.  Obviously we can afford to spend less on our military given that.  

As far as public education, studies show that public education is garbage, and that much is shown by test scores.  I trust parents to spend that money wisely, maybe it'd create a generation of kids who actually learn in school rather than indoctrinating them into thinking that they deserve everything for free and should shout to get it.Lmao I love the strategy. Public education is garbage. Your solution is to then get rid of it. The smart thing to do would be to look at countries that do it better and try to make ours better.

Regardless, I just view the advancement of society as vital. You're comfortable believe the free market will fix everything, but that's objectively false. You pretend that the policies advocated for would make it impossible to be prosperous, but its just the opposite. People like you are a dying breed, because in the free marketplace of ideas, yours lose out. People are beginning see the tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else, the military industrial complex, the pharmaceutical industry, and so on. America is the only first world nation that hasn't figured out these basic things yet, and we suffer greatly for it.

I bet you understand that a lot of these policies are empirically better for society overall, but maybe not for you in particular. That's fine. Its not a crime to be selfish. Its good that more people are realizing that being selfish isn't better for them in the long run though. Have fun being among a dying breed.[Is this it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYiZJ0laArA)Video linked by /u/gigantic_meaty_balls:

If so holy fuck nice job When someone does a bad job, fire them.

You want to give that person a raise.

The data shows that your public education does no better than private forms of education, and one of the most recent studies proved that privately educated students have a higher ROI on academic achievement.  

All of your ideas assume apriori that properties like prosperity and success are objectively defined and universal to a society.  You assume that a society exists in a fixed state based on your current status versus your expectations.  I do not care about your personal expectations.  I do not care about your prosperity.  I do not care what piece of the pie you think you deserve.

Here's what you get from my society:  Enough to survive.  That means a one room shack with a toilet, food to eat, water, and sanitation.  That's it.  You want something else?  Earn it.  You can deal with your dirt poor minimum standard given to you by the government, or you can go out and prove that you are useful to work for someone.  

Prosperity is defined by you and your goals.  When you get out on your own, you define your own goals.  We don't need a mommy and daddy style government to tell you what your goals are.  That's for you to define.  So when I hear someone talk about "prosperous society," that's someone who doesn't get that there are different measures of prosperity and people have different goals.

Not everyone thinks like you.  This is the kind of condescending babble that has caused you guys to lose election after election.  People do lean to the left on issues because people vote with their hearts, but people ALSO want compromise between left wing and right wing according to almost all data points on the subject.  

And let's also decode another word.  When you say the word "society," you really mean "the government."  Here is what is empirically better for society:  God.  Moving away from a relationship with God has caused lots of hardship for this nation.
Prove God exists and then we can base our Government around him. Until you have something better than 'faith.' Remember, every religion gets a fair shake in America. If you want the Christian God to be in charge, then you also need to give Muslims and Jews and Hindus and other religions the ability to dictate law based on their gods.

I'm glad that we both agree with smaller government.  Hillary did not cause people to vote for her.  People did that on their own.I definitely don't prefer a small government as much as I prefer a government that does good by its people.In other words:  A government that gives you free stuff.Nah man, taxes aren't free :)You're begging for my tax dollars.  Yes, that is trying to mooch off of me.I'm not usually the one to make a "don't talk politics at the dinner table" argument but I wish they just kept these kinds of people off their show. I admire Ethan for inviting people he disagrees with but he's not articulate or informed enough to really challenge political ideas. In the Joey Salads episode Joey ended up looking like he won the argument just because Ethan didn't know what to respond and here he's just letting Peterson do his shtick unopposed and giving neutral responses.

I kinda feel that way about comedians inviting political guests in general, a lot of the times these guys are funny because they call out bullshit about everyday life and stupid things people do without thinking about them, but that doesn't always extend to politics and as a result political guests can often come across as the debate winners. The comedians don't have strong arguments and shy away from their usual character and give these "right, yeah" responses which paints it as if the guest just overcame the bullshit test. 

Compare Ethan harshly calling out Jake Paul vs. struggling to argue with Joey Salads' shitty but well articulated points, anyone who isn't informed about the stuff they discussed will think Joey totally owned Ethan.That's a very true statement but it does not at all address whether elections were rigged or not. People might have voted differently or at all had Sanders' campaign not been disadvantaged. It's very hard to determine the precise effect of the DNC shenanigans and whether the outcome would have been different and it might all have been done in a legally correct way, but if all the allegations are true it is at least immoral.Are you arguing that ads and money have no influence on the outcome of elections?Advertising only has an impact if people like what you have to say.  People heard what Bernie had to say and knew plenty about him, and quite frankly minorities weren't pleased with the focus on White issues like college debt.  Look at the states Bernie lost.  That was no accident that it was states with large numbers of minorities.I have chosen to insert the words "Kyle claims" because Kyle is, once again, talking out of his backside and shitting out that well-known subversive outlet, the Intercept's, talking points.

So, YouTube and Facebook are just supposed to allow anything go up on their platforms. What about child porn? That's potential evidence of a crime being committed. Should Facebook and YouTube take those down? What about copyright infringements, someone uploading an entire movie? Is YouTube wrong to take those down?

Also, before anyone gives me the "free speech" argument, this is not a free speech issue. Facebook and YouTube are not the state or part of the state. And even if it was, your right to free speech does not trump Facebook's and YouTube's property rights. If it does, then you would if have no recourse if some painted graffiti all over your house.^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

Jesus Christ

Edit:and no, not everyone knew "plenty about him" he was not well known when it started. Where as everyone under the sun knew hrcIt does seem like there is no easy way to solve this issue. The sheer amount of content being put online every single hour is just way too much for humans to moderate effectively so it's going to always have to be done by machines. Not only that but if something problematic has been removed and it's bought back the majority of people aren't going to care because as soon as something is old then it's not going to show up on peoples feeds.


I do think that the current algorithms employed by these tech giants are too blunt and I'm not sure whether that is by design or if they're learning to better understand the rules. I think they might always be too blunt because it's better for their brand to be safe rather than sorry.Look at the RCP national poll averages.  Bernie did not pass Hillary at any point, even right up to the final primary, and they had national votes going on that long.The easy solution is to not delete the content. Yes, even child porn. But remove it from accessibility. Archive it in some fashion. Hold onto it for some reasonable period of time to allow authorities/investigators the opportunity to request it. If it doesn't come in a reasonable amount of time, purge it from the Archive to prevent just hoarding everything.The same could be said about Bernie supporters. 

Seriously, is this the level of discourse? Led to a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, and won the war--meaning no case was filed. 

Because a heroine dealer didn't get caught dealing heroine still makes him a heroine dealer.Yeah, you're gonna have to put that goal post back over where it belongs. We all saw you move it just now. Stop being a silly person.&gt;Because a heroine dealer didn't get caught dealing heroine still makes him a heroine dealer.

What if he stops before he gets caught. Is he still a heroine dealer?No but he still delt heroine that possibly killed people; where as the results of the Bush administration did lead to the homicide of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Hey, here's another question: have you ever watched a pirated movie? Or downloaded something illegally? Because, if you have, by your logic, you are a criminal. &gt;Yeah, you're gonna have to put that goal post back over where it belongs. We all saw you move it just now. Stop being a silly person.

What an amusing non sequitur. Well done. And I'm a criminal cause I smoke fat doobs all the fuckin time; you can't equivocate that to ending the lives of people my dudeFairly sure the international courts don't place a statue of limitations on war crimes. &gt;Fairly sure the international courts don't place a statue of limitations on war crimes.

What have I said that makes a limitation period relevant? The word: ever. 

And pirating is a crime. So many people do it, however, that it is hard to prosecute even a fraction of the total, so companies focus more on distributors. &gt;And I'm a criminal cause I smoke fat doobs all the fuckin time; you can't equivocate that to ending the lives of people my dude

"Equivocate"? You mean "equate". And yes I can. If you haven't been convicted for smoking fat doobs, it would be silly of me to call you a drug criminal, wouldn't it? It doesn't mean I can't criticise you, however. But to call you a drug criminal, well, that would just be silly. &gt;The word: ever.

In what way does the word "ever" make a limitation period relevant to the discussion?

&gt;however, that it is hard to prosecute even a fraction of the total, so companies focus more on distributors.

I could make the same argument about war crimes. It is hard to prosecute leaders, so the ICCt focuses more on foot soldiers and low level commanders. I doubt you would accept that argument in defence of Bush though. So why should I accept it in defence of piracy? 
[Here's a video where Kyle explains why he thinks Bush and Cheney should be brought up on war crimes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEuRFm2AGM)&gt;Here's a video where Kyle explains why he thinks Bush and Cheney should be brought up on war crimes.

I know all about why Kyle thinks Bush et al are war criminals. But thinking someone is a war criminal does not make that person a war criminal. Kyle is not the International Criminal Court, therefore, he is not an authority on who or who is not a war criminal. Sorry.I was pointing out a major difference in how having ever committed piracy vs war crimes. Anyhow. 

I didn't say you should defend it. I'm saying that we still socially disapprove (or should) of pirating. 

What is the difference with "war criminals"?

Neither is prosecuted. Both did the deed. &gt;I was pointing out a major difference in how having ever committed piracy vs war crimes. 

What was the major difference you pointed, because I missed it?

&gt;I didn't say you should defend it. I'm saying that we still socially disapprove (or should) of pirating.

I didn't say you said I should defend it. I said I don't accept your argument in defence of why piracy does not equate to war crime in this case.

&gt;What is the difference with "war criminals"?Neither is prosecuted. Both did the deed.

What? 
Judging from what I see in the rest of this thread, you've become a well-fed troll. Nicely done.&gt;Judging from what I see in the rest of this thread, you've become a well-fed troll. Nicely done.

Very good. What do you have to say about the actual argument - i.e. George Bush is not a war criminal as he has not been convicted of any war crimes? Or would you rather stick to abusive ad hominems and non sequiturs?Please...you don't need me to contribute to your obvious thirst. I hear your cry for attention, man; it's all over the place here. I don't see how anyone can click onto here and see that that's *NOT* the case. Rest assured, you're getting exactly what you want from everyone else.   
  
Instead of answering your question, I have one for you; and I don't expect you to give an answer, but rather, just think about it to yourself: *what are you looking to achieve here?*     
   
Who comes to a place like this, feeling the way you do about issues, says the things that you have, and thinks there won't be a conflict of some sort? Unless...was that the point?What if a murderer stops murdering before he gets caught. Is he still a murderer? Yes.&gt;What if a murderer stops murdering before he gets caught. Is he still a murderer? Yes.

Actually, no he isn't. If he gets caught and is acquitted, is he a murderer? It's for a court to decide if someone is a criminal. It is neither for you nor I. Otherwise, we can just go around calling anyone we like war criminals, as Kyle ddoes vis-a-vis Bush. &gt;Please...you don't need me to contribute to your obvious thirst. I hear your cry for attention, man; it's all over the place here. I don't see how anyone can click onto here and see that that's NOT the case. Rest assured, you're getting exactly what you want from everyone else.

That's great. What do you think about the argument?

&gt;Instead of answering your question, I have one for you; and I don't expect you to give an answer, but rather, just think about it to yourself: what are you looking to achieve here?

A free, full and frank exchange of ideas.

&gt;Who comes to a place like this, feeling the way you do about issues, says the things that you have, and thinks there won't be a conflict of some sort? Unless...was that the point?

The point was debate, which is what I am getting from most who are responding to this thread, apart from you. You appear to be more interested in personal attacks. So, I fully expected conflict. What is debate if not conflict? What I did not expect was non sequiturs and abusive ad hominems of the sort you have been making. You equated killing people via war crimes or heroin to piracy. I was pointing out the massive difference in severity. 

Piracy is rarely prosecuted, but putlockers exist. And they are pirating movies, shows. We call them pirates because it's obvious. Bush's actions, or at the very least, his negligence, led to various war crimes. That too, is obvious. 

Both groups have done the deed we accuse them off. Neither have been prosecuted. Yet if we call putlockers pirates, why can we not call Bush a war criminal? "What is debate if not conflict?"    
You seemed to have missed the point of it entirely then.   
  
You're not supposed to approach a debate with the mindset of contention or to butt heads, so to speak. I know that's what debates have become, but that's not what a debate fundamentally is.  
  
You were on the right track with the exchange of ideas. That's definitely in the mix. However, it's not like a fist fight where the goal is to beat anyone (which is what you clearly are aiming for in other threads...and failing, btw). You're supposed to take the other person's POV, consider it, and then honestly, respectfully test their ideas against your own position and arguments, then come to a decision based on each side's merit. You are doing none of that, and you're simply going "NO!" and telling people how they are "wrong." That's not debating.  
  
[You keep saying "abuse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk), yet there is no cruelty or violence.Dave's new look is fantastic.
There is a difference between legal innocence and factual innocence. 
Bush could never be tried because of laws *he* passed so how can that standard be applied fairly?
Here's an example:
https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/08/03/us-hague-invasion-act-becomes-law
It would be like a murderer being acquitted because if found guilty the courthouse would have been invaded.It's been 2 days you're not banned yet. You posted this before going into the chatroom so you were clearly going in intending to cause troublesomeone seems pretty triggered!I totally get what you're saying, and that's true,  innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. That still doesn't change what he did... So semantics? Wanted potential warcriminal that's above the rule of international law? I'm not sure what a more applicable "title" would be? What do you think? Fascinating. Truly fascinating. Every time you have responded to me, it's been with a logical fallacy. It appears you do indeed have nothing to say about the actual topic at hand. It appears you would you rather carry on with abusive ad hominems, non sequiturs and absurd straw men. To be clear the straw man is your claim I am simply going "NO!" and telling people how they are wrong. The abusive ad hominem was calling me a troll. The  non-sequitur was your very first comment. 

Also, how do you know I am failing to beat anyone? Have you been reading all the exchanges. If you have, then you would have fed the troll, wouldn't you? In fact, just engaging me, as you have done, is feeding the troll, isn't it? It seems then that this is a defeat for you. &gt;  Bush could never be tried because of laws he passed so how can that standard be applied fairly? Here's an exam

What? Bush could never be tried because of laws he passed? First, which laws passed by Bush prevents him from being tried as a war criminal? Second, your link does not support your assertion. Thirdly, what does this even mean:

&gt;It would be like a murderer being acquitted because if found guilty the courthouse would have been invaded.&gt;  Yes, even child porn. But remove it from accessibility. Archive it in some fashion. Hold onto it for some reasonable period of time to allow authorities/investigators the opportunity to request it. 

That's probably what these platforms are doing - i.e. archiving this content! But Kyle begrudges them the fact that they are removing this content from accessibility. https://twitter.com/Nin10d0014/status/925401250748870657

Seriously if I could give full chat logs I would

Shao asked Justus to give her an answer as to whether or not slaveholders were more moral than atheists today and it took him 10 minutes to give an answer. He says that slaveowners were more moral than todays atheists because apparently todays atheists want to eradicate native americans or some shit. He also says the soviets of the ussr and "communist china" killed because they were atheists (they didnt, they killed in the name of a communist revolution). But when I suggest that hitler killed the jews because he was christian and hated jews (got mitt uns on SS belts for example) he ignores it. He's quite an entertaining side show on our discord server.

Edit: BTW he thinks Bernie is a Bolshevik. [here](https://i.imgur.com/3CaAZWO.png)

Edit 2: Couldnt resist making this photoshop. Bolshevik Sanders posing after the american revolution in the United Soviet Socialists of America USSA [here](https://i.imgur.com/vUp29Ma.jpg)Ahahaha I love the Bernie pic at the end What is extra funny, Justus spent at least a day arguing that oral language started around 5000BC with the revelation of god. That neanderthals had no language or culture, that humans only began using oral language and written language after they had already began agriculture and urbanizing. And much more laugh worthy things. A shining example of what our homeboy Kyle would call, "a silly person." If he ever makes more awful videos about it, and doesnt censor them, youre in for some laughs on a slow day.I honestly have no idea who this Justus person is or why he's relevant, but that Bernie pic is fantastic.He's the long time troller of the Secular Talk YouTube comments and Blog Talk Radio chat. He goes by the name 'Climate Skeptic', which I think tells you all you need to know.Oh so you don't think that the working class should be emancipated from the chains of enslavement brought upon them by the bourgeois Illuminati lizard elite? Look, if I could invent a time machine and send you back to 1940s Germany I would, Dylan. But I don't own the means of time machine production so how could I. but anyway, the point is I would suck Karl Marx's dick if he were alive today, seeing as he is not I'll just have to make do with Castro #sizedoesntmatter. You won't be calling me a triggered snowflake when Antifa seizes the means of production and brings almighty Marx's classless utopia into existence!!! HOW YOU WILL TREMBLE AT THE MIGHT OF THE WORKING CLASS!!!! [*Hail Marx*] Oh how I will laugh with enormous vigour and enthusiasm when I read your whiny post on some forum sitebook about how you are being oppressed by some anarcho-chomskian goons who have kidnapped you and your family and are making you hit yourself and saying to you "stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Typical capitalist pigs, always hitting themselves" and I will just be reclining in my armchair reading through your pleas for help, thinking "hahaha if only Marx could see our society today! What progress we have made in emancipating the working class!". Dylan. Well see look here, there is still time for you to renounce your far-right liberalist, free-speech-loving pacifism and not be slaughtered like the enslaved capitalist sheep you are, but instead just be starved to death by famine like every other utopia loving working class gentleman. Can't we all just agree to want a better life? Without Gender pronouns? Without people who disagree? Without being oppressed by the homosexual bourgeois elite? Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.oh he's been trying for 3 days to get banned from the discord so he can make a video about triggered sjw snowflakes but he's the triggered one in reality lol

edit: btw nice name #23 lolSomeone has been having a rough weekwow I'm featured in these logs I feel so honored :')I think you guys need to fix your inner cities before you call anybody racist.  Decades have passed and you haven't imporved anything for minorities.  Chicago is STILL segregated 50 years after Republicans told you to stop doing it.  

And don't even get me started about FDR.

As far as slave holders, yeah, slave holders were more moral than Charles Darwin, who wished for the EXTINCTION of Black people and other natives.  As bad as slave owners were, I don't think they wished extinction upon anyone.Looks like you were asked about the athiests in the discord, not Darwin. But ok.You guys get those ads too? At first I was like "yeah, yeah.." and then they drop the ball and spew bullshit.I'm glad someone agrees r/politics is absolute garbo I don't see how that comment even remotely breaks the rules. Did they offer any explanation as to why they banned you for it?They did not, at the end of the thread I call the Main detractor "a fucking shill".  Pretty sure that's what did it.Do you have specific instances where he has retweeted Jacobin articles? What’s your evidence for Murray Bookchin being friends with Bernie Sanders?Social Democracy and Democratic Socialism have many overlapping socialist goals, the ones listed of course. Both support unions for workers as well. The distinction, to the extent of my knowledge, is that Democratic Socialism takes a farther step to the left by believing that the workers should control the means of production. I know that sounds like Marx because it is. It might be a bit more nuanced than that though.I know. I was a marxist once lol. :PLabels are as pointless as this argument. Just discuss the specific policies and whether they result in greater utility.It's like trying to figure out which pizza place called Ray's in New York was the real one. 

And moot since deep dish is better anyway-- BURN! (watch that generate ten times the controversy as any political subject).Hey so i left you tube for a couple months and now i am back. My first video is about the justice democrats its a rant video. I have not posted this yet cause i was hoping to get some feed back from people to see if it is something that i should post please be honest on how you feel about thanksI did show it to some candidates and one responded back that she loved it but i thought i would get some more opinions[This guy doesn't have a life outside of harassing people on the internet](https://imgur.com/a/O6T80).

Projecting much?

You seem to be buttmad about my comments to you.  Yeah, I was rude in that post, but you're just a wee bit oversensitive is what I'm saying.  Need to develop thicker skin is all I'm saying.

I'm perfectly happy with myself and my situation, thankyou :).  Being as interesting of a person as I am, I'm used to ankle biters like you. *blocked text*I'm a big fan of Kyle's, I sincerely despise SJW identity politics bullshit. I've been in the after hours discord, everyone seemed pretty nice to me.Just wait until you find a disagreement.He calls everyone an SJW who doesn't agree with him lol.Feeling rekt yet, ankle biter? 

I bet you also have a dead end skillless job.
You and I are disagreeing right now, You were first complaining about being silenced, then you were complaining about not being banned. The video made absolutely no sense. I'm glad they're leaving you alone, I think most of us here sincerely enjoy speaking with people who disagree with us. If you want to have a productive conversation, tone down the hostility, and lets talk.Never complained about being silenced.  I think that the anger is hilarious quite honestly.  Big difference is that I'm not going to bash you over the head with a U-Lock like leftists will if you dare express disagreement.mm, yeah, typing 120 words per minute, my idea of skillless.You literally did in that video.The lesson is to burn bridges with people who you *know* will stab you in the back. Don't just make alliances with people who agree with you - make alliances with people who you trust.

I feel as though Justice Dems might make the mistake of not doing this. It's one thing to eject the wolves from your flock - it's another to eject the goats.*blocked text*What happened? Did Kyle debate Carl on there recently or something?No Kyle debated some moron named "Razor fist" on The Drunken Peasants podcast, and of course destroyed him, because his ideas were garbage. Now The drunken peasants are (eventually) gonna have David and Sargon debate. Which is just going to be beautiful. If you want to watch Kyle debate I think it's like episode 399*blocked text*I think David is actually ill-equipped to handle Carl on some issues. Then again, the reverse is also true. Should be an interesting debate.

Also, I don't think Sargon is right-wing.Sargon says he’s left wing, and throws a bone in that direction occasionally, but almost every one of his talking points either panders to the right or is one of their talking points. 
Source: had an anti-sjw edgy phase and listened to tons of his videosMaybe it's because I've moved more towards the center recently, but I can understand why Sargon would focus on criticizing the left more than the right. 

So much of the left is filled with moralizing cunts who I just want nothing to do with. I imagine those Trump voters in West Virginia who applauded Sanders after the election would be more eager to vote for someone like him if the American left was a force for East Coast labor instead of West Coast, Bay Area moralizers obsessed with gender theory and race-baiting. But I'm very much afraid that while the left has gotten "#woke" to the malign influence of neoliberal corporatist and globalist shills, very little has been done with regards to far-left ideologues. I fear that movements like Justice Democrats run the risk of breaking bread with these people for the sake of left-wing solidarity against Trump, but we're dealing with personality types that do not coexist; they infiltrate, they subvert and they gentrify movements and communities. I can very much see JD becoming a vehicle for far-left outrage politics in the age of "anything but Trump".

This is why the emergent phenomenon of the "anti-anti-SJW" baffles me.Sargon is a moderate just as I am.  He is to the left of me on the spectrum, but the reality is that it is the left wing that is causing the issues with this country right now.  That’s a big theory you got there my guyi posted this same thread on r/theyoungturks and am now permanently banned for [brigading?](https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/9ym0py)Well when you look at ANTIFA, you see that that is objective.Yeah, damn left wing. Trying to take away peoples healthcare and... transfer mass sums of money to the richest,most powerful elites on Earth. Antifa is a gaggle of trust fund faggots that only really have a place on the west coasts. Didn't see many of them in Charlottesville because it was east coast I get your point, and JD should work to combat that part of the left, but I do think that Sargon and his likes make the SJW groups on the left into something bigger than they really are.The only difference between you and a trust fund gay guy is that you don't have any money. You still sleep with the same amount of women :PI could get mad at you, or I could just keep looking at your username and bust out laughing I think you underestimate the degree to which they dominate media, communications, academia and entertainment, or how much power this actually gives them.*blocked text*....but don't you *DARE* talk bad about Big Seltzer! They make great products!*blocked text**blocked text**blocked text*Who declares bankruptcy over phone bills
you mean daddy Kyle I would describe him as a libertarian, which is what "liberal" essentially means in the UK.If the left does not reject SJW-ism, Dems will be reduced to the party of New York and California, and it will basically never win elections again.  We need to go back to egalitarianism and economic populism.  Preach brother ctlawguy! 

Though with regards to egalitarianism, we have to draw a line in the sand when it comes to equality of opportunity, and (metaphorically of course) shoot anybody who crosses it. 

Egalitarianism should involve strengthening unions within the framework of a free market system (regulated so it doesn't fucking choke on its own fat) and providing healthcare to all legal US citizens, and *not* be a path that leads us back to engaging in the moral phrenology of oppression dialectics, McDiversity, or racial identitarianism.

Change means nothing if we don't learn from our mistakes.I've heard him describe himself as socially liberal. And given that he's pro-NHS, he doesn't actually fit the description of a US libertarian.

In any case, I actually like libertarians quite a bit, even if I disagree with them on economics.Ron Paul. I love his anti war stance, and I like some libertarian ideas. I think he would be good at slashing unnecessary spending.Ron paul of course. He's the conservative equivalent to Bernie Sanders.I almost feel like Ron Paul is cheating. Do you have anyone further to the right?Donald J Trump!!! Cuz he's tremendous and has the best words!The answer should be about what left wing politican I would vote for.  

The answer is none.  The left has gone off the cliff of stupidity.C'mon, that's cheating.Why? There can be only one.Ron Paul's every left-winger's favorite Republican. I'm interested in how far right you can convince yourself to vote.There are some republicans who are essentialy equivalent to corporate democrats who I would reluctantly choose over someone like Hillary Clinton. What comes to mind is John Kasich, maybe John McCain just for the fact that he refused to let his followers believe that Obama was a muslim terrorist, and his recent vote on the healthcare bill was redeeming. Of course he still has a bad voting record, and isnt ideal, but better than most republicans. Gary Johnson is alright as well.If Libretarian counts as right I nearly voted Johnson last election. I voted Stein. Now Kasich is how much I'm willing to go right.Hell yeah! Although I can't believe he called me a cuck. I would NEVER call him fat and Looney. I hope we can still be friends though.No. I think you're referring to SJWs. We don't like them at all either.I'm talking about the Bernie wing and the Hillary wing.  Both are just freaking insane.What... the... fuck?!?

I mean, write fanfiction about fictional characters, but not real people. That's the line, right there.Holy shit I don’t know if this is hilarious or horrifying Ooh, I'm getting hard from thi... wait wut?  wut?  I don't know what you're looking at.  I totally don't have fantasies for Kyle...This can't be for real. Someone is trolling us, send this to Kyle plzMaybe he wrote it about himself. Edit: Sorry that went through 2000 times.Yes he should! He should do something like David Pakman, it'd highlight his fansYes and it would be a lot better than that neoliberal sellout David pakman! Hillary ClintonSo... why did he call Denmark a socialist country, then the country of Denmark issued a statement denying Sanders' claim. From that alone, it appears he is not well-versed in labels and terminology.PragerU has a tier.

-Oil and Natural Gas (Sweet Koch Brothers money)

-Nuclear

-The RestYou know Kulinski is part of the Bernie wing, right?If an election was, say, Susan Collins vs. Roy Moore, and Moore had a legitimate chance of winning, I would probably have to vote Collins.Tweet him about itAttention everyone after watching this video if you don't feel the need to share it then i don't know what where doing as progressives. This video is not monetized just so everyone knows this is not something to make money on. Videos like this are some of the most important videos to share in our fight to win as progressives. I am starting to lose a little faith on how strong this progressives movement is i hope i am proven wrong and it is as strong as people say.
No, Kyle doesn't think that living in a city should mean that you are exposed to massive amounts of air pollution.

It's really quite an elementary position to take, even not accounting for the minimal improvement found in moving to a city from a rural area.So what's your alternative?  Die at age 25 because of disease because of the plagues of insects on the farmlands or get bitten by poisonous snakes that are nearly impossible to detect?  

The biggest cause of bad health is poverty.  Getting people out of poverty is a higher priority than your shitty tree hugging nonsense.Nobody agrees with Justice Democrats.  If you want communism, go to North Korea.Lel you aren't banned, discord was down.You weren't banned, you monumental idiot. Discord was down.

https://imgur.com/DMLbnoXYes, am banned, saying the same thing.  Triggered snowflakes can't handle it, and I finally proved it.Not banned. Just stupid.You guys couldn't handle it, just like you guys couldn't handle truth at the Pakman server and banned me from there and their reddit.

Fact is that you can ban us from your discords and reddits, but you can't ban us from the polls.  That has to feel like shit, eh?You aren't bannedVideo proves otherwise.  

I got what I wanted so not worried about it, lol.There is literally a screenshot in this thread proving you aren't banned. How deep does your delusion go? Please seek psych help.lol, you mean that outdated log?  

As I said, it doesn't even matter if I'm unbanned.  I got what I came for.  It's over :).https://twitter.com/discordapp/status/931999521780809728

But whatever, you'll believe whatever you wanna believe. ;)As far as the Discord, as I said repeatedly, I already have the video evidence.  Again, it's over, get over it :).Discord was down for everyone. I get that you don't want to get your feelings hurt anymore tho.lol, feelings hurt, that's why you had to ban me when you guys got too sensitive.  

I won.  You lost.
Just like last November.

Also, remember that this is the same dude that tried to claim I wasn't banned from David Pakman either, and we all know how that argument turned out.It's a pretty simple solution: cut down on air pollution.

How you enact that can and will vary. There's a million ways to do it. A particularly interesting (and new) option is to coat concrete buildings with a titanium oxide additive which absorbs pollutants and, on contact with water, the pollutant washes off after being converted to either nitrates or nitrites, I can't remember.

That's one option that, where it's been used, has had a dramatic impact on air pollution and respiratory health.

Or we could just be lazy, unimaginative, cynical children like you. In which case we'll just expose as many people as possible to vast amounts of harmful compounds and shrug it off because, fuck it, at least they're not dying of disease on a farm.Why is it that you guys pretend that all of this shit is free?  Do you guys on the left ever recognize the cost of anything other than the military?  It's like you guys seriously think that the only things that cost money are boots on the ground.

We're talking about AFFORDABILITY.  People in poverty need jobs, first and foremost.  I don't give a damn what you think in your glass house about how clean the air is.  I care about the guy who works himself to death early in life, and I care about him being able to rise above that work and have the opportunity to do something.  

We take care of people in poverty first.  That's #1 priority, not you and your shitty tree hugging nonsense.  It's about the poorest of the poor having a better standard.  

These things you guys talk about cost money, lots of money.  When you're talking about complex alloys meant to fill specific roles, you're adding A LOT of cost.  This ain't free.  Companies are less incentivized to expand when you increase their cost of expansion.&gt;We talk about Naziism being a major problem, and most of it is sadly coming from the left wing.  

Normally I'd prepare a brief lecture about fascism being an intrinsically right wing phenomenon. But I'll be generous here and ask you a quick question: can you define left and right?

&gt;Fact is that while Israel has made some mistakes, it is a far better nation than any other in the Middle East, and has been a wonderful partner to the world and a tireless worker and contributor to UN efforts (what exist).

This has nothing to do with illegally occupying land that isn't theirs.

&gt;Fact is that Israel is tolerant of diversity, even moreso than Western nations.

In what way?

&gt;Not only do Israelis tolerate Arabs, but they serve in the government at higher rates than their percentage of the population.

[citation needed]


&gt;And you want to talk about apartheid?  Liberals love to pick on Israel, yet ignore the blatant apartheid conditions in south Chicago, which actually do rival those of South Africa when it was prevalent.  South Chicago's conditions are more miserable than any part of the nation, yet liberals don't talk about it.

Apartheid is a legal framework that results in fragmented social structures, similar to the Black Laws of reconstruction, and Jim Crow. What legal framework is there in Chicago that requires, by law, division of the races?

Presumably you think you're making a good point, but in reality you're just pointing out the end results of social stratification on economic and racial lines, with poor economic prospects and low standards of education that would enable minorities to actually get a shot at life. Which- make sure you're sitting down for thus- liberals talk about *literally all the time.*



&gt;Yet they have the gull to talk about Israel, a nation that tolerates people of all backgrounds, which has a higher atheist population than the United States and treats their secular populations well.

It's spelled "gall," as in "guts." Taking a hill into an argument sounds miserable.

Regardless, you've missed the point again. We are not criticizing Israel, we are criticizing Israel's violations of international law and advocating that they not reap the benefits of our friendship as a nation until they follow the law.

&gt;Here's an idea, try to be an atheist in Palestinian administered territory and see how far you go.  Go uncovered and act freely as a woman.  Better yet, let's wait and see if they ever take the destruction of Israel out of their documents.  

Red herring.


&gt;Leftists are antisemitic Muslim apologists these days, and this is what Sargon has hit a nerve about and he is right about.

Let me put this as delicately as possible:

* Leftists most certainly are not. I'm a leftist and I think Islam is just as dangerous as Christianity. Your statement is now dismantled. Generalizations are indefensible.

*Sargon can't even define basic terms, nor does he know anything about history, economics, religions, political theory, or logic and reasoning skills. If your source is Sargon, you will never arrive at a conclusion that is in any way reliable or true.

&gt;Why is it that you guys pretend that all of this shit is free?  Do you guys on the left ever recognize the cost of anything other than the military?  It's like you guys seriously think that the only things that cost money are boots on the ground.


Oh, you want to talk about economics? Okay, then.


&gt;We're talking about AFFORDABILITY. 

The additive I mentioned is not expensive, nor do you need a lot of it to make a significant difference.


&gt;People in poverty need jobs, first and foremost. 

Guess what climate-conscious infrastructure projects do? They create jobs. Stable, sustainable jobs. Try again.

&gt;I don't give a damn what you think in your glass house about how clean the air is.

Son, you need to calm your tits and get off that horse.

&gt;I care about the guy who works himself to death early in life, and I care about him being able to rise above that work and have the opportunity to do something.  

Like live a long, successful, healthy life in a clean environment with sustainable jobs in industry sets that would and will create millions of jobs?


&gt;We take care of people in poverty first.  That's #1 priority, not you and your shitty tree hugging nonsense.  It's about the poorest of the poor having a better standard.  

My shitty tree hugging nonsense, as you call it, is actually an explicit concern for the people who are moving from impoverished areas to do moderately better for themselves only to be exposed to air that is *equal to ~4.25 packs of cigarettes a day.* There is no economic, social, or moral benefit to be had in that situation. There is no point in trying to "take care of people in poverty first" when your efforts to do so place them in different but still awful conditions. Especially not when the alternative is giving those same people jobs that will benefit the health, happiness, and stability of everyone around them. It's called fucking markets. Read about 'em sometime.



&gt;These things you guys talk about cost money, lots of money.  When you're talking about complex alloys meant to fill specific roles, you're adding A LOT of cost.  This ain't free.  Companies are less incentivized to expand when you increase their cost of expansion.

I'm talking about titanium oxide mixed into a cheap chemical binder and sprayed onto buildings. Titanium oxide is cheap and plentiful enough that it's used to make sunscreen. Is sunscreen insanely expensive? Is sunscreen a specialty alloy? Do you even know what titanium oxide is, skippy? Do you comprehend how plentiful ilmenite is, and therefore how cheap this option is? Do you also understand that businesses benefit from a healthier labor pool, and that businesses could therefore pay independent contractors fees on a quote-by-quote basis to literally clean the air around their facilities?

Cleaning the air costs money, yes. And when something costs money it creates jobs. Jobs create opportunity. Jobs in a city with cleaner air means that that opportunity can he enjoyed for decades by even the lowest citizens.

Does that make a little more sense, or do I need to draw you a picture? Maybe after that I can draw you other pictures about other cheap, easy, beneficial solutions?

"can you define left and right?"

Economic left is collectivism, economic right is individualism.  If you look at the policies of Germany in the 1930s, they are far more collectivist than the United States has ever been.  If you compare Germany in the 1930s to the US, they are considerably further along on collectivism.  They believed in intense regulations, welfare, unemployment, universal healthcare and education, gun control, an extremely strong central government.  

"This has nothing to do with illegally occupying land that isn't theirs."

The only UN recognized nation in the former province of Palestine is Israel.  There is no internationally recognized nation called Palestine.  The way an armistice is set up is based on military boundaries, not civilian boundaries.  Nothing about international law prevents civilians from crossing the military borders.  

To put it simply and avoid complications, Palestine only has some administrative control over West Bank and Gaza, NOT full control, not sovereignty.  Sovereignty comes with UN recognition.  We don't have that.  Israel is the only UN recognized nation.

"What legal framework is there in Chicago that requires, by law, division of the races?"

Fair Housing Act of 1934 signed by FDR, which allowed blatant discrimination through redlining practices by local communities.  Even though Republicans defeated FDR's legislation in 1968, nothing has been done to fix the segregation already created by that act.  This is apartheid, when poor neighborhoods are neglected, not provided with basic necessary services while other areas of Chicago are catered to.  

"We are not criticizing Israel, we are criticizing Israel's violations of international law"

Know who else doesn't follow international law?  The United States.  In fact, the US breaks more international laws than Israel by a long shot.  If you are to believe in sanctions for Israel, we should be sanctioning ourselves.  That is, closing ourselves off from trading with other nations.  

But no, this has nothing to do with international law.  This has everything to do with defending Palestine, a nation that directly calls for the destruction of the Jews, just as Hitler did.  Palestine, despite being one of the worst violators gender equality, that still punishes homosexuals, is allowed to operate in the UN as an observer state.

"If your source is Sargon, you will never arrive at a conclusion that is in any way reliable or true."

You guys always say that, but then end up being proven wrong.  Fact is that liberalism is one of the worst predictors of the future there is.  Case and point?  Obamacare.  You said it would lower premiums back in 2009, that was wrong.  You said that Hillary would win the election, that was wrong.  

So if you ever want to be wrong about future predictions, just ask a liberal to predict the future, and pretty much go with the complete opposite of what they said."The additive I mentioned is not expensive, nor do you need a lot of it to make a significant difference."

I'm not interested in weasel words.  Provide a cost analysis of different industrial methods and then compare them to the one you mentioned.  I want numbers, not feelings.

"Guess what climate-conscious infrastructure projects do? They create jobs. Stable, sustainable jobs. Try again."

How many jobs?  How many people are qualified for the work?  How many jobs are being lost to replace it?  See, when you replace something, the jobs also are replaced.  You do not just tack on the green jobs on top, you use them as a replacement for jobs lost.

Fact is that if the cost per unit of energy is larger, guess what?  You are not creating jobs, you are costing jobs.  

"Son, you need to calm your tits and get off that horse."

Couldn't care less about your pearl clutching.  I care about poor people, especially farmers who live in some of the worst conditions imaginable.  

"Like live a long, successful, healthy life in a clean environment with sustainable jobs in industry sets that would and will create millions of jobs?"

Got news for you, I think I trust industry experts more than some random dude on Reddit about which method is cheaper.  If your method produced more prosperity for industry and commerce, it would already be done.  Companies love to cut costs and they love to do things more efficiently.  If your way more economical, they would do it.

But naturally your ideas fail in the free market, which is why you want to apply the force of government.  When your ideas fail in the free marketplace of ideas, time to ask for that government help.

As I said above, fighting poverty, getting people off of their old farms comes FIRST, yes, FIRST.  You have not mentioned farm poverty once as of yet, which shows how out of touch all of you are.  

" Especially not when the alternative is giving those same people jobs that will benefit the health, happiness, and stability of everyone around them. "

And this is exactly what I'm talking about.  You raise the cost of manufacturing, there will be fewer jobs and you don't necessarily fix the problem.  There is no evidence that these kinds of regulations produce better environmental conditions by themselves.  

All developing economies, from the British Industrial Revolution to the American economic golden ages produced lots of pollution.  These impacts were reduced far before there was an EPA, and there is no evidence that the EPA did anything to aid in it.  Studies show that air and water quality were improving just as fast before the EPA as it did after.

So you just create hoops of fire for companies to jump through and don't even produce an improvement.  That doesn't sound very effective to me.

"I'm talking about titanium oxide mixed into a cheap chemical binder and sprayed onto buildings. "

And I'm telling you that, if this produced cheaper results, companies would use it.  India is oen of the world's fastest growing economies.  The US, European nations and Australia are the slowest growing countries.  Sorry to tell you, but when you're in last place, I don't think you are in any position to tell ultra fast developing nations of Asia how they can better do business, you know?  

"Is sunscreen insanely expensive?"

And this is exactly why I say the things I say above.  Now I'm not sure how much titanium oxide is in sunscreen, but I would estimate it's considerably less than what is sprayed on buildings, and more importantly, it's reasonable to say that a person has considerably less surface area than a building that could take up 2-3 city blocks.  

"Cleaning the air costs money, yes. And when something costs money it creates jobs"

Cleaning the air costs money, hiring workers costs money.  This is money spent NOT on producing a product or service.  That's the thing, you completely ignore productivity.  It would be like hiring 50 people to dig ditches, then hiring 50 new people to fill those same ditches and then hiring 50 more to dig them back up and cycling through that.  Yeah, you can hire people all you want to do that work, but how much have you produced doing that? lol.&gt;I'm not interested in weasel words.  Provide a cost analysis of different industrial methods and then compare them to the one you mentioned.  I want numbers, not feelings.

I haven't provided feelings, I've addressed yours. And considering that I don't speak Italian, I doubt I can find any cost analyses of the service I've mentioned since it's brand new- and being profitably deployed by private businesses.


&gt;How many jobs?
X+Y=Z, where X is the number of extant jobs and Y is the number of jobs added, with Z being the result. Since I can't tell you how many people it takes, I can't tell you how many jobs it adds. But it adds more jobs than there currently are- jobs which add a tangible benefit which reduces extraneous societal costs.


 &gt;How many people are qualified for the work?  How many jobs are being lost to replace it?

It's spraying a building. You've clearly never been on a job site before. Why would it have to cost jobs? We're talking about a commercial service.

&gt;See, when you replace something, the jobs also are replaced.

I'm not proposing that anything be replaced.

&gt;You do not just tack on the green jobs on top, you use them as a replacement for jobs lost.

You do if the green jobs add value and service. Again, simple market reasoning. 


&gt;Fact is that if the cost per unit of energy is larger, guess what?

Cost per unit of energy? What the fuck are you talking about?


&gt;Couldn't care less about your pearl clutching.  I care about poor people, especially farmers who live in some of the worst conditions imaginable.  

Since I come from a family of farmers, I'll happily tell you to fuck right off with that condescending bullshit. I have not said at any point that farmers shouldn't get improvements.

&gt;Got news for you, I think I trust industry experts more than some random dude on Reddit about which method is cheaper. 

You didn't even know this "method" existed before today. How do you know of any industry experts to trust? 

&gt;If your method produced more prosperity for industry and commerce, it would already be done.

It's a new technology. Markets lag. Try harder.

&gt;Companies love to cut costs and they love to do things more efficiently.  If your way more economical, they would do it.

New technology. Try again.


&gt;But naturally your ideas fail in the free market, which is why you want to apply the force of government.  When your ideas fail in the free marketplace of ideas, time to ask for that government help.

At what point have I stated the government has to do this? I've presented a neatly packaged capitalist, free market solution for you and you've yet to even wrap your head around it.


&gt;As I said above, fighting poverty, getting people off of their old farms comes FIRST, yes, FIRST.  You have not mentioned farm poverty once as of yet, which shows how out of touch all of you are.  

Where are they going to go from those farms? What will they do when they get there? Why does the answer to the previous two questions mean that jobs cannot be added to the marketplace to also improve the conditions in the city? Especially the city which you've stated is an improvement and therefore desirable as a destination?

&gt;And this is exactly what I'm talking about.

No. No it isn't.

&gt;You raise the cost of manufacturing, there will be fewer jobs and you don't necessarily fix the problem.

So a one-time application of chemically inert material increases the cost of manufacturing? Okay, you've definitely got no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;There is no evidence that these kinds of regulations produce better environmental conditions by themselves.  

Where did I mention regulations? Strawman.


&gt;All developing economies, from the British Industrial Revolution to the American economic golden ages produced lots of pollution.  These impacts were reduced far before there was an EPA, and there is no evidence that the EPA did anything to aid in it.  Studies show that air and water quality were improving just as fast before the EPA as it did after.

[citations needed]

Although frankly I already know you're talking out your ass, but try to back up your position anyway.



&gt;So you just create hoops of fire for companies to jump through and don't even produce an improvement.  That doesn't sound very effective to me.

When have I mentioned adding hoops of fire? Your objections don't even apply to what I'm discussing.


&gt;And I'm telling you that, if this produced cheaper results, companies would use it.

Companies are already using it. In the country where it was developed. In the last 10 years.

&gt;India is oen of the world's fastest growing economies.  The US, European nations and Australia are the slowest growing countries.

Which, by your logic, means they have the most potential to add reasonable precautionary measures to prevent the atrocious effects of industrial development on the labor force.

&gt;Sorry to tell you, but when you're in last place, I don't think you are in any position to tell ultra fast developing nations of Asia how they can better do business, you know?  

Irrelevant.


&gt;And this is exactly why I say the things I say above.

No, you said the things above because you have no idea what you're talking about.


&gt;Now I'm not sure how much titanium oxide is in sunscreen, but I would estimate it's considerably less than what is sprayed on buildings, and more importantly, it's reasonable to say that a person has considerably less surface area than a building that could take up 2-3 city blocks.

Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess all paints using it as a white pigment are just unbelievably, impossibly expensive, especially when you consider that it takes more titanium oxide to make a pigment than it does to do this.


&gt;Cleaning the air costs money, hiring workers costs money.  This is money spent NOT on producing a product or service.

I've literally described this option as a service. Keep up.

&gt;That's the thing, you completely ignore productivity.

Productivity is severely hampered by sick workers. Cleaning the air provides more jobs, creates healthier workers, lowers the strain on local and national infrastructures due to health crises, and has a variety of cumulative benefits. Try again.

&gt;It would be like hiring 50 people to dig ditches, then hiring 50 new people to fill those same ditches and then hiring 50 more to dig them back up and cycling through that.  

Yeah, it's nothing like that at all.

Since I'm sure you are impossible to offend (I'm assuming you hate snowflakes), I won't bother to he tactful here: you're a fucking moron.

&gt;Economic left is collectivism, economic right is individualism. 

Wrong. Left and right are not economic terms. You aren't even familiar with the most basic terms necessary to prove your position. Try again.

&gt;If you look at the policies of Germany in the 1930s, they are far more collectivist than the United States has ever been.  If you compare Germany in the 1930s to the US, they are considerably further along on collectivism.  They believed in intense regulations, welfare, unemployment, universal healthcare and education, gun control, an extremely strong central government.

The way an armistice is set up is based on military boundaries, not civilian boundaries.  Nothing about international law prevents civilians from crossing the military borders.

It does prevent Israel from providing any sort of municipal benefits. Doing so constitutes a violation, and renders the settlements of expanded borders- which is against international law.

&gt;To put it simply and avoid complications, Palestine only has some administrative control over West Bank and Gaza, NOT full control, not sovereignty.  Sovereignty comes with UN recognition.  We don't have that.  Israel is the only UN recognized nation.

Okay, buddy.


&gt;Fair Housing Act of 1934 signed by FDR, which allowed blatant discrimination through redlining practices by local communities.  

I'm pretty tall, you know. If you'd like I can give you a boost so you can grasp at those straws a bit more effectively.

&gt;This is apartheid, when poor neighborhoods are neglected, not provided with basic necessary services while other areas of Chicago are catered to.

No. Apartheid is when all citizens of x color or nationality are restricted uniformly without exception. No such thing exists in Chicago.

&gt;Know who else doesn't follow international law?  The United States.  In fact, the US breaks more international laws than Israel by a long shot.  If you are to believe in sanctions for Israel, we should be sanctioning ourselves.  That is, closing ourselves off from trading with other nations.  

Tu quoque. Whether or not we follow international law is an entirely different matter. It does not render the idea of Israel following international law wrong or unworthy of consideration.


&gt;But no, this has nothing to do with international law.  This has everything to do with defending Palestine, a nation that directly calls for the destruction of the Jews, just as Hitler did.  Palestine, despite being one of the worst violators gender equality, that still punishes homosexuals, is allowed to operate in the UN as an observer state.


And Saudi Arabia sits on the human rights council. Another tu quoque. You're bad at this.

&gt;You guys always say that, but then end up being proven wrong.

Considering you can't even grasp the most rudimentary dichotomies necessary for your argument, I'd avoid statements like that if I were you.

 Fact is that liberalism is one of the worst predictors of the future there is.  Case and point?  Obamacare.  You said it would lower premiums back in 2009, that was wrong.  You said that Hillary would win the election, that was wrong.  

I said no such thing. Many that I know also said no such thing. Can you deal out anything but generalizations? Also, red herring.


&gt;So if you ever want to be wrong about future predictions, just ask a liberal to predict the future, and pretty much go with the complete opposite of what they said.

Red herring^2


"I haven't provided feelings, I've addressed yours. And considering that I don't speak Italian, I doubt I can find any cost analyses of the service I've mentioned since it's brand new"

Saying that it's brand new is just a copout for you to do your due diligence.  You are telling me about this great new technology and can't even fucking tell me how much it costs?  Seriously? You spent basically half of your post defending a technology you know nothing about in terms of cost, only offering "applying profitably," which says nothing about the cost, as we have no idea what the actual impact on the bottom line is.

"Where did I mention regulations? Strawman."

What is the video about?  What have I spent this entire time talking against?  If you are not for regulating companies, then why are you here again?  

"Although frankly I already know you're talking out your ass,"

Which is rich coming from someone who cannot even tell me the cost of a technology he's vouching for.  Oh, but tanning lotion uses it and it's cheap!  Talk about talking out of your ass.  I would give you both of the studies for both Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, but I'm not putting forth the effort when you refuse to do so yourself.

"especially when you consider that it takes more titanium oxide to make a pigment than it does to do this."

Again, talking out of your ass considering you don't read Italian thus don't have any documentation of this "new" (i.e. 10+ year old) technology.

Yeah, you're a libtard.Left and right wingers have both social and economic positions.  You ... do know that, right?  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics
Scroll down to economics.  That will give you the basics of the economic right.

For more information on social welfare, see this Wiki too.  This will give you the basics of Nazi and their centralization of welfare and abolition of private charities, which is significantly more collectivist than anything done in Europe even today, where private charities are welcomed.  Charity is an individualist notion.

"No. Apartheid is when all citizens of x color or nationality are restricted uniformly without exception. No such thing exists in Chicago."

It exists as much in Chicago as it did during Slavery.  There were lots of free Black men in the US during that time too, does that mean slavery is not apartheid in your eyes?  Don't be stupid.  This was the result of a program SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to segregate minorities that was never fixed.  Black communities are not provided adaquate public services, resulting in gangs and horrible urban squalor.

That is as deep as apartheid gets.

"Tu quoque. Whether or not we follow international law is an entirely different matter. It does not render the idea of Israel following international law wrong or unworthy of consideration."

You are proposing that we not give Israel the benefits of friendship.  What you are doing is providing multiple standards to countries that do the same thing.  In fact, the US actually deserves far worse than Israel, much worse, for the butchering and genocidal bombing of Iraq that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians.  When you gonna advocate that we pay for those gross violations of humanity there?.  That is the entire argument.  It went a bit too far over your head apparently.

"And Saudi Arabia sits on the human rights council."

And that is even worse.  At no point have I defended Saudi Arabia.  In fact, you guys treat them with kid gloves.  Why are you not demanding that they start taking Syrian refugees?  Liberals talk about refugee resettlement being this great thing, yet Saudi Arabia takes none.  That's right, ZERO, and you leftists are silent.

What I said above still stands, and I am glad that you didn't even attempt to refute something indisputable.  Fact is that the same CBO that you guys rant and rave about with Trumpcare also predicted premiums would fall.  That didn't happen.

I am simply explaining what the data is telling us.&gt;Saying that it's brand new is just a copout for you to do your due diligence.

Your position to this point is a copout. I've presented a free market solution, and you've done nothing but rail against things I haven't even mentioned.

 &gt;You are telling me about this great new technology and can't even fucking tell me how much it costs?  Seriously?

From the person who understands neither environmental regulations nor the impact I've had. And, as I said, since I don't speak Italian (or Spanish, or Portuguese), no, I don't have cost analyses. Feel free to dig them up. 

&gt;You spent basically half of your post defending a technology you know nothing about in terms of cost, only offering "applying profitably," which says nothing about the cost, as we have no idea what the actual impact on the bottom line is.

A) I spent half the post dragging you back from your insane laissez faire ramblings that have nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

B) A one-time process has a diffused impact on any bottom line. This is a concept which I suspect, for you, will be a stunning new concept: investment. It's where you spend money with the intention of making a return on that investment over time. Such returns can be tangible (wealth, goods), or intangible (morale, environmental).


&gt;What is the video about?  What have I spent this entire time talking against?  If you are not for regulating companies, then why are you here again?  

I specifically presented a solution that doesn't require regulations to cater to your simplistic mind. Clearly I did not make it simple enough. Oh dear.


&gt;Which is rich coming from someone who cannot even tell me the cost of a technology he's vouching for.

Still waiting on those citations- which, by the way, are available in English, and would take about 10 minutes to gather if you actually had them.

&gt;Oh, but tanning lotion uses it and it's cheap!  Talk about talking out of your ass.

An insanely plentiful ore yields titanium oxide through an insanely cheap process involving sulfuric acid (which is also insanely cheap). It follows that a product containing such an ingredient using binding agents (which are also insanely cheap) would be... cheap.

&gt;I would give you both of the studies for both Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, but I'm not putting forth the effort when you refuse to do so yourself.

So 2 acts which were subpar disprove an entire concept? Okay.



&gt;Again, talking out of your ass considering you don't read Italian thus don't have any documentation of this "new" (i.e. 10+ year old) technology.

Is my logic flawed? A cheap mineral mixed with a cheap chemical blend makes a cheap product? It's entirely safe to infer such a conclusion if one has comparable knowledge to do so. That's a rational expression called judgment. If you'd been given any sort of solid education, you'd be able to follow along.

Sadly, all you've done is throw out canned objections to things I didn't say because you've no familiarity with any of the concepts involved in the problem at hand. 


&gt;Yeah, you're a libtard.

Spoken like a whimsical stranger that doggedly throws out objections to sweeping government regulation in the face of a tentative free market solution. Incidentally, it's also what a cynical, childish individual with no spark of creativity or compassion would say. Enjoy wasting your life with that mindset- it's the only life you get so I hope you like the only ideas you'll ever have.

&gt;Not only do Israelis tolerate Arabs, but they serve in the government at higher rates than their percentage of the population.

[That must be why they shoot Palestinian children for shits and giggles.](https://youtu.be/jm_L5fRoQUA)&gt;Left and right wingers have both social and economic positions.  You ... do know that, right?  

Uh-huh. I'm sure.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics
&gt;Scroll down to economics.  That will give you the basics of the economic right.

Ahhh, Wikipedia. Got any papers from political science journals to back yourself up there? Because I do. And even if they do have some intersectionality with economics apart from sociopolitical stresses, i can absolutely guarantee that your arbitrary deployment of individualism versus collectivism is, at best, laughable.


&gt;For more information on social welfare, see this Wiki too.  This will give you the basics of Nazi and their centralization of welfare and abolition of private charities, which is significantly more collectivist than anything done in Europe even today, where private charities are welcomed.  Charity is an individualist notion.
&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_People%27s_Welfare

Again with the collectivism.


&gt;It exists as much in Chicago as it did during Slavery.  There were lots of free Black men in the US during that time too, does that mean slavery is not apartheid in your eyes?

It absolutely does. Apartheid is different from slavery. That's why it has a different name.

&gt;Don't be stupid.  This was the result of a program SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to segregate minorities that was never fixed.  Black communities are not provided adaquate public services, resulting in gangs and horrible urban squalor.

Sounds an awful lot like the classist policies that the Justice Democrats are uppity about to me.



&gt;You are proposing that we not give Israel the benefits of friendship.

Yes.

 &gt;What you are doing is providing multiple standards to countries that do the same thing.  In fact, the US actually deserves far worse than Israel, much worse, for the butchering and genocidal bombing of Iraq that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians.  When you gonna advocate that we pay for those gross violations of humanity there?.  That is the entire argument.  It went a bit too far over your head apparently.


I've happily argued both online and in person for over a decade now that most, if not all, US presidents since WWII (including Truman and FDR) should have been impeached at the least for war crimes, but it would be more satisfactory for them to be executed for crimes against humanity. Does that explain my position on these so-called "multiple standards" for you? Or would you like to revert to the entirely sufficient statement I made earlier about it being an entirely different subject?


&gt;And that is even worse.  At no point have I defended Saudi Arabia.

Nor should you. Not should I. Nor should anyone. That's precisely my point. If I said that the UAE being in the human rights council makes everything the US has done perfectly fine and dandy, that'd be absurd, right?

&gt;In fact, you guys treat them with kid gloves.  Why are you not demanding that they start taking Syrian refugees? 

That would be an awful idea, since refugees would find neither safety nor security in Saudi Arabia. If you could see the letters I've written to Senators and Representatives from my state, you'd understand that I hold them to the same standard that I hold Israel and the US.


&gt;Liberals talk about refugee resettlement being this great thing, yet Saudi Arabia takes none.  That's right, ZERO, and you leftists are silent.

Because we recognize that Saudi Arabia is not a good place for refugee resettlement.


&gt;What I said above still stands, and I am glad that you didn't even attempt to refute something indisputable.  Fact is that the same CBO that you guys rant and rave about with Trumpcare also predicted premiums would fall.  That didn't happen.

Nothing you've said so far has any basis in fact, and thus cannot stand. Until you start furnishing facts, you're lying with that statement.

To top that off, the CBO being wrong about one program doesn't make them wrong about this one. You'll have to provide data as to what they were wrong about, how they were wrong about it, and how that doesn't apply to something like Trumpcare. Just because A is bad doesn't mean B is good. Healthcare is, as your daddy says, "complicated." 


&gt;I am simply explaining what the data is telling us.

**Right-wing politics**

Right-wing politics hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal or desirable, typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics or tradition. Hierarchy and inequality may be viewed as natural results of traditional social differences or the competition in market economies. The term right-wing can generally refer to "the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system".

The political terms "Left" and "Right" were first used during the French Revolution (1789–1799) and referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament: those who sat to the right of the chair of the parliamentary president were broadly supportive of the institutions of the monarchist Old Regime.

***

**National Socialist People's Welfare**

The Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (NSV), meaning "National Socialist People's Welfare", was a social welfare organization during the Third Reich. The NSV was established in 1933, shortly after the NSDAP took power in Germany. Its seat was in Berlin.

The structure of the NSV was based on the Nazi Party model, with local, county (Kreis) and group administrations.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28&gt;  I've presented a free market solution

No, you haven't.  A free market solution requires cost-benefit analysis.  That means comparing the costs of the application versus the costs non-application.

&gt; no, I don't have cost analyses.

Which is the entire problem.  You cannot give me a quantitative justification for this great "new" technology you keep bumbling on about.

&gt;  your insane laissez faire ramblings

Good to know I wasn't strawmanning you when I talked against your regulatory nonsense.  Glad we have that cleared up.

&gt; B) A one-time process has a diffused impact on any bottom line.

So, no maintenance?  What if the building gets renovated or repainted?  What if the exterior is damaged by high winds or heavy rains?  You are aware of how huge of an imapct weather has on large parts of India, right?  Monsoons there wreak havoc.

Somehow I call BS, but I'm sure you can tell me those kinds of specifics about this Italian product when you can't even read Italian.

&gt; I specifically presented a solution that doesn't require regulations

Wrong.  Solutions require cost/benefit analysis.  You presented nothing more than an idea, but nothing that you can even demonstrate would solve the problem.

&gt; ...  insanely plentiful ... insanely cheap ... also insanely cheap ... also insanely cheap ... cheap

Come back when you can define what these weasel terms mean in numerical terms.  Moreover, come back with an understanding of how things are mixed together.  Are they combined under high or low temperature?  What are the catalysts?  What are all of the minor ingredients in the mixture and how are they mixed?  Do you assume that they just put titanium oxide into a kettle and stir it with the other ingredients or something?  

 &gt; So 2 acts which were subpar disprove an entire concept?

FIFYShould be anti-fundamentalism instead of anti-name-specific-religion-here, though.Sargon is smart, just somewhat of a bore and too right wing for my taste.

Though I must admit, the truther shit called this into question.  Not sure if he actually believes it or was pandering to the scattered libertarians of the time.  Not that pretending to believe lunatic nonsense is any better, of course...I agree with you, but it's not so much a dog whistle as bait for white nationalists to lure people in by ascribing it to skin color.

I hear "enlightenment values" used on the left, which I'd prefer to use if the other term is too damaged.  Plus, "the west" is vague and by no means a singular culture with agreed upon ideals.Well, he has convinced hundreds of thousands of people to watch him make the same video over and over again.

Every time I hear him slam JD, he is usually going after Ro Khanna.Yup. It isn't boding well. Twitter is blowing up and people are withdrawing support for JD. It is sad that JD bows down so easily to corporate media pressure.I actually like Sargon. The SJW left NEEDS to be criticized by people on the left. Yes, he does give Trump a pass too much, but he still agrees with Kyle on 90% of issues and I think he's on point most of the time. Hell, he's talked to Kyle for hours on video and they got along great. He originally started his channel because he thought the left was being taken over by SJWs and wanted to do something about it.Careful vetting, too.Exactly. Make it its own country rather than fight over it.Fuck monarchies, fuck the Crusades, and fuck royalists and crusaders. Jerusalem should be its own city-state, its own country.Support individual candidates. JD's rat-infested.If I remember correctly, Kyle did said we should still support the individual candidates since they didn't have anything to do with what happen with Cenk. That could easily be done without going through JD.It won't happen. JD clearly cares more about how corporate media portrays them then what the majority of their own supporters think.The last thing we need is another ism.

One of the beauties of socialism, democratic socialism, and social democracy is that no matter how radically different, the people have some influence and control over the market. Nothing wrong with money, nothing wrong with a lot of money, but everything wrong with putting that money into politics and nothing else.I agree. It definitely can't be done overnight even if the US government controlled all aspects of the military industrial complex. Other redditors have already mentioned where the money can be diverted at least from the government side.

Though my biggest concern is that a lot of the jobs are privatized (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, etc.) and spread across the states so they essentially hold the employees hostage. Enough people might turn their job loss anger on the politicians rather than towards the companies to make the threat real (though I do think a better social safety net can help reduce that anger). The best scenario I can think of to deal with those companies is that we improve our social safety net so a job loss isn't as bad and slowly reduce our military spending on those companies while still allowing the companies to sell the excess weapons to allied democratic countries (UK, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, etc.). Of course, it won't happen overnight, but long-term the companies can always reduce the money spent building better planes and rockets to screw over other countries and spend more building better passenger planes and rockets to Mars.When you mentioned about words having consequences. I just thought about all the damage Trump has done with words.Pretty lame, to be honest.  If he didn't openly shill for Trump I could take him more seriously.  Even Rubin didn't sink *that* low.Personally I won't be using the word anytime soon.  After all I don't want to give anyone reason to think I'm homophobic when I am not.

I do think he's right in that the word has, to an extent, been re-appropriated to means something else and the idea that anyone who says it is homophobic is pretty silly.  However, it's important to keep in mind that while words do mean different things to different people, that *includes* the people who disagree with your interpretation.Shapiro is like a young Rand Paul -- completely spot on half the time, pants-on-head clueless the other half.Hehehe... PreggerU.And MSM keeps ignoring the leaks being from a DNC insider. FFS.Bernie should run as an independent."Atheism" is a misnomer, that sub worships the DNC as much as any Christian does Jesus.Most of that sub and r/politics are just angsty teenagers rebelling against their christian conservative parents, not people who have put any kind of thought into their worldview.And when you argue against their patron saints *from the left*, they'll call you a Republican.  Once you point out that you're an actual progressive, they start accusing you of wanting "free stuff" and "hating America".  Now *where* have I heard that before?But surely you acknowledge that the vast majority of people DO have empathy, they just have it in different amounts and for different people. And you also acknowledge one can be TOO empathetic, right? I.e. naive.I'm speaking under the assumption that God is perfect and, therefore, has an objective conscious.Actually, being a self-made millionaire is not necessarily greedy, and I'm not sure why you would think that since millionaires have more money to give to charities and the poor than those who don't get rich. I could argue those who didn't strive to be millionaires are more greedy since they missed an opportunity to give more to those in need. Secondly, I think the reason "gay marriage" is focused on more at the time being is b/c it is more contraversial in society, i.e. most people acknowledge greed is wrong but not necessarily homosexuality.^What are you talking about? I genuinely have no idea.Doesn't "trolling" involve being deceitful in some way? I'm asking a genuine question, as it's something I've been curious about.Obviously. I like to get to the meat of a question when I don't feel like clarifying the obvious.Right. I mean the vast majority of people on earth, although their morality may differ, intend to do what they perceive to be the right thing, even across cultures. But yeah, thanks for the response!And why wouldn't He?Even as a Muslim I found the hijab to be utterly ridiculous.Of course, as God would be the only objective moral standard in which we could judge that action.I think they just recommend political videos in general.The alliance between neo-feminism and Islam has to be the goofiest thing I've ever seen.  It would be funny if it weren't damaging to the ideas and reputation of progressivism.Somehow r/atheism is even *worse*.  The number of people who blindly and unquestioningly support American neoliberalism blows my mind, especially among so-called "non-brainwashed free thinkers".  It's a religion to them, as if somehow this one party in one country has everything figured out.

Now for the rest of his dementia-laidened [sp] policies.Don't you mean **EVISCERATES**?Just to let everyone know, this guy quite literally saws his gun in half.Thanks for the post. It is quite uplifting to see. Though I am a bit concerned not much will change unless people punish the politicians who block the gun reform laws. I was listening to a NPR segment that mentioned that even though the majority of US citizens (even majority of NRA members) support stricter gun laws, not much changes since the politicians don't get voted out on this issue.This isn't much of a sample size to be alarmed by.  You're on a video with Richard Spencer's mug on it, on a website with a primarily right-wing viewership in the comments on a channel of a guy who attended the Charlottesville nazi rally.I just heard of him on here.  I really don't think we should care who the latest alt-right-fuckstick-du-jour is, otherwise they'll get the attention they want.Tbh I wish he would change it to Secular Talk since it's more original, but I'm happy for his new setup! So awesome he keeps improving Lol, I already know about that one. That's what I said "The last time I remember he talking about it was about Donald Trump's call with the president of Taiwan."

I was wondering more about videos where people might not go through whole video like Kyle &amp; Corin or Secular Talk(ing Smack). That reminds me, I didn't realize he had one yesterday. Should have joined the superchat.Yeah, he needs to work on the audio. I had to adjust the volume and back and forth. Don't put on the headphones!It’s. a bit of a challenge when high on 420! CNN is giving fuel to conservatives.

Authoritarian cuntsHahaha YES ! That's it ! I need to find that video !I just think he doesn’t respect others beliefs when it comes to religion. I think you should expect respect from others of your believes if you cant respect theirs! I disagree with you. I think there is no more evidence that there is no God than there is one. I don’t live in literal 6 day creation but I do believe God causes the Big Bang. And the vast majority biblical values are progressive values! And I think Christianity is a belief well worth respecting! There is good historical evidence to back up our claims! Atheism is the most ridiculous belief i’ve ever head of!!!Well which ever you prefer to call it! It’s a pathetic lack of belief! There is better historical evidence of the events in the bible than most ancient events! That has nothing to do with if the bible has progressive values! I can’t take you seriously! So I won’t dignify you with further response! That is just factually incorrect, the bible was written first hand by many authors! That’s just a smear!
You have an anti-Christ spirit! I have good news for you No they aren’t but I said the vast majority not 100%! Beliefs like there is no God? Yeah! They shouldn’t be respected! Maybe that's why her softball team is losing.That’s a pathetic comparison! If you just look at creation out obvious there is a greater being that created it!

Now the question is...does he wear pants when he records his videos?I remember Marriott apologizing to China over that.

I don't think his purpose is to analyze issues in depth for the audience.  He's just a good independent news source who, while clearly biased, doesn't pretend that he's anything else.

&gt;-become a bit of a broken record and has the same solutions to all problems

Most of his solutions haven't been tried at all, but I can see why you'd think of it as repetitive.  His show is rather cathartic for me as much as it is informative.

&gt;-has continuously tried to downplay the russia story no matter what the evidence shows

I don't think that's true.  He simply doesn't think it deserves 90% of the media's attention, and hates that the corporate Democrats use it as a perpetual scapegoat for how poor Saint Hillary had the election stolen from her.  Not to mention calling people "Russian bots" for arguing with the Democratic Party status quo from the left.

&gt;-to this day he still shills for Wikileaks and assange

That's one of the things I like about him.

&gt;-blames almost everything on money in politics, which I find to be too simplistic

I do kind of agree, but it's a big reason why popular policies never get any traction.Occasionally (once or twice a month) I'll check on Shapiro because he's a sign of the younger generation of conservatives to come.  We don't agree on a whole lot, but he's way more intelligent than Tucker or Rush.I am biased (my name says it all) but I'll reply to your reasons.

&gt;-no longer seems to try to do anything more than just surface level analysis of certain issues

That's been going on for a long time. I suspect it is also what gave him boost in popularity, too. Deep level analyses can be confusing for audiences that have not delve too deep into the issues.

&gt; -become a bit of a broken record and has the same solutions to all problems

I do agree that he does become a bit of a broken record, but he does admit it though and gives his reasons for it. Mostly because said solutions has not been implemented yet.

&gt; -has continuously tried to downplay the russia story no matter what the evidence shows

Most of the times he talked about MSM hyping it. My only problem with him is recent gut reactions and say something false when MSM has another Russia story. His twitter audience will call him out on it though when that happens though. Though I blame that mostly on his lack of research. I remember him admitting that he can be quite lazy at times.

&gt; -to this day he still shills for Wikileaks and assange

Not going to lie, I do have some issues with how much he panders to Wikileaks in some videos but I wouldn't call him a shill. Compared to Jimmy Dore, he isn't at all.

&gt; -blames almost everything on money in politics, which I find to be too simplistic

I agree. It is good as a campaign message. However, as far as his videos are concerned, I blame it again that he doesn't do much research unless he feels he needs to. I kind of hope he would fill in some of his gaps in knowledge on foreign affairs since it seems we on collision course with friends, allies, and frenemies really soon. Which reminds me, to this day I still cringe about the time he got the president of the Confederacy wrong...twice.Well I’m 22 and smoke daily! I meant to say "enemies, allies, and frenemies." I'm referring to foreign countries. It's a problem that the power players (US included) are dealing with domestic problems by focusing on foreign affairs.

&gt;Stop hiding behind the whole 'oooh it's his research' thing (the presidency of the Confederacy, for one, is irrelevant to contemporary politics). It sounds to me like the only thing you're really saying here is "it's all too leftist for my tastes".

I don't see how I'm "hiding."
Also, dude, calm the hell down. I never said that him getting wrong who the president of the Confederacy cause me to feel he's too "lefty." In fact, I'm not even sure how the hell you even get to that conclusion. As a Secular Talk fan, it is just cringeworthy for me when he gets things wrong like that on more than one occasion even with his twitter followers screaming at him.Bill Maher is probably my favorite mainstream media figure (which isn't saying much), but he has a willful blind spot to faults of the Democratic Party itself.  He'll bash college SJWs with no hesitation for reducing support for Democrats, but won't even touch *policy* shortcomings within the party.

Kyle's point about "voter shaming" is something I've tried to argue with neoliberals endlessly.  It's such a revolting sense of entitlement; "it's *your* fault you didn't vote for my anointed one!"  Go on r/politics and r/atheism to see exactly what I mean.  Maher seems to think that standards and accountability are shortcomings.&gt; But in that case, how does Secular Talk contribute to "the collision course with foreign countries"?

By "we," I'm talking about the USA.


&gt;I'm frequently seeing centrists hiding behind the "you're not doing your research" line. It's a lazy misdirectional attack on leftists and one that is often employed by Sam Seder and David Pakman (the latter of which is what this discussion is about).

Well, I guess then that is a difference of what we have seen. Then again, I rarely watch Sam Seder or David Pakman or visit their subreddits.Is this the only place where the poll is shared? If so, I'm getting the vibe that people are voting for Kirsten Gillibrand out of pity or just plain trolling.If only Republicans can be at least this outraged about the plight of those who aren't in the one-tenth of the 1%.I looked at the actual list. I'm surprised Taiwan even ranked that high. Then again despite all the constant threats from China and loss of allies due to China threatening other countries, Taiwan has a decent single payer system. In fact, I remember somebody posted a link to a NYTimes article in r/SandersForPresident about how we can learn from Taiwan in how the country made a huge leap to single payer. If a country like Taiwan can do it in a short time, so can we!

(FYI, Taiwan is NOT a province of China despite what the report claims. I been to both Taiwan and China and I needed two different visas and two different currencies. This is just China trying to frame an international issue as domestic for propaganda purposes to the rest of the world.)Give him time. He's pretty slow about non-Bernie and non-TYT stories. Looked at how long it took him to report about the atheist being kicked off of Egyptian TV.His forehead resembles that of Sam Harris."It's just pink haired college kids bro"

Some people have no idea what's going on outside the US.I post in the Sam Harris sub, and we were getting that recent "college kids most likely to support free speech except racists" study a lot.  A regular there who's quite the prick kept trying to argue at me that if someone is given a stipulative definition of the word "racist" (to mean "thinks black people are genetically inferior") then it is impossible for them to apply the term inaccurately, and the votes favored him as well.

That place is unique in that people can be extremely socially liberal, but also very pro-war.  I generally like it though, as they have the most diverse opinions of any sub I know and *usually* keep the conversations civil and out of the gutter.  The mods are also pretty hands-off.Yes it is. I watched the livestream myself and he uploaded the segment shortly after: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQzb0LRClqYIf there's one thing Republicans and Democrats now agree on, it's "the government doing anything is socialism".The other O-face.I fucking hate him the #NeoliberalShill and #HillaryPuppet He called people who think there is no Trump-Russia story “a bernie bro” and he meant it as an insult. He refuses to endorse primary’s against corporate Dems, he spreads the lie that was created by corporate Dems that you can’t run populist left in red states. I find most of the other stuff boring, I want them to talk about politics more! Maybe an idiot's take on it.

It seems the author's main contention is that we consider Assad's regime to be a sovereign government, and then the author conflates that with us supporting Assad.

Guess what? We don't like Assad. He's a brutal dictator, and a cunt. The author's morally superior attitude seems a bit simple-minded, as the US installed it supports the majority of the world's dictators. The only reason the US government is against Assad is because Assad sided with Russia. 

Regime change only causes more chaos, and more civilian suffering. Not in the Middle East. The sad part is some idiots still favour deregulation, even those of the new generation! They believe everything their conservatard politician tells them, and will never blame anyone but anyone not right-wing enough.I mean with all the shit Clinton has done (you know, *actually* killing people in North Africa/Middle East) I don't know why he had to jump on that horseshit.

I don't think he's a dishonest hack like Rubin, I think he's just allowed his frustration with liberals to completely obscure his priorities.Need mom to check under the bed for Russians?This is why neoliberals are completely impotent against Trump: their main concern is not with his fucking of the environment, taking peoples' healthcare or slaughtering innocent civilians, it's how mean he is on Twitter and where he puts his dick.

If Hitler were alive today and said one bad thing about Trump, "the resistance" would be fawning over him.Maher was a hero of mine for quite some time.  I still watch Real Time every now and then, but it's becoming painfully obvious where his money is coming from.Yeah, just like Dave Rubin is...You are either lying or don't know what the left is.I know that America is far to the right, and that only demonstrates my point.So we can keep moving to the right?  No thanks.

You mad that universal healthcare and college are now a majority position among Americans?  That war is historically unpopular?  That the neo-Cold War baiting isn't convincing anyone of anything?I personally feel that it’s best to boycott Israel were it will most effectively hurt them most and not normal everyday Israeli citizens. I think people should boycott companies that have contracts with the The Israeli military and those companies that operate in illegal settlements in the West Bank Military-industrial complex That guy is agonizing to listen to.  Holy shit.Why do people insist on using the word "skeptic" for anyone on the right?  It's a bizarre development.The usual inanity from the She-Wolf of Wall Street.I definitely agree You’re letting the right make caricatures out of us by doing this and justifying their claim that a Bernie Sanders style platform is like Venezuela or Cuba \*DemocratsI'm surprised at the optimism of choosing Sanders.  I wish I shared it.  I chose Warren and would happily vote for her, but Sanders is just a bit better.

Goddamn I hope it's not Biden.Well what do you mean by runs?  What do you mean by hides?Is the live stream for Patreons only? Because she supports corporate Dems and she voted for the military budget, those 2 should be enough but there is heaps more! I would also support a primary of Bernie Sanders, just to send a message to them! We should even primary the best! I want Jill Stein to run as a democrat against Elizabeth Warren! Most conservatives who strawman on what Bernie Sanders say know he’s talking about Nordic countries because they mention it slyly now and then but most of the time mention Cuba or Venezuela because it’s an easy get out of jail card  I'll admit Warren has some issues but I still think it's more important we get rid of the worst Blue-Dogs before we move on to someone who is still mostly progressive. Tulsi.  After signing onto the defense bill, I have to seriously call Warren's judgment into question.This guy is a little to Marxist for my taste, but the video isn't a bad watch. Anarcho-Communism is still based on Marx, just more his end vision of what communism would be than any society that actually attempted his ideas. Okay, I'll admit I'm not the most well versed in old school philosophy. I do know that this particular guy has praised Marx in the past, or at least cited him as an example of a "class socialist author", but I'll admit that should have been what I said in the first place. Aside from the sources I have cited in this article, I'm also drawing on my own experience with these conflicts. I am a writer who analyzes the Syrian Civil War as well as other conflicts in the Middle East. My articles can be found at [syrianwardaily.com](http://www.syrianwardaily.com), where I analyze and give updates on the Syrian Civil War. I've been following these conflicts for 4 years, and I think I probably disagree with Kyle when it comes to some of the particulars of his ideas of what we're doing in the Middle East. I do think that the US is overall too involved, but only in some particular places. For example, I completely disagree with all US military aid to Saudi Arabia, because they have shown blatant disregard for civilian lives in their three-year-long air campaign and blockade against Yemen. I also disagree with military aid to Pakistan because of their support for al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, and anti-India terrorist groups in Kashmir and other Indian regions. I also think we should stop all military aid to Israel until the end their blockade of the Gaza Strip in the occupation of the West Bank (unless some peace deal with the Palestinians is reached). However, I completely agree with our support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Iraqi Kurdistan military, and the Iraqi Security Forces. I also completely agree with the bombing campaign against ISIS, which I don't think Kyle is on board with.There's a big difference between conducting targeted drone strikes that only kills terrorists once every couple of months, and doing a daily bombing campaign for months against multiple targets per day. One of those responding, the other is a very limited anti-terror operation. I don't think it's fair to the US to say that it is bombing a countries at the same time. It's an overestimation for one, but it also creates this image in people's minds of the US blowing everything up in all the different countries without good reason. That is factually not the case.The United States has **NEVER** used a drone to kill a journalist. You really need to get your facts straight before commenting on stuff like this. Whether or not they're "pro-terror" depends on whether or not the strikes are specifically intended to inflict fear on a civilian population or not. I think that that's up for debate, because the general public does not have access to classified high-level meetings in which this type of strategy would be discussed. If US drone strikes end up killing civilians in a military context, where the goal of the strike is to inflict military damage on the enemy, then that cannot possibly be considered terrorism because terrorism is the use of violence against civilians for a political or religious goal.You're correct that they're not always sanitary. By definition you're going to have civilian casualties in a war. And I do definitely think that the US has used drones in an incorrect way and hit targets at shouldn't have because of bad intelligence. But by and large, this program has been effective in eliminating terrorist leaders and breaking up al-Qa'ida's central network, as well as defeating ISIS in Syria and Iraq. When Kyle looks at the civilian casualties in, say, the bombing campaign against ISIS, and denounces the campaign, he is missing the bigger picture, which is that the strikes are justified and morally good.Donald Trump [has](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) a 42% approval rating, which is abysmally low compared to almost every other president at this point in the first term. Bernie Sanders is one of the most popular politicians in America, and one of the only anti-Trump candidates to have a strong positive platform for the country rather than a solely negative anti-Trump platform devoid of policy.

If I were Trump right now, I'd be absolutely scared of my poll numbers. And I would stop doing all the stuff Trump is doing to bring those poll numbers so low (which of course Donald Trump will not do because he's Donald Trump). As long as Trump keeps tweeting stupid stuff and simultaneously screwing up both the Russia investigation (attacking the Justice Department) and economic policy (trade), his numbers will continue to remain low, far below what he would need to win a second term.

On top of all that, if Bernie Sanders runs in 2020, his economic populist platform is virtually guaranteed to swing over a decently-sized portion of the [8 million Obama voters who swayed to Trump in 2016](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/) and delivered him Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Even a small chunk of this 13% of Trump's 2016 voters would be more than enough to deliver those states to the Democrat, which would in turn cause Trump to lose the presidency.Sometimes you have to watch the sarcasm for Poe's Law. That sounds a little too much like what an actual Trump supporter would sayYeah. By Kyle's logic, we were bombing 28 countries in World War 2, a war which he said was justified because the Nazis posed an imminent threat to us. Apparently he doesn't think ISIS or other terrorists pose a real threat to us because they aren't about to "invade Nebraska/Kentucky". What a poor standard. He must have no idea how military attacks on countries actually work.That video is of a manned Apache gunship helicopter, dude! Right in the middle of a high-stakes battle in Baghdad in an area controlled by insurgents! I totally disagree with that particular strike, but it's hardly an example of a drone program going to ride. That was a case of typical civilian casualties in war involving direct human involvement. Should we stop using helicopters because of civilian casualty strikes like this one?Thank you very much this is exactly what I was looking for. Cheers!Upon reading the documents I don't really see how these objectives are "the worst parts of the TPP". As a Canadian it seems like the Trump administration is actually doing a pretty decent job of protecting American interests in these NAFTA negotiations. Am I missing something?Thanks for your thorough reply. I wholey agree with you on your thoughts about the TPP. However from what I'm hearing in the news Trump seems to be in favor of using NAFTA to raise tariffs on major imports such as steel in order to protect American workers, a sentiment that if I were a middle class American I would be very in favor of. I suppose their may be some language that ends up in the final document that ends up being harmful to the middle class.
 
I think the media is doing a terrible job of using the NAFTA negotiations to attack Trump as they continuously point out his protectionist stance as if it were a bad thing, when imo it's probably his most attractive quality as president. They locked the thread, of course They're running scared of the left.That's a "classically good" idea.Used to be on TYT.  Started his own program and became a Koch whore.Reddit is too complicated for him17 people dead, 50 injured, just today. Yesterday, it was 36 dead, 60 wounded.

I wonder what would've happened if the US withdrew all 13,000 troops in the time between the ceasefire and this massive suicide bombing.

By the way, the Taliban never agreed to the ceasefire. [It was unilateral.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/world/asia/afghanistan-ashraf-ghani-cease-fire-taliban.html)

In Afghan prime minister Ashraf Ghani's [own words](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kabul-afghanistan-capital-under-siege-while-americas-longest-war-rages-on-60-minutes/), the Afghan National Army would not last 6 months without US support:
&gt;"We will not be able to support our army for six months without U.S. support, and U.S. capabilities." – Ashraf GhaniWhen the Afghan government in Kabul controls every single one of the country's 398 districts, that's a pretty clear metric. Right now, they only control less than 200 of these districts. The Taliban has solid control over at least 100 districts, meaning one-fourth of Afghanistan's territory is a safe haven for these 21 terrorist organizations. 

It would be a bad thing for the US to throw up its hands and say that because these victory conditions are hard to obtain, that means we should let the Afghans be defeated and let the terrorists win.I don't think kyle does his show live. He likes to edit stuff out and take his time. He does do it live, he streams on BlogTalkRadio.Source please Where did you get the idea that anyone of his fans is alt-right? Good point. But I have listened to what Ben Shapiro has to say, and on my own without Kyle's commentary. And with what I've heard from him, I don't agree with him on practically anything. There's only so much time that I'm willing to give to somebody before I realize that there's no point in listening to them anymore.I found it finally https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z2uex1WQ7o&amp;list=PLuT_CbT94oXK_hlNLhuWTm8ck2Ds3VjSa&amp;index=29Mad magazine. Back in 1992 I think. Even back then he was a joke.I prefer Our Revolution.

The leftist authoritarians could give us a 2nd Trump term if we aren't careful. People don't want left authoritarians over right authoritarians.They are left wing authoritarians. We are left wing libertarians. I think to a certain extend we have to work with them because they are also on our side economically. Saying that. Free Speech is important as fuck, I will die on that hill.  Please tweet this to Kyle and Cenk,  TJ kirk, Chris ray-gun everyone who is left wing libertarian, Hell  even s Sargon. What is positive is that when they all signed up it was on the platform. I even got in contact with one Justice Democrat who won her primary and she said she was for free speech like they all were, I told her that they removed the part about free speech.  So the people that are in Nominated now we can trust to a certain extent but I am not sure about 2020. I however good candidates to win now, if they do not mention how important Free-Speech is for the general election they will not beat the right wingers. You can find the winners of the primaries here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice\_Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Democrats) Tweet the winners facebook them, tell them to get free-speech back on the platform, They do not have Free Speech as part of their platform. \* Email them tweet them make them write it into their platform. I do like Our Revolution more, they are very effective.  they got in  5 people in the house . 4 from 2016 and 1 from 2017 ( Special election) they all supported HR676 and I did not see any SJW problems yet. I  agree that in large part that happened during that time, that racism still exist, that 90&amp;#37; of BLM platform makes perfect sense. But we were not founded on the principals of slavery, no where in the constitution does it say that we value slavery, or value genocide. Secondly   "**and we have never been able to escape that legacy.** " The implication here is that people still value our founding principles genocide and slavery.   Now it said we were founded on liberty and justice for property owning white males and during that time genocide and slavery occurred with no force to stop it, i would not complain. Because it is true, most white males were not able to vote, so it has been and will always in large part a class issue. Racism did and still does play a role but no one thought we are going to be a nation of slave owners and genociders.Tweet everyone about this, i think that if Kyle reaches our the candidates and those candidates demand that it goes back it the platform it will get there, it will increase their chance of winning. Fucking they are going to lose 10 points in Texas  for not having free-speech as part of their platform. No one is going to pick left with authoritarianism over right wing authoritarianism. Also the SJW part of them taking over is two fold, They say that we were founded ( meaning the values that led the nation) of slavery and genocide and they removed protecting free-speech and free expression. If that is not SJW, I do not know what is. I have been told at college that white people are evil, history proves it. 

If you think that that type of mentality will win, and is not harmful you are out of your mind. Most likely will not win ,calling every person that does not agree with them a Nazi, and if they do win, it will be very very bad. Social Democracy good. Marxism bad Found the regressiveBecause he is against justice dems primaries attempts to get rid of corporate dems, he pushes fake news like Trump-Russia! &gt;20 day old account

&gt;-93 karma

Do you... do you have any proof?He’s a creep and a sellout!!!!You are a sellout of you push the Trump-Russia conspiracy theory and a hack!!! We need a zero tolerance for that among progressives, if push it then they don’t have my respect!!! Many of our fellow believers are very annoyed by atheists claiming secular as their philosophy, secular is not supported to mean atheist is supposed to be a neutral belief non partisan system! Religion is not a part of it, it all beliefs being respected and not openly attacking someone for no good reason! Everyone judges the evidence for themselves so don’t bash others beliefs because of they way they have judged things based on evidence! Other word for Patternicity, that was mentioned in the video:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ApopheniaYes because they are not worthy of respect from anyone because they are morally wrong where is people of most faiths aren’t morally wrong! I’m not saying you are but Kyle does! Oh no way but to tar everyone who believes in the rapture as a fundamentalist is not at all accurate and very ignorant!!! But yes I fully agree that a lot of Tele evangelicals are way off track and there are a lot of con men out there too who genuinely are fundamentalist. Jeb memes are always the best.I don’t agree with bashing people’s beliefs if they are not hostile or bigoted. You can always see the Antichrist spirit operating in someone!!! They bash Christianity a lot more than any other belief! Exactly. Ever since the 1940s, conservatives have been pulling the "if you disagree with me you're a communist" card.Remember back when it was controversial to say "hey, maybe we shouldn't kill union leaders". That's classical liberalism.  I'd argue Bernie's single biggest mistake was calling himself a democratic socialist instead of a social democrat. Now he uses the same title as people who hold signs saying "ABOLISH PRISONS. ABOLISH PROFIT." It allows for effortless fearmongering from many on the right.

I also think it's dangerous to build popularity and legitimacy towards socialism. It might help us electorally, but for those of us that are social democrats, it could hurt us in the long run.Atheism Is Unstoppable, a.k.a. Devon Tracey, a.k.a. Atheist RooYes, however he despises Trump and doesn't shill for Republicans nonstop in the way that Sargon and Chris Ray Gun do.Perhaps CRG wasn't the best example in the books. You still get what I'm saying.I agree with you 95&amp;#37; or even more. 

My point was that looking at history and then concluding that white people are evil is not true or healthy. I see it this way the elites, the kings, the rich, all of the powerful fucked over the little guy, yes a lot of the time he was white, but it was not the whiteness that made him that way it was the corrupting influence of power and money. Saying white people are evil ignores the elites that are not whites, and it ignores all the poor whites who were not evil. The drug war does have a little bit to do with drugs, if the alcohol lobby was not as strong weed would be legal already. Also some people do go crazy on drugs. The problem is that most people do not know that 80&amp;#37; of people who do drugs are not addicts, and leave normal lives.  What we need to do is legalize all drugs to defund the drug kingpins and have legal business for that 80&amp;#37;, and fund clincs rehab etc for the 20&amp;#37; who abuse drugs, which would save billions each year .People to write columns and make videosJust got word that this Reddit post has now turned Kyle into a Christian. Good work.Oh I’m sure it will take a lot more than forums like reddit to change Kyle! Yeah, maybe if he saw a medically varied miracle taking place that might make him rethink! As a footnote: I don't dislike everything that Carl has ever said or done. I just wish he was still the skeptical atheist he was a few years ago, not the tool of the right he is now.Well he’s not as bad as Dave Rubin In 2014, Sargon was still somewhat sane. He wasn't defending Elliot Rodger, he was defending young men who were frustrated with their sexual inadequacies but hadn't hurt anybody. It's 2015 when he really went down the shithole.Straight from the horse's mouth! Why hasn't Kyle reported this yet? It's not because we don't want the Taliban to implement Sharia law, we already knew that (since the US supports the Sharia law states of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Pakistan). Here's the real reason. 

Source: [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/International/isis-insurgents-afghanistan-prove-resilient-us-special-forces/story?id=56545752)Not really. Just because a guy doesn't get pussy doesn't mean that he hates women and will go on a mass shooting, which the media, both left and right, is trying to claim.Sure, a few of them. Most of them are just honest folks without that many tallies on their board. The dude supports stop and frisk. He supports Trump without challenging him on anything. Hell, he even tried to spin Trump's "sue the EU" thing, and him lying about attacking May, in a positive light. He'll defend Trump or sidestep any argument about Trump.What exactly do you want from him? He’s already said that the hack was done by Russia. That they colluded with Wikileaks to help trump and the republicans. He backs all the indictments, his only problem is the most recent ones are against Russians who will never appear in a U.S court. 

He also makes some good points. The DNC corruption that was exposed in the hack has gotten little to no coverage. If this was the RNC we would be discussing the exposed corruption more. 

As for the  voter information today is the first I’m hearing about that. I don’t think anything was released to the public, because no one seems to be talking about it. What conspiracy? He didn’t “want” to believe anything. He believed what he did because he distrusted American intelligence agencies. He admitted he was wrong. As for the conspiracy theory I never saw him talk about this one. I’ll go back and watch some stuff on that. Both the DNC and the intelligence agencies have lied to us in the past Kyle had every right to be distrustful of them. 

What do you think we should do about what was leaked? One of his main points is we should be talking about what was actually in the emails more because that’s important. You’re doing a good job at this new McCarthy red scare!!!This is why I started watching David Pakman more and more. Secular Talk is my favorite hentai 

So upset this is unfinished though Go on the Youtube channel of pretty much any right-winger and type in "Venezuela" in the search channel bar. Def post when you're doneThis one with Charlie Kirk and Michelle Malkin is pretty ridiculous. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7FvErgG820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7FvErgG820)I don't like the pixelation near the text, all I have is Paint 3D. If someone with better software wants to fix that up (maybe with a blur tool?) That would be much appreciated.Yeah I put it here, there, and ToiletPaperUSA as well.Lol I never said that. There's no way you're not a troll.  
No clue, as there aren't really any solid numbers or data for it. 

But in 2009/2010, 48 million Americans did not have insurance and 45k people were dying every year. Since that number is almost half that now, I think it's safe to say that 45k is more like 20k and likely even lower. Are those all really socialist countries? You guys are joking and all, but what is the actual response to this? Just Say Venezuela is just an outlier because it is run by dictators and sanctions are killing their economy?

If that is true, why is inflation through the roof in Venezuela?This implies that Venezuela was doing well in 2011. Crime peaked in 2011. 

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-16349118](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-16349118)

And the inflation rate was way higher than the Latin American average.

"Inflation in Venezuela has averaged 23 percent during 1999-2011 compared to a Latin American average of 4.6 percent. Imagine what life would be like if the price of groceries went up 23 percent every year. This craziness combined with stringent price controls has completely distorted the economy, creating black markets and shortages. In 2012 Venezuela will again have one of the highest inflation rates in the world."

[https://abcnews.go.com/ABC\_Univision/News/ways-chavez-destroyed-venezuelan-economy/story?id=18239956](https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/ways-chavez-destroyed-venezuelan-economy/story?id=18239956)What are you talking about? I think he's attracted to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, not Bernie. Hence why he always defends her when she's attacked. You didn't mention any of my other points, interesting. If you read my other points, you'll see why Kyle's ideas have some holes that can be easily debunked. If Kyle ever had the courage to debate Shapiro, he'd better have an answer to these. &gt;Also

I'm glad you agreed with these points,

Also, I did read it. It just says the picture is too blurry to 100% confirm that is is Bernie, but he was in AZ that day. Seems a little too suspicious. I'm a Bernie supporter but let's not kid ourselves, that's gotta be him.

And the claim they were trying to debunk was this: "Bernie Sanders purchased a $172,000 luxury car with presidential campaign donations." That last part is of course not true.&gt;That is hardly Venezuela praise

Call it what you want, but he wasn't exactly critical of Venezuela. If you can list the country and the last time we bombed them, I'll consider my criticism debunked. &gt;Now you can say that means he indirectly praised Venezuela but   there article is called "Close The Gaps: Disparities That Threaten America" So it is clearly an article about income equality in the USA, and not about income equality in Venezuela and that quote is in the last paragraph and is the only time Venezuela is ever mentioned.

How is Crowder being dishonest if he's using Bernie's own words? I see. Bernie should have it taken off his website then. He defends AOC more than any other Justice Dem, but isn't critical of her (see her two false comments I listed above). Even her staunchest supporters can't defend them. 

There's no way to know for sure if the pic is real or fake, but it wouldn't surprise me.

How am I being nitpicky or hallucinatory for trying to fact-check Kyle on misleading claims he always makes? The politicians and bankers are a huge problem but so are all these half-truth statements. Everyone is hung up on the AOC thing. I just think he needs to be a bit more critical of her when she says dumb shit is all. Nice lack of a response! I will rise as He is risen! Become the vessel He has called me to be! I often ask that about secular talk, seems to stupid to be real but Kyle is in Spot on with his political views but dead wrong on spirituality! I don't think it's a misstatement because she gave 2 specific numbers. 200 million Americans make less than 20k a year AND that it is 40% of the country. She truly believes that to be true. [Dab on the American people](https://giphy.com/gifs/toferra-l3q2FOeVbpGSqHj4Q) 🤣👌💯Well I’ve always seen him for a fraud! I have no idea what that means nor do I care! I reject the satanic prosperity gospel if that’s what you mean! The bible is not a perfect document! Their morality was put their by almighty God! Twisted trolls who may be demon possessed is all I can say! I’m not going anywhere! If you play the religion card you are spiritually dead! Have you ever had any supernatural experiences? Because I have! Also there is also evidence of god’s with a small G  AKA fallen angels! Also rejecting the Word of God is not the answer either! Please prove it’s not! I’ve been cold sober when I’ve had out of body experiences AKA trances and saw into hell and was taken through it by Jesus! That’s the voice of the enemy talking, also I have received the baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues! If you have cable TV you can probably sign into FOX GO onlineI always feel like it's best to watch this kinda stuff live. Puts you in the shoes of an average cable news viewer.He tweeted that he is going to be on between 13 and 14 et Trust me, you will not be disappointed. His facial expressions were gold.Video has been removed by the user. FML&gt;And Fox using that clip of the woman slipping up on her words is an obvious straw man.

She was endorsed by Kyle and JD. It's a really bad look. I'm just glad Kyle didn't let them put him in that trap.This was one of the best Kyle clips I’ve seen in awhile. I hope he does more debates and similar stuff it’s always fun watching him argue with other people. I know he is a little iffy on debates but he’s really good at it and seems to enjoy them. We can only pray that we get another Razorfist debate. The host tried to throw a curveball of the justice democrats car crash when Kyle said how left-wing policies are popular and because he even admitted Kyle made a good point and so he wanted to change the subject #KristolClear2020 jk the guy’s a joke Your second point has been debunked. That 81% number will only be true in 2025. As for now, the middle class is seeing tax cuts. Maybe not much, but still a tax cut. I know! it would be so funny if he tried to run!But the point still stands that that the tax cuts only benefit the rich Well we are talking about the one who claims then how about we start with the atheists because I’ve NEVER heard them make a reasonable case before! Also my God needs NO defence! Kyle knows what he’s doing politically that’s for sure but I still find him to be very fake in many ways! Hope and pray that populist left win out! As a former military veteran myself, who has converted a lot of former christians I was friends with in the military into becoming atheist, it basically goes like this:  


1. You have no evidence that a god exists, let alone any specific one.
2. The bible is clearly flawed, man made and not divine.
3. Given you have no evidence for a god, why do you believe?
4. Faith is not an answer.  The correct answer is because it's the religion of your family or one of the majority religions of the society you live in. (this is the case 99.9999% of the time)
5. Since you clearly are making an unjustified claim, don't you think it would be logical to withhold belief until there is evidence to support any god claims?
6. If you agree to withhold belief, congrats you're now an atheist too.  If not, you're being illogical and buying into nonsense based on zero evidence or logic.The tax cuts right now, 83% are going to the top 1%.  In 10 years the middle class tax cuts expire, which would make it nearly 100% to the top 1%.  The point mainly being that the middle class didn't really benefit from the tax cut.  Not in any meaningful way. The middle class was handed basically pennies that doesn't really help anyone out, and on top of this, when you adjust for rising costs of living, wage stagnation and increased healthcare costs, the working class of 2017 is worst off in 2018.  


For example, I make about 100k a year, Trump's tax cut went into effect and I got an extra $45 every 2 weeks.  That's nothing considering my federal income tax burden is nearly $10,000 and my healthcare premiums went up $80 a month in comparison to 2017 (from $220 a paycheck to $260 a paycheck).    


Bernie praised Venezuela for enacting public programs that were focused on helping the poor.  Venezuela's economic issues come from the negatively manipulated oil market and the fact that oil exports were one of Venezuela's main source of income for the country.  Nothing about what Bernie said about Venezuela is a stain on him.&gt;81% of the Benefits to the top 1%

No, again it will only be true in 8 years. 

"In 2018, according to an [analysis by the Tax Policy Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/full), the top 1 percent of income earners would glean 20.5 percent of the tax cut benefits — a sizable chunk, but far less than the figure that’s preferred by Democrats. And in 2025, that percentage would be 25.3 percent, with the top 1 percent (those earning above $837,800) getting an average tax cut of $61,090." 

[https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/democrats-misleading-tax-line/](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/democrats-misleading-tax-line/)Cori Bush looked really, really bad.  I get that being put on the spot and asking for specific numbers to generic statements is rough, but that's why you're supposed to have canned talking point responses that can make you sound informed with generic answers you can blast out when you get cornered.  This is basic public speaking crap.  Has she never practiced mock interviews with her friends / supporters to prepare her for this stuff?  


She might be on the right side of the issue, but damn she needs to work on her hostile interview game.Lets not forget that Venezuela is also a Market Economy, who's economy was composed 70% of private sector businesses which employed 80% of their working population.  


I mean, that's just inconvenient though.  Venezuela is proof capitalism doesn't work.Omae wa mou shindeiru!I've never upvoted a post so fast.Seeing Kyle slap Ben Shapiro is always worth it And secular is supposed to be non partisan not atheist!!!Like Christian bashing! I’m not going to bother trying to explain Spiritually to the spiritually dead, you need to have a supernatural experience for you self! I don't see the big deal with this. He was close enough, her name is kinda long and hard to say. I worked through the numbers and it appears that a return to JFK taxation levels of 70% on the top 1% and a raising of taxes on the 4 through 2 percent tax brackets by a smaller amount would cover the cost of Medicare for all while not raising the taxes on anyone in the remaining 94% or any decreases in spending.

This is given the worst case scenario laid out by that libertarian study on the cost of Medicare for all, which is likely to be a higher estimate than what it would really cost.I mean, Trump and his team already basically admitted to colluding with Russia.  And that is a big story no matter what you think of it.

I agree with Chomsky’s whataboutism when it comes to US interfering with elections, he’s 100% correct, as always, but it’s time to stop brushing it off like it’s a fake conspiracy or a nontroversy.Yep and when I establish my channel I will demonstrate just that! The internet is now a darker place without our favorite meme lord.  Who's going to advocate for the frogs? Who's going to inform us of which pizza shops are safe and which ones are pedophile smuggling headquarters?  This is a tragedy.Jesus, really? A lot of progressives go WAAAAY to far with non-interventionism.This needs to happen tho.I know that sliding horizontal scroll animation makes web browser use more computing power which also leads to more energy use and more heat. ( Yes, CPU runs faster and with more of it's parts if there is more to compute. )

Well they are both Fox News contributors now. We AT LEAST need to see them face off in a Fox News segment, but I would much prefer an extended debate.

Kyle always says "Debates are the lowest form of discourse." Which is pretty rich coming from him because he doesn't exactly use polite discourse. Like, ever. Or he'll say the (honestly douchey) "I don't want to give their ideas an equal platform to mine." Bullshit.

Also, I don't care if debates are low discourse. They're fucking fun to watch!I don't mind that he swears, I'm just saying it's a bit rich to say that debates are low discourse coming from him.This assumes a lot of really bad premises.

As I've stated here before, you could pay for Medicare for all by returning to JFK levels of income taxation on the top 5% of earners alone.

You could also even lower the taxation levels needed on those 5% with reductions in things like corporate welfare and military spending.  
This is besides the point that M4A would save the country overall trillions of dollars in cost reductions, administrative efficiency and removing the profit motive.

This article is beyond trash and was written by a retard who knows nothing about economics or healthcare.No one appears to have crunched the numbers in this way.  Most studies or stats posted are people assuming a flat income tax increase on all citizens, distributed evenly among all income tax brackets.  I ran the numbers myself with another econ savvy person on another subreddit a day or 2 ago.

When you account that we're already paying nearly 1 trillion dollars for medicare for the oldest and most unhealthy demographic, as well as medicaid and other health programs and services, given an extremely biased libertarian based study, you'd basically have to come up with, roughly, 1.25 or 1.5 trillion dollars in revenue and/or cuts to pay for M4A.

If we returned to JFK level income tax rates (after he implemented his cut), it would more than pay for that if you only applied those rates to to the top 5% of income earners, based on 2015 tax data.

So about 60 to 70% top end effective tax rate the highest income tax bracket.

You could reduce this by a decent amount with military spending hardware cuts.

Also, doing it this way would provide a massive economic stimulus to the bottom 95% of workers which would, at the moment, have extremely positive economic growth results.  Everyone currently spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on medical costs and premiums would now have a swell of money to invest in new businesses, spend money at local businesses, rent on their own, get a college education or purchase homes.Ya it looks like the person who wrote the article doesn't have a clue. It's just an establishment shill apparently.

I thought I wrote that the $1 trillion comes from medicare, medicaid and other random health services / programs / subsidies / etc.  The bulk of it being from yes, medicare and medicaid.You're asking me about a proposal I'm not familiar with.  My proposal was to set the income tax rate for the top 5% of earners back to JFK era levels without raising any taxes on the bottom 95% of earners.

Medicaid, and all other minor healthcare related programs and services would be rolled up under the Medicare For All umbrella, obviously.  Which is why when looking at the "cost" of M4A, you subtract what we're already paying in all these programs (close to 1 trillion dollars total) to get estimates for the additional costs M4A would be.

The study performed by the Koch brothers estimates the total cost of M4A at a very high end estimate of 3 trillion dollars per year for the next 10 years.

Other studies suggest that the costs in total will be much lower.

I suspect the real answer will lay somewhere in between.

Based on that estimate, and given what we already spend on medicare and other programs that would become unnessisary under M4A, you're looking at needing to raise 1.25 to 1.5 trillion dollars in taxes and/or budget cuts to be deficit neutral.

Also, as others have pointed out, based on MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) we could always take on some debt to help reduce the needed tax burden with little or no negative effects.  MMT people suggest that the amount of debt we have isn't anywhere near a damaging point, so that's also another option that could be discussed.Yes most likely if you hear a 2.4 or 2.8 trillion price tag, that's including what we spend on government healthcare programs, so that would be right in line with all credible studies into M4A and everything I've described here.  Hell that would even line up with the Koch brother's most likely exaggerated estimate.

If they're estimating more than that for total cost they're lying to push a hit piece with an agenda.

No, JFK's tax cut put top marginal tax rate at 70%.  It was 91% when he took office.  His tax cut brought it down from 91 to 70%.

As for investors / job creator argument, all the data shows right now that we don't have an investment problem.  We have a wage problem.  Businesses are struggling to get customers in the door because people don't have disposible income.

It's a balancing act.  Too much at the top, means not enough customers.  Too much in the hands of consumers and no money on top means lack of investments.

Right now the top end is so insanely bloated that the proposal I made isn't a problem, in fact, it'd actually have a very stimulative effect on the economy.Hahahahahaha I’m so glad to have him gone! I would advocate for the 60 to 70 percent tax increase on the top 5% in today's figures, which is basically 200k+ a year and above crowd.  Remembering that all income from $1 to about $199,999 would be taxed at the current rates, and it's only income earned at or above 200k that would see the increase.  So if you're making, say, $250,000 a year, the increase in taxation wouldn't be that much, because it's only an additional 30% or so on the 50,000. (also noting that that person too will probably be losing 5,000 to $15,000 a year in medical costs and premiums anyway, so it's not a complete net loss even for these people.

The bulk of the income would be from people making millions and billions of dollars.

In regard to the balancing act, remember that we have the data that shows investments are literally stagnant because the wealthy at the top know that there's a lack of purchasing power right now.

Think of it like a restaurant.  If you get 200 customers a day and your cooks, waiters, dish washers, etc are all keeping up with the demand, you're not going to expand, or hire new people out of charity, or anything like that.

But now say the middle class and poor get a boost to their disposable income, now you're getting 300 or 400 customers a day.  Now you can't keep up with the demand.  Now you have to hire more people to keep up.  Now that there's more people hiring wage competition can take place because there are less workers to pick from.

Workers get a more reasonable distribution of income while the owners of businesses benefit from increased customers.  It's a win win.  That's the scenario that would play out right now, because working class wages have been too low for too long.

Maybe in a few decades when things even out (if the gap narrows enough) maybe the taxation rates can be adjusted if need be.  But right now, it's not even a possibility that higher top end taxes would be bad, even with extreme increases and there's all evidence to suggest it would actually improve the society and economy as a whole.You should work on not being Christian.  That'll help.Hahahahahaha you’re so funny! Being a follower of Jesus Christ is the very essence of my being! Come on man. Lets stop coddling the fairy tales. Join us in big boy land.That's pretty lame.Fairytales is that there is no God! Having no reason for living, pretty lame! I will start a YouTube channel called holy fire action! Just have faith that God will provide! I’ll preach from the street if I have to! Be FILLED with the Holy Spirit and fire! The passion that tore through hell like a rose! &gt;I still think there’s a better marginal tax rate system we could use rather than jumping 30% around $200k. Something like 40% on $200k+, 45% on $400k+ 50% on $2000k+, 55% on $10 million+, 70% on $100 million +, 99% on 1 billion+.

Absolutely.  There is probably a more optimal way to collect the revenue.  I made a simplistic analysis to prove the the top end can actually pay for it in it's entirety because there's a big meme of "There isn't enough money on top to pay for it!"  A more specific, targeted, marginal tax rate that increases beyond the normal income tax brackets we currently have, special taxes on speculation and capital gains and lots of other wealthy-targeted taxation methods could be combined progressively to pay for M4A.

Healthcare savings come from drug price negotiations, administrative efficiencies, reduction in minor illnesses being ignored becoming major problems, etc etc.

If you want those details on single payer cost savings you can look up the more detailed papers on the subject.

I was merely using taxation data and basic economics to prove that it's not only possible to pay for medicare for all without taxing the working class, but that it would actually be economically stimulative to do so.There's no reason for living outside of Jesus? That's depressing. It's like a weird form of Nihilism. Christian Nihilism?Is this even a strawman. Or would a pillow-man be more accurate? The polarization brought in by Trump has as well. I'm sure you're familiar with the premise that Trump has made lots of liberals adopt crazy beliefs they didn't hold before just to oppose Trump. Immigration is no exception.
I DO believe Trump is racist, he is constantly unfair to racial minorities. This is a gross injustice and a national embarrassment.
HOWEVER, we should keep our heads on our necks and realize that the appropriate way to fight back isn't to wish for the extinction of all European cultures and peoples. We should be able to stand up for black and brown people without hating ourselves and our relatives.I agree with everything there, except that I think we absolutely do need to distance ourselves from the right-wing nationalism. I'm not quite sure who or what you're referring to, but men like Richard Spencer should always be seen as adversaries, even if they're right about healtgcare and non-intervention.Hahahahahaha you have no idea, you are incapable of respect! I pray the lord deals with you! I have no idea what you mean, nor do I care! No, you are! I know the word of God and I know you lot are spiritually dead and on the way to hell! And I’ll dream Gods dreams! Destroying the country to own the libs!Who’s ready for communism? This capitalist thing ain’t working for ya.But but but nah freeze peach and da free market place of ideas are under attack by colage libruhs!Nah, reform capitalism. All of the facts point toward a market economy.To be fair, Kyle also makes a lot of half truth statements. I made a post about it Did you at least read my post before downvoting it? All facts point to capitalism system issues are unworkable.Really? Compare any social democratic market economy (or even ours, really) to any attempt at a post-capitalist state. The results are pretty clear, we've done enough testing. Let's not keep gambling with livelihoods and lives themselves to achieve some utopian fantasy.This is such a dumb comment. Never in any point in human history have our lives been healthier and easier than in our current capitalist era.

Markets work in most areas (besides healthcare, education, infrastructure, military, police, etc.) as long as you have a reasonable amount of regulation.

I'm no "free market fuck yeah" guy, but I don't get what people are comparing capitalism to when they shit on it. Yes, it needs to be reformed. But there has never been a system with objectively better results, and completely throwing it out is just a fool's idea.Marinaleda provides double the median standard of living with their communist city over the rest of Spain and was immune from their housing crisis.

Capitalism is morally bankrupt and is systemically flawed.  Time to grow up and move on.I disagree. Capitalism, no matter how regulated is still wildly flawed and immoral.  I used to think like you until I got educated on the subject.You could have made this exact same comment when transitioning from tribalism to feudalism and it would be exactly the same.  Stop being a fool.The difference is, we've already tried communism and socialism on a national scale multiple times and it has always failed to improve over capitalism, and was usually much worse. Feudalism was tried and was an improvement over tribalism.So you're saying every attempt to implement it has failed? That proves my point. Should we really try something that has a 100% failure rate? Marinaleda? You're fucking joking, right? It has a population of 2,278 people. Pretty much every system on Earth can be successful at that scale. Does that mean white nationalists should use the town of Orania, South Africa as a reason we should be a white nationalist state? No, because it's a tiny town of 1,085 fucking people. Every time socialism has been attempted at a national scale it has failed eventually. The same would happen for white nationalism.

Just because something can work well on a small scale doesn't mean that it will work for a nation of hundreds of millions of people. If small towns want to implement utopian ideals, they can go ahead as long as they don't hurt anyone. But utopian ideals don't work on a large scale.

Also I really don't see how social democratic capitalism is "morally bankrupt".Not really. I don't think you'd deny that people have tried to establish socialist states. You also said there has never been a socialist state. Which means that every single attempt to establish a socialist state has failed. 

Unless you're going to claim that nobody has ever tried to establish a socialist state? That would be false, and it's also your only way out of admitting that the establishment of socialism has a 100% failure rate.

Since it has a 100% failure rate, (by your own accidental admission) why in the everloving fuck would we uproot the entire country to attempt it? Shapiro fans want him to debate anyone and everyone. Kyle's fans say debating and discussing is a waste of time.

 If we truly want to win over people on the right we have to at least talk with them. Lol, but to be fair she did smear Ben when it wasn’t needed and I’m sure she even knew it was a smear. No disrespect to at all to AOC but It’s quite hypocritical of her to not turn up to a debate or discussion with the Jew when she criticised Joe Corruptly for not turning up to a debate with her. She didn’t have to appear on the daily wire but at least don’t make false accusations Skip to the end of the clip, trust me the real meme is there. As in he says something cringe at the end True but she also apparently called conservatives who didn’t appear in a debate with her cowards, don’t quote me on it Ben said it Look to my response above and watch the whole clip. She compared his interview request to being catcalled I just basically told you. Watch the vid when you have the opportunity to connect to WiFi Yes I hate Jews they control the banks and are a part of the illuminati and have heavy influence in the porn industry by trying to push miscegenation. Blacked.com is owned by a jew. They want to destroy white culture. Every time capitalism has been tried it’s been a massive failure too, so what’s your point? At least letting workers democratically control the means of production hasn’t even been attempted at the national level yet.  Let’s give that a go for 50 or 100 years.Wrong boi.Nice argument boiYou gave nothing to argue against.  There's never been a country where the workers were in control of the means of production democratically, yet you claimed "communism has already been tried".  What are am I supposed to do with you?  You don't even know what communism is in the first place.I know what communism is. It's a classless, moneyless, stateless society in which everything is owned in common. A complete and total unattainable utopia. This state has never been achieved by any country, but a few have tried it. That's what I mean when I say communism has been tried.That may be one form of communism, but there's a broader range of what would constitute as communism.  Just like the USA is a capitalist country, but we don't have an anarcho-capitalist state.  We have government, welfare, laws, rules and regulations.

The key identifier however would be the market-based economy and private ownership of businesses and there's a lot of variation in different types of capitalism.

Now, communism is at it's core level predicated on workers in democratic control of the means of production.  This is different from socialism, where it's core concept is planned state run economy.

Communism has never even been attempted at scale so your statement:
&gt; ..but a few have tried it. 

is nonsense even if you understood communism correctly.  Show me 1 country that handed over democratic control of the means of production to the working class.

It's had massive success in the small scale and anything that works in a small scale can be adapted to a large scale.Yes, lets continue to stay divided. Great plan Jesus I was only trolling guys Do you really think I as a leftist black guy would believe those anti-Semitic alt-right conspiracies about Jews destroying white culture &gt;He has asserted, however, that when talking about Social Democracy or Socialism (which Americans have trouble telling apart), Scandinavia should be taken as an example, not Venezuela.

Scandinavia is by in large Social Democracy. Venezuela is socialism.

&gt; Kyle wants Scandinavia to be an example of how well socialist policies work

Social programs. Kyle is a capitalist, as he has states numerous times. Venezuela, as well as all other **economically** socialist states have failed due to said policies, Venezuela specifically due to their seizing of the means of oil and factory production (most famously GM).

&gt; Most of Europe has policies in place, that social democrats want for America. Hence, also Germany, France or the Netherlands could be taken as an example for paid vacation time or maternity leave.

Indeed. Aside from France's paternity test ban, there is no massive  gap in social policies between Scandinavian and Western European states. God this subreddit is trash. Anyone who critiques socialism is downvoted to shit with no good rebuttals.

Socialism has failed 100% of the time when done on more than a very small scale. Social democracy should be what we strive for and that's what Kyle strives for as well. Why the fuck are socialists even here? Stop defending failed economic systems just because right wingers constantly attack them.Erm but but what about Cuba or USSR #Upgrade I’m against his ban but If anyone argues he’s being politically censored because he’s a ‘right-wing commentator’ is in delusion because this guy is a political sycophant of Trump and talks like a schizophrenic about conspiracist theories and those who oppose him. He’s ill and wouldn’t persuade any sane person to agree with him How am I full of shit exactly? Al Sayed lost. Cori Bush lost. Kaniela Ing lost.  Brent Welder lost.  Hardly a "majority."Someone is emotional. 

Mark Thompson, Matt Morgan, Robert Davidson, Rashida Tlaib, Jamie Schoolcraft, Pramila Jayapal, and Sarah Smith won. 

Abdul el Sayed, Kaniela Ing, Brent Welder, David Benac, Fayrouz Saad, Cori Bush, Dorothy Gasque lost. 

Thats 7 for both. Where's the majority? Actually...if you want to get really technical, Tlaib lost another race that day so that's 8 losses. 

But again. They are better the corporatists, but JD has to do a better job of finding people. See Cori Bush on Fox news for exampleI am ok with deplatforming criminals that use their platform to endanger people.Getting sick of idiots saying “I am against his ban.”  The dude is a psychopathic criminal who uses his platform to spout hate, perform defamation and endanger people.  Aside from spouting literally fake news that is rotting our society.All that typing and you finally realized that it was just a typo. Relax man. &gt;Actually you're just a dipshit worth the trash talk. Like the little weasel you are you tried slipping Kaniela Ing (wasn't last Tuseday) past everybody's radar and conveniently left out James Thompson. Fuck off dipshit. We're going to be as successful as we're going to be. Tautology. Engaging with somebody intellectually dishonest to their core is not exactly peachy either so can drop your little act.

Thank you for this thoughtful post. I never said Justice Democrats suck or that their message is bad, I just wanted to find out why they aren't winning more- hence why I used the word "underperform." We need to evaluate all the loses carefully in order to proceed in the best way. Thank you for your service!

What made you interested in running for public office? A version of liberalism which endorses free market capitalism. You are forgetting the SHILL part! You obviously also like Sam seedier too! Go fuck with seeder and pakshit! Hahahahahaha You are in ur Atheist bubble! Pathetic! He lies because he’s against justice dems, peddles the mother of conspiracy theory‘s Trump/Russia need I go on? He’s a Hypocrite! Half way between democratic socialism and social democracy. UBI set at least $20,000 per annum,  100% Top effective tax rate on all assets and income over $1billion, job guaranteed, best single payer system in the world with private healthcare banned, nationalisation of the town water and the best tap water in the world, maglev across America (375mh), Free internet, the right to housing, legislation taxation and regulation of ALL drugs including the worst!Youtube and other social media platforms aren't deplatforming people, even in the far left.  I'm a subscriber of a lot of communist / socialist channels on youtube for example and they're treated the same as anyone else who follows the rules.  


DemocraticSocialist01, BadMouse, ContraPoints and many other far left youtube channels aren't being censored.  The whole slippery slope crap argument for Alex Jones is nonsense.  


Do I think that workers should be in democratic control of business? Sure that's my personal political belief.  But I see nothing wrong with how Alex Jones was handled and how YouTube and other platforms are handling content.  Jones is a lunatic and the things he was spouting on air were nothing but insane lies and propaganda, and clearly was endangering people's lives.Yeah, and every time this has been attempted, it has ended with "State Capitalism" and disaster. Maybe your system just can't be achieved?Yep, there it is. "Well it worked on an incredibly small scale!"

Yeah, any system can work on a very small scale. White supremacists will cite Oriana, South Africa as a shining example of white supremacy working. Doesn't mean it would work on a national scale.I'm not moving the goal post. I'm saying that socialism has never worked on a large scale, because it hasn't.I put State Capitalism in quotes, because there's no point in arguing about whether or not it was state capitalism or socialism. The point is that they intended to try socialism, and the result has always been a disaster whenever it has been tried on more than a very small scale. And no, I haven't fucking dropped the argument, jesus fuck dude. Sorry if I didn't specify "on more than a small scale" in my original comment. I'm not fucking flawless at articulating my argument. I have never moved the goal post. Because that's what I meant. Hell look back in my post history like 2 days and you'll find me arguing that same point on this same subreddit.

You're just a fucking asshole taking advantage of an honest mistake to try and win the argument.

Again, sorry I forgot to type "on more than a small scale." Be mature and just accept that it was an honest fucking mistake and argue the point you absolute dunce. Look in my post history. I said "on more than a small scale" there, which should be enough for you to accept that not saying it this time was an honest. Fucking. Mistake.

Stop dodging the argument by getting hung up on an honest mistake: Socialism has failed 100% of the time when tried on more than a very small scale. Are you going to argue against that or just keep bullshitting about this stupid petty shit?Holy shit, this is the second time this has happened when I present a socialist with this argument. They avoid the question and stop responding. Quit getting caught up in stupid semantic bullshit and engage with my point.

You're a fucking coward who can't just argue and instead has to get caught up with fucking fallacies, unknowingly committing the Fallacy Fallacy (look it up) by disregarding everything I say because of one mistake I made. You are the biggest piece of shit I have ever argued with in the six years I've been on reddit.

 SOCIALISM HAS FAILED 100% OF THE TIME ON MORE THAN A VERY SMALL SCALE AND YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO FACE ITThe Athens point was fucking stupid as well. FOR THE FIVE HUNDREDTH TIME, WE HAVE ALREADY TRIED SOCIALISM ON A LARGE SCALE. IT FAILED. IT MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED ON A TINY SCALE, BUT IT HAS ALWAYS FAILED ON ANY LARGER SCALE THAN THAT. DEMOCRACY WAS TRIED ON A LARGER SCALE THAN ATHENS AND FUCKING WORKED. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE AND YOU'RE ARGUEMENT IS FUCKING STUPID AND POORLY THOUGHT OUT.

You absolutely refuse to engage with this point because you're a coward. ENGAGE WITH THE ARGUMENT. ENGAGE WITH THE ARGUMENT. ENGAGE WITH THE ARGUMENT.

Just do it. That's all I want. Just engage with my main fucking point. I'll wait. I won't hold my breath, though.&gt;liar

Dude relax. JD are doing very well tonight. Very proud of them!Well trust me I’m notThe press pushes this conspiracy theory! &gt;Ugh whatever. I'll admit to the fact that I could of expressed myself much better. This political climate brings out my anger more easily. I usually wouldn't assume the worst like that. I'm way more cynical about keeping with decorum and the go high bullshit and it  doesn't lend itself well to discussions like this. I'm genuinely trying to correct that. I think our political opposition have sort of warped my mind around their bullshit but that's no excuse on my end. I'll try to keep negative influences like them at bay from now on. Honestly I'm sorry.

I'm glad you said that. We are both more or less on the same teamAnd plus Cuba and South Vietnam weren’t democracies, as I can be defo sure that Cuba wasn’t under Batista who came before Fidel Castro Given Ben Shapiro’s record regarding women’s rights and his personal opinion of his own wife, I’d venture to say she painted an accurate portrayal.Rather than focusing on his multiple and clear positions regarding his opinion on LGBT rights I think you are just cherry picking this issue. 

Additionally you haven’t provided a basis for your claims. I have never heard him use said term, not saying it’s not possible, I’m just questioning the context you are referring too, and also when this supposed word was used.

And even in the event he did, we should focus both on the context, and the content of what was said. To simply ignore someone’s context because their content was lacking (linguistically speaking) is just disregard for the overarching point being discussed. And that would be a clear exercise in cognitive dissonance.

Edit: in simpler words, please post and example of what you are referring to. If he used the term “faggot” off the cuff, and in a non-disparaging way to LGBT individuals, than that is a clear exerting of his right to Free speech.
Anything other than that would be up for discussion, such as defending its use as you mention.Jesus Christ what a slow motion train wreck the first one was.Alright I understand you now. The issue is not the use of the word, but claiming it is not disparaging. 

That may be a fair point to discuss. However without understanding the context in which Kyle framed it I wouldn’t be able to speak to the topic effectively. I’ll happily discuss the issue in more depth if you can provide me a video where his discusses this, I just unfortunately haven’t been able to see it. I’ll do some searching on my own as well.

Now I do want to discuss political correctness for a moment, as I feel we’re are getting into that territory.

Personally speaking, I agree with Kyle in the respect that anyone should be able to say whatever they want (excluding the threat of violence of course). Similar to what you are saying now, I agree you should have the right to call him out for this behavior (if it bothers you).

However, my personal opinion aside, objectively speaking your overarching point is that because he is a Heterosexual male, he doesn’t get to decide that “faggot” is not a derogatory term. Now this is certainly disputable, within the right (or should I say wrong) context “faggot” can absolutely being a disparaging remark. But this sounds like you are using identity politics to dispute his opinion, but that’s purely conjecture on my behalf.

However, again that does not mean that arguing it isn’t a disparaging term is inherently false. Because your entire argument appears to be that simply because he is a heterosexual male, he doesn’t get to have an opinion on the topic. And that would be a clear usage of identity politics for arbitrary means.

Not saying that was what you were trying to get across, but that’s how it comes across.
Did you get a reply? Or they took it down before it had a chance.

Either way wouldn't be surprised. Echo chambers lead me to expect this behavior.Alright man, Chill out, seriously, I'm trying to have a discussion with you.

&gt;no it isn't. the idea that a straight guy(who literally uses south park as an argument for the shit he's spewing) gets to declare that THE FUCKING MAIN ANTI GAY SLUR isn't an anti gay slur is preposterous and a slap in the face to all the gay men who have faced violence as they hear that word shouted at them, it's spititng on the grvaes of all the gay men that were murdered in hate crimes, the last words they heard being "faggot". it shows a clear lack of respect for gay men

Firstly, this is purely conjecture. Secondly, if you are a fan of Noam Chomsky, then I'm sure you're familiar with linguistic ambiguity? Faggot was a term originally created for a bundle of sticks, thats not relevant, but it evolved into a derogatory term for LGBT people. I understand that clearly, and I am not disputing it.

But you seem to be trying to yell into my head that no matter what "Faggot" is always going to be a derogatory term and always was. And Listen, I'm not saying it isn't to some people.

But what I am saying, is that the only reason you think its derogatory is because you give it power. Its the same thing with the word "nigger", it was created as a derogatory term, but now has somehow evolved into an endearing term for black people to use with each other. And theres nothing wrong with that.

So listen man, I agree with you that it can be a derogatory term, however I vehemently disagree that it is inherently a derogatory term. The only reason it has power over individuals is because they allow it to have power over them.

Think of it this way, I am short 5'7" to be exact. But you don't see me screaming at people on reddit that "Shorty" or "Short stack" or other derogatory terms for short people are a problem. Because I couldn't give a flying fuck if someone called me that, it doesnt matter to me because I can't change it. Just like an LGBT individual cannot change their sexuality; they are equivocally the same.

Given you are a gay individual, I'd hope you can understand that, as it is directly equatable to your point regarding the term "faggot". You are arguing that it is always derogatory, but in doing so, you are giving power to it for the very same reasons you despise it.

And this ties into discussions Kyle has had on his channel. Language is complex and constantly changing, it is not just a matter of "this is how it is" because we give the words we use the meanings they have. It's not like a statistical study where that can be called a fact. But to just blatantly state that:

&gt;his argument is inherently false and would be even if he wasn't straight, that he is straight just makes it way more douchy. faggot is a disparaging term and an anti gay slur

You are trying to use language (which is alterable and evolves all the time) as the basis of proof for your argument. But you aren't acknowledging the *fact* that language is not unalterable, and *is* open for interpretation.Thats a shame, I think you did a good job of framing your overall point without throwing your opinions into it. Unfortunately I'd venture to say that the Mods and Members of TD don't seem to care about impartiality nor open discussion.Thats how I ended up banned from r/news

I compiled a list of about 6 threads the mods had supressed and was distributing it through the sub. I made all of 2 posts before I was perm banned and muted. I still send them a message every 3 days just to piss them off though.Oh I don’t doubt that at all. The thing that really gets me is sometimes the kids will remove posts or comments that were wildly upvoted for no apparent reason. When I get home I’ll link you to an r/news thread they killed, if you have the un-removal extension you can see that the top comments were literally calling the mods out for their behavior.Alright man, I’m done. I tried to have a discussion with you, I’m not cursing at you, or towards you. And most importantly I’m not committing ad hominem against you, which the majority of your comments were against me.

It’s pretty clear you aren’t interested in the discussion or my point of view at all. I conceded multiple points to you, which you made well. But everything I say is brainwashed lunacy evidently in your eyes.

This is an unequal discussion because you think my arguing against your point is attacking you or gay people. Which it’s clearly not. You can make it out to be all you want. But all you are doing is displaying you are incapable of discussing the topic without being able to be self critical of your own argument or beliefs. This is textbook cognitive dissonance.

I hope you take some time to reflect on that, because the way you spoke to me when I was respectful just shows you aren’t interested in discussing the topic at hand, and just trying to make me out to be some “bad guy” for disagreeing with you. Which is just wrong, just because I disagree doesn’t make my points inherently invalid, and just because you are gay doesn’t make your points inherently valid. Discussion of a topic should be about the topic, not the fact that I just happen to be a straight male who disagrees with your beliefs.That entire reply is the definition of identity politics.[source 5:42-6:25](https://youtu.be/XBVUffXSS2I) The one thing I’m glad is that at least Ben Shapiro understands is that when many progressives say they are ‘socialist’ or ‘democratic socialists’ they mean they want America like other Nordic countries and ‘muh people are eating rats in Venezuela’

But Ben is a hypocrite because the only rebuttal I see that he to that says to that in the clip is that America is uniquely based ‘individualism and liberty’. Seems like he is choosing feelings over facts and being a typical partisan hack. I have zero issue with you having an opinion.

This entire discussion, your whole point has been that because you are gay, and because I am straight, you are somehow the ultimate authority on whether or not the term is derogatory. Every response you have to attempt to justify your stance was based around that concept.

But you are blatantly ignoring the fact that just because you happen to be gay, that doesn’t make you automatically correct on your stance versus mine.

EDIT: And I am not automatically right either, that’s why it’s a discussion.

Instead of arguing substantial points or policy or *facts* about language. You pretty much said “I’m gay, therefore I am the ultimate authority on this topic” which is just plain identity politics. Instead of defending your beliefs with substantial arguments, you decided to just use your identity to devalue my argument which is just wrong.

Just because you find the term offensive under any and all circumstances, doesn’t not give you the right to say that for ALL gay people it is offensive under all circumstances. I have zero doubt that that is not the case, comedy, satire, and irony would all be examples of how someone could use the term “faggot” and it not be inherently offensive.

I laid that out in my points regarding linguistic ambiguity, but you choose not to address that very valid point, and instead opted to attack me and simply say that “your straight so you don’t get an opinion.”

I really don’t see how that’s not blatantly clearI’m already doing that, I am reef diving and snorkeling in key west area and reading the only book that matters, the Word of God and I know how to protect myself against the world! I also KNOW my rights when crossing an international boarder! I could put a sniper on this guy he’s not just a fist! I think the problem is the sheer scale of the grossly incorrect information they convey to their audience. Given Kyles realm of influence, and others similar to him, he’d have to put something up multiple times a day just to call out Fox News.

As important as that is, i think the reason it isn’t covered as much is because in order to retain the impartiality and objective view of his show, he has to cover other sides besides just fox and conservatives.Well he did two segments today. He does cover the other networks more which I’m fine with. I don’t think he cares about being perceived as partial or impartial I think he’ll just cover whatever he sees and thinks needs to be discussed. Yeah that definitely could be true, impartiality may not be a priority, but he does a good job non the less.

As a secondary idea, it may be because of the way traditional establishment media already attacks Fox News. He may not want to add more fuel to the fire, especially if he perceives it as not helping the discussion.Again I don’t think he cares about that especially because no other establishment network is going to defend our side of the party. There is a reason fox gets away with it because no one is correcting them. That is true, they’ve only gotten more popularWatch him delete the video the moment she easily wins in November.I hope you guys know that I’m a random guy with his own beliefs and was of seeing the wold and all I want is a quiet private life with the lord look me up on Facebook, Tim Gordon Hahahahahaha well God can redeem even that if it’s true! Hahahahahaha gosh you make me laugh Kyle you remind me of jimmy! ALL you guys need to do a #RealResistanceTourIt still means his name and by association his message are getting out there, and thus big tech's attempts to shut him out have been an abysmal failure.So would you say in your opinion they are objective at covering stories non-related to the russia investigation? I have been considering watching them for that reason.

I agree that since they are state funded they are going to have an implicit bias, but I am trying to gauge which issues they are clear on, and which ones they are not.

It's difficult because I am a progressive and I agree with many of the commentators such as Chris Hedges, Jessie Ventura, and Abby Martin.Thanks for the recommendations, I've tried Al Jazeera prior but I am not a huge fan of some of their past coverage, specifically regarding middle eastern conflicts, but that could be due to their being based and funded by Qatar.

Would you think its logical to assume that foreign news (whether state funded or not) that covers topics in america are going to me more objective to the topic at hand because they are "outside" so to speak of US politics? Or would you feel the opposite?He needs to get it on Spotify or Pocketcasts. It'd be great if I could tell my Gov. Spybot "This is so sad. Alexa, play the Kyle Kulinski Show." Nice. Now we just gotta fix the shit audio.Med4All is only cheaper for the working class.  Taxation would be used to pay for it, and taxes are based on income.  Medicare for all would cost rich people, like the share holders of CNN, Jake Tapper and all other wealthy people, each hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, or more.

You will never see big businesses and ultra wealthy going to bat for a system that's going to cost them exponentially more.

This video doesn't surprise me at all.  This is also a large reason why I hate Kyle's capitalism coddling.  It's like he knows there are problems, but he's unwilling to find a real solution.  Sad.[ಠ\_ಠ ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSkf-xq5VPrBThPmLLHtjOd_HWzLUtPegD3zTKhHme6PQqfhCUJ)He's too busy trying to find ways to twist logic to defend capitalism.He's one of the libs that knows about the systemic and unavoidable problems with capitalism, but incapable of comprehending that there are viable alternatives that avoid those systemic problems.Don't worry, give it a few years and capitalism will wreck them too.Yea I had feeling he was spouting nonsense, I’m pretty dumb so I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t going crazy. It’s a shame though I really do enjoy his videos on religion A fundamental restructuring of how businesses are owned and operated into a Democrat system where no one person can personally own the means of production.I like naughty tbabes tooWhat is your point? You laid out the issues clearly, albeit lacking sources but that I can just verify. However I don't understand what your presiding point is?

Was your goal simply to lay out the situation as it is, or are you attempting to pose a solution? Not trying to put you on the spot, I just don't understand where you are going with it is all.Islam is not a race, fucktard.That's not a point of disagreement. The US needs to adopt a foreign policy of non-intervention.I was describing the situation as it is. Which many other leftists refuse to acknowledge.However, that doesn't mean that said refugees are not creating problems, even if many of them (though for from all of them, the US has no direct military involvement in Algeria, for example) are the US's fault.Neither. I want a society that is not overrun by Islamic culture, which is incompatible with Western ideals.

This isn't about white or non-white. I used South Korea and Japan as positive examples.Right, but that's not really an opinion, more of a synopses; regardless I also think you may be reaching a good bit on quite a few of your points.

One that I want to address specifically is your statement regarding terrorist attacks in Paris:

&gt; There have been 10 major terrorist attacks in Paris since the beginning of 2015. No modern US city has experienced this degree of frequency in mass killings, and we're the 'shooting spree' country. Tourism to Paris - which was a critical part of the city's economy - has gone down 30% due to fear of terror attacks (amidst other possible factors too, such as the common complaints that the city smells of human urine). Countless other attacks have occured in other European nations. 

Now I believe you are falling into an easy mistake *which is an appeal to ignorance*. Although you are correct there have been that number of terrorist attacks since 2015, **none of those can be, nor have been, directly correlated with increased** ***refugee*** **immigration caused by the migrant crisis.**

Now, some of those may have been committed *by immigrants*, sure, b*ut again that doesn't mean it correlates with specifically refugee related immigration.* 

I've done my own research on this and *there hasn't been a study or analysis produced which looks into the correlation between* ***specifically refugee related immigration***, and a rise in crime/violence/terrorism.

And of all of the studies found regarding ***non-refugee related immigration***; *across the board they commit less crime and violence than natural-born citizens.*

[Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/two-charts-demolish-the-notion-that-immigrants-here-illegally-commit-more-crime/?utm_term=.a7ad1cf41faf)

So here's the problem: *you are advocating for an issue that has not be verified or correlated in any way, and hasn't even been proven to be a problem correlated with* ***refugee related immigration***. And even further, any studies about ***non-refugee related immigration*** *have all found the exact opposite affect of what you describe*. I mean no disrespect, but you're really grasping at straws on this one.

&amp;#x200B;\&gt;Sharia law and Islamic ideals are bad

\&gt;Islam is not a race

\&gt;This makes me a neo-Nazi

kek

You probably think that Sam Harris is a Nazi. lolThe Islamic Golden Age and progress in the ME is largely untouched in American schools. [http://www.regressiveagenda.com/](http://www.regressiveagenda.com/)

3, 7, 9 and 10, my friend.You're not right on the substance, and I pointed that out because words have meanings. I'm not a neo-Nazi or Alt-right, I think Richard Spencer is a cunt.

I don't hate Muslims. But Muslims in Europe disproportionately commit violent acts. It's a statistical fact, you regressive beta male cuck.I said nothing about race. But be sure to scream "wascist!!!!" a little louder, I don't think enough people heard you.What's your argument? That not all immigrants are refugees? We know. That isn't relevant in the least.

If anything, it supports my point. Not all of these people are refugees, so they're not even forced migrants.I know about the Islamic Golden Age. I'm a history major at U of Miami, shithead. Wanna know something super interesting about history? It's *in the past*.

Saying "Europe used to be more backwards and theocratic than the Middle East, therefore there is no problem with Islam" is absurd.Kek is just a substitute for lol. I don't care if Sargon and other right-wing idiots use it. It's still funny.That was flattering! Upvote for youMy argument is that you are omitting pertinent information because it allows you to put forward a narrative which is:

1.) Not founded or supported by any empirical evidence.
2.) Already based on an appeal to the audiences ignorance. Meaning you are making you point assuming the audience already agrees with it, and (I’d venture) assuming you are already correct.
3.) Im not saying you are wrong, I’m saying there is no evidence you are right. Therefore what you are stating is your opinion, not a fact.

Additionally:
&gt; What's your argument? That not all immigrants are refugees? We know. That isn't relevant in the least.

Actually whether an immigrant who commits a crime is of refugee status or non-refugee is important because it frames the entire context of your point. Your entire post went on *specifically to talk about the migrant crisis*, and *refugees are a direct result of said migrant crisis*. So distinguishing between refugee immigration, and non-refugee immigration would be extremely important within *your own context*. Because if you just lump refugees in with non-refugees, then you are doing a disservice to both us as readers, and you as the poster.

In short, not distinguishing refugees from non-refugees when framing your argument that the migrant crisis (AKA refugees) increase crime in countries which take them in is a lie by omission on your part.I'm an atheist. I like anything that makes any religion look bad.

Stop hating your own culture and your own way of life, you self-loathing beta male.I'll copy and paste for you, since you want to stay in your safe space.

3.  Defend the Muslims. Create a false equivalence with Christianity and muddy the waters.

7.  Disregard linear time. Blur the past with the present so as to demonize modern people for the actions of those from the distant past.

9.  If someone brings up a problem, pivot to talking about a non-problem.

10.  If someone presents a problem to you, mention another problem because two wrongs make a who cares.I'd say that not treating women like second class citizens, not killing LGBTQ people, and not killing Jews are important parts of our culture.I can tell you hate Western civilization and people, so let's do this experiment for you. If Europeans/Americans were going into an African country, raping their women, blowing them up, fucking up their economies and slowly eliminating their culture, what would you think of it?Not many Nazis show up as (-5, -7) on the political compass test, buddy.I'm aware of that, I also made a clear distinction between refugee and non-refugee immigration. I used that source as a counter point to his claim that specifically refugee immigration causes crime.

There is not empyrical or statistical studies available on specifically refugee immigrant related crime (at least that I could find), ***therefore i offered the most relevant information avaliable.***

If you have any information regarding specifically refugee-related crime in europe or elsewhere, please let me know as it would be beneficial to the topic at hand.There are some confounding variables but migrants disproportionately commit the offenses.

And FYI I support a path to citizenship and abolishing ICE, my gf is Latina and I live in a &lt;20% white city and love it here. If I'm a white nationalist, I'm a lousy one.Not necessarily. Go to Chechnya, Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan, the white Muslim nations. You'll see the same barbaric shit as the Arab and African ones.

Some people might make it about race, which indeed is pointless and bigoted. But those people are not me.Albeit I appreciate you giving these sources, they are irrelevant to the topic at hand. The migrant crisis has to do with refugees, ***whether they are muslim or not is also irrelevant.***

OP's claim was essentially that the migrant crisis created more refugees, which has resulted in more crime, and that crime he is attributing to them being of muslim decent.

Firstly, the migrant crisis ***does not have exclusivity to muslims being displaced, so thats a moot point.*** And to continue hounding on it *would say more about you or OP than your argument.*

​

I pointed this out, as well as the fact there's no information at all regarding refugee immigrants committing crime disproportionately. ***And I offered supplemental information regarding non-refugee immigrants.***

***I asked for any information regarding refugee immigrant crime statistics***, and you gave sources regarding specifically muslims and jail populations. So not only do those sources not add to the topic at hand, it also raises questions regarding what someones religious background has to do with their likely hood to commit crime. ***Or I should say, why some people believe someones religious background correlates with their likely hood to commit crime.***

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: ***Correlation is not causation, and a disproportionately high muslim prison populations does not equate to the belief that "muslims are more likely to commit crime".*** &gt;you regressive beta male cuck.

You are not helping your argument. Firstly, the migrant crisis ***does not have exclusivity to muslims being displaced, so thats a moot point.*** And to continue hounding on it *would say more about you than your argument.* 

Secondly, ***Correlation is not causation, and a disproportionately high muslim prison populations does not equate to the belief that "muslims are more likely to commit crime".*** 

u/Allsep provided sources regarding muslim prison populations. You have provided no sources thus far. Additionally, your argument lacks substance because you are using a moot point to justify it.White peopleMore like I'm not a white nationalist and here's objective proof that I'm not a white nationalist.
He effectively called me a white nationalist. Is it not PC to defend myself? 
"Oh, he says he isn't a white nationalist. Sounds like something a white nationalist would say."So let me guess. It's wrong when Europeans do it but nobody else. I am not surprised.1. It does not matter whether they're second generation or first generation.
2. The broadening of the definition created a confounding variable, but that does not mean that Muslim migrants are not disproportionately represented among sexual criminals.
3. Crime in Germany being at a 20 year low, if that is indeed true, doesn't address the disproportionate demographic representation in the offenders.
4. Those European nations have strict gun control as well. Both gun control and strict vetting are necessary for the security of a country, you can't just forget about one because it makes you uncomfortable. That's what both the left and right do, except with opposite issues.
5. What the fuck does Breitbart have to do with this? Let alone everything they say? The answer is nothing, you just wanted to make a gross strawman.
6. South Koreans know what's going on halfway around the world because of these amazing new inventions called TV and internet.
7. Why are you saying fuck those South Koreans and insinuating that they're racist? They're not white. I thought racism was MUH SYSTEMIC SYSTEMS OF STUCTURAL INSTITUTIONAL HHHHWITE SUPREMACY.
8. True on the Yemeni genocide, the US should stop supporting Saudi Arabia's murderous rampages.
9. I'll point you to the beginning of the post wherein I explained that I am an atheist, and thus I don't like any religion. But all religions are not equal. Republicans believe stupid shit about religion but nothing close to the Islamic theocrats.Thanks for the comment, I think the issue I’m having is just that some people cannot be reasoned with and I’m bending over backwards to reason with some of the people in that sub.

A lot of the posts are essentially people breaking a rule such as no racism or sexism, etc, then they get banned and complain there. As I said though some have legitimate concerns of moderative abuse so it’s worth discussing.

Interestingly enough I have had some success with people come right out and essentially say “yeah you’re right that was racist/sexist/etc”. I’ve learned that people can say something without realizing it’s implications, and that this is mainly driven by an implicit bias.

But god damn there’s just some people there that seem hell bent on just preserving their cognitive dissonance.That’s good advice, I’ve been attempting that to some degree. Main setback has been that once you start a discussion with one person it seems like 2 more chime in with either the same fallacious argument, or support for the original. It’s almost like 1 step forward 2 steps back in a way.[Here's the clip itself.](https://media.giphy.com/media/X7PvKfrOgCU4y1skOg/giphy.gif) Did he finally become brave enough to try psychedelics, or did Big Seltzer^(TM) just edit the video to cut out his cry for help?https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/are-70-of-frances-prison-inmates-muslims

And when I talk about politics with someone else, I don't need to know what Kyle thinks about something because Kyle does such a great job of laying out why he believes something and why that makes sense. And with that, I am able to seamlessly use the same logic with any other policy or position.i think the worry is they cant beat donald trump. he’ll expose them for the fakes they are. also, they are the kind of shitheads that led to donald trump in the first place. they are corporatist democrats pretending to be progressives for votes. they might be good on social issues, but they’ll expand the corporate hegemony over all of us.  they didn’t vote for clinton because they knew she was worse than obama, and obama was also a corporatist. they thought “my life didn’t improve under obama, shit isn’t gonna change with hilary, Trump is telling me they’re all bought off by their donors.” and that was true. and it’s true of these guys too, and trump will call it out and it will resonate.  obama wasn’t worse than trump, but he was just as bad as bush in a lot of ways. he would pander to the left yet constantly deliver for the right. you don’t understand how bad it is out there. in the US 40 million people live in poverty, 18 million live in extreme poverty, 5 million people live in third world conditions of absolute poverty. inequality got worse under obama. 47 million people are being crushed by 1.7 trillion in student loan debt.



of course you are right that trump is a million times worse in every possible way. but 3 people have as much wealth as the bottom 50%. that wasn’t trump’s doing. so these corporate democrats are not good enough. the onion put it best: https://politics.theonion.com/obama-urges-young-voters-to-ignore-how-many-lousy-candi-18289417791) increase taxes on the rich including a surtax

2) abolish student loan debt (we’ve given trillion in tax cuts to the rich under trump and billions to the bank in the form on bailouts. we could’ve used that money to help students)

3) he should’ve split up and nationalized the banks after the crash

4) single payer health care


i could go on and on. there a million things he could’ve done for income inequality. he had 8 years. his job was pretty much to lose to republicans. as america jerks to the right, liberals do the same in order to win elections and keep the country from moving further right. this is the basic liberal mantra and it’s fitting that it takes the form on an excuse.  democrat’s lack of vision will never fundamentally change american politics. obama promised change you can believe in, but he didn’t believe in it! he was supposedly going to change how washington works, not just play the same old games a little better. but goldman sachs gave him more money than anyone else because they understood he is a puppet to the machine. I think he could've used the bully pulpit to make his case forcefully and change the overton window. Instead he offered a compromise to republicans and then compromised on that compromise until republicans got everythingthey wanted. i wish he wouldn’ve fought tooth and nail for the public option, and in the end, if we lost we lost. but tht is the problem with liberls and democrats. they don’t even try. they are defeatist losers and that’s why no one likes them. trump is the most popular president in the history of the republican party (among republicans, least popular overall) and it’s because they feel like he fights for them. bernie is the only democrat that actually fights for us. maybe elizabeth warren. the rest are all a joke. bernie isn’t a dictator. i just want a fighter. can you tell me with a straight face that obama fought republicans? he wanted to be best friends with them. FDR famously said of the rich “I welcome their hatred.” MmmmmyEEEEEEEsLol that voice is too much man lmaoooI like David, but he seems to treat his callers poorly when he disagrees with them.

Also if you do this again it would be cool to see how the specific subreddits voted, especially since you posted in some non American, and non political subreddits. Your reply really encapsulates the people that perpetuate this type of religious extremism. The vast majority of people who would agree with that sentiment likely aren't aware, or more likely do not care, that this country was founded on the premise of the separation of church and state and religious freedom.Yes. They were a mixture economically, with some of the characteristically "socialist" policies you mentioned and some of the more traditionally right-wing ones mentioned elsewhere in the comment section. But guys like Crowder only focus on the left-wing ones, and typically exaggerate them and take them out of their historical context.Anybody have links to Sargon's bit?

His self help videos are very insightful and encouraging, his takedowns of feminism are empirical and fact-based instead of "le rekt triggered femininis XDD" like some other anti-SJW Youtubers. He is wrong on some issues involving race but that's mainly because he overvalues statistics and doesn't look at all if their nuances. AIU hates Trump bYeah that’s essentially what happened with cenk. But Kyle also has a certain smugness to him that could provide a good counter to that.I hope it's Pakman Exactly, it does the movement more harm than good.I want it to be Bernie.

&amp;#x200B;Good, but it's just one poll. I like looking at an aggregate of polls to prevent bias If you look at the RCP aggregate, Beto is behind by 4-5 pts- well within striking distance. 

[https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/tx/texas\_senate\_cruz\_vs\_orourke-6310.html](https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/tx/texas_senate_cruz_vs_orourke-6310.html)Depending on how young we are talking it's particularly hard for young people to vote in primaries. I live on a college campus, and I see most organizations that help young people register to vote come in after the primaries. plus you have class/work (also depending on how young you are) and it's easier to justify taking time off for a general election than for a primaryOk. Are the young people aware of these things? Because here they aren’t. Yeah I’m very aware that Democrats are pretty much just as guilty as conservatives at not caring about spending money until universal healthcare is brought up. I just didn’t have enough room to add “conservatives, corporate democrats, establishment media, etc” in the meme. It is hard to understand what Kyle and some others mean with their sayings about pandering Putin and Kim jong un. Trying to put some possible interpretations in picture form may at least give something that can be refuted.

1 Upper left, pandering is on or off and chance of war drops from 0.9 % to near 0 % when pandering is on.

2 Upper right, the more pandering the less risk of war. So better turn up pandering to 11 ?

Those 1 and 2 seem to be what they could mean. 

Then there are other possible opinions about this kind of one dimensional / one adjustment knob choice view:

3 Lower left, after some amount of pandering, more pandering does not reduce risk of war. Benefit of pandering levels of.

4 Lower right, there is an optimum level of pandering after which more pandering increases risk of war.

In reality international relations are more complicated than one adjustment knob.

If a leader calls Putin or Un "good", they are wrong or lying. Can't be a tactic to lie about that. It's just a meme. It's really just a collection of stupid things Trump has put into action/proposed. And while the drone strike program does cost 2.9 billion dollars, I mostly included it because it [kills over 90% the wrong people.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civilian-deaths-drone-strikes_us_561fafe2e4b028dd7ea6c4ff) I mean, I could have chosen some way worse things (in regards to spending), like [the US spending about 5.6 trillion dollars in war since 2001.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-estimates-war-costs-at-5-6-trillion-1510106400)

And obviously, I don't think that every single conservative thinks this way, but also I think we all know that the majority of people (not just conservatives, this also includes corporate Democrats and the media) who always ask "how are we going to pay for this???" when universal health care is brought up, but never ask that about anything else. Memes aren't supposed to be some profound research driven vehicle that is supposed to blow your mind. It's just to make this community chuckle a little bit.What's Kyle's final smashI love how you sarcastically belittled him for making a meme none the less. Then he proceeded to politely respond to you about how your statement was blatantly incorrect.

  
And then in your response you proceed to complete abandon your original point, the points that OP raised, and just decided to belittle him again without acknowledging the point at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess for you:

&gt;It's easy to say this shit behind a screen on Reddit 

&amp;#x200B;Yeah this is wayyyyyyyyy to busy and long of a presentation. Plus the visuals are childish in nature therefore someone could try and say this isn't a "serious" presentation.This is why i don't watch The Young Turks they have ever so subtly always seemed like they supported the current conflicts, because I never really noticed them call them out in dept or discuss the affect our intervention is having on the population. Just like Mass Media, TYT seems to only be concerned with reporting the minimal amount of acceptable information in regard to Syria, Nigeria, ETC.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, fuck her, I'm glad jimmy cursed at her. It is bullshit, and if you can't handle a little cursing then get out of politics.

&amp;#x200B;

The labor party of the 1930's use to shut down the senate and house to regularly stage protests votes, and regularly used to shout and curse in the house and senate to get their agenda through. That caused a huge calamity back then and it's doing the same thing now. But it's not causing a calamity just because someones cursing, it's caused calamity because they were using profanity to prevent them from being silenced.Just want to interject with some observations.

&gt; Sanders could be the Democratic Presidential candidate and the Greens and Dore would still work against him. 

Kyle has made it poignantly clear that Sanders shouldn't run for risk of splitting the progressive vote. Sanders should put his full support behind Elizabeth Warren, and guide her agenda to prevent her from running astray.

&gt;I don't think the Greens care at all about getting elected or else they would do just as the Social Democrats do and run as Democrats and get elected and make the Democrats more progressive.  

Jimmy had a segment on his show about sentiments just like this. The reason we have third parties is because you have a right to decide to vote for whatever party represents your values. If the green party represents your values more than the democrats/republicans, then by all means you should vote for them.

What you are doing is the same thing that establishment democrats are doing, and subtly implying that any third party voters are wasting their votes or placing them in protest.

The green party is a different party, they do not identify completely with the Social democratic platform, they may agree in some aspects, but definitely not all. Additionally, what you are pushing for in this statement is reformism of the democratic party, which I do not see happening. And many many other progressives agree with this sentiment.

&gt; The Greens are activists. They are not politicians. It is not possible for them to get more then 2% of the vote. 

And this is just the nail in the coffin that clear shows everything I stated above.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;Look I’m not going to delve into this topic. It’s really pretty simple. To vote for the greens is to vote for whomever someone decides is best. That is a right, and if you can say they wasted it, then I can say that’s an inherently undemocratic sentiment, because it is.

You can say that’s a wasted vote all you want. But really, in doing so all you are doing is further eroding the efficacy of our democracy by pushing us further towards a polarized left/right position, and not only that, your literally telling people that their vote doesn’t matter.

Trump won in 2018 because that’s what the democrats did, they turned their backs on independents and the rust belt, and what you are suggesting, which is to again ignore independent voters, will lead to another trump in 2020. The democrats need independent votes to win, and yet they consistently do nothing to try to win over independent voters.&gt; There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution

*John Adams, Letter to Jonathan Jackson (2 October 1780), "The Works of John Adams", vol 9, p.511*

You are just like I was prior to the 2016 election. imbibed with the Democratic Party and the concept that moving more towards the center will win votes. You say you represent Bernie and AOC and yet that is inherently contrary to their own leftist platform.

Additionally, you have a misguided understanding not just of what the founding fathers wanted, but about democratic representation. A multi party system is inherently more democratic than a polarizing two party system. Moving to the middle is not going to solve that problem, because many parties, such as the Green Party, are outliers whom ideals don’t reside in the middle. Therefore if you want their vote in a democratic election, then you need to appeal to their base in some way in your platform.

Instead, just like what you are doing now in response to my argument, the democrats are just shouting at independents to fall in line for the sake of maintaining the establishment status quo.

So you talk about democratic reform, and yet what you and the party is doing is contrary to that.I think we just disagree about the people’s beliefs regarding progressive ideals. Across the board and across the country people are more progressive and more leftist then ever, and some of them don’t realize it.

So let me ask you this, why are AOC and Bernie running on Medicare for all, tying Estate tax to income, free public college tuition, forgiveness of student loan debt, etc the list goes on and on and on. And across the board, whether democratic or conservative, the majority of the American people support these clearly progressive ideals.

[Source 5 increasing the minimum wage](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_570ead92e4b08a2d32b8e671) 

All of these polls are clear examples that the American voter (whether left or right leaning) overwhelmingly support a number of clearly leftist and progressive policy points.

I would firmly disagree with you that their policies are too progressive to win, on the contrary I believe that because they are so progressive that is why they have had success. And I think the mindset you are feeling into which is of sidelining them because you think their “too progressive” is damaging to democratic voters&gt; I would say the country is slight more progressive.  It is slowly getting more progressive due almost entirely to generational turnover.

I could agree with that sentiment but it’s really just speculation on the topic of generational turnover. And I think usin. The rust belt as a case study for this is perfect. I mean progressive ideals have always been rooted in the rust belt, just like unions.

&gt; But the details and specifics are not necessarily supported by a majority.  This details and specifics are. It that relevant until it is time to put togeather legislation that can actually pass.  For instance the majority of American support the concept of M4A but I do no think the Majorty will support(for the next decade or so) the details and specifics of Sanders M4A plan(the funding/taxes for all of that is the problem).

This is a problem I have both with your argument and the discussion being had overall around the topic of M4A. Sanders and AOC have put forward a starting point yes, but no one has offered anything to build off of what they have put forward both in mainstream media and the general narrative. Everyone is very quick to overgeneralize or cherry pick weaker aspects of the beginning plan they laid out, and yet establishment democrats and republicans aren’t offering anything substantive of their own. So if we keep talking those points we don’t eat anywhere.

&gt; But again my issue isn't with progressive policies it is with Jimmy Dore/Green politics and political practices.

We will have to disagree here, albeit Jimmy is just as vulgar and abrasive as some other media figures, what matters at the end of the day is policy and substance. The media is extremely quick to throw him under the bus for being similarly as abrasive as such figures as trump. And yet the things Jimmy discusses are in direct benefit to the average American, such as his points about Sanders and AOC needing to be more hardline on the position of M4A.

Meanwhile the trump administration is in active litigation against pre-existing conditions for Americans being covered by the ACA. 

And meanwhile when Obama initially put forward Obamacare it was much more leftist in regards to funding dedicated towards Medicare and assistance for those who couldn’t afford healthcare.

So from my perspective, and looking at the history around healthcare, I think it’s good that Jimmy is taking a hardline stance on this issue of “leftist lite”. Because that’s the only way we can prevent M4A from becoming a boiled down joke just like the ACA became.You act as if identifying people as communists somehow gives your argument more traction, newsflash, it doesn’t.

You can’t just dismiss someone else’s argument on the grounds of ideological difference, that’s just sticking your head in the sand.Or Jimmy actually has the foresight to realize that 20 years from now all we will be discussing is the wars for profit and exploitation of the average consumer.

Not Omarosa and some milquetoast “resistance” republicans.&gt;I didn't dismiss any argument. I didn't suggest it supported my argument. There is no arguments being made here.

Okay... and yet in the next sentence:

&gt;Obviously most people dismiss communists. He probably isn't a communist but more of an anarchist which most people also dismiss.

You generalize about how "most people" dismiss them. You wouldn't point this out unless you were dismissing them. So lets come full stop there, you were and are trying to dismiss him for being of different ideology than you.

Secondly, since you (and it seems like any establishment democrat) want to hound on how "ThIrD PaRtiEs CaNT WIn ElEctIoNs!" I'll leave you with this:

&gt;"There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution."

[*John Adams, Letter to Jonathan Jackson (2 October 1780), "The Works of John Adams", vol 9, p.511*](http://www.selfgovernment.us/news/3)

Maybe, instead of just saying "Well I support their platform, they just won't win" you should fucking vote for them if they support what you want? Like the circular logic with people that hold your position baffles me. Your entired Argument boils down to the following:

You: "I like their platform and policies, but I can't vote for them because Third parties can't win"

Literally anyone else: "So you like them but won't support them?"

You: "Well of course not, their wrong, and they can't win"

Literally anyone else: "But... you just said you like their policy, couldn't you vote for them...?"

You: "but they can't win"

Literally anyone else: [Okay...](https://media1.tenor.com/images/bd5ed73019a114c376b8d6c1a9c1597b/tenor.gif?itemid=12354165)
Hah. This reminds me of 2006 in Germany, when they quickly passed unpopular laws during the quarter World Cup finals between Germany vs. Italy. The same in 2010 and 2014. Those are always the most productive 90 minutes in our parliament.&gt; The person who raises the most money wins over 99% of the time. Not every democrat can get grassroots donations like Bernie did. 

Generally speaking, the best fundraiser wins, I'll give you that. But you are completely off on your second point. Not every Dem can raise small donations like Bernie and AOC because not every Dem is running on an actual populist platform and actually represents the voters in their districts.

The reason establishment Dems can't beat leftist progressive Dems is because our platform actual serves the voters and not corporate interests. I spend every single day telling people to only vote for candidates not taking corportate/PAC donations, and everyone I say it too agrees whether right or left.

&gt; And yes, all Democrats support overturning Citizens United and Buckley v Valeo. Corporate money hurts democrats. While those are still standing, they are leaving the option for individual Democratic candidates to take corporate money. 

Secondly, this whole sentence was contradictory?!?! So democrats support overturning citzens/etc, and yet the vast majority of democratic candidates still take corporate and PAC donations? And not only that, those that do are shit-talking progressive dems not taking corporate/PAC money.

Dude, are you even paying attention? Like your policy points are completely ass backwards from what american voters clearly want.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;Now your just saying they’re taking the corporate money to “level the field” with republicans, which is just categorically untrue. Look at Beto O Rourke out fundraising TEd Cruz in Florida, look at Ocasio winning on much less fundraising.

Corporate money is less valuable to prospective candidates by the day, whether left or right. And arguing that the Dems should take it just to “level the field” makes them just as bad as republicans. Because that says they are willing to set aside what their base wants, what will win elections, and what will benefit Americans. 

By democrats continuing to take corporate donations, as you argue, they continue to further the very problem you say they are fighting against? Do you see the contradiction there? You can’t have your cake and eat it too.You are literally saying an equivalent of *the ends justify the means*. I hope you realize that.I’m just going to leave you with a little quote that I hope you reflect on the historical implications regarding our countries history with the concept of *”The ends can justify the means”*:

&gt; Good ends, as I have frequently to point out, can be achieved only by the employment of appropriate means. The end cannot justify the means, for the simple and obvious reason that the means employed determine the nature of the ends produced.

-Aldous Huxley, [Ends and Means](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ends_and_Means) 

Whether it be Agent orange and starving and maiming the south Vietnamese in the name of the *freedom and protection*.

Or our countries support of the Khmer Rouge and their Early genocides.

Or our countries support of Vladimir Putin’s original 2000 election with clear evidence of an illegitimate election back then.

Or our countries current support of the Saudi Coalition actively committing genocide in Yemen.

Your attitude of *”the ends can justify the means, absolutely”* has a long history of which I don’t think you have fully studied. So I really hope you take the time to reflect on that stance, because it can be taken to dangerously evil levels very easily.
&gt;***There is no genocide in Yemen.***

# All sides in Yemen conflict could be guilty of war crimes, says UN

[Source.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/middleeast/un-yemen-report-intl/index.html)

&gt;Their report, which comes after multiple ***recent civilian deaths, points to thousands of civilian casualties caused by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, widespread arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence and the conscription of children as young as 8 into Yemen's armed forces***, all of which are crimes under international law.

[Bomb that killed 40 kids in Yemen made in US](https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/08/17/yemen-school-bus-strike-us-bomb-elbagir-tsr-vpx.cnn)

&gt;The Yemen war began in early 2015 when Houthi rebels -- a minority Shia group from the north of the country -- drove out the US-backed government and took over the capital, Sanaa.  
&gt;  
&gt;The crisis quickly escalated into a multi-sided war, with neighboring Saudi Arabia leading a coalition of Gulf states against the Houthi rebels. The coalition is advised and supported by the US and the UK, among other nations.

&amp;#x200B;

And thats just what CNN has to say about it. Personally, I look to Noam Chomsky in *Manufacturing Consent* when he says:

&gt;“Genocide" is an invidious word that officials apply readily to cases of victimization in enemy states, but rarely if ever to similar or worse cases of victimization by the United States itself or allied regimes.”― **Noam Chomsky,** [**Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/857416)

and as a follow up:

&gt;“This bias is politically advantageous to U.S. policy-makers, for focusing on victims of enemy states shows those states to be wicked and deserving of U.S. hostility; while ignoring U.S. and client-state victims allows ongoing U.S. policies to proceed more easily, unburdened by the interference of concern over the politically inconvenient victims.”― **Noam Chomsky,** [**Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/857416)

We as a nation are actively participating in a Genocide in Yemen, whether you *believe it* or not does not matter.

&amp;#x200B;YouTube my dudeI know the show airs I think M-W-F at like 12:30-1:30?

Do to his website, it has the information regarding the live podcastAll of these are great points. The only thing I’d add is remember to be succinct. Write out these explanations into two sentences or less and make them as informative and effective as possible; it has to be easy to understand and stick in someone’s head. Most important write it how you would say it so it sounds natural and authentic.

If you do that, along with the information u/mooseloose28 said you can get your points across very effectivelyIll second everything you said, Kyle had it right from the start, hes a careerist.Louder for the folks in the back please.God damn what is with you people and shit? Are you really so full of it you need to throw it at the rest of us?Big fault on Polticon for being heavily disorganized but also the cuckservatives backing out the last minute. I'm just praying we get *something* from David and Kyle at this point!Really? Didn't know that You're kidding right?This is deeply disturbing on multiple levelsI don't consider either of those men to be particularly authoritative, smart or credible, but they're still free to voice their beliefs regardless of their professions.Did I say there wasn't? All I said was that neither of them are that impressive. To me celebrities are akin to normal average joes in politics (provided they don't have a degree in poli sci, law, history, etc.) and their opinions are worth no more or less. And don't call me "buddy."So you're literally arguing that, left or right, someone's opinion is more valid and critical thinkers should take it more seriously because they have money and fame. You're a fucking dunce, I know your dad beat you and gave you brain damage but that doesn't mean you can take it out on others.\&gt;On reddit

\&gt;Complaining about people being mean

Might not be the best place for you homeboy. You're the one who took a shit on me simply for adding nuance without even disagreeing.I think progressives and right-wing libertarians can get along with each other well and I think we should make alliances with them where ever our values align "Is it true you are scared shitless of Kyle Kulinski, or have you just not come up with a valid excuse yet?"How to argue 101\#CowardCoulterI really feel like all this back and forth on the left about Jimmy Dore really just boils down to a difference in ideology.

Jimmy doesn’t believe in reforming the democrats and want’s third parties to take the reigns.

Whereas Kyle, Packman, Seder, etc are more on the lines that democratic reform are the right way to go.

Personally I think we’re arguing circles around this point and yelling at each other for no real reason.

Both options would be better than our current climate, so why can’t we embrace each other’s ideals and perhaps work them in conjunction with one another?&gt; The point is that Dore and the Greens refuse to work in conjunction with the Democrats! You can run leftist anti-Dem candidates without severely helping the right/Republicans in a two party system and we exist in a two party system! You have to reform/coalition with one of the parties! The Greens never get more then 2% of the vote! It is not possible for them to positively effect change for the outside! They can only do more harm then good and that is just they do. They are counter-productive. 

No we do ideologically disagree. I am for democratic reform 100% but I also believe we desperately need a third party in this country, whether that be a socialist, green, or Labor party i don't really care at the end of the day.

The green party has an entirely different platform from the democratic party, its voters support completely different policy positions than the democrats, and it should be pretty clear that someone that is voting green is doing so because they feel the democrats don't represent their values.

What you just argued by saying:

&gt;The Greens never get more then 2% of the vote! It is not possible for them to positively effect change for the outside! They can only do more harm then good and that is just they do. They are counter-productive. 

And I am projecting slightly, but my interpretation of this is as follows (feel free to clarify):

The democrats don't need to modify/change/push policy which would actually win over green party voters for covering the issues they care about. The greens just need to fall in line behind a party they don't support which is asinine. The democrats want the support of greens and independents, but they expect it without changing their policy to better identify with those votes? That doesn't make any sense, and it's just disrespectful all around.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I want to leave you with a little something to reflect on, Even John Adams one of the original founding fathers saw no greater threat to this country and its democracy than a two party system:

&gt; "**There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution."** 

 \- John Adams, *Letter to Jonathan Jackson (2 October 1780), "The Works of John Adams", vol 9, p.511*  
 

And I really think you should reflect on this, because it hits right onto what you said, your entire argument was that the greens are obstructing the democrats from winning because they won't suppor them. 

Meaning they are in "opposition" to the Democrats. 

So what you are doing with your argument is demonizing the Greens, just like the republicans demonize the democrats, you are demonizing the Green party and it's voters because it allows you to feel it furthers your party agenda. Meanwhile the democrats aren't offering anything of substance for Green party voters to support.

&amp;#x200B;Elizabeth Warren did not change her Ethnicity from White/Caucasian to Native American/Alaska Native. 

&amp;#x200B;

The university did it, after asking her permission. They did it to fill a minority role. 

If anything, we should be attacking the university responsible for using her hertiage to fill Affirmative action requirements:

[Source](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/09/01/did-claiming-native-american-heritage-actually-help-elizabeth-warren-get-ahead-but-complicated/wUZZcrKKEOUv5Spnb7IO0K/story.html)

Excerpt:

&gt; That previously undisclosed report reveals that the hiring committee at Penn, where Warren worked from 1987 to 1995, viewed her as a white female applicant. ***Moreover, the committee went to some pains to explain on this form why she was selected over several minorities to fill a faculty position.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Not until she had been teaching at Penn for two years ***did she authorize the university to change her personnel designation from white to Native American***, the records show.

&amp;#x200B;&gt;We have a two party system and they are coalitions parties. They are not strict ideological parties. They are the left and right, the governing and the opposition. The founding fathers didn't want any ideological politcal parties and they succeeded because the Democrats and Republicans are not that ideological.

This is nonsense and you know it. Are we going to ignore the massive partisanship when it comes to things such as judge appointments, supreme court picks, or bill approval? You realized that the vast majority of bills are passed with singular partisan support. Meaning a majority of a single party puts it through, and 99 times out of 100 you can draw a straight line through the house or senate and find that All the party supported it.

So you can talk about "coalitions" and that the parties aren't strictly "ideological" but we both know that's just factually untrue whenever you look at the voting record in the house or senate. Nearly everything is put through by singular party conforming votes, their are no dissenting voices anymore in the senate and congress, and I know because I watch the daily sessions at home.

&gt;Many Greens will never vote for Democrats even if Sanders was the Dem candidate because many Greens are privileged and stubborn counter-cultral contrarians.

Nice broad sweeping generalization, I didn't realize you represented the ideals of all green party voters? When did they nominate you, when did they decide, "yeah he speaks for us"? I'd love to know.

Do you not realize you are literally acting exactly as I described and yelling at the greens without offering anything substantive for them to support? This is a literal example of you expressing your desire for them to "shut up and fall in line". Your exact attitude is the very problem Jimmy Dore highlights and the very problem the democrats fail to see.

&gt;They have a psychological need to not be a part of anything popular and responsible. The Greens are a personality type. If the Dems moved to the left they would not get hardly any Greens but they would lose all the moderates and centrists.

The greens are populist, and what you are decrying is populism.

And now I begin to wonder, have you ever watched Kyle's show? Do you understand that he is a staunch supporter of populism?

If you had, and if you were paying attention, you'd have realized that moderates, centrists, and neolibralism is not the future nor the "saving grace" of the democratic party. *The greens have Zero interest in working with Moderates, Centrists, and Neoliberals because, like i said* ***(and which you conveniently didn't acknowledge)****,* ***they don't represent their values.***

&gt;Stop blaming "the system" for the failures of democracy and the human species. The Greens do a million times more demonizing of the Democrats then the Dems do of the Greens. Democratic candidates ignore the Greens while the Greens constantly talk shit about Democrats and "the system"

Firstly, I have no ideal how you even came to this conclusion. Have you ever seen a green party candidate on national news? Have you ever seen one on local news? Have you read any local news articles discussing them? Have you ever even read one word from the green party candidate in your district? (if one is running).

Additionally, how is it now all of the sudden not acceptable to you that the green party candidate attack the platforms of their democratic opponents? How is that any different from a Democrat attacking a republican, or Vice-versa? So it's okay when every party BESIDES a third party does it, is that what your point is? ***I'd really like some clarification here if you don't mind.***

Also, you are misrepresenting multiple democrats who have vocally and on national news blamed the greens for "Stealing" elections by not voting for the Democrat in the race. ***I'm not blaming the "system" I'm blaming the Democrats, and their failures in rallying any support from the greens, or similar leftist parties/ideals.***

Lastly, you proved my point with this final statement:

&gt;A third party on the far left or far right isn't going to happen and anyone trying for that is wasting their time and ignoring real work towards progress.

I just said that mine, and Jimmy Dore's entire argument is that if the Democrats want Green party voters, then they need to push policy which represents the values of those voters.

And your response was that you and the democrats don't have to care about what policy positions the greens like because they are "wasting their time" and that they should just fall in line behind democrats they don't support to "work towards progress".

Dude, you are literally exhibiting the behavior I said was a problem, and your entire response didn't even acknowledge my overall point that if Democrats want green votes, then they need to appeal to their base through policy.r/unexpectedseculartalk Where is this from though? It looks like a Korean live stream--also freaked me out at first because the red looked like blood Interesting. Not something to my liking but that was pretty funny XD Thank you!
Kudos to Peter Scrhiff here! It's really cool that he's open minded and respectful towards Kyle. I hope that an interview will happen someday since we haven't seen one yet from the showHoly shit I thought this was gonna be a Secular Talk YTP but when I clicked I was so taken aback

Someone needs to show Lilith this!So are you confident that US could have single payer and free college through higher taxes because our working class owns at least part of the means of production?Kyle killed it in this panel, he was the only one getting consistent response from viewers. Makes the anti-populists think.Do you want some cheese with that whine Ann?Which ones are you referring to? They are against corporatism, authoritarianism and imperialism. In fact I’d argue they’d agree with leftists on most of the problems but not on the solutions . Like schiff basically argued about every problem with the US Economy that Kyle has always banged on about this whole time but they depart on how to solve it 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cwyc3OD4n84You are taking Kyle out of context. I watched the entire podcast, and rewatched this specific section a few times because it was important.

Kyle said multiple times that he has no proof or evidence that the accounts were removed due to a “back room conspiracy”. He clearly stated he was inclined to believe that conclusion because of the perception around the account removals.

He told viewers from the beginning that what he was saying was his opinion and only speculation. Did you miss that?&gt;That just like when someone says I'm not a racist but...

No. No it's not. They are not even in the same ballpark and that is a false equivalence.

&gt;Having such a strong option based on nothing isn't OK

First, this doesn't make sense given theirs people that think far more outlandish things on much more cut and dry topics.

Secondly, I will re-iterate, did you actually watch this section of the podcast in its entirety? Multiple times he states it was his opinion, and that it was not based in fact nor evidence. Then Kyle continued to further elaborate upon why he has this opinion by citing multiple examples:

Such as the orchestrated removal of Alex Jones from more than a dozen websites all within the same day?

Or the two previous times they removed huge swathes of twitter and facebook accounts?

Or the fact that facebook censored its own platform to be allowed in israel?

And look man, I'm not saying Kyle is right, I recognize he is speculating, ***but he made that blatantly clear.*** I don't understand what you are arguing for? Is he just not allowed to have an opinion contrary to facebook or twitter? Like what is your point?&gt; I don't think it's a false equivalence. When someone says it's just their opinion doesn't avail the person from the option stated afterwords. So it was clear what Kyle was implying and wants people to think. Just be sprinkling around "it's my option" doesn't change the nature of content or provide any defence from criticism of having a bad option. 

I should clarify that I was under the impression you were simply attacking him for having an opinion not backed up by some form of evidence or proof. Or that he wasn’t being clear on that. 

However if you wanna talk about the substance of that opinion that’s totally fair.

So to talk more to that point, I can understand someone such as yourself not wanting an opinion not scientifically founded to be put forward by kyle. He is typically very scientific and matter of fact.

&gt; Don't tell millions of people about your batshit crazy "option". All it does is damage the progressive movement.

To address this, I do not see this as a crazy opinion, Kyle himself has done multiple pieces regarding how left wing and progressive (along with some conservative, but mostly leftist) viewpoints are suppressed in news, colleges, and education curriculum. I would defer you to these:

[YouTube Pulls Syrian Gov Channels](https://youtu.be/JJoaGaFww_A) 

[Article critical of trump gets pulled down.](https://youtu.be/1oKOeogYG4Y) 

[Facebook pulls 652 pages for “Coordinated misinformation”](https://youtu.be/T6xdoKdCQ_c) 

[Left wingers banned from Twitter for Dumb joke](https://youtu.be/N0yDJYd_IEg) 

[Corporate Dems plan Social Media Censorship](https://youtu.be/UCvie7pmiGk) 

So I don’t necessarily think you’ve been paying attention to the show, additionally I think your skepticism regarding whether the media and social media companies are conspiring against the American consumer and them getting a full scope of information through censorship; I will direct you to this:

&gt;*In countries where the levers of power are in the hands of a state bureaucracy, the monopolistic control over the media, often supplemented by official censorship, makes it clear that the media serve the ends of a dominant elite. It is much more difficult to see a propaganda system at work where the media are private and formal censorship is absent. This is especially true where the media actively compete, periodically attack and expose corporate and government malfeasance, and aggressively portray themselves as spokesmen for free speech and the general community interest. What is not evident (and remains undiscussed in the media) is the limited nature of such critiques, as well as the huge inequality in command of resources, and its effect both on access to a private media system and on its behavior and performance. A propaganda model focuses on this inequality of wealth and power and it’s multilevel effects on mass media interests and choices. It traces the routes by which money and power are able to filter out the news fit to print, marginalize dissent, and allow the government and dominant private interests to get their messages across to the public.*

*Manufacturing Consent, Edward Sherman and Noam Chomsky*

Additionally:
&gt; The whole idea of having options based on nothing is anti-intellectual/anti-scientism. If you don't have a good reason to believe something then you shouldn't have a strong opinion about it. Don't tell millions of people about your batshit crazy "option". All it does is damage the progressive movement.

I am quoting a legendary intellectual who is in agreement with kyles position, and helped him form his own position. He has said this multiple times on the air and encouraged people to read it now, that’s exactly why I am as a matter of fact.

The simple truth is, if you look at the historical context of mass media suppression, and not even just in the sense of censorship, but also In the sense of simply not covering certain stories. So for Kyle to have an opinion that “Hey the media and social media companies are probably conspiring to censor dissenting ideals” there is literal historical proof and context of that happening. 

And again, I will highlight, there is a difference between clearly prefacing an unfounded statement with *this is just my opinion” and actually attempting to claim our opinion is fact. 

And here’s a key point:
&gt; If you don't have a good reason to believe something then you shouldn't have a strong opinion about it.

You claim he doesn’t have “good reason” to believe in his clearly stated opinion. Yet it is blatantly obvious in both his own show AND intellectuals and scientists that his opinion has merit. So please, continue.





Less than Hasan my ass you Koch funded chode chugger.He looks a little short, maybe 5 foot 9. Not sure of the exact height Doesn't he? Maybe "populist" would be a better way to describe him All I could find is that he supports a public option I may be wrong but isn't Kyle also neutral on the Wall?Frame it within a context that a conservative viewer can consider and potentially agree with. These are some really great arguments I’ve written up for Medicare for all:

1.) Our current healthcare system is estimated to cost 34.6 billion dollars over the course of the next ten years. The Koch brothers study found that under the best case scenario, M4A would cost 32.4 trillion dollars, and at worse 34.4 trillion dollars. Knowing that even under the worse case scenario M4 all would still SAVE money; how can we afford not to do it?

2.) Currently in the United States, 55% of Americans are covered by employer provided healthcare; and in our system the cost of coverage for businesses is highly determined by the size of the business. This of course leads to large expenses on the behalf of businesses, in fact Employers in the this country pay 1.2 trillion dollars annually to cover their employees, which equals the 1.2 trillion dollars the government spends on Medicare and Medicaid combined annually. And most importantly small business are the most affected by excessively high healthcare costs for their employees. A Medicare for all system would eliminate that expense for employers both large and small, and by switching to a single payer model would lower overall healthcare costs. If you want to support small businesses and give them more money to spend on the economy, then how can we not afford to do a Medicare for all system?

3.) Currently, an estimated 30 million Americans are without health insurance in this country since the end of the ACA insurance mandate. And additionally, in the last 2 years of complete conservative control of all branches of government 3 million more Americans were added to that total. This causes an estimated 45,000 deaths a year in this country due to lack of healthcare coverage. A Medicare for all system would cover all Americans with insurance, and would leave intact private supplemental insurance. How would it not benefit the average American and how is it not the right thing to do?
I honestly look at him as a future PresidentAs nice it would be to think this were the case, its purely speculation and conjecture. Even if it was in any way true, there is no way we would ever find out about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Not defending trump, the bombings, or the surrounding debate (which isn't substantive), just saying this type of speculation hurts the leftist and populous cause.Don't get me wrong, I think Sahil Habibi has tons of potential, but virtually everything he's done thus far has been plain cringe.Really? 
I qould have guessed 22-4Exactly. If he is actually only 18 then that's good because he has plenty of time to learn how to do a wuality show, because right now he certainly isn't doing one.We exploit the third world more than any global power.

And our country has committed far more war crimes than many other countries so we have no room to talk.I am 23 years old with only 1 years experience in my industry. One of my coworkers is 62, partisan republican, and refuses to talk any politics with me because every time I body slam his ass with facts. Now he settles for making arbitrary shots at me over the cubicle about the "blue mob" and the republican bomber being a "false flag).

Some people just can't be helped, and deserve to suffer the consequences of their own stupidity.

Whats baffling to me, is he has severe arthritis to the point that even getting up is extremely painful, and he can't afford knee replacements until hes 67 and qualifies for Medicare, YET hes against medicare for all, which would allow him to get them now and not wait 5 years. Baffling folks, just baffling.I am 23 years old with only 1 years experience in my industry.

Baffling folks, just baffling.We'd be more inclined to upvote this if you were to provide the evidence you provided the discord in this post.We should both reform the democratic party and institute a congressional/parliamentary system which actually allows the formation of an effective third party. 

There is no sense in picking one or the other and dedicating all progressive action towards it, many progressives feel one way or the other on this topic so to try and tell them they need to go left or right only goes to split the progressive vote."Literally anywhere" 
So the French Aristocracy of the 18th century could potentially fit the definition?Ben Shapiro. Kyle's popularity would increase tenfold overnight if he debated him. I also think Shapiro is an excellent debater, which would be fun to see Kyle go up against &gt;Ohhhhh ya. He's not taking any PAC money, was very strongly involved in the teachers strikes in WV, strongly opposed to big pharma, and sponsored a bill in the state legislature to legalize medical cannabis.

Apparently he is taking PAC money. [https://votesmart.org/candidate/campaign-finance/147777/richard-ojeda-ii#.W9fV22hKi00](https://votesmart.org/candidate/campaign-finance/147777/richard-ojeda-ii#.W9fV22hKi00)

&amp;#x200B;Same thing with the Styx666 guy. He'll defend Trump no matter what he does Unfortunately with either choice the only ones who really benefit are the businesses. This meme has some real depthI think it also stems from the fact that there are innumerable voters who are so imbibed in the idea of voting blue vs voting red they don't even consider looking into third party candidates; Even when the third party candidate might be for the better policy positions in comparison to the Democrat/Republican. 

But the worst people are the ones who acknowledge that a third parties represents more of their values and positions, but they still vote blue/red anyway. It's pure cognitive dissonance on behalf of serving the "lesser of two evils" which has traditionally always lead to nothing in terms of change.
