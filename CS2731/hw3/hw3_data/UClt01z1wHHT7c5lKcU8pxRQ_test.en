I feel like Chris would probably fall into the same category of armored skeptic that they're kind of pseudo-intellectual in that they are selectively skeptical about what they believe

Edit : especially when it comes to gender identity I think Chris is quick to find an article backing up his belief and that is the only one he will checkHi everyone,

any thoughts on Bomberguys opinions on the prequel trilogy?

Do you agree or disagree?I heard about it on H's video at the end, and it just sounds ridiculous from the name. Someone please explain it to me.So whatever happened to Hbomb's soy diet experiment, was it just a joke or did he actually go through with it? LISTEN. Here are some article's / videos who are already done against Ben Shapiro's claims about Transgender people and data, so if you want to make a video against Ben Shapiro's claims and misinterpretation's about Transgender study's and data, something like 'TRANSGENDERISM: A MEASURED RESPONSE' with the Transgender Flag and a funny head of Ben Shapiro next to the flag as a thumbnail maybe? Like you did with Paul Joseph Watson :D (please o it &lt;3)

There are more Ben Shpairo videos on Transgender people and data than just his 'why arent you 60' video. Knowing you, I think that you will find also more arguments. I hope that these videos and articles are a good help for you to start. Ben Shapiro needs a good take down and rebutal on his claims about transgender people and data. Also his question 'why arent you 60'  is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid. The more accurate comparison would be maturity of someone, you know like foe example 10 year olds which brains are mature faster than others, and have a brain of a 40 year old or the other way around, adults who still have the brain of usually a 5 year old. PLEASE Hbomb i know you can to this, please debunk Ben Shapiro's (and others like steven crowder, black pigeon speaks maybe?) claims about Transgender people and data ONCE AND FOR ALL &lt;333Hey guys, anybody know which video from hbomb had Davis Aurini with that sword he spent way too much money on slicing up melons? That bit kills me but I can't find the video. Thanks!Hbomberguy talks in his video a lot about the problem that being the most efficient way to beat a game implies playing it in a way that it was not intended to. This is an actual huge problem in AI safety and it is considered the major danger in a world full of AIs. It is a very interesting topic, I strongly recommend it.

Knowing you, I think that you will find also more arguments. I hope that these videos and articles are a good help for you to start. Ben Shapiro needs a good take down and rebutal on his claims about transgenders. 

Its important to know that hormone therapy, SRS, FFS (and so on) are mainly to reduce gender dysphoria, not suicidality or at least not mainly suicidality. Ben strawmans the entire topic into that transgender medicine is about to reduce suicidality and suicide attempt rates. Its like you would say that anti depression medicine is to reduce suicidality, which is not. Its to reduce depression. It CAN help (if you are even suicidal), but mainly its to reduce depression. The same for gender dysphoria - its mainly to reduce gender dyhsproia. 

&gt; REDUCING GENDER DYSPHORIA &lt;

That is the entire main purpose behind hormone therapy, SRS, FFS and so on.

Also his question 'why arent you 60'  is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid.

PLEASE Hbomb i know you can to this, please debunk Ben Shapiro's (and others like steven crowder, black pigeon speaks maybe?) claims about Transgender people and data ONCE AND FOR ALL &lt;333Hey, everyone!

I hope I'm not intruding or being rude here, but I've recently started up my own Youtube channel/podcast, and I'm hopeful that you guys will be interested! It's called "Snowflake Rants and Reviews" and it'll be me talking and analyzing important leftist topics and current politics as well as me reviewing movies, tv shows, books, and anime (....mostly anime). The channel is really inspired by people like Contra, PhilosophyTube, Hbomb, Shaun, and Gwen_no_Fear so hopefully you guys will like it! It's still new so there's no much there, but I've got LOADS more planned so more is on the way, I swear! It would mean so much to me if you guys would subscribe and listen to my work and if my channel could become a success so, again, hopefully you guys will enjoy what I'm offering! Thanks in advance! :D

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZEYg6UHXUB1PkLUPi01whAI never realised that Philip E Mason, published chemist, was the one and only thunderf00t! I reviewed this paper in a group meeting back when I was just starting my PhD:
https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2161

Amazed at how small the world can feel sometimes.
his bones look so brittle and like they'd crumble to dust

his eyes seem almost soulless and lack morality

his hairline is that of a balding parliament member from the 1500's

he must spend too much time on his computer

pathetic lolI'm sorta addicted to SLA3. Part analysis of the internet's favorite trash, part sci-fi/horror short film, and somehow everything's connected by a poignant message on dehumanization. Oh, and the giant Loss print, which is something I genuinely want now.

But I need to know what happened to Hareton. Was he resurrected into a new, retconned universe like Ethan? Is the presence of noted freedom fighter Sonic supposed to foreshadow a civil war against game theorists/reviewers? Should we just take the image of Loss giving birth to a naked, glistening Hareton at face value? [1000th sub btw](https://www.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/p/keep-calm-cause-i-am-epic/)I'm not convinced.They both have a fanbase of incel 16 yr old boys.

They're both far right.

They both further the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that is "cultural Marxism"

They both dogwhistle. (I'm not sure if Peterson does it by accident though) 

They both talk about the emancipation of white menFuck all means of subtlety, fuck his life, he should devote his whole entire life arround Divinity Original Sin 2.I bet they people who complained about this game really don't like the borderlands franchise...A conspiracy theory which alleges that the hacked DNC emails revealed a hidden pedophile ring, operating out of the basement of a comet ping pong. The place in question had no basement, but that didn't stop a wannabe vigilante from charging in with a gun and holding them hostage.

The emails themselves are supposed to be suspicious because of references to pizza being excessive or weirdly specific. No real evidence other than the usual chan screenshots.

The truth is, the reference to pizza is about weed, and Clinton and other DNC people come together to chill and relive their college days by sharing a spliff.For laid back, long form video games analysis check out Noah Gervais: https://www.youtube.com/user/broadcaststsaticIn Borderlands you can skip all the cutscenes and go straight to murdering bigoted caricatures of mentally disabled people! Yay! The very thought of this just hurts my soul. I can not stand that idiot. What a foolish, foolish boy.He went on the diet for an extra month I think. He tweeted that he is finishing up the video now so expecting it soon.
https://twitter.com/Hbomberguy/status/958402422673690625Comet pizza is an actual business implicated in the theory. They do have a basement but there's no children down there. It's all bunk. To this day the staff at Comet pizza are harassed by people who believe they are a front for a child sex ring that doesn't exist.Another great video.  Kudos!  Love your shit!Also a large majority of responses in the comments consist of 
"HAHA Beta leftist makes a 30min video when it was just a joke HAHA how sad HAHA"*closes tab*

Oh wait; i need more man pills first!Video on the diet itself is in the works rn! :)Awesome, thanks!please mark shitpostsHow do you do that?#you put a [I'm fucking joking] in the titleFucking commulists always shitposting wrong...BRAIN FORCEI went on a big health kick lately because I scared myself into it and lost pretty much the exact amount of weight that Harris did by just eating more vegetables and cutting down on my carbs. I've since gained back a bit of it, but it did help me to watch what I eat a bit more. And I'm glad I've started to do that before even turning 20. Better than later in life. I think it’s because they’re both liberal leftist CUCKS most likely #makecityairportgreatagainHe talks about how the skeptical community should take a look at nutrition and such instead of just conspiracy theories, which reminded me that [Myles Power](https://www.youtube.com/user/powerm1985/videos) has a quite a few videos related to that, such as on the [Food Babe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ey-nEmfxes&amp;list=PLthPsWmE3ced0theVx7fkvvs5gVuQDDrt) and [GMOs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLthPsWmE3cee4x1DiYKSoJURZBizwa8xt).UpIsNotDown's This Is Why series is overtly inspired by hbomberguy. Do you mean UpIsNotJump?Yeah! My mistake. i'm fucking dying oh my godHe was found guilty and put to trial, absolute BSScotland has a different definition of a hate crime When I said that on Twitter people were madI don't know how anyone could have watched his video and not have perceived it to be a joke it's not at all serious.

This is a very troubling day, I hope people across the political spectrum can agree that this sort of authoritarian shit is not onAm out of the loop, can anyone clue me in? (:He got arrested because he taught his dog how to do the nazi salute and he said a lot of offensive shit It sucks but unfortunately he broke a law the hate speech law the definition of hate speech is different over there and we can’t do anything about it now but hopefully the Uk changes the definition of hate speech in the future for this doesn’t happen again Don't know who he is, though hahahaIf this is actually all it is, yeah, him getting arrested and convicted is BS. If they caught him on actually promoting genocide, then fuck him.Tankies are a goddamn blightThey banned me because I said a CENSORED racial slur in an ANTI-RACIST context.

They proceed to have on their sidebar images of actually racist historical people.

The irony is thick. I would be annoyed that he did this but the music is great he is kinda cute tho...read his tweets.I got beaned, please do an actual skyrim is garbage though. this got me good. I feel bad though because as funny as it is, him being downvoted is ironically because they wanted his actual critique and care for his opinion.

I think I remember him saying that he doesn't want to focus on trans issues as much because he doesn't think he should do that as a cis person himself.  
(From a "I don't want to claim to speak for trans people" perspective, not from a "It doesn't affect me" perspective)
But this is more a matter of information and facts, like he did with SOY and he is not one of the bigger youtubers, he is THE big youtuber to have a good reach. Also I remember him saying that he wants do do a video about race realism and iq lies even though he is not a person of color^^Am trans (though I only speak for myself).

I trust hbomb to make quality debunking content, and I don't mind that he's a cis white guy when talking for a couple of reasons: he's aware of his position and lack of experience; he searches for a trans person's perspective on the matter. It's what we saw on his videos about Bill Nye's show.

For those reasons I trust him. I'm also starving for some hbomberguy content, but thats unrelated I swear.I spoke to several trans persons and pretty much every one of them was in favor of a debunking/rebutal video :-)Okay a few minutes ago i also spoke to a transgender friend of mine (she subscribed Hbomb since 2016) and she said that she really would love it if Hbomb would debunk shapiro's claims, many trans persons are actually just wating for a debunking video! :-)put this in his curiouscat to make sure he sees,Already done it :-)📅 2018-04-24 ⏰ 01:27:44 [(UTC)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180424T012744&amp;p1=1440)

^^• Beep boop I'm a bot • Find out more about me at /r/tweettranscriberbot/ •HONESTLY, I am so absolutely blown away by the whole of this video, I was shocked to see no one was awake in the dead of night to have posted it yet.

Completely incredible.This confirms what I began to suspect after watching Lindsay's Hobbitdoc: we have entered a golden age of Media Analysis Youtube. 

Soon MAY will overtake the media landscape as the dominant form of entertainment, with Contra, Harris, and Linsday as the three gods of the Tribunal Temple. MAY will run out of traditional media to apply critical theory to, and then the MAY-MAY wars will begin. This was a fucking ride. When I started to see the connections he was making between CAD and The Room I about lost my shit. Fucking brilliant. This video is extremely well made but it's genuinely giving me anxiety ;-;This makes me want to get a Loss print for my wallHis comment on The Room suddenly made the whole movie make sense.Youtube masterpiece, this is easily one of the best videos he's ever madeI would kill for hbomb to do an analysis on the Deus Ex franchise.This is a masterpiece, fucking brilliant

I think lefty youtubers could really start to threaten the dominance that the right has had for years on youtube. I think Hbomb is exactly the kind of person that could appeal to the young men that the alt-right recruits. 

After years of observing the right-wing circle jerk that is politics on youtube it's refreshing/therapeutic to see others finally articulating a comprehensive and logical rebuttal. Really gives me hope that whilst right-wing channels are stagnating, these new left leaning people on the scene like Shaun and Contrapoints are only getting more popular. I need help. Please don't down vote the idiot. 

I've never heard of this comic strip he talks about. I've heard of, but never seen, The Room. I've heard of, but never read, Penny Arcade. I don't understand this video at all. I especially didn't understand the Grim Reaper / portal-travel B plot. 

Could someone spell out what's going on here? I'm completely lost.Silly question, what are the user names for those you mentioned? And are there any other good similar media analysis people? I like Hbomberguy and have been looking for more like it. Watching Mr Plinkett is way more entertaining than watching Star Wars prequelsby Lindsay he's taking about Lindsay Ellis. Check out her 3 part analysis on the HobbitThanks! Any other channels you'd recommend? &gt;I've never heard of this comic strip he talks about.    


CAD is pretty close to a generic 'gamer' webcomic as you can get.  I think he was also calling out most 'gamer' webcomics in general for being a mirror of how trash and unhealthy 'Gamer' subculture is.

&gt;I've heard of, but never seen, The Room.

Oh sweet summer child, you are in for a *treat*.  'not'-torrent the Rifftrax commentary for The Room and give it a watch.

It's a movie written, directed, and starring an amateur named Tommy Weisau, he sold the movie as a serious drama, but after the backlash he sells it as a 'black comedy'.  It's glorious and sober words can't do it justice.


&gt;I've heard of, but never read, Penny Arcade. 

It's another 'Gamer' webcomic, it's higher quality than CAD, but has the flaws that the genre has. Atleast it didn't try to have an arc about *miscarriage*.

&gt;I don't understand this video at all. I especially didn't understand the Grim Reaper / portal-travel B plot

I'm not sure myself.  Part of me thinks it was used to give his commentary some time to rest and to pull everything together when he compares The Room's meta-narritive to CAD's reflection on 'Gamer' culture.&gt; I especially didn't understand the Grim Reaper / portal-travel B plot.

i *think* it's supposed to represent an* individual resisting self-awareness.

this video is all about becoming aware not just of surface-level problems in gaming culture, but *systemic* problems in gaming culture and the economic principles that* provide it with media. however, in many gamers there is this resistance to treating games as anything other than warm, indulgent entertainment. that resistance comes from some part of the mind that doesn't want to admit that maybe the media they consume is problematic. in order to avoid the guilt, they reject the idea that there is anything wrong and project the problems onto specific people (in hbomb's assertion, this is Tim Buckley) so they can ignore that it's a system problem instead of simply one untalented hack.

the hooded figure represents this resistance by trying to kill the character who is questioning these things and beginning to ask deeper questions.easily his best video. funny, entertaining, incredibly smart, along with great music and visuals, he’s killing it!It was the short one answering Pyjama Watson's response to the Measured Response. Davis left a comment on the main Measured Response vid so hbomb took the piss for a bitThe "Nice try paul" one? I just watched that and didn't see it. Did he do another one maybe?
NVM, it was the Aftermath one, preciate it!I've begun watching Harris after Mitch L's response to the DS2 video, and I really enjoy his videos. His range of analysis, commentary, and silly content is very entertaining.Combine Skyrims combat with morrowinds story/world and you would have a great game, which some are actually working on.I have already posted several of such videos and articles against Ben Shapiro :-) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/hbomberguy/comments/8c2fpi/hbomberguy_should_debunk_ben_shapiros_claims/

https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/8c2zwd/hbomberguy_andor_contra_should_debunk_ben/

I really hope that Hbomberguy will do a good debunking video of the nonsense of Ben Shapiro's claims about transgender people and data. We really need this.Great video, well argued and historically interesting.  Adding to this, will we be getting some other lefty youtubers such as Three Arrows and Thom Avella?If you visit the sub you’ll see I have a list of recommended channels that includes both those guys.do you just want media analysis or leftist video essays in general?

if media analysis, Innuendo Studios and Dan Olsen are both really good.

Otherwise, Contra Points, Three ArrowsMust be a different one. It’s unlikely Thunderf00t would have anything published without inserting some complaint about Anita Sarkeesian in there. I thought the same but his face is on the Wikipedia page with the paper in the citations, aaaaaaaaand his face is on his staff page at the Czech institute for science. Hate crimes are hate crimes. I don't like thought police (or any police) but I really don't like hate crimes.

Yes, it was a joke, but it was also a hate crime. I don't know why he's being such an indignant cunt about it. No remorse, no attempt to empathise or communicate with those he offended. Dudes a class-a cunt, and I don't give a shit about cunts.The reason it's so fucked up is basically none of his audience understand why racial discrimination is a bad thing. If you've got a huge audience you have a responsibility not to poison their minds with horrible shit like that. He's asked his fans to pay his fine, and they have done that. (he's probably getting rich of the amount of ads viewed on his channel recently too.) Guy got a get out of jail free card, Is currently getting paid for making a spectacle out of a crime he committed and hasn't shown anything but arrogance and indignation. He doesn't care that his supporters are 4chan kekistan incel subhuman filth.I hate it when smart people are arseholes. Like, dude you've got such a big brain, surely there's room for some rational opinions on gender politics in there.This is a lot more common than you'd think, at least in my experience. While the vast majority of scientists are reasonable, level-headed, normal folk, there are a surprising number who know very little about anything **but** their field of study. Leads to some unusual and kind of uncomfortable conversations.This is a great article, I wish I'd seen it sooner.

Thanks for sharing! No problem :-)Found older versions of it:

To be honest, it wasn't undeserved.I'm a huge MATN fan, so I'm biased; but I think he made some excellent points.

FO3 has a lot to offer that make it a really good game, but lots of the issues that HBomb talked about weren't addressed.

I personally enjoy the game, but I think that, as HBomb said, it takes a certain kind of person. Maybe to him, a good game is defined by what most players do and how it guides them, but as a FO enthusiast, it's about the exploration for people like me and MATN.

Ultimately, FO3, just like any game, is one man's trash and another's treasure. Similar to what MATN said, if you play it like an FPS, that's what you'll get and miss out on lots of quests and features; for those who are struck by the world and really want to explore, it's a masterpiece.I think it was a good video. Defending F3 nowadays isn't a popular position and MATN did a good job at laying out his argument. I did have a few problems though:

\-The video's goal was to debate common arguments against F3. That's not unreasonable, but MATN routinely grouped up general arguments against F3 in a way that made other\-wise reasonable critiques seem silly or hypocritical. For example, he would take arguments from someone comparing F3 to F1/2 and say "well New Vegas did that" and vice versa. Although I doubt he did so intentionally, it's still obfuscating valid criticism.

\-He rarely considers significant counter\-arguments and talks\-passed a lot of obvious flaws. MATN brought up the two games' main quests and didn't spend a single word talking about the Enclave's motivations. I'd be willing to bet that was because it was *inconvenient* to his "Fallout 3 really does have grey morality, guys!" argument.

\-I think every instance of MATN addressing Hbomberguy's video is an example of either, or both, the above points. I don't think MATN's video should be considered a direct response to Hbg.

Again, I did like most of the video. In fact, I'll probably play through F3 again because of it. However, it seems like certain arguments were made in bad faith. I wouldn't consider it a balanced take.It is definitely not in Eric Taxxon's albumThis is some pretty lazy trolling tbh, might want to step up your game.hbomber guy makes pretty lazy videos soJust the right amount of irony for a one-line poem:

"pathetic lol" said the reddit troll.butthurt fan of a man who couldnt lift a 10 pound weight"attention please," implying uneaseYou see, the version of him that you view is but a meek skin projected on to Type - 82 Lens that allow split video, which is compatible with YouTube's e685T-RWQ playback script which works as a translator so the split junction can be compatible for any type of monitor regardless of what you use, what you see is a frail little soy boy because the perception filter allows you to see the frail little soy boy in his weakest form. Right click the video and click "inspect element", ctrl f to locate playback ID=?e625T-RWQ and replace it with playback ID=?disable_e685T

An easier method is to find a blank YouTube page script and copy that into the playback ID location while keeping all the other variables open to conforming to the actual request of the YouTube video you want to watch, and insert the script in Greasemonkey. Video pages will take a second longer to load, but trust me, you will never see youtubers the same way again.

Fair warning, while H3h3 and Erik Salvia may look normal, hbomberguy, Jacksfilms, Shane Dawson, Captain Disillusion will never make you see the world the same way again. That's just a short list. There's plenty more. Smoke some weed so you don't dream well.

If you can't achieve this, well, I can help paint a picture for you. The closest imaginable thing you can get to what he looks like is akin to an 8 year old's drawing of bara sonic making out furiously with ultra bara Goku, except bulging eyes protrude from the skin in every inch of the surface and green liquidy thick lube dribbles out or every orifice, there's at least 7 horns glowing upon the heads and 3 mouths speaking so loudly you develop a bit of a migraine, but your animals run to the end of the house demanding exit. Every second of your it life goes darker and darker in every fleeting moment as you stare into the dark soulful eyes of the miraculous beast that swims every second of its day in original sin, listening to the music of the damned voices lulling him to sleep every night. Every subtle muscle twitch pangs the waves of radio frequency and the particles vibrate in worship and form, but where is the hamburger you say? Where are the pickles? Where are they, Harry? When will you give them to us? When will you free my spirit into your eternally loving void of teeth? Nay, every atom had begun to invert, energy warped inside out only for a fraction of a nanosecond, yet it seemed like forever. All of your memories become scattered, you realize you never meant anything wrong you ever did. You don't even know what is wrong. What is right? Is it the warmth from a freshly baked hamburger, or is it the hot fleshy squishyness of a new victims dead corpse? Is it cold? The cold hatred that lies at the bottom of a heart? But hearts are warm, you thought. You pick a hamburger from the vesticles wriggling about from Harry's deliciously alpha buff body, He tells you to hold it close. You do. The hamburger screams, the sins of your past floods past each memory of your mind, and you find yourself falling to the knees of the God before you, pleaing for it to stop. He tells you to eat it. Even though you don't want to, you obey, and as your teeth clech through the mushy sandwich of meat you realize you behold all love in the universe, you are God, you are One.

You have reached enlightenment.

I give you a hamburger.Probably all the soy!!!!!!!!!

DONT BE FOOLED BY HIS SOCIALIST PROPAGANDA, PEOPLE!

https://www.infowarsstore.com/brain-force.htmlwhat if he consumes soy to balance all the good stuff :thinking:It is in one of them. It’s called the art state and is called ‘head’I’m pretty sure that thanos isn’t a fascist. He specifies that he doesn’t discriminate in his genocide, and I’m pretty sure he’s just characterised as an idealistic psychopath. He definitely isn’t fascist in the comics I’ve read either (that infinity gauntlet comic(1990-something and the prelude)Holy shit thank you so muchI think the symbolism is clear. Hareton Splimby is infact, The miscarried baby of Loss.Tbh, I didn't like his pug joke, and most of his political jokes are mediocre.

But arresting someone over a joke, even if offensive,  is petty and a waste of the police's time, who could be arresting 'actual' criminals.honestly it's all quite poetic, I'm very drawn to the whole comment and the way it's layed out

the repetition of 'his', the nice odd number of lines getting shorter... beautiful 

the only thing that's distressing is the apostrophe in "1500s", not just because I'm being pedantic but also i somewhat subscribe to the Cormac MacCarthy opinion that apostrophes are messy lookingHad to stop watching, that dutch angle was making me feel nauseous. Having PTSD from Thor 1. I agree, I understand it could be taken as offensive by some people, but an arrest is overkill.One without axe:https://youtu.be/LqYgjGDaMYg?t=1184
same but with no context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GgrhqxX-j0I upvoted it because it looks like the kind of poem hbomb would write to make fun of himself. Good thinking. What H.Bomb needs to counteract the soy........is more soyThe issue there, really. Is that for the most part Chris Ray Gun is just a comedian. Armored Skeptic likes to put himself forward as a political figure with opinions that matter whilst Chris just shitposts half the timeand so the fallout community goes back to thinking fallout 3 is great because a youtuber said its okayFucking beautiful I also tried to draw Contra a while back but it didn't turn out that wellIf anyone has re-checked the video, he has renamed the video to CTRL+ALT+DEL | SLA:3 (too many downvotes due to click bait?).

I liked this analysis of The Room but I'm not too sure how to connects to CAD. In comparing CAD and PA, yeah I always thought they were quite similar in terms of lol random violence but Buckley is almost universally hated cause of "lazy" artwork (despite being quite a good artist) and the miscarriage story line. Big win for the marketplace of ideasIf you're jonesing for that kind of content I think Shaun has a video on him.Not jonesing lol, just wondering i guess.Fair enough. Still, I think the Shaun video was good. Didn't treat him with Sargon levels of contempt but clearly pointed out the flaws in his reasoning while maintaining a feeling of goodwill.Cause sargon is a cunt lolSargon "I wouldn't even rape you" of Akkad is a bad guy?

HE'S BACK, BOYSThe entire 33 minute video started out as an intro for another video lolAnother fantastic video. I’m a massive (...ly critical) Lovecraft fan too, but I never quite made the connection between existential and personal alienation the way that’s laid out here. Like all great ideas it ofc comes across as really obvious now that I’ve had it explained to me. 

I wonder if my comparative privilege had something to do with my different experience w Lovecraft - I obviously grew up enough to recognize that a stories where part of the horror is all the *Italians* MIGHT have been influenced by bigotry, but because I don’t face bigotry myself, never experienced the sort of thematic crossover HBomberGuy describes powerfully here.Wait why are they ferretsHarris’ fursona is a ferret. This is canon.I love everything about thisSOY BOY!

"balding parliament member from the 1500's" 
that is funnyDoes anyone besides Hbomb even pay attention to Aurini? I feel like he's the only fanI just did for a week straight and I feel dead inside.He's like watching a terrible accident. I was overwhelmed with dread and anxiety but I just couldn't look away for the life of me.It is pretty fascinating to see just how idiotic one person can get. What I found most interesting about climbing down the Aurini hole was how desensitized I became. When I work on a video that requires me to to watch a lot of footage I'll put on an album or play a game that has a slower pace. Everytime I hear something I need to come back to I'll write a time stamp down in a notebook. With him he's constantly one upping himself in shitty stuff he's saying so after a while I kept waiting for "the really bad stuff" but it's all the really bad stuff.You should crosspost this to /r/BreadTubeI had no idea that sub existed! Just posted it there!My ex showed me some of his videos back in 2013 when we were going through our LaVeyan satanism phase honestly I can't remember if it seemed sane back then either."I have no problem with white nationalists on paper."They're terrible, boring, confusing movies. There are definitely cool ideas hidden in there, but they're obfuscated by bad dialogue and odd performances. I think it's neat that Hbomb sees something cool in them, I think they're shite though.  I never cared a whole lot for episode 1 but as a kid I adored 2&amp;3 as much as the originals. Then grew up a little and at some point watched parts and didn’t like them. Then like a year ago? I rewatched 2&amp;3 and it ranged from didn’t care to annoyed. Like near the end of 3 it was too much lightsaber and I got a headache and started to build lego and had it on as background noise. 

I mean there are a lot of good ideas hidden in them just not well done at all imo. 

Even though I’d probably disagree with him I want him to eventually make a video on them. Because he will probably go way in depth and also explain on an emotional level how they make him feel. Because like often when I see people defend them it’s just I enjoy them or it’s more weaker reasons like these three scenes were cool or lightsaber fights. 

Like when I watch the originals or the two sequels I feel emotions. When I watch the prequels I feel nothing or I’m irritated. 

It’s weird though I like most stuff around the prequels just not the actual movies. Like for whatever reason I enjoy learning about the planets, weapons, gear, variants of clones their stories like all that stuff. I think the broad plot outline is actually fairly compelling.  A Sith master infiltrates politics, plays both sides of a 'war' to gain power, converts a young ambitious Jedi by using his passions against him, and ultimately turns the Republic into the Empire undetected.  Everything else is terrible, though; the characters, the pacing, the dialogue, the acting, the action scenes with no stakes, the overly-CGI'd world that feels sterile.   This actually made me burst out laughing:D well put.Could you link the responses to them?I know about Shaun’s massive fuckup and watched the TL:DR, despite his obnoxious voice. I remember watching Shaun’s video and found his decision to just not read the book rather head scratching. I don't know anything about the thing with Shaun, but I just rewatched Hbomb's soy boy videos a few days ago, and he didn't bring up cancer because it is irrelevant to the topic. Cancer has nothing to do with the claim that soy makes people feminine, so there was no reason to put in the video.Maybe don't get all your news and opinions from YouTube? You sound like you put waaaaaaay to much stock in internet personalities. He basically discredits the entire bodybuilding community and their concerns about Soy  proteins despite the fact that it causes a quite elevated risk of cancer. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXjk0pnCs4c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXjk0pnCs4c)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqnsHXh8o94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqnsHXh8o94)

In the description of the second video you'll find a link to Shaun's video, which as far as I can tell has been unlisted. I actually think this is worse than PJW saying 'it's just a meme' when referring to the Soyboy issue. The community that calls the 'skeptic' YouTubers out for their mistakes is apparently unwilling to own up to theirs. Yeah, stuff like this convinces me that nobody can ever be correct about a large majority of issues. For every video where Sargon is whining about some inconsequential Twitter BS there's some where he'll talk about something extremely important like the British government/entertainment industry paedophilia scandal, or about how Theresa May is ruining Brexit no matter whether you're a remainer or a brexiteer. For every video where Shaun or Hbomber just forget to read a book, there's a video about why PJW is intellectually dishonest or one where Skeptic completely fails at being a Skeptic. I get most of my 'news' from the BBC. It's the most unbiased news source I can find, yet there are still huge problems with it. The BBC is slightly left leaning when it comes to opinions, and I would never want to delve into the cancerous American news industry which is basically just lies, lies and 11-person panel debates where everyone yells at each other.The fact that you typed "news" in quotes tells me you don't actually know what you are talking about. Just because you only know the stereotype doesn't mean you actually know anything about the American media news landscape. It isn't all like that at all and your hyperbole just makes you sound like a jackass.Skepticism is good whether you’re dealing with a hbomberguy or an armored skeptic. However I think someone like hbomberguy deserves more benefit of the doubt because he’s been consistently well argued and well sourced, unlike your sargons or your skeptics.  Well sourced, yes. He uses more data. I wouldn't say well argued, since sometimes he can be just as intellectually lazy as those he criticises. And people assume that just because he can make a great video about Sherlock his Dark Souls 2 video will be just as good and well argued.

I think a lot of people assume their side is the one with the complete and total desire for reasoned debate when really they just want to own the libs or own the cons. The central premise of his anti-feminism video pretty much rests on 'Sargon said \*survey\* in a dismissive tone, and then used another survey to prove the other survey wrong, thus disproving his own argument'. He then shows the data that Sargon missed in the second survey about unreported sexual assault for about 0.5 seconds, so for all the audience knows there was hardly any, or an insignificant amount. He cares more about trying to pwn Sargon for missing something than the actual TRUTH of which survey has a larger sample size, better methodology, can be applied more successfully to the wider population etc. Now I don't know which survey is actually more valid because neither of these dudes have given me the whole picture.With the BBC there's always a very clear divide between breaking news, the pure facts of the case (or at least as much objectivity as possible) and the opinionated articles and pieces. . There are no 'shows' where the anchors start railing on a certain topic with very little pushback.  We have talk shows for that. When interviewing opinionated people the anchors have a duty to push back.  Tucker Carlson or Brian Stelter wouldn't be able to get away with jerking off all the guests they agree with here, at least on the BBC. The fact that you don't understand the difference between news and analysis makes you sound like a twat. &gt; He basically discredits the entire bodybuilding community and their concerns about Soy proteins despite the fact that it causes a quite elevated risk of cancer.

"that fact that soy causes cancer" that's a very strong statement, you have a source there my dude? because all i can find is [this study linking soy consumption with the 'activation' of genes associated with cancer growth](https://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/soy-may-turn-on-genes-linked-to-cancer) in women who have already been diagnosed with stage 1 and stage 2 breast cancer.

conversely, the [shanghai women's health study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16236996) consisting of 75,000 participants who consume, on average, 140+ grams of soy a day - 3 times the amount as the previous study - [seems to show no correlation](https://blog.dana-farber.org/insight/2018/01/soy-breast-cancer-connection/), though you would expect one at consumption levels that high, wouldn't you? i'd question that considering soy has been a staple food item in asia for literally millennia, why aren't their cancer rates demonstrably higher?&gt; For every video where Shaun or Hbomber just forget to read a book, there's a video about why PJW is intellectually dishonest or one where Skeptic completely fails at being a Skeptic.

i was interested in this thread initially since i'd never heard of this business with shaun claiming to read a book or hbomberguy being "wrong from beginning to end" on the idiot soy subject, but now i no longer think you are acting in good faith or are even equipped to, like, *think* about these things. "For every video where Shaun or Hbomber just forget to read a book" - ok, so, one? i've never seen that shaun video before and i think founding an argument on your *assumptions* about a book you never read is pretty retarded, but this wasn't deliberate concealment. he literally says "now, i never read this book, however.." i'm also unaware of any similar 'scandals' with hbomberguy.

equivocating this with the abject fucking stupidity of sargon or deliberate dishonesty of paul joseph watson can't really be something you believe, right? i've listened to sargon debate a shit-tier communist and *lose*, insist in another debate that just getting married would solve all the black community's problems because he is *incapable* of understanding the difference between correlation and causation, join the ukip party to prove to the world how centrist he is. these people are fucking **morons**.In response to that I’d say 2 thing. First the videos are made to entertain people as well as educate people and some good ol fashion pwnage is a good way to do both. Secondly, I think the goal of these videos is to convince neutral parties and the fans of those people to defect. Challenging the credibility of Sargon and PJW is the best way to do that. So basically you're saying that the means justify the end. If this side could very possibly turn out to be wrong on the facts, what is the *point* of engaging in sneaky tactics and 'pwnage'? If you're just in it to enjoy some YouTube drama that's one thing, but we all know it isn't. It's about Harris trying to advance his political ideology, just as Sargon is.Lol you think Tucker Carlson is a good indicator of what news is like here? You clearly only know Fox News. Ever read a newspaper? You are so obtuse I bet you didn't even think I would be talking about more than tv news. Don't be such an ignorant rube.No one cares what a bunch of ignorant sweaty chuds think. Y'all put way too much stock pseudoscience. Why don't you go jerk it to Joe Rogan or something?You are throwing out any and all context. Sargon's political ideology includes discriminating against people like me. Harris isn't trying to do anything close as disgusting as the ideology Sargon is pushing. Maybe don't boil everything down to these tiny meaningless statements? Grow up and see the bigger picture.I'm not having a go at you, but I never said 'Soy causes cancer'. As you demonstrated that's a false statement. What's not a false statement is that in the context of bodybuilding, Soy protein does elevate cancer risk. I have no idea what kind of chemical process they use to make this stuff (I don't even lift bro) but clearly it's bad soy and not good soy. The point is, if there was some bodybuilder watching Hbomber he might leave with the false impression that it's totally fine for him to keep consuming Soy protein because all concerns were dismissed in his video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOMJLAq0r2w

Sorry for making you sit through this video. Yeah but his political ideology is more nuanced, better thought out, and backed by academic sources. Those tactics you consider so menial are classic tools of rhetoric.  Sure he commits character assassination but said attacks come with evidence backing up those attacks. Theyre targeted for legitimate problems and lies they tell. I hope you become less intolerant one day. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOMJLAq0r2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOMJLAq0r2w) \&gt; but now I no longer think you are acting in good faith or are even equipped to, like, *think* about these things

What's with the character assassination? This just makes you seem irrationally hostile.

\&gt; but this wasn't deliberate concealment 

How is hiding a video where you fucked up HUGELY and not owning up to your mistake not a deliberate concealment? 

\&gt; i'm also unaware of any similar 'scandals' with hbomberguy.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uISGGCB5LbM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uISGGCB5LbM)

I'm prepared to be put on full blast for even daring to watch your political opponents' video. 

\&gt; equivocating this with the abject fucking stupidity of sargon or deliberate dishonesty of paul joseph watson can't really be something you believe, right?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t26AjrVk80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t26AjrVk80) 

Yeah yeah, I know, he's pretentious and drunk. Just watch from 10 minutes to about 12 minutes in his video about buzzwords. Harris destroys his own argument in seconds. I'd say that's pretty close to 'abject fucking stupidity'. Except I don't think either Sargon and co or Hbomber and co are stupid. 

Harris makes more entertaining and witty content, but ultimately both are blinded by ideology. You're the one asserting that your enemies are either dumb or malicious. I wasn't 'converted' to the 'free thinking' side of YouTube, I was converted away from heavy ideological bias, on both sides. 

\&gt; i've listened to sargon debate a shit-tier communist and *lose*

Well, he won the debate with Destiny and that dude from Mythcon. He lost to Kristi Winters and whoever you're talking about there. He chimped out when faced with Richard Spencer's smugness but ultimately had him talking about a 'warrior guardian Elite' and an 'ethnostate in space' so I think we can say which side won that debate. They really don't conclusively prove much since response videos (when done honestly and without deception) can get at the heart of the matter much more accurately and all facts can be explored. I haven't seen Hbomber debate anyone (I'm fairly certain Shaun has) but everyone looks worse when they can do away with the slick editing and don't have unlimited time to make their points.

\&gt; insist in another debate that just getting married would solve all the black community's problems because he is *incapable* of understanding the difference between correlation and causation

What would be your explanation? I haven't seen any 'free thinker' videos on this yet, but if you could sum up their positions on it? Because the single act of marriage is clearly not going to fix the back community. 

\&gt; join the ukip party to prove to the world how centrist he is 

No arguments there. That's a solid fail for Carl. All I want to persuade you of is that both sides are wrong a lot of the time. Surely you can see that me being someone who used to believe the 'skeptics' were right about most things and had their ideas changed, I have a perspective when it comes to those on the other side of the coin. That despite their allure they're probably wrong about a lot too. Ultimately I get the impression that emotions run too high on both the left and right for any 'perfect response video' devoid of dishonesty or logical failure to exist, yet. 

I hope you've noticed that I haven't been defending Paul Joseph Watson. He's a snake oil salesman and thus clearly worse than anyone else I've discussed. Also his videos are shite.I hope you grow the fuck up one day (ps vegan gains is trash)In what way does his ideology discriminate against you? I'm not being sarcastic when I say I'm curious to hear the answer.Do you not see the trans in my user name? Take a guessHere's my problem. If someone's being deliberately shady in regards to a product, like PJW or Alex Jones trying to sell you their snake oil, then by definition a character assassination is what you have to do.

When you have no proof of intellectual dishonesty and your accusation is that someone is just being stupid or doesn't have the right reasoning, attacking their character isn't really warranted. It's not useful and it just serves to beat the drum for the progressive side instead of trying to actually persuade right wingers. If you want to make the argument that perhaps Harris can do this in the political sphere because there is money to be made (Patreon) and real consequences (UKIP) then you have to explain why he was so smug and rude to critics of Dark Souls 2 in his video. It's like he can't help himself. So you just ignored the fact that I said Brian Stelter. You completely ignored it. The whole point of my original post is to point out how your side is also guilty of intellectual dishonesty. Thankyou for proving my point, dumbass. 

I obviously read online newspapers, genius. I'd even go as far as to admit that the Daily Mail, a British paper, is worse than anything you have over there in America. I hope that soothes the feelings I hurt when I said that the BBC is more impartial than everything on US news.Moot point. Turns out I didn't. What did he say that discriminates? Again, I actually want to find out, I'm not being a dick here.I'm not even a bodybuilder and that is the first and only vegan gains video I'll ever watch. 

I hope you drop the negative attitude one day.Do you know anything about the political right? I'm not gonna do your research for you. I have no need to prove anything to you. Maybe don't be so lazy?Says the guy who started off this whole post with negativity. Ok bud.You're lumping every single person right of centre together, declaring them all to have the same beliefs and then calling me lazy? The sheer irony. 

If you were to say 99% of discrimination against trans people in America comes from self-described Republicans I would totally believe that. Yet you judging all of your political opponents without hearing what they have to say is just not intellectually honest. 

Unlike you, I actually took the time to find something. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiWl_doVaTM 

And in this video he says the problem is that opportunists who aren't trans will enter bathrooms and sexually harass and spy on people in there by pretending to be trans. He doesn't ever blame trans people. 

Yet a counter argument would be that the right wing community beat this drum so hard that nobody would have known about it otherwise, and the perverts would therefore not exist. Although there have been cases there aren't any studies about frequency of offences and how much of a problem (or lack thereof) there actually is. Additionally I go to a University with gender neutral bathrooms and all you need to stop creepers is a sufficiently designed cubicle system. I actually prefer them to normal bathrooms since urinals are a terrible idea.

Don't call me lazy. True scepticism means not treating your ideological opponents as wrong and evil by default. Hbomberguy isn't evil. Sargon isn't evil.
I’m not trying to say that response videos are inherently perfect or that Hbomberguy is a saint. Response videos inherently have problems related to their direct and specific nature. 

However when it comes to showing someone else your point of view the best way is to discredit someone’s main source, like Sargon or pjw. 

It worked on me. Only when I was shown my go to sources were wrong or misguided did I realize I was wrong. Harry had a major roll in that and, while he’s not always right, comparing him to pjw or Sargon is unfair.It's not negative to say that both sides are wrong. I'd argue that moving away from political content will make people happier and less trigger happy. I certainly wouldn't react like that if someone sent me a Vegan Gains video, as if he were a literal Nazi or something. Lol u mad? You def have a tiny ego and need to prove yourself. Way to prove you are super fragile ♥️ 

The argument Sargon uses is a false narrative used to harass real trans people. There are pretty much zero instances of that really happening. If you were really politicaly aware you would know that is a common way to harass trans people and not at all a real concern. More Republicans get caught in bathrooms doing shady shit than trans people. Sargon is pushing a total lie to hurt tans people and your ignorant ass doesn't even notice. You have your head too far up your own ass to care or learn. You are just a fool trying to prove he isn't.

Just because you go to a university with gender neutral bathrooms doesn't mean shit. Like wtf? Are you bragging? You have incredibly naive. For real, you have no idea what you are blathering on about in attempt to prove you aren't stupid, but all you are doing is putting your ignorance on display. Grats ~I didn't I just said he was trash. You really like to twist words and just straight up lie, don't you? Well we are done here. I don't like arguing in bad faith. Get fuckedComparing Sargon to PJW is unfair, tbh. Anyway that is a good point, I just have to say that Hbomb doesn't really open himself up to criticism in the same way that Sargon does. While Sargon seems to make a lot of videos asserting his ideas, principles, etc, Hbomb doesn't really do the same in the political sphere. He does with other topics though. So I'd like him to just make a video laying out all of his ideas and see what people make of it.Another happy little soldier of tribalism. One day you'll realise that all this pavlovian conditioning to hate those evil enemies on the other side was pointless. It just made you angry, spiteful and hateful. 

(PS: on the other comment you made, you said I had a tiny ego. The actual insult would be telling me that I have a huge ego. Thanks for the complement about me being a well rounded individual in control of my emotions though).Hey answer my other comment where you clearly don't understand the modern political landscape and defend a bigot named Sargon . Coward taking pot shots while ignoring the larger ideas over here.How is Sargon not a bigot pushing a false narrative? How are you not a bigot for blindly pushing this narrative? You won't answer the real shit, fucking coward. 

But yeah, muh tribalism is the problem /sI never watched his dark souls 2 video so I’ll take your word for it. I’ll admit that can be very condescending and uncompromising about his criticisms. I personally prefer Contrapoints because Natalie avoids a lot of the smug condescension that comes with harry or even Sean. 

However I think some of that condescension is part of the hbomberguy persona and relates to his targets, alphas, alt righters, etc. they’re people difficult to not condescend to. You know that assaults have happened due to this law right? Saying otherwise is fake news. All you did was assert a bunch of things with no evidence. You have to provide evidence for your claims. The evidence of the assault is in the video I linked.I agree with the last paragraph. Especially PJW since he puts on a persona to attack progressives in his videos. I guess everyone has personality problems in some fashion. but if Hbomber could reserve the smug for people who deserve it, I feel like he'd be on 500k subs right now.Says the guy who doesn't provide evidence that there are assaults. Do you even listen to yourself? The burden of proof is on you to prove the positive not me to prove the negative. Read some real skeptics and read Bertrand Russell's teapot theory. Maybe your illiterate ass can find a YouTube vid on it. Learn some real skepticism and science. You don't know shit about the scientific methodThat’s fair. I get the sense that he’s smarter then your average person, his blood borne is fascinating in a way that I haven’t seen before, but that makes it harder to be understanding towards others. Though that is an astonishingly level of conjecture on my part https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/06/u-of-t-bathrooms-voyeurism_n_8253970.html?guccounter=1

He definitely is, then again Thunderfoot probably has a higher IQ than most YouTubers but his antifeminism videos are EXTREMELY bad. Honestly Hbomber makes more interesting videos than most YouTubers, so even if he was wrong about everything he'd still grow his channel a lot.So because of a single article, trans people shouldn't get to use their preferred bathroom? What are you saying? Trans people should be discriminated against because some people are evil? What are you even suggesting? Even if trans protections happen there will still be creeps out there. Do you think I should have to go into the men's room when I look like a woman? You don't think that is dangerous for me? Should transmen be forced into the women's restroom? I don't think you have thought this through at all. I strongly suspect you are transphoic if none of this is familiar to you. You don't even know the basics of what you are arguing probably, just defending Sargon because of your tribalistic loyalty

Also lol, you think a single outdated article proves your point. Way to prove your ignorance again.So your premises are 1) Hbomb made a video about soy and testosterone/sperm count and didn't spend enough time talking about cancer, and 2) Shaun messed up and made a bad video he had to delete.  Your conclusion is 3) "These guys are just as wrong as everyone else usually is" and "every political YouTuber is just flat out wrong about at least half their content."

I think that's a terrible argument, I don't know how else to put it.

&gt; It's all about emotion and it always has been.

I'd wager you like the emotions associated with the thought that you've out-skeptic'd the rest of the field.  Could be wrong of course, just the sense that I get, but maybe being overly dismissive is just as bad as being overly credulous.Then we generally agree. I’m not sure what to say beyond that. lmao I don't even agree with Sargon. FFS. I just don't think he hates trans people. When I said that I had gender neutral bathrooms in my University, if I really hated the idea that much I'd use the bathrooms that haven't been converted yet. Okay, I should have made my point better. There are tons more issues with the Soy video, the point is that the most serious health issue on there (because soy doesn't turn you into a girl, and therefore hormone disruption isn't the biggest issue) was completely dismissed by painting bodybuilders as a bunch of meatheads who don't know anything. The fact is that Soy protein (not the stuff people consume in Asia, what bodybuilders have) does elevate cancer risk. Basically the point is that even when Hbomb can prove someone so dramatically wrong, he himself can also be almost as misleading and incorrect on important issues. 

With Shaun he never owned up to the video, and the error he made was huge. Worse than anything Armoured Skeptic has done, I'd argue. I'm sure you know all about the things that skeptic YouTubers have got wrong, but Hbomb's video about Buzzwords takes seconds to debunk because he missed a crucial thing - the 'free thinker' uses buzzwords just as much as the skeptics (or whatever they're called nowadays). For example, he listed SJW and anti-GG as 'reactionary buzzwords' completely failing to see that in order for these to be buzzwords on the right, their opposite components (anti-SJW and GG) have to be buzzwords on the left.



&gt; I'd wager you like the emotions associated with the thought that you've out-skeptic'd the rest of the field. 

If I made a video about anything political I bet it would have more mistakes than a No Bullshit video. It's certainly possible for someone to make a video debunking EVERYTHING in a video and being almost 100% correct but that ends up creating a huge change of response videos where every video is longer than the last. I love the channel Mauler93 but his response to Hbomb's dark souls 2 video is like 10 hours long. I mean Jesus Christ, imagine that happening with political content.

I haven't watched every single right wing or left wing video so I can't say which side definitively makes more errors, but when both can be wrong in such important ways I find it hard to even care about politics other than the purely emotional stuff with no reason behind it. 
I appreciate you putting together a response.  Ultimately my goal is not to defend Shaun and Hbomb to the death, since I respect them for the views they hold rather than the people they are.  Here's why I think there's a real difference between rightist and leftist youtubers, and why I think equivocating between the two is inappropriate.

Rightist youtubers, whom I would call 'status-quo warriors', are in the business of making complicated situations seem simple.  I think the social situation of women, for example, is fairly complicated.  Women have equal standing before the law, yet social forces often act against them in subtle and hard-to-detect ways.  If women speak out about this, should we attempt to understand and discover the nuances of what it means to be a woman in American society?  Or should we pound the drum about how any such complaints must just be thin skin, because look women have the right to vote.  Rightist youtubers, typically the "skeptic" community (I think they've desecrated the word 'skeptic', honestly), would tilt hard to the latter.

Leftist youtubers are generally attempting to demonstrate how situations that may seem simple are actually more complicated.  So while soy may have certain attributes that justify a categorization close to 'estrogen' (phytoestrogen), they nevertheless do not actually disrupt the hormone production of the human body.  This is an attempt to move from the simple (estrogen=woman) to the more sophisticated (hey maybe there are multiple uses of the root 'estrogen').  This is a single example, of course, but it falls within a larger pattern.

I suggest to you that if you investigate both sides, you will find the right consistently over-simplifying issues, and the left attempting to counter-balance this over-simplification.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but this is why I don't think mere equivocation is justified.  And again I would stress that being overly dismissive is as bad as being overly credulous, so be wary of both extremes. I appreciate your response to my response. First I'd say that most of these right leaning YouTubers steer well clear of the label 'skeptic 'now. We all know about Armoured Skeptic of course, dear god is that man a buffoon. There's also the fact that the rightists have gone through a period of agreeing pretty much 100% with each other to the point where they're now very disparate. Thunderfoot and Sargon had a huge flame war, Armoured Skeptic seems to be transitioning to some sort of Chris Ray Gun clone and TJ Kirk's channel is dead. Of course there's loads more to talk about but those are some of the largest ones. I'm not saying that'll happen with the leftist community.....who I am I kidding, it definitely will happen at some point. If they can manage to sort out disagreements civilly, then fair play, but after that you're not going to get three of them collabing on taking down Jordan Peterson. It's an inevitable consequence of echo chambers developing and can't really be helped.

As to your main point about the differences between the two sides, I'd say you're right, at least with most of them. If we stick to social issues, yes, many on the right will talk about legal definitions and not advocate for any kind of social pressure in regards to sexual assault, for example. However, I see the equal and opposite problem on the left. They can be nuanced about social issues, going into complexity about the different advantages and disadvantages various groups have, but then they'll either defend personally or defend people who advocate ridiculously oversimplified and nebulous laws such as constant affirmative consent which will only lead to more problems.

Obviously we're both generalising massively here. However that's my intuition about the groups. I can see the issues on both sides (not trying to suck my own dick here, just my observation). So the left will have a go at people for ironically calling themselves Nazis and then ironically call themselves communists. The right will attack the left for their lack of statistics and then not even read studies. The bigger problem I see is that both sides have relatively intelligent people who are so bound by ideology that they refuse to disavow the idiots on their own side and instead devolve into snarkiness.

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez just associated Ben Shapiro's debate offer to catcalling, instead of either ignoring this or calling her out for what is undeniably a ridiculous statement, the 'free thinking' community rallied around her and somehow used it to attack Shapiro. This is of course mirrored by rightists not calling Trump out when he either Tweets something stupid on purpose to distract from a lawsuit or Tweets something stupid because he knows nothing. And when I say left and right here, I mean the YouTube community 'leaders' or whatever. Not talking about the drooling morons who accuse Ben Shapiro of being a Nazi or who say Barack Obama wants to drone strike your family.I love it just 6 min 30 seconds in. Thank you hbomberguy for that 6 min.. Now to finish it w/o the interruption of me clapping and woo!-ing then commenting here.   Edit: Finished and loved the rest. Glad that I'm financially contributing even if it is a miniscule amount. Well not really new, is it?I know I'm 5 days after the fact, but a quick response.  My charge against rightists is that they oversimplify social issues, which you are at least hesitantly on board with, and your countercharge is that leftists oversimply legal matters.  Your primary example is what you call 'constant affirmative consent,' worrying that it will lead to more problems than it solves.  

I have only heard the affirmative consent argument raised as a possible legal refuge for people who are taken advantage of when drunk to the edge of (or in some cases over the edge of) unconsciousness.  Currently, if the defense is that 'the sex was consensual', it's very difficult for an actual assault victim to demonstrate that they were denying consent.  It is especially difficult is the victim initially did consent to sex, but revokes consent shortly before or during, which is _well within his/her right_.  Enter affirmative consent, which requires that, to have sex with someone, they actively tell you they want to have sex with you, and if there is reasonable doubt about this (at any point during the encounter), sex is not appropriate.  This seems to me to be absolutely reasonable, and without being too graphic, my own sexual history suggests that people are not naturally ambiguous about whether they wish to have sex.  I would argue that putting ambiguity on the wrong side of the law is a good thing, because healthy sexual relations do not have such ambiguity, but it is easy to use ambiguity to escape current sexual assault laws.  I submit to you that leftist ideas like affirmative consent are not as ridiculous as they are often framed.Well I'll commend you for creativity I guess?you want good skepticism?

I used to have dozens of these things, but can't even remember more than this now.I feel like I'm missing some context here. Would you mind explaining what's going on for someone out of the loop?Peep the history. OP's a troll and not a clever one./u/no2ndbreakfastforyou y u lyke dis?Yeah we're gonna need more than what seems like a pretty bad concern troller's word for it. Got any sources?

EDIT: did some internet diving and well, seems the story checks out.

Feels wrong to upvote an obvious concern troll, but looks like they're right. This kind of shit should *never* be forgotten.I thought when i read this, it was a troll, but i still took the time to check out what happened.

Turns out what happened was a trans afab who worked with Hbomberguy noticed that a close friend of Hbomberguy was a person who threatened to rape her. When Hbomberguy was told this he seemed to not believe her. They cut ties and stopped worked together. after about a year later he posted the chat logs and called him out. He apologized in a tumblr post. he responded by pointing out that the apology was piss, as he did not take responsibility for his actions and the friend who threatened to rape her was still his friend, live streams with, and mod. 

It's a pretty shitty thing to do. 
OP may be a troll, but it seems the story checks out.

https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/63pstz/left_mods_response_to_hbomberguy_revelations?sort=confidenceNot to be pedantic, but please respect his pronouns. He's made clear he wishes to be referred as a man. Oh, so this is old drama and not new drama.  Didn't he post a mea culpa after this?right, i missed that.It seems he did, but what followed it was a real shit show, with him/his mods doing their best to shut down the conversation at any cost. A conversation that still needed to be had. It seems that recently hbomb actually deleted all his old videos with paperlion (the sexual harasser) in them, such as the swanny trailer and the ghost police one. It looks like he may be trying to move on from the potentially shitty thigs he did. Do you know if he every properly apologized? Or is he just ignoring it and pretending it never happened?Hbomb or paperlion? Because hbomb did apologize a second time more genuinely Yes, H. When did he apologize a second time? Could you link it?As a completely disinterested party (as as much as I neither know nor care about any of the people involved), I would like to extend a heartfelt "fuck you" to OP and all the morons supporting the OP.

One of the biggest reasons I call myself an "independent" instead of just calling myself a "liberal" (despite supporting about 99% of liberal issues) is the weird-as-fuck obsession the extreme Left has with acting like total douchebags.

A couple of examples:

1: In a popular liberal forum, people were whining about how white girls shouldn't wear ethnic dresses, because it's "cultural appropriation."  I mentioned that if that's the case, African women shouldn't wear bras or shirts, because that's appropriating *western* culture.  I was, of course, banned for making such an outrageous observation.

2: Over in Contrapoint's forum, someone suggested that we all needed to band together to get rid of the word "tranny", since it's offensive.  I suggested that maybe we should just call people by their preferred gender, thus Chaz Bono is a man, and Laverne Cox is a woman.  This triggered the shit out of one of the mods (still trying to figure that one out) and again, I was banned.

In this case, all of you need to pull your heads out of your asses and grow the fuck up.  Seriously.

If some random person came to me and said "so-and-so who works  for you harassed me", I'd say "I strongly suggest you contact the police or a lawyer then", and that would be the end of it.

I'm not going to fire an employee based on the random bullshit some other person spreads about them.  I don't give a single fuck if they're straight, gay, trans, or Kryptonian.  If it's another employee making the accusation, then I'll certainly look into it, but that's not what the story in question about hbomberguy claims happened.

It literally claims that Random Asshole X recognized someone who works with hbomberguy, and then anonymously accused them of harassment.  

A few points:

If you think it was hbomberguy's responsibility to give **even one single shit** about an anonymous accusation, you need to go *fuck yourself in the ear with a power-drill.*

Seriously, go eat shit and die, you reprehensible fuck-nuggets.  If you think ANYONE is morally obligated to believe the anonymous ravings of some online attention-whore over a friend or co-worker, you are **exactly** what is wrong with the American Left.  Fuck you, you witch-hunting McCarthyist shitstains.  

Here's how these things should be handled.  If you feel you've been harassed, contact the police and a lawyer.  Then get a restraining order and file a civil suit.

But what you *don't* do, under *any fucking circumstances*, is write an anonymous screed wherein you openly admit to a history of mental illness, then randomly attack someone tangentially connected with your alleged harasser, merely because you think they're famous enough that you can blackmail/bully them.

Jesus Christ.  You people need to start acting like functional adults.http://hbomberguy.tumblr.com/post/159210444691/an-apology I believe Ooof, dat title.Strange hearing someone using trans exclusionary radical feminist lingo such as TiF and TiM, calling someone out for being a bad ally to trans people.

Otherwise i don't know what to say"If you're a fan of him, you're scum."

Jee, I wonder why a lot of leftists have been saying that call-out culture is toxic and maybe we need to rethink it lately?Only shitty people who don't want to be held accountable for their bullshit are against call-out culture.This video is about two of my favorite things - speed running and hbomb.

Don't listen to this person, they are playing a strawman character of a "leftist". Just look at their post history.I'll take my info about trans people from someone who doesn't go on gendercritical, thanks

&gt; I’m with GC because they acutally give a fuck about AFAB trans people. The trans community treats AFAB trans people as if we don’t fucking exist. They ignore us and exclude us (just look at THEM’s recent article about trans people and passports, no mention of trans men whatsoever), they refuse to support us, and they never make resources available to us. I don’t want to be a part of a fucking community that can’t even acknowledge that I exist.

[mfw](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Dave_Silverman.svg/659px-Dave_Silverman.svg.png)

Elsewhere in his post history he talks about under-representation of afab voices in the online trans community, and he's not really wrong about that.  But jeez, this isn't a chip on his shoulder, this is a goddamn crusade.GC thinks trans men are women. They think I’m a man in a dress. They’re transphobes, plain and simple. They do NOT give a shit about trans people. I honestly don’t believe this person believes half the shit they say.

Nah, this person is a troll who has co-opted the cause for AFAB people in online spaces, and is using it to infiltrate and poison leftist/trans spaces. I’m not interested in humouring this.More deadly than stdbomberguy.A lot of the stuff he says in [this video](https://youtu.be/c5qRX3shD3I) (and it’s part 2) make a lot of sense and are very interesting to think about, I even agree with a lot of it, but this doesn’t change how I feel when I’m actually watching the movies; they’re still poorly made and hard to watch imo Some say that the black fire bomb is what the golden one's chosen weapon against "international banking"Oh god he still does those videos?I don't know last time I checked his channel it was just videos of him working out set to the halo theme and with quotes from Warhammer 40k booksGood Lord.Actually I just checked. He made a video about the "Hollywood question"He's so subtle these days.Nah, rape apologists don't deserve to be named after a weapon in Dark SoulsThis still? How many damn accounts did you make for this?How dare you defend a dude a who thought it was okay for his friends to sexually harass a trans man? It's people like you who make trans/ leftists communities toxic for afab trans folks. Go fuck yourselfHe didn't think it  was okay for his friend to sexually harass someone, he was unsure which of two people he both knew and trusted to believe when serious allegations were made. It's you who makes things worse; by putting forth a possibly good point in the worst way possible (ie shitposting with obvious alts the same thing any time his name is mentioned) you do a disservice to that point because you've told everyone that you don't have a better defense of it. &gt;He didn't think it was okay for his friend to sexually harass someone, he was unsure which of two people he both knew and trusted to believe when serious allegations were made. 

Then why the fuck didn't he denounce his friend's actions in the first place? He apologized to his braindead fans, when it was his friend he should have apologized to.&gt;he was unsure which of two people he both knew and trusted to believe

It's understandable to not denounce someone for something you don't even know if they did.♫ the phantom of the frankfurt school is there

Thanks, appreciate that :)None of this thread is useful as all the supporting evidence in links has been deleted, except for the apology. I’d like to read from more perspectives but only one perspective/contextualization is allowed in that thread. 

So I’m shit out of luck, I suppose? I’m being asked to accept a narrative where I’m not even allowed to see the alternatives?

This ain’t the left I signed up for. The left I believe in is compassionate and forgiving. Capitalism breeds corruption and like a parasite, ruins us. We blame the game and not the player, because blaming the player is rule number one of the game. Let us rescue and rehabilitate, not condemn and hate.

Fuck. This post really just threw me for a loop. It has made me question why I’m a leftist, and I am so because I believe people are good and worth saving. Hbomberguy’s apology can be read multiple ways, and is being read in the least charitable way. The reasoning for this seems circular. “Hbomberguy is bad because look at all these things he did, where if you already see him as bad, can also be interpreted as bad!”I just unsubscribed and re-subscribed, checkmate.Is there still evidence of what he said? I want to read the primary sources on this to see where I can stand./u/loghatv is about to make "/u/sprachen_lernen Is Garbage, And Here's Why".It’s contradictory in other ways too- first they basically say take this evidence as you will, but then delete every comment they disagree with... i wasn't sure what this sub was really for but i like what i see so far.They’re definitely the same person in spirit- kindred spirits. It won’t be long before they meet and fall in love. The Golden One is a legit Nazi, or at least something so close as to be functionally indistinguishable from them. For all his dog whistles and shadiness, in his heart I don't think JBP is anything other than a crusty Christian Conservative; that said his actual material impact on the world is definitely greater and more harmful than our big Swedish boi, so far as I can tell. He definitely helps to normalise and rehabilitate crypto-Golden Ones though, which is also obviously bad.I like to imagine that if the Golden One was a balloon and you popped him, Jordan Peterson would be the deflated pile of rubber left behind, both in appearance and rhetoric.But homosexuality is Marxism sillyShit ur rightHBomberGhee is hbomb's Indian cookery doppelganger... or something?Potential Halloween costume?Why’d you post an unedited picture of sonic the hedgehog Blair white, more like uncle TomHouse TranIt’s from his Twitter.

You're not allowed to like them.Me too. I like Hbomb but I'd like to know what he did. I'd like to have my own mind battle through this even if it means being massively let down by someone who I admire.Found the original ousting [here](http://titleknown.tumblr.com/post/158830082972/jonjafarifanclub-dicksweredinner-hey-yall). I honestly don't know what to make of it. It seems pretty legit. Hbomb fucked up big time and there's really little one can say about that...

&amp;#x200B;

The whole thing reads like tears. Especially for the person that used to be on his team. I hope they are well.I found the original outsing [here](http://titleknown.tumblr.com/post/158830082972/jonjafarifanclub-dicksweredinner-hey-yall). Good luck mulling it over, it's not pretty.Thank you. After reading that, yeah he fucked up. I’m glad that the survivor stopped doing business with him, because HBomb needed to learn his lesson in that regard. No production is more important than ensuring the people working on the project are in a safe environment. 

Do they still work together? If HBomb is still employing the abuser, and the abuser hasn’t sought the help he needs and removed himself from environments where he can take advantage of others, then I no longer feel comfortable watching HBomb’s videos. I can't really find a list of creators anywhere. Even an old one. So who know?

Does anyone have a better info on this?

Dear god...It's a Trilby! HOW DARE YOU!!!H-Bomb censorship add on?I will say that its fine for people to subjectively like whatever game they want. I'm not going to lose my shit if someone says that they enjoy Sonic 06 because they like the type of story its trying to tell (despite how well or poorly it was executed).

&amp;#x200B;

\*i'll update this in a reply after I've watched the video, this is just my current opinion so it doesn't come off as biased after watching the video, whether in a positive or negative light.Edit 1:

So the first thing i notice in this video is how it tackles the whole "introduction part is a encapsulated version of the entire experience" argument that Hbomb brings up during his video. I do think that he misses the point about it being an introductory section of the game and how it doesn't more clearly convey that you're able to sneak past Officer Mack and other Vault guards. I believe the term Harris called it was "Play Conditioning." Other than that, he does bring up a fair amount of other points, and the only real fault is that the introduction doesn't more easily convey that to new Fallout players who have 0 experience with the series. Most of the people who's first Fallout game was 3 probably went into Fallout 3 expecting more of a shooter game with light RPG elements possibly. That's what the introduction often conveys, and it doesn't more clearly express and encourage the player to try non-violent options. The options are there, but the game doesn't encourage you to use them in the same level that it does with how the game hands you a gun for target practice. Its treated with less importance.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that, i will concede that Fallout 3's opening at least has "some" merit, and that I can see *why* some people genuinely prefer this game over New Vegas from the get go. I imagine for someone who figured out how to sneak past Mack on their first playthrough, they'd feel more smart as opposed to the other players who just took the violent option by default.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2:

Currently at about the 20 minute mark. I like his argument about the thematic through-line in the scenery and how the game really does give more detail than you'd expect. However, most people who played Fallout 3 for the first time probably abused the map marker heavily. As Harris mentioned, that marker really does kill one of Fallout 3's strong-suits for new players.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't entirely agree with philosophy towards "choice." Megaton does provide a choice, but its a pretty uninteresting and uninspired choice. Unless you just subjectively like Megaton, there's literally no reason /not/ to blow it up (and that's the point he's missing). On top of that, he doesn't really answer a lot of the other critiques towards Megaton that Hbomb asks in his own video. At best, he says "there's perks to blowing up Megaton, and there's perks to not blowing up Megaton." The only thing i agree with him on is the probability of a town like Megaton existing. It does have a somewhat consistent food and water source, and it has a somewhat stable economical system within the town. The problem is that its nowhere near as nuanced as a town like Junktown from Fallout 1, and whilst you can argue "at least its not objectively awful (which is honestly arguable)," there isn't a whole lot other than rather subjective points that you can use to defend Megaton.

&amp;#x200B;

The punishment for blowing up Megaton for a new player is at least somewhat punishing... For someone who doesn't save scum like myself. Filthy casuals. ;v

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 3:

So here's the part where I start to agree with a lot of his points. First off, I respect the awareness of the development setting between games like Fallout 1 and Fallout 3. The PC gaming industry was nowhere near as big back in 1997 as it was in 2008. During that period, the N64, Playstation 1-3, the Xbox and Xbox 360, Gamecube, and Wii had came out and completely pulled gaming gradually into the mainstream. Because of that, standards for what could and couldn't be in games had risen during the time. Considering Bethesda had just recently bought the Fallout franchise from Interplay, it would've been smart to have a more safe entry for their first title in the series.

&amp;#x200B;

In short: Fallout 3's qualities could be seen more as situational whereas Fallout 4's is 100% at the fault of Bethesda. He points this out in the bit where he talks about the children and how you're unable to kill them, and whilst i think he's overdoing it in terms of shite like "if i punch a wall enough times, it would realistically break in a few in-game days", he's still onto something there.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, he does go into explaining how there are some more open-ended quests in Fallout 3 that do provide some moral questions. I think the reason that Hbomb probably doesn't acknowledge these examples may be because they aren't entirely obvious at a surface level without thinking about it (which, in turn, can lead to some roleplaying scenarios in this western RPG about having choice).

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't exactly had too much gripes at this point in the video, and he does provide some convincing arguments. Tbh, I'd love to see hbomb make a response over this one now because not only would both of them profit from the exposure and it'd give me an excuse to hear hbomb talk about Fallout again, but it'd give me a chance to see what points either fall flat and what points actually change Harris's thoughts about Fallout 3.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 4:

I really have nothing else to say, he's pretty much explained how one mans garbage is another mans treasure. I think the moral of this is honestly that "its hard to find an objectively awful game." All i know is that i need to stop putting games on pedestals like this because its fairly arbitrary to begin with, and that I should just stop being so elitist about vidya games.

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine there's bits in this video that are much more arguable, but this video is 2 hours long and I've got a lot of other things to do with my time. I just want to make some notes here since this will probably be my last edit.

&amp;#x200B;

1: I liked his point about the Super Mutants and how most people may have misunderstood them and disregarded the journal log from Fallout 1 that states that most of the super mutants are like orcs in layman terms. And I like how much of the subtle subtext he points out that most people may not read into if they go into Fallout 3 without the proper mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

2: For the same reason as the Super Mutants, his defense about the Brotherhood of Steel is very solid and signifies further that Hbomb just didn't really give too much effort into researching about the overall continuity between the games.

&amp;#x200B;

3: In regards to the final big bads of each games, i actually disagree with MATN on this point. I can *maybe* forgive his point about how the final bad in NV can be talked down, but so could you talk down Richard Grey (although you have to provide external evidence to do so). And whilst I do agree that almost anyone would probably step down and surrender if a giant robot was knocking on their doorstep, the sequence for convincing him to surrender could've been a much longer and nuanced process. On top of that, NV does a better job building up to the player meeting the final bad of its campaign, unlike Fallout 3 which is only superficially climactic near the end because "giant robot."

&amp;#x200B;

4: A lot of this video and MATN's knowledge about Fallout 3's interworkings really does show how much Harris doesn't understand about Fallout 3. Ironically, Hbomb is to MATN what Mathew Mattosis is to, well, Hbomb. You can argue "play conditioning" of course, and i agree, but it honestly shows that Hbomb was arguably *"playing the game wrong."*I know that this is old news by now but i couldn't sleep without saying something, and after reading the post, the comments, and the Skype log, I don't see a way out of this for H. I came into this expecting to find a bunch of people over reacting to something small but this has shocked me. 
This has hit me exceptionally hard; I only found his channel recently and he blew me away, he was the first youtuber I've tried to reach out to, he inspired me to learn more and become more active in my efforts to effect change, he made me more critical of myself and even sparked a revelation in myself that left me reeling for days but stronger for it. He stopped me from being just another "activist" who only watches youtube videos about injustice and those perpetuating it's existence. 

Then he took the side of a man already known as a creep over the side of a rape survivor.
Those mods are right, actions have to been taken and we can't let up because he puts out great content, if we've really been listening to what he's been saying we have to do what he didn't and support this survivor.

I came here to join the sub and now I've found I have to unsubscribe from his channel.
It was good while it lasted.What in the fuck did these people think was going to happen? Were they not listening to the racial rhetoric? Why would you vote for him when your wife, the mother of your child, was here illegally?Well that sucks but really what the fuck did he expect? It's like Leave voters complaining that their area won't keep all its EU funding...Some people seriously can't read between the lines, they genuinely take all the language they use to mitigate and obscure the racism at face value.Its just kind of lame when you could be using that time playing a new game or god forbid going outside or trying to have a social life.I completely trust this man to handle a story that originates in victorian era xenophobia. England is officially over and it’s all Stefan Moffat’s faultDarn Esteban and his shenanigansNOOOOOOOOOi think this assimilated ingrouping behavior is really fascinating. ie: jontron, the child of iranian immigrants, believing he belongs in the white ethnostate he tacitly endorses. there must be some literature on this type of mentality.

Xenophobia. No. I don't think so. Classophobia. Yes. Definitely. Yes"Classophobia" r/hmmmIt's something you wouldn't understand, only Gods do. He's literally a foreign count who comes over to seduce and kill women. Yes that's right. A COUNT. Dracula in the book is a man that feasts of the Rumanian villagers, because they're helpless to stop him. He's several hundred years old, he fought in the Turk Wars on side of the Austrians. And when the battle was lost, he forced his men to fight on, almost everyone dying in the process. Then he aligned himself with the Ottomans and well, became Dracula because of his Dark Rituals.

His actions are that of a rich guy in power, that doesn't care for the people he rules over.

Also side note, Marx called the Capitalist class often 'Vampirish in nature' He looks like it idkHe's also a noble who lives by robbing people of their life force. He's powerful, charismatic and a complete parasite.
The xenophobic reading has two things that strike me as odd: People generally are more concerned with lower class foreigners, especially if you consider Victorian society. Also, Dracula is from Eastern Europe which isn't the usual ethnicity which the British empire was especially racist about. "Non-binary is a nothing" 

OofThat whole video was yikes after yikesYou could use this against any kind of leisure activity. If your goal is to enjoy yourself and speedruning suits that goal then what is the problem? Also, you can make friends speedrunning, there are whole communities cantered around this that collaborate on routes and optimisation. 

I love it when the leftist part of this channel interacts with the gamer part because I have to spend 8 hours banging my head against a wall reliving all the fucking terrible arguments that social conservatives have been making about video games for 30 years. She straight up GOOD OLE DAYS us.

She's like if Boxxy was possessed by a male boomer.I want it ASAPTen seconds was enough to nope right on out of there. Honestly, I wouldn't post this on here because it just gives her more views. It's not on her channel though.A major yikes from me dawg.Just... Roblox "oofs" all around.I just haven't played video games in general for about 2 years now and I think my life is better for it. I think a lot of people would if they were not so addicted to gaming. But if you wanna go play the same 20 year old game ad infinitum go for it nobody is stopping you.Yes 176% it all makes sense now
