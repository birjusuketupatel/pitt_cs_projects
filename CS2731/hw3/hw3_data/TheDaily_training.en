kim jong on surprise new year's day call for direct talks with south korea could undercut the trumpet administration's tough approach to north korea and scramble the dynamics between the three countries
and orrin hatch is leaving the senate potentially clearing away for the return of mitt romney it's wednesday january third

what you mean do you want me when david tell us about this new your speech that kim jong un gave a couple of days
in the same speech he had two very different messages for the allied forces south korea and the united states he did have two messages in this one david sanger has covered north korea's missile program for decades and the first was to be about spades new one cuticle cutters get don't put on
do you do basically said if you thought we did a lot of missiles staying and nuclear testing last year this year than we're moving to what he called mass production of missiles and nuclear weapons kind of up hundred okay
goes back a message though wasn't director of us who was directed at south korea
didn't and that was unusual because the north koreans are usually ignore the south koreans they this them
his lackeys of the united states they frequently say are up of the a and in this case he said what's get involved and direct negotiations with the south koreans about everything including the upcoming olympics
the south koreans are hosting the olympics the winter olympics starting an early february
the south koreans have wanted to see if they could get a north korean team to come in not because they're particularly interested in their olympic skills but because they're interested in kim jong non not conducting some act of terror disruption during the olympics them their theory was that if they're on athletes are playing
not likely the mess with the game
so what is kim jong il ne trying to do here with these two divergent messages produced two different countries so the message for the united states is simple were a nuclear power move on to the message to south korea is the unusual one because
clearly kim jong a pretty cammie examination of of the nature of the relationship between south korea and the united states has come to the conclusion that there's a lot of daylight
between president moon in south korea who just took office the middle of last year after his predecessor resigned of a scandal
and president tropics janice rock to his nations day saying is more open to dialogue with north korea were would meet whereas it jong on under the right conditions to talk about the nuclear weapons program president moon has said that he would open up discussions with north korea
basically without conditions no nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals armor itself with nuclear weapons and mr president prompt those made it clear they would have to be impatiens including an understanding that any negotiation had the lead to a fairly quick the new
queries asian of north korea it is time for north korea to realize that the denuclearization is it's only acceptable future most importantly president moon told his own people last year south korean president who now that sounds like claiming
our over any military action answer that after meeting with president from he now had a veto right
mona de vito right on any american military action against the north the implication being that he wasn't going to lot of war start up he wasn't know let down from go attack north korea and the american officials who i spoke to right after that statement said
he's got no such veto right this is a decision that really made by the united states in the united states entries
so the us and south korea are genuinely divided in their approach to had a deal with north korea and its nuclear program and it sounds like kim jong own knows that it is certainly fair to say that the president of south korea and the present the state
have very different views about have a good deal with this they start from a common point both of them would tell you that ultimately we need to get to a nuclear rise korean peninsula the question is how do you get their president moon believes that the way you get there is by trying to learn or the north
koreans out of their isolation offer them all of the usual inducements will leave from sanctions internet for investment so forth and so on president trumps few is the president treated out being nice to rocket man hasn't worked and twenty five years i would wouldn't work now clinton failed bush failed and obama failed
i won't fail that's been tried before and nothing will lead the north koreans to give up their nuclear weapons in return for some promise of investment from south korea or from the west and so then the question is do they have a common strategy for dealing with north korea and right now
now the answer is they don't the united states has great strength and patients but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea president trumps approach is to say we're going to try some diplomacy with no expectation that it's going to
work and then when it doesn't work i'll move on to my military options or as the view of the south korean president is south korean president known as urging open dialogue
quote president and i will not buy a hostile policy against north korea we have no intention to attack north korea we do not wish to save the regime replaced or collapsed more going to make diplomacy were one way or the other
but what's interesting here is that it was evident who kim jong on the president has days and the president south korea had to very divergent strategies for dealing with the north and he was nimble and to jump on this and say let's see what we can do to widen the
gap
that was pretty sophisticated diplomatic move so let's talk about how he tried to widen the gap he sees this opportunity this divergence between the us and south korea and what's he doing in this speech to try to capitalize on what he's doing is suggesting a meeting between the north koreans and the south koreans
that basically it's foods the us
the opposite of what he usually wants which is a meeting between the north koreans in the us that it's the south korean and his hope is that north and south korea would week some separate agreement
that the united states could not say no to and as a result it could lead to some agreement to relieve sanction some make it harder for the state to read military action do whatever he could to separate the us from its ally of seventy years

what was south korea's response to this invitation from the north to start talking the south korean seem quite open to it in fact they turned around and propose that they get a conversation going at the d m z that's the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries and we'll see whether or not covered
station happens whether the content of it is about more than merely whether the north my participate in the olympics is there a way of seeing south korea's willingness to directly negotiate with the north as good news for everybody including the us and other words
north korea cares to preserve its relationship with south korea is arguably a good sign in the stand off anytime you have conversation going on between them you have to think that's a good thing
but you will have to keep in the back of your mind the possibility that this is merely a delaying tactic
merely a way to go buy some time while kim jong on gets ready to conduct more missiles as and more nuclear test food you can prove beyond a doubt that we can reach any corner of the us and you know even as we are having this discussion there are reports emerging from american intelligence
agencies that suggests that another missile was being loaded up for testing and the result of that is that kim may simply be hey i'm going to buy a little time with the south koreans while i complete my experiment here
and other words that's not a good situation for the world that's just can getting more time and more cover to advance his nuclear program that right and he sees the olympics as a great opportunity because he knows that the olympics have to go well for south korea and he's the potential disruptive
so let's talk about the role of the olympics and it's because it's kind of fascinating and odd even
what is south korea is concern about the north in relation to the games
well their biggest concern about the door
is that it would disrupt the games and subway imagine that they use a moment when all wise and all too real networks are focusing on the or the games on this gig jumps on bob's where everything else that goes into this
and in the middle that they are missile test or a big nuclear test that will be bad right
and i think that kim jong un has recognized that that boy capability gives them some huge leverage for the next month or two which is kind of amazing so came to england unpredictability means he has greater leverage with the olympic games going on
then potentially any other time because the imagination ones while with the possibilities of what he might do with the world focused on the south that right
so to the north koreans actually have an olympic development program like the us this doesn't feel like something they do in the past michael the north koreans have periodically same athletes under the north korean flag to the olympics one thousand and sixteen
who's the summer olympics in rio de janeiro they actually did send a good size team at it goes about thirty one athlete more women than men interesting the medals wait what
hello
asian bronze to lydia valentino as of spain darien a matter of ruth took the silver and gold medal awarded to rim johnson of the democratic people's republic of korea i think they had set a target of twelve medals or rio and they came up a little bit short on that when they only got seven she cemented gold
this attempt

be in this particular case though is that they only qualified to athletes i think both figure skaters for the twenty eighteen olympics and south korea and they never actually submitted the names for those athletes by the deadline at the end of our
october now
that's not necessarily dispositive here they could say they want to send their athletes and the international olympic committee which has made a pretty clear would like to have some north korean represent asian
in the games could let them in the last moment bend the rules right presumably all of this would be part of these discussions with south korea that we're talking about i think there would be the initial discussion was south korea get the figure skating out of the way first move on a nuclear weapon

in the end david how much does all of this this unusual change in the dynamics between these three countries have to do with our realization over the past year of just how far along the north korean nuclear program has gone has that fundamentally shifted the dynamics
here in a way that allows the north to do bald things i try to break apart a seventy year old alliance between the us and south korea or it's a good question because until now the question was would the around states come to the south korea
written by the north once the us feel threatened itself it may pursue a defensive policy that is separate from the one the south korea but then it must pursue in the past we built missile defenses in alaska california
on the fourth one day the north koreans might be able to lob one or two or three nuclear weapons or away
but now you're looking at the possibility that if they so decided they might be able to wobble are more than that and of course the missile defenses could be overwhelmed and at that moment a president united states is going to think about this issue and very different terms there were a lot of people saying that the president what this isn't fundamentally that different from the sick
jewish when we faced with the soviet union starting in nineteen forty nine or with the trainees starting in nineteen sixty four
and both those cases classic containment and mutually assured destruction worked what's interesting is that this administration says in this case classic containment will not work
that in fact north korea might use its weapons to blackmail countries to try to take over the south there are any number of scenarios that many in this administration spin out that they believe the north koreans could try to enact using the new power of a nuclear weapon that can reach the us
including the possibility that the us would not come to the south defense if the north can take out was angels to washington
and you suspect the deep conversations between the north and south in the lead up to the olympic games are really just about preserving the peace until the olympics are over and negotiations will more or less go back to normal after that or do you think given what you're saying that these dynamics could forever beach
change now
it's a fascinating question for clothes it's very possible that this is all just a temporary thing but it's also possible that if they got into a real discussion it could generate a dynamic of its own could continue pass the olympics
thank you thank you mike all happy new year
on tuesday night president trump responded to one of kim jong wounds provocations from his new year's day speech when he'd said that could a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office
this is just reality
a threat jump replied boost someone from his depleted and food star version please inform him that i too have a nuclear plant
but it is the much bigger and more powerful woman has
my body works
labour

when the province reserve shooter our last month he said i was a fighter
i've always been a fighter
i was an amateur boxer my youth brought fighting spirit with me to washington
but every good father knows when to hang up for grabs
for me
that time soon approach her on tuesday utah sen orrin hatch the longest serving republican in the senate said he would retire at the end of the year depriving president trump have a close ally on everything from health care to taxes european you
out of order
my colleague jonathan martin is covering hatches announcement
where actual at a war on air score and hatches special friend of mine i can tell you that are actually the rude
really well

agreed utah
and what does it say about the state of the republican majority in the us senate and trumps relationship with the republicans in the senate that he's so fixated on exactly who occupies a single seat in the body
and he had a row liable ally in iran you gun not only a question mark with somebody who could actually represent a competing coalitions body i think it how romney would vote in the finn and i think even more than that would help rally would conduct can show public what he would say to the media what he would sound elevation about the

much more
in your a wet
rigor example accurate
given that we now know to yeah absolutely

an idiot or watergate to be a real scandal in with reagan there were you it
about what
he got older
through these comments about leak the president now infamous lead into the series of tweets by seeing he's actually a genius a very steep genius
and then a few hours leader on saturday afternoon he elaborates on bad camp david where he has been spending the weekend what happened there

all really sticky stuff raid the question of mental health contrary to what the president says in a tweed and the defense is mounting the media has really sort of avoided the subject for that reason but it is true that democrats in washington have been increasingly trying to mobilize some kind of action around

the issues last year


some breaking news while you're in commercial see ben and apologizing to president trump i want to work backwards from the surprise apology on sunday we've just heard from her called peter baker
what's going on with the trump team in the time since this book was previewed were leaked what's been going on with banned since then the lead to this apology will denim has been increasingly isolated past week has been one indignity after another donald
trump has launched a scathing attack on his former chief strategist steve ban and first of all you have the president basically saying steve who never heard of the guy jeremy peters has known and reported on steve then and for years he's a credit stealing blowhard steve was a staffer who work for me after i had already
he won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the republican party and you should write him off just like i have that was essentially trumps message to republicans in the conservative movement which is crucial for steve because here steve is trying to build
old a political movement off of trump goes on and recruit candidates and run them kind of in the mall of trump
the blow it continues against mr benn and there are multiple reports tonight then you have the next day the mercer family is distancing themselves from hand they are among his most important financial backers rebecca mercer who
ben's political patronage has funded much of who's activity and also a major donor to trump same or my family and i have not communicated with the banning in many months and had provided no financial support to his political agenda nor do we support his recent actions
and statements i'm sever ties with them he will not have any more of mine financial today president wait in the a tweet merce your family recently dumped the leaker known as sloppy steve banning smoking exclamation
but it's not just trump and the murderers who turned on ben and it's some of the candidates the ban and has been campaigning for and supporting who are going to challenge republican incumbents in senate races across the country you had kelly ward in arizona and any park came in nevada
among others saying loving see the spokesman for a republican kelly war downplayed ban it is only one of the many high profile endorsements doctor ward has received steve is just one guy who supports mean i have the support of many other the conservative movement convicted felon michael grim who is running for his old have seen in new york said strongly denounced the comments by steve
and they are baseless attacks against the president's day and i fully support our commander in chief and i think ultimately the most painful and dignity for men and personally happened on sunday morning it's tragic and unfortunately steel will make these go comments so out of touch with reality and obviously south injected when steve
miller who was a costs associated
ally abandoned and going back well before they ever worked to get and i'm going from campaign basically went on national television and twisted benign and deep man and extend to the wire and the whole white house staff is deeply disappointed in his comments which were wrote so over the course of fourteen hours his political
capital drops like a stone
thank you but you're only been in knowingly participated in this book written by michael what he did a similar interview with vanity fair just a few weeks earlier and he talked to you a few weeks before that obviously he is being intentional it seems with his comment so what's going on here did he know
that this would happen or do you think he didn't expect this reaction this kind of anger at him over what he's been saying about the president you know michael it's funny i get that question a lot what was steve thinking the answer was really quite simple he wasn't thinking this was impulsive it was reckless and it was done as far as i can read deciduous
without any thought he was hopping what was on the top of his mind he was hot at the time the disclosure that this meeting had taken place with the russians in trump tower which such an obvious and avoid of ball self inflicted wound that in theory steve and it in fury
other people around the president as well so he's reacting there without thinking through the consequences now i think it's a question of whether or not those comments were ever meant to be on the record or not and whether the other took some liberties and putting them in the book but there's no doubt the steep said them
so what does ban in say on sunday what is his apology
it's not really an apology
a more of a clarification what he says the man is not that down trump junior treason us for taking this meeting with russians and trump tower in two thousand and sixteen but that the other people around trump you should have known better like paul manner for was the campaign manager at the time he should know
not have ever allowed russians and to trump tower and germ donald trump junior was there he was at the meeting but he says great patriot i do not believe that he is treason us here's more of what van and rides he says quote my comments were aimed at home manner for a season campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the russians operate he she
should have known they are duplicitous cunning and not our friends to reiterate those comments were not aimed at dawn junior and did however say the he regretted how long it took him to respond
five days from when the news first broke to when we finally heard this may a copper so what do you do you make of that and especially the part where he expresses regret for how long it took him to express regret
i don't think it's steve i don't think it sounds like steve he watched his political capital evaporate he watches financial support collapse he watched the conservative movement and the white house turn its back on him and
steve being somebody who is hard headed stolen and unapologetic this doesn't sound to me like it was written by him but when you when you see that do you do you mean that somebody else literally may have written the steam and or that dependents heart wasn't in in what is your reporting telling you that that i think the people around
and wanted to mend the relationship with president trump and that the only way they were going to do that was to essentially put a gun to st helens that you've got to go out and say something and he i think that this statement issued under extreme duress and
ben and did not even today with all that happened with the denunciations on television by senior white house officials didn't want to apologize and display the weakness that he believes apologies do and yet he ultimately did apologize
if you read it the word i'm sorry isn't in there is a
do we know jeremy if steve den and route to statement we do now

thank you thanks for having me it's a pleasure is always going to

that's it
i'm michael moore


from the new york times on michael vaughan
the is that

today when president trump announced that he would end dog he made it congress problem they had six months to pass a bill or tens of thousands of undocumented children could be deported
as the clock counts down why is the president once again making it his problem
it's thursday january eleven

good morning
here to dodge ram out the program known as dhaka there was a virtual worded under the obama administration is being sim
a dark a program was implemented in right so it was september fifth i believe of last year almost two thirds of the way through the president's first year in office and attorney general jeff sessions went out at the justice department and made this dramatic announcement to have a lawful system of emigration that serves the national interest
we cannot admit everyone would like to come here is just that the administration was rescinding a program called dhaka deferred action for childhood arrivals michael scherer covers the white house for the times it was a program that was set up originally in two thousand and twelve by the obama administration as a way of a dry
arresting a particularly sympathetic group of people were brought to this country by their parents
sometimes even as infants and often have no idea that there are undocumented until and so the obama administration had put into a place a program that said look let's carve out this group of people and say we're not going to deport damn well going to give them the ability to get a work permit to work here legally it makes no sense
spell talented young people who for all intents and purposes are americans
and that was the status quo for something like five years two thousand and twelve to two thousand and seventeen the compassionate thing it is in the lawlessness
and force hours and if congress chooses to make changes to the law
to do so through the process set forth by our founders but it's actually not that simple right that suddenly the president through jeff sessions is just shutting down doc and that's exactly what he does right i mean look part of the interesting thing about president trump is that he is somewhat conflicted on this
issue to dhaka situation is a very very it's a very difficult thing for me because i love these kids i love kids i have kids and grandkids and i find it very very high doing what the law says exactly did in has a long history of expressing some
the same sympathy towards this group that others do
actually a little known fact is the president trump in two thousand and thirteen long before he was a presidential candidate her even given thought about running for president and he met with a group of these young immigrants they're known as dreamers and as i understand it gaby you are in that meeting with donald trump a couple of years ago
yeah and and he met with him in trump tower sat around a table had a long discussion one and
i shouldn't bad people who are not wild berry and don't understand immigrant and new it happening in the country and we worried about
and then at the end of it meeting as they wrote down the elevator one of them told us that
and bad you now you can
we lacked
wow
and here it out and really bad people would be embarrassed about
but again i'm yeah
that has clearly stuck with him so even on that day on september fifth day when he sent out his attorney general to end of the program president trump had managed to figure out a way to do two things on the same day and pretty dramatic fashion on the one hand he found a way to satisfy this sort of super conservative
if anti immigrant part of his base which had always hated this obama era program they had seen it has an executive overreach that obama had just would have waived a magic wand in kind of exempted this group of immigrants from sort of the normal immigration laws and so by sending out he's very conservative attorney general to ended he satisfied
that part of his base but at the same time in the reason why it's not so simple and why it's pretty interesting and dramatic on day is that literally the moment that he did that the moment he ended the program he also challenge to congress
to fix it
one thing tonight hours after the trunk administration announced it was phasing out the doctor program over the next six months president an interim tweet to congress now has six months to legalize dhaka something the obama administration was unable to do if they can't the end of that clock is march fifth after which if they don't act by march fifth
everyone knows that that sort of the day that many many of these young immigrants will start being affected by this strikes me as his kind of a brilliant stroke on the part of the president if it works he doesn't alienate his supporters who put up an office and who have lille reservations about something like a dream act
but more congress to solve this where congress to pass legislation protecting the streamers it would actually be far stronger and more enduring then what president obama had done which was an executive order or what trumped would have done by just furthering the executive order right know
i mean look at president obama tried to take the legislative approach during his time in office and i've said time and time and time again to congress send me the dream act put it on my desk and i will sign it right away they just couldn't get it through congress so the doctor program was an executive
actually that president obama did out of frustration is he couldn't get the legislation passed fast forward to president trump and if he can help republicans and democrats in congress to come together and actually do a version of the dream act that was tried and failed several years ago it will actually be a much more permanent
losing a much better solution for these young immigrants because at the end of the day gay won't be subject to the whims of the next president who comes in my office they will simply have become permanent residents the united states and depending on how the legislation to be written might have an opportunity at some point in the future to become citizens
so what's congress been doing in the four months since this six month clock started to count are they trying to solve this problem so congress does what congress always does which is they don't ever do things simply great
it's never as simple as just let's take this one issue and let's talk about it and debate and vote on it right so both sides looked at this question of how to deal with the young immigrants and said how can we improve our leverage
so that we get what we want
it is going to be an eventful few days on capitol hill let's get to illinois who can set the table force on that he like a morning
call center caps humor
and representative nancy pelosi has said they are willing to support a deal that would raise the national debt limit for three months now that is the offer fan democrats that unclear if republicans will accept it when i do think it's very interesting is the wall is so critically important to ham and dhaka and maintaining it is so critically important democrat
rats and he has using that as the ultimate and bargaining chip here will he get his way to both sides started posturing
this remarkable dinner the president late wednesday working around his own party hosted chuck schumer and nancy pelosi at the white house while we have an invitation to chuck schumer and i are leader humor on the menu tax reform border security infrastructure trade and how to resolve the dispute over so called dreamers the president said you know he said
the dream now
they could have talked it through with a bunch of aids there and what everybody's it was all we've got a deal the president and the democrats a great deal on doc i'm single and dhaka after the sit down the democratic leaders announcing we agreed to enshrine the protections of dhaka into law quickly and to work out a package of border security excluding the wall that's acceptable to both sides we're not going to
hi the wall to dreamers that's a very very good thing and good progress i've told him over and over again at one point he said to me go easy on the wall i said no
but the minute that dinner ended in everybody left president trump is pushing back this morning against democratic claims that they have a framework for a deal to save nearly seven hundred thousand young immigrants from deportation the president reading a short time ago no deal was made last night on dhaka massive border security would have to be agreed
in exchange for consent would be subject to vote the normal partisan mechanisms in washington kicked in and so within avenue few days a couple of weeks it was pretty clear that whatever quote unquote deal both sides might have thought had been struck like there wasn't a deal that was sealed that right and so for that reason this say
next month clock that you've been describing is still ticking with no deal right there is no deal and ultimately that's what led the president to invite members of congress from both parties and both chambers to the white house on tuesday for what ended up being this remarkable discussion hour long broadcast on television where they release have confronted this question in how to solve it

we'll be right back

so like what happens in this televised
at the white house on tuesday
what your
the president gathered all of these lawmakers around in the cabinet room
today to advance bipartisan immigration reform that serves community
normally depressants brought in for just the first couple of minutes and then laid out the meeting can happen in private in this case the press can stay for a while at a couple of folks can make statements the press was brought in and then we just loud to stay in the meeting went on and on and on for almost an hour
i think we're going to come up with an answer i hope we're going to come up with an answer for a doctor and then we go further than that later on out and everybody in all the different sides were trying to make their points so you had the democrats need take care of these kids and we all agree on that eighty six percent of the american public agrees on nine hundred
our members of the us
twenty thousand of them are schoolteachers repeatedly trying to make their case to the president dad let's just do this very simply mr president let's just take the dream act and let's pass it like not get bogged down by a lot of other stuff lives are hanging in the balance our new job done and then on the republican side to recent
terror attacks in new york that were the result of this i think failed immigration policy we like to see that directs you had a bunch of the republicans urging the president not so fast we're going to address a order enforcement and security and let's make sure that we do this and it's a package and it makes more sense for their concern
truancy sort of we do not do something with the security if we do not do something with the chain migration we are fooling each up and then there was one moment to crystallize the tension and then back and forth when senator what you like a sosa
sen dianne feinstein democrat of california veteran of the senate for the last several decades sees an opportunity and take the what about a claim doc of they'll now tries to convince the president that the best way to go is to just do a clean dream act something for these young him
without loading it up with a bunch of other things
i think that's basically what we're going to come up with the president seemed to agree i would like
you could sense that the democrats in the room were like wow that's a real moment because i think when they're here in then representative kevin mccarthy republican from california also and in the leadership in the house and was somebody who you could see it on his face he
realize that this was a panic yeah the without securing are you talking about security as well
wow i think if we have some meaningful comprehensive
immigration reform that's really where the security go president had just would have seemed to suggest that they were going to the banned in all of their efforts to get tougher immigration restrictions on who can come into the country tougher enforcement at the border learned like three pillars dhaka because we all were all of them are want to do it or secure
so we're not back out here and chain migration she was sort of back and forth between feinstein in mccarthy
do you really think that there can be agreement on all of that quickly and because course we know from coverage of the president over the whole year that oftentimes where he ends up in the position of whoever whispered in his ear last so you could see around the table in that moment both sides trying to be that voice
his head of the last voice to convince him to go one direction
thank you very much
so then what happens so the meeting breaks up with the white house and it was really only a few hours later then
and new road block to that trump administration's moved to and dhaka a federal judge in california issues a ruling on this very program on the dock a program a federal judge blocking the trump administration's decision to in the dreamers program on march for essentially what the judge said is that the president's decision back in
september on september fifth when he had the attorney general announced the end to the doctor program that decision was essentially illegal that the administration had not followed the proper procedures to end the doc a program and you can't just take something away with the stroke of a pen any issued a nationwide
injunction basically said the government has to restart the doctor programming and started giving back those benefits to people now
the trick here is that the legal process move slowly and it's not at all clear with the appeals that are likely and what impact the legal case will actually have mine in the meantime the political process is continuing and i think talking to democrats republicans the white house there is a real sense that even though the judge's ruling
on tuesday night was amazing that he came on that same night of the white house meeting right but that really at the end of the day nobody expects the legal process to be the one to solve this rate like everybody understands ultimately the political process is the one that's going to matter so is this time he just happened to be a coincidence that on the same day the white house holds the session on dhaka and whether to renew
had the judge this judge makes a ruling on die that's quite consequential we have no transparency into the judge's decision making my suspicion is that it's not incidental you know that the judge has been considering this case for weeks now on months the loss
suits were filed back in the fall and i have no reporting to suggest one way or the other but did he decide hey this is not a bad upper division is not a bad moment to release this decision it's it's certainly possible
make it seems like whether the timing of this ruling was coincidental born i it offers an explanation for why president trump after trying to make dark of congress's problem rather than his problem has now come back
and is trying to help get a bill passed because on last year we saw him using executive authority to deal with immigration with the travel ban and just getting blocked do to court over and over so is this court ruled just another example of
something the president trump seems to have already figured out and is exhausted by which is that executive action is just legally fraud and temporary and not a real way to get a problem solved yeah i think you're exactly right i think it is a reminder
of the risks that you take when you try to make big broad consequential public policy outside of the normal legislative process the judge's ruling in this lawsuit underscores better than anybody could possibly have done that
when you make policy that way it becomes completely wrapped up in this legal quagmire that you've got you know judges in california and appellate court judges and ultimately the supreme court likely to get involved in a process that ultimately shouldn't be about judges in legal questions rated
ultimately a question of what's the consensus in the country of what should be done with these young immigrants
even as the legal in the political process goes forward that's the question that hanging over these children is what will their feet be and will it be resolved with some kind of an ultimate political solution or will it continue to be uncertain and left to the whims of
kind of uncertain legal process and that's that's what we don't know the answer to you
thank you mike
yes you're happy to do it
on wednesday promenade house republicans came forward with a proposal for a strict immigration bill that directly clashes with president trumps efforts at a bipartisan deal the proposal would crack down on illegal and legal immigration and off
first three you doable work permits to dhaka recipients
without offering them a path to citizenship
while the plan is unlikely to make it out of the house it signals how difficult it could be for congress and the white house to come to an agreement
at the same time some liberal democrats are adamant that they will not vote for government funding measure with out a deal on immigration
and funding is set to expire on january nineteen


three years what else you need to meditate on wednesday morning in a nation wide crack down on illegal immigration the trump administration dispatched federal agents to read nearly one hundred seven eleven stores resulting in the arrest of twenty one undocumented workers in a statement
the director of immigration and customs enforcement said the arrests called send a strong message to us businesses that hire an employee and illegal workforce ice woman forced the long and if you were found to be breaking the law you will be held accountable
get your legal team sources told us believes that in the next few weeks the special counsel robert moeller will ask for some sort of an interview with you
are you open to meeting with him there has been no collusion between the trump campaign and russians or trump and russian is no collision under questioning from reporters on wednesday president trump refuse to say whether he would grant an interview to the special counsel in the russia and destination a rock
quest the white house aspects in the coming weeks that marks a shift for the president who back in june said he was cool one hundred percent willing to testify under oath in the investigation but at the white house on tuesday trump was noncommittal to get where you would you be open we'll see what happens i mean certainly else you what
happens but when they have no collusion and nobody found any color
at any level
it seems unlikely that you even have an interview
that's it for today
i'm michael barbara


from the new york times on michael barbara this
a government hearing gets overtaken by the fight over whether the president
he is reported to have used why it matters so much to members of congress
and steve then becomes the first member of trumps inner circle to be subpoenaed in the mother it best
it's wednesday january seventh
so on tuesday morning there is a hearing scheduled in the senate judiciary committee to talk about the different options for a border wall julie davis watch the hearing on tuesday by it came at sort of a tricky time are you saying the president did not use the word that has been so why are they report
because you did not use that word george and up till and it's are gross misrepresentation
so to the last few days have been consumed with this debate going on between the white house and republican and democratic senators about what was said by president trump in the oval office meeting last week and i'm not here derogatory comments i sent out about individuals percent sheet metal when he has reported
have said that african countries to send a immigrants here are shit her countries
really
and so do your first of all your here before the community will be food for nothing
what's happening in this hearing chairman grassley ranking member feinstein in members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today the protagonist is christine neill nielsen she is the somewhat new homeland security secretary and she is a top official at the
apartments there she would naturally be there to talk about border wall but she also happens to you have been one of the administration officials in the oval office last thursday when the president made these remarks that have caused so much ruckus an instructor hope you remember me almost immediately we were together to meetings worst week
it would like to urge to about one of those meetings one of the senior democrats on the judiciary committee is senator durbin who was there for that oval office meeting and has now spoken out about what he heard people across the united states and around the world want to know what this president believe should be are priorities when it comes to immigration
i'm going to ask you as best you can do recall what you heard the presidency
when it came to those berge right germans actually the democrat who was in the room at the white house proposing this bipartisan immigration deal with republican senator lindsey graham that's right and senator durbin has been working on this issue for more than fifteen years but now he's also become
a key player in this kind of back and forth over what actually and fall it at the white house and what this says about how the president views immigration and immigrants do you remember the president saying expressly i want more europeans why can't we have more immigrants from norway
i do remember what he i do remember him asking about the concept of under represented countries he basically says to her you were there i was there and essentially dares her to deny what they both heard should on fox news that the president you strong language what was that strong language
let's see strong language there was so secretary nielsen says that she did not hear that specific word i apologies i don't remember specific word what i was struck with frankly as i'm sure you were is well aware it's just the general profanity that was used in the room by almost everyone in burma use proof
no sir neither did her so she says that tough language was used in people were impassioned a lot of people were using profanity what do you remember the president
about immigration from african countries to the united church that when durban presses her on what specifically the president said she says what i heard him saying was that he'd like to move away from a country based quota system to merit based system and she also claims that she can't really remember
any sort of characterization of african nation which was in the context in which everyone i've spoken to you about this meeting says this remark was made out of the characterized those countries in africa
in i i don't i don't specifically remember categorization of countries in africa i think what he was saying is as far as best i could talent is you now there were about a dozen people in the room there were a lot of cross conversations there was a lot of rough talk by a lot of people in the room
but what i understood him to be saying is let's move away from the countries and let's look at the individual and make sure that those we bring hair can contribute to our society
president saying
i mean julie would she seems to be describing is kind of this previous locker room and of the president and members of congress talking about immigration it was the sort of everyone is saying it's a big shouting match and it was actually somewhat surprising to me to hear
the meeting described that way by her because she is in effect conceding that this devolved into not very high level of discourse about this huge issue that they're trying to solve
this has turned into a show just to complicate things for this hearing and we need to get back to be in a great country another member of the judiciary committee who also gets his chance to chime in and ask questions is lindsay graham who was the only other republican in the oval office
offense at that meeting to have come forward and said publicly that there was an exchange that he pushed back on and he's defended and continues at this hearing to defend senator durbin his account i think dick durbin
people you could ever hope to work with that he's a decent honest man and graham is actually turbans cosponsor on this bipartisan immigration plan that's what they were doing in the white house in the first place
right thursday
are you aware that senator durbin and the pros that talked ten o'clock around that time thursday morning only through news reporting african to fabricate and senator graham sort of recounts publicly what i and others have reported happened in the run up to this extraordinary meeting which is the key and senator durbin
had gone to president trump with the foundation of what they thought was a bipartisan compromise here are you where the government call me and said i had the best conversation or the pros that we should follow up on it
ham now okay so that body else that the president was actually quite upbeat about in phone conversations with them on thursday morning or are you aware of the great girl called the lot else and super we can sort of a moving your now yes sir only to then find when he got to the white house that wasn't actually that simple and that he describes that the
president the he confronted in the oval office was a very different person from the person you talked to you on the phone that morning between ten o'clock and twelve o'clock
we went from having conversations between sooner drug urban which i believe every word and the president that was very hopeful and by the time we got there something had happened so what happened between ten and twelve it sounds a bit like a rhetorical question so what his nielsen's actual reply to ground question i don't know since i didn't i don't know
i'm going to find out i'm not she basically says she doesn't know obviously what senator graham is driving at him like he said after the hearing tests and reporters in the hall is that he thinks the president has been poorly served by his staff like steve miller senior policy advisor who is very much been a hardliner on these issues and potentially even neil
send herself though he doesn't name her are really constraining trump from the position where he keeps trying to get or a were at least graham would like to see him get who's the we had a president that i was proud to golf with call my friend who understood immigration her to be bipartisan you had to have order sir
security is a search or you airport security or the wall but he also understood the
with conversion
now i don't know where they're going nowhere
i want him back
i actually think that senator graham in some ways was trying to talk to trump through the hearing testimony or even questioning process in other words china in and say to ham sir you're the president if you want to do these things it isn't as your position you should do then don't let these
people push you around the present watching i'm still on the phone book don't give my number of gone
so let's take a step back why is whether or not the president used this word dominating this homeland security hearing on tuesday morning why are these lawmakers so fixated on that
you have to understand that the government funding is that to run out on friday as part of a gear and spending deal that republicans and democrats may of last year they need to vote by friday to replenish government spending and keep the government open and democrats and republicans thought that they had reached a deal to address
doctor before that happened that they could have presented to the president that they could at least be on their way to getting that voted on and signed before they made the commitment to in fact support a measure to keep the government open so they went to that meeting thinking that this was the path forward at the white house with graham will has with graham and with
well what they stand instead was an exclusive meeting where the president use this charge term and ran all these days that followed of bickering over whether he senate or he didn't say it and what it has essentially done is pulled the extremes of both parties away from a place where they were ready to deal and instead
given democrats pause about whether the president and serious about doing something for this population and for immigration in general and given the republican hardliners a reason to point it democrats and say they are making this big deal out of nothing and they can't be trusted to cut a deal with us that is going to have the kind of immigration restrictions that we think me
to be in place
are the democrats the ones in power here for once the budget can't get past without them it seems so good they now have a leverage on this issue that they might not normally
they do have a leverage if they're willing to use it that even now even after these comments there is a big question about whether all of the democrat and they only need a few to though with republicans to keep the government running are really willing to make the stand and say we're shutting down the government over this issue
do you agree with me that the throes to the notion her
or pretty severe and if we should remember government that be a good idea
yes sir
finally julie i want to ask you about something else the republican senator lindsey graham said in this congressional hearing on tuesday that i found quite interesting and i wanted your take on it does the president in to extend dhaka past march fifth boat executive or not that
i'm aware of do you think has the legal authority to do so i believe the attorney general has made it clear that he believed such exercises unconstitutional for congress to fix so i agree with the frozen can extend his are good order in march fifth a lot of bad things begin to happen
seems to me were try to avoid can do you agree with the yes sir what's your take on that
well thinner ground with things something important here because donald trump has actually intimated in the past he did when he rescinded doctor that he could revisit this that he would somehow have the power to go back and if congress didn't act he was going to fix it himself senator graham is basically saying that's not possible right grim saying
he is in rescinding this you've basically said it's unconstitutional for you to deal with this so it's congress that solves this or nothing and when he really seems to be saying to the president through his homeland security secretary is let us solve this and stop mucking about
right let us do this for you president has said repeatedly that he feels for these kids he calls and even many of them are not kids that he has compassion for them that he wants to do something that's full of love and essentially senator graham is saying if you don't allow a deal to go forward in congress if you mess with that if this gets derailed
we can't help you address this you will be responsible for having ended this program and it will be over
thank you doing
thanks michael
we'll be right back

that what are you reporting
today we reported that steve banned in the president's former chief strategist had been served a subpoena last week by bob mahler to special counsel breaking is today though in russia investigation for the first time the thing here that was interesting new and different is then he is using his
brian subpoena power than your dad and is the first person in the president's inner circle to get a grand jury subpoena everyone else did has talked to former white house chief of staff rinds pretty boss of was can't we know about a former white house press secretary shaun spicer has been interviewed by has gone soon the informal
setting of use officers in downtown washington white house communications director hope he spent the last two days meeting with special counsel robert mahler's to the curious thing was then banning someone who at least publicly the image of being close to the president in certainly was around for a lot of things wasn't among men were either we kept on wondering
if muller's investigation is coming to an end as the white house has tried to say it is why hasn't he talked of man and
the mouse among about the term campaign and administration is now available for everyone to read it is the timing of this subpoena meaningful because it came just a few days after ban and got himself into a lot of hot water with the white house because of the commons and he made in michael wolfsburg fire and fury about
donald trump junior a meeting with russian officials which he called treason us we don't know been timing is certainly funny and the book's publisher moved up the schedule release of buyer in theory to today after the trump administration threaten to sue to keep made from coming out in the book comes out in the first week in january in the books the ban in the press
those former top advisor calls the president's son unpatriotic and treason as you have banned in out there saying donald trump son's decision to meet with russians in two thousand and sixteen who were promising dirt on hillary clinton was treason is he also said the ongoing russia investigation is a category five hurricane for the administration you have
him saying that there was almost zero chance that trumps son didn't bring the russian to meet the president extraordinary war of words breaking out between president and his former top strategist steam ban and a clear bring between ben and and the president and on wednesday the president excoriated ban and saying he lost his mind
in losing his job a top or a part in last week as this split has become public mother moves in in serves them with the subpoena
she doesn't council has many reasons but many of them related to the book to now talk to steve of the book created these features in trump world that exposed breaks that had gone on between people between ban it in the white house and other white house officials
were bandaged hatred for a vodka and jared was very public it expose these things and if you're mahler and you see these things sort of fracturing in front of you you want to go in as quickly as possible and get banned in find out what he knows the other thing here that mother may have been doing is trying to give in cover there's two ways
mahler's gonna try and talk to people there is the interview in his office with his investigators which is more informal or there's the grand jury appearance which is as formal as they get its transcribed you can't take your lawyer in it's a much more intense setting so what this does for banning is it gives him
sort of a way of saying look i'm not a rad it's going to give up stuff on the president voluntarily i'm being compelled to do this i'm being legally pushed to go before the grand jury in tell them everything that i know so one way of looking at this subpoena from the special counsel is that they're giving ban in some cover
another way of looking at is that they're forcing him to talk after he probably regrets saying what he said in the book and having this followed with the president
well at the gay mahler's going to compel who he needs to to get the information that he needs in whether that means nicely asking for you to sit down for an interview being a little more stern in compelling you with a grand jury subpoena or going to court to enforce their grand jury subpoena actually getting the f b i t go out and get you
molly's can get what he needs to get to the bottom of this in were just simply watching that process point yeah
thank you michael things family



here's what else you need to know in summary the president's overall health his of this earlier performance during his physical exam was very good on tuesday afternoon the president's doctor ronnie jackson held a news conference to describe the results of his first physical exam of president trumps since taking off
office he would benefit from a diet that is lower and fountain carbohydrates in for a routine exercise regimen during the exam jackson said he performed an additional test the reason that we did the cognitive assessment is several because a president asked me to do he came to me he said is there something we can do a test who were some type of screen that we can do
to assess my cognitive ability in so i looked into the president jackson said got a perfect score the president exceedingly well on it so there was no i've driven it all by it serves i have it was driven by the president's wishes he did well

that's it for the day
i'm a warmer


from the new york times on my cobra all this is the day
today democrats forced to shut down by saying no budget
without a duck
republicans have refused to end the shut down by saying no docket
without a budget deal the us gov is in a stalemate
it's monday january twenty second
we begin with those high stakes negotiations underway at this hour will there be a government shutdown or and eleventh hour deal here so the question as be dad was would there be some negotiation some progress that would lead senate democrats to decide okay fine
we will go along with voting for something that will keep the government open thomas kaplan has been covering the negotiations the possibility of a breakthrough there seemed to come when president trump invited the senate democratic leader chuck schumer to the white house to meet president trump stepping in today with an unexpected invitation to the senate
top democrat chuck schumer to come to the white house over cheeseburgers they talked about the issues that were outstanding say new in my heart
i thought we might have a deal tonight
that was how far we've come
that's how positive our discussion felt we had a good meeting
but there's been plenty of arguing back and forth over what exactly played out in that meeting the way senator schumer calls it he agreed to fund the border wall that president trump wants to build along the southern border with mexico i essentially agreed to give the president something he said he wants in exchange for something we both war
in exchange for the president agreeing to an immigration measure that would protect the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers it is true that chuck schumer made what i consider to be a bowl an important to concession and said yes we'll go forward with the wall as long as we do this on a responsible fair
caution when he had a substantial twenty million others
i'm not going to code members because i don't think that's my place to do it but i can tell you it was a substantial commitment to the president if this is going to have to be a compromise where democrats give something and republicans give something at the end of the day
spending some money on a wall that granted democrats say is unnecessary and is a waste of money and isn't the best way to address securing the border maybe that was something that they could swallow for being able to address the fate of we're talking hundreds of thousands of people are you will wanna
build this monument to stupidity you'll want a waste and you will insist upon wasting twenty billion dollars in i say free to dreamers soon as the border wall just one aspect of an immigration planned that isn't really about how we approach immigration in this country in the way that doing away with the
lottery or what the president calls chain migration is it seems like something they don't mind giving away since it's not an essential question of american immigration and how we approach i think that's right and being a waste of money is sort of a different question from making significant changes to
the immigration system broadly yes democrats think the wall is not the way to go but perhaps spending some money on something they think is unwise would be something they could swallow to get what they really want and as despicable as it is as hurtful to people like me and others in this country we are
ready to sacrifice that so that dreamers can have great memories
so things are looking pretty good coming out of this meeting between schumer and trump in the white house on friday the democrats under this plan that the two are talking through would get a deal on dhaka and the present in would get funding for his wall
she has promised since he started running for president and only sixteen so then what happens well the way the schumer describes it the president backed away from this tentative agreement
and suggested let's do it by tuesday night
we said great
several hours later he called back he said
so i here we have a three week deal
i said know mr president no one's even talk to me about a three week deal i heard that's the deal i said no one's talk to me
cold leader pelosi no one to talk to her
then a few hours later they called back again
well we're gonna need this this this this in addition things it was general kelly that they knew were far far right after the president and schumer seem to have the basics of a deal the white house chief of staff john kelly who is see
as a hard line or on immigration called tumor
and outlined a whole list of objections to what had been sketched out earlier on the day and as the night went on it was clear they said unraveled whatever tentative deal had been sketched out was in tatters here we go there are ten seconds left officially until the top of the hour into there is an affair
government shutdown your lawmakers now still working to try to come up with something but obviously that will be too late
so here's the breaking news it is midnight
no deal as a result at midnight on friday night the government shutdown shut of the federal government is now beginning the democrats had to unify to make this happen great day almost unanimously had to agree to hold out and let the government shutdown if they didn't get what they wanted primarily
some sort of deal on immigration
and they embraced all the political risks that come with being that unified and a triggering a shutdown yeah this was something that i think a lot of people myself included were really skeptical about there are a bunch of senate democrats were up for reelection this year in states that president trump one in two thousand and sixteen
there was a big political risk to be seen as voting to shut the government down and it was a big question mark whether a lot of these democratic senators would be willing to go along with that certainly there were a number of senate democrats particularly some of the most liberal members who really want to push this issue
and demand a solution on dhaka but the vast majority of democratic senator stuck together with this position that this stock capital that did not address immigration was unacceptable sarah to be sanders overnight writing this in a statement senate democrats own the schumer shut down we will not negotiate the status of unlawful integrate
while democrats hold are lawful citizen hostage over their reckless demand this is the behavior of obstructionist losers not legislators out at midnight the government shutdown the blame game started and since then it's been a lot of finger pointing between the two parties and so the republicans
most immediately are pointing at the democrats as having shut the government down over and in their words and unrelated issue not tied to funding the government which is dhaka senate democrats said by chuck schumer they are the ones to blame tonight they are the ones
who really in reality of putting illegal immigrants before you the american people dhaka is in place until march it is not that urgent how are democrats pointing the finger in the other direction at republicans so democrats are very quick to point out that the republican party controls the white house
the house and senate republicans are in control of every branch of government the presidency of course the house the soon it through their nominees the supreme court
the republicans are in complete control of the business comes before the house and senate another piece of the argument has been focused on president trump and this is where schumer and others have said the president must take yes for an answer
until he does it's the trump shut down happy anniversary mr president your wish came true you want in a shut down there champ shut down is all yours it's become this big battle of is this the schumer shut down or the trump shut down on be is preparing for what we're calling their schumer shut down the humor shut down is completely
unnecessary it should be unavoidable both sides had something they could point to in arguing that the other side was to blame
that continued ever since the moment the government shutdown it's been public blame shooting in both directions so what you're describing is pretty much the impasse for the rest of the weekend right do both sides remain locked in the position of on the left democrats saying we won't negotiate spending until you saw a doctor
and on the raid republican saying we will negotiate doctor until you give us a budget that is the outline although there has been a bit of a thaw and this is why there is some reason to be cautiously optimistic that there could be an exit to this crisis that has back to work
the capital and return to the scene of the down the political battle for ideal that will involved dreamers in washington law makers appear to be moving toward a deal to and the government shutdown alive for you at capitol hill where lawmakers continue to negotiate and in a stalemate a group of moderate senators from both
please met over the weekend to try to chart a path forward some kind of compromise that put an end to this neither side would really get what they want in the sense that some kind of compromise would perhaps involve some kind of commitment that dhaka
will be addressed in the senate in the weeks to come so would not be an actual deal on immigration
and as part of that perhaps democrats would then be willing to vote for a spending bill that would reopen the government for a short period of time perhaps a couple weeks and end this crisis so democrats would get new guarantee of what would happen
in those negotiations
if a short term budget deal is past just an agreement to keep discussing teacher of issues i doctor so that's the big question now is what exactly will this commitment promise pledge whatever you want to call it on immigration be one obvious issue that comes up here is
so mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader agrees down vote on a dock a bill in a few weeks
it doesn't do a heck of a lot of good from a democratic point of view if that bill passes the senate but that is dead on arrival in the house and never goes anywhere so just a promise to have a bow in the senate might not be enough in the eyes of some so that's really now the biggest lingering question
in is what promises are concessions could be made on how immigration could be handled in the weeks to come and will those promises concessions be concrete enough to demeaning fall to democrats
and i'm struck by the fact they're all of this uncertainty in congress seems to come back to these meetings at the white house and what happens when members of congress go there to try to work out a deal on immigration the trump or support this all started last week when dick durbin and lindsey graham
i thought they had a deal with the president and then it seems trumps aid steven miller stepped in and the deal's off now we have reports that the president's chief of staff john kelly played a similar role in stepping in and calling off the deal with chuck schumer on friday
i think it's a real point of frustration on capitol hill in dealing with the white house and the president which is certainly something that schumer and democrats have said how do you negotiate with someone who agrees to something commits to something and then that agreement that commitment suddenly
wiped away what's even more frustrating than present and trumps intransigence is the way he seems amenable to these compromises
before completely switching positions and backing off negotiating with president trump is like negotiating with jello even today a republican lindsey graham complained about steven miller i've talked with the president his heart is right on this issue and think he's got a good understood
hall or sale in every time we have a proposal is only a bag by staff members his longest david miller miller's in charge of negotiating immigration were going nowhere he's been an outlier for years they help us make sense of something president from started all this by rescinding dhaka and sending
to congress and telling congress this is yours to solve and indicating very clearly that he wanted to protect the dreamers but at every step along the way it's felt like the president himself has blocked congress effort to do just that how do you make sense of that well i think that's why there's so much
frustration in congress certainly among democrats they say the president created this crisis he set in motion
this entire saga he created this uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of people in ever since then it's been hard to pin down what exactly he was i think a big reason that we are in this position now
is that lack of trust and the fact that lawmakers struggled to figure out what the president wanted them to do the president sent different signals a different times and democrats really question whether something would actually get done on this issue
and i think that motivated a lot of people to really forced the issue and say
we need to take a firm stand and if it means shutting down the government then that's something that they felt comfortable doing
thank you very much thank you
on sunday ne senate majority leader mitch mcconnell announced that he was delaying only night vote on a temporary spending bill until today at me a signal that the plan being worked out by moderate senators who was progress
it would be my intention to pursue the legislation that would address gaga
border security and related issues in a gesture to lawmakers who are demanding that the senate address the fate of the dreamers mcconnell said he planned to move ahead with immigration legislation next month if the issue had not already been resolved go a step back on the brink

soon the killer tell me about walking into the court room and tuesday morning
i'm a while when i walked in the first thing that i really noticed was all the girls that i recognize that i've competed were trained with my colleagues sabrina to have uneasy talked with a former gymnast look healer thrush i really wasn't nervous or scared or anything i was just
to get my statement i've had to be quiet for so long
i was really excited to be able to speak it's bent over or maybe like a week span i've been putting together my statement and did a lot of editing a lot of adding things lot of taking things out and then my whole away their i kept thinking that maybe it's not complete maybe it is i don't know you entered the next if however you will hear
he has agreed to be publicly identified her name is nicola kayla thrash right
they called my name and i looked at my fiance is useful scott there with me

you are likely to know well i promised myself i wasn't going to cry and i was okay but then i took a deep breath
i would like to start out by saying that i was a gymnast get her to twist arts from the age of seven until the age of seventeen but i've been doing gymnastics since three
gymnastics isn't just about fancy we encourage you to four medals trophies you can get from morning a competition
it's blood sweat and tears and i didn't even make it like for the first couple words than i already started crying

is in the power of your voice thank you for speaking out in breaking your silence
thank you
yeah i the next survivor
we wish to me
the
so lie nasser an incredibly trusted doctor for athletes particularly gymnast for many years emily basil on rate above the law for the new york times magazine he was the physician that you tried to go to see if you are struggling with your body which of course many gymnast are going to talk
and what did you do
the to have now
how would you feel the pain is here comes across a little bit through here
this for regis
touch and what we've learned since two thousand and sixteen when the indy star did an expos day is that he was abusing his position of trust he was molesting many many girls you have come forward at first when these charges were brought doctor and ask are denied all of them michigan state university where he's on the faculty he said
had no evidence you done anything wrong but he was criminally charged and in november he pled guilty in court in michigan to seven counts of criminal sexual misconduct
eighteen homosexual hundred first degree relations your personal virgins your first wife your brother
yeah sure sure
this is a man who has pled guilty and what is at issue is the degree of punishment he wrote should receive


and now at the sentencing the judges deciding how to punish them
users you are you use were from the testimony your money
with than a million you
newsroom
mature here
and she first made a statement that she was planning to punish hand the maximum degree possible that she thought he should live out the rest of his life in prison but then this time
it was just
she really opened the mike two survivors who wanted to come forward to testify about their experiences the first time i stepped into one of the exam rooms and apps are had and is worth than i was twelve i say if nintendo was fourteen and tell them i was eleven years old when i first went to see larry i was seven years old
i was only twelve i had been patient and so it was eight years old
the pain you have caused the mentally and emotionally if unexplainable this is what we're seeing happen not just once or twice very sexually assaulted me repeatedly under the guise of medical treatments for nearly a year but over seven days i remember the first time very that at the a wave of women came forward and testified i remember how
absolutely mortified i was when you asked me if i had started my period yet because you couldn't do the treatment if i had a tampon in and i was taught that is now okay for anyone to touch you don't there unless it's the doctor and you weren't a world renowned
people who had not testified during the gulf phase of the trial who had not been cross examined but we're there to speak to the fact that masters abuse the misconduct had on them when they were growing up the crimes that larry nasser committed against me have altered my life for number
very good relations
this
me and we have over one hundred and fifty women coming forward in this way
it's an incredibly unusual even unprecedented moment in the united states court room to have this kind of impact from the testimony of victims at a fat and saying i've just never seen anything like it before
in what is the judge say while i can't imagine
nineteen ninety seven this happening you and not one person and and they were all so the judge many clear that this was for the victims for other survivors your words are a sign that you are feeling you're taking your power bad you're giving him back
nine
he will fall in your rise acting in a way that's quite unusual from the bench you and your sister survivors
are easily the friend
remain behind bars
the rest of his natural wife she was thinking each women as she came forward survivors or warriors and your words of goes victory
i don't know if you're all feel it now but you will
you are so strong and wonderful
oh we're having here is a kind of cathartic moment it has to do with the therapeutic effect if there is one for survivors in giving voice to what happened to them and striking back serves in the military
and
the army women are performing
without any battle with you as my leader
so this just making a choice about the role that victim should be allowed to play in a courtroom


you know we've been as a society debating about the role that victim should play how much they should be at the center of the criminal law for a very long time we often talk about in a kind of shorthand way the idea that like a victim is pressing charges against someone but that's not actually how it works it's the people vs larry and
nasser not alleyways race man or any other particular woman whose pressing these charges and when we see the people winning this stage we me in the state the government as the representatives of the people and what's important about that is that the prosecution doesn't actually represent a person they don't represent the victim there's this idea
have a kind of large your motivation of justice that doesn't depend on an individual victim
but around the nineteen seventies a lot of victim started complaining that they felt left out of the process that sometimes prosecutors and defense lawyers ignored them
there needs just for not being met at the same time there was some concern about the emotional a fact that hearing from a victim can have on a jury and on a judge and fear that there was something that of biased about this that could turn people toward more punishment and toward retribution and
a way that seemed prejudicial
for youth
fill in the nineteen eighties the supreme court entered this debate in the context of the death penalty teams used to the thumbs and to his victims always a meeting murder victims
as included in this case included
family members who obviously were upset by the column has anyone would be there were not closing in any way at the crime the question in this nineteen eighty seven supreme court case was whether a statement could be offered into evidence where the probation officer was talking about the people who'd been killed and the impact of the crime
on their surviving family members
was introduced to new evidence mr
have the testimony
the statements egg the made them so this is what's called a victim impact statement and the supreme court was deciding whether it was proper and constitutional to allow that to state statement at the penalty phase of a death penalty proceeding at the sentencing phase in other words and at first the supreme court said no
when a judge is deciding whether to send someone to death they are not allowed to hear about the effects the murder has had on family members and why not what was the reasoning they decided that because they said that the effect of the crime on a family members was not related to the blame the of the defendant
i think what you're seeing here is the fear that when we allow victims to inject emotion into the courtroom that there's something prejudicial about that though we're going to end up with heavier punishments for bad reasons and emily then what happened it was overturned at some point right that's right on the record
unknown number nineteen fifty seven twenty one
used to see so for years later the supreme court and essentially hairs a very similar case and reverses that earlier judgment will hold the moon would urge no automatic bomb prohibiting new capital since june from considering the gym do evidence relating to the victims bruce personal current roosters and in this later decision
and what the court says is the hearing from victims help educate the judge who's meeting out the sentence about what the harm of the crime has been in the process of behind and for cuban criminal defendants shoes
in the victim's family are often more on move to become soon blues to tuesday
howard victim impact statements use today what's the common usage now
it's a common thing that happens now is bad when someone has been sentenced there's a moment where the judge will let the people who are the most affected by the crime come forward and talk in a kind of oh been pretty informal way about what happened to them that i think is the very powerful element of what we saw the michigan car
from this week you know women seen each other wanting to support each other wanting to make it clear that the person who should feel shame and guilt here is doctor nasser not any of that

do it



do you mind if agency to defend inherently thrown may seem to think
cleary marines
larry larry larry larry i trusted you larry you or my dearest friend you larry where the gentle one you never inches to them being clogged are you really read my doctor my adult and most importantly my friend recently
i was abused in my own home by you i was abused at your office that unless you
i was abused in your basement
when my mum said on the coach in your children were upstairs
today and say that i saying this is if you haven't listened to one thing i have said he to look at me and listen you ten this for i love into something or here you've violated the various principle of you're calling
do know have i pray that you larry spend the rest of your life behind ours you cannot break me larry
i am the survivor

any moment now former usa gymnastics doctor larry nasser is going to learn what his punishment is for sexually abusing more than one hundred and sixty girls under his hair is moment
take us through what happened in the courtroom on wednesday
goes to church
what happened on wednesday was about barry nasa apologize your words several lose
significant
go to work or so before all this outpouring of testimony nasa actually complained to the judge that he shouldn't have to sit there that it was mentally difficult for him to hear and he also kind of blamed though when in so that made him seem like someone who really not wreck
end with his own guilt
the most the of your peers and comparison
the bush administration
rather short statement in court that was very different from the statements he made earlier in which at least it appeared that he was really absorbing what these women had to say to him
for that
to prove
whoa whoa
sorry
my phone with a mix of origin
these to your own do
thanks
so essentially these victim impact statement this whole process
yes it works potentially as healing device for survivors and victims but maybe the says something about what it does for the perpetrator of crime is that right
i think that is possible and it brings to mind the idea that when you have a crime of the victim sometimes if you bring together both sides there's a kind of reckoning and a healing that can come out of that that is more powerful than perhaps sending someone to jail or prison because it really creates more understand
dang and i think sometimes victims want is the sense that the person who's hurt them really understand what that means and what they've done

and seventy five
one one month
just fine
the judge is really sad herself up as a kind of figure of wrath and retribution in this case and so she sent doctor and asked her to one hundred and seventy five years in prison and then she also talked about why she was doing that
i'm doing
if you home
the sentencing
so there's a moment where the judge says i'm not special i'm just doing my job
and meet kind of feels like the heart of what we're talking about the she doing her job or is this inappropriate behavior for a judge in a criminal case you know we are going gonna have a long debate about that it's an example of a judge i'd say pushing the boundaries of her job and there i think has been a lot of catharsis as a result of the
she has taken other people are gonna i'm sure accuse her of grandstanding and of going too far of making this kind of personal and making naps are into a kind of state go figure that's though the debate i'm sure we're gonna be having
and i think there is also a recognition that victims have to be in some way at the heart of criminal proceeding said well we're talking about when we talk about a crime with the victim is something that has had an effect on a human being often quite terrible effect and so if we don't
wow victims to talk about what's happened to them if we don't pull them inside of the criminal justice system and then what's the point

when i was addressing him i went to go glimpse at him i didn't really want to because i didn't know if he was actually going to look at me and acknowledge what i'm saying but finally i kind of got the guts to do and i looked at him and he was actually looking at me and i mean i don't know if he was taking
in everything i was saying but
he was somewhat acknowledging lead to some extent in think that totally through the end of your state and so when you finished
you feel
well towards the end i kept thinking that there were things that i forgot to say or that i skipped through
i mean i walked up there feeling like i was carrying one hundred pound weight on my shoulders
and then you walk away from it
like it was just gone
did it feel like something had changed for you what did that mean for you i mean i don't wanna say that i feel great now because i don't i feel as if it's a step it just feels like a step that's one person that we can remove and
the deal with any more but there's other people that need to be dealt with you i mean you have to think of everyone else that enabled them
i definitely feel about maybe fifty percent better there is still other things that when they get dealt with
be a completely different person

thank you so much michela things

many of the victims who addressed leary master in court this week
also demanded accountability from us he gymnastics
the us olympic committee in michigan state university were nestor was employed as a doctor
since the testimony began last week the chairman and several board members of us a gymnastics have resigned the head of the olympic committee apologized for not attending the hearing and on wednesday evening the president of michigan state university
an assignment stepped down



hughes what else you need committed
in a super is exchange with reporters on wednesday
president trump said he was willing to be interviewed by special counsel robert mother saying i would love to do that i'd like to do it as soon as pass rubber miller will be fair to you in this larger investigation will find out
how are you concerned because here's what russia
and everyone says no colors
is no collusion oh well
if i
sure just fight back all it's structured so is a thing
i hope so the president's lawyers have been negotiating with mothers teams about the terms of an interview for weeks and the president noted to the reporters that any interview would be quote subject to my lawyers and all of that
and on wednesday afternoon with two weeks until government funding runs out again white house press secretary sarah could be sanders held a news cause she the white house release a legislative framework on monday that represents a compromise that members of both parties can support we encourage the center
to bring it to the floor
this framework will fulfill the for agreed upon pillars securing the border and closing legal loopholes
indeed extended family chain migration canceling the lottery and providing a permanent solution on doctor after decades of in action by congress it's time we work together to solve this issue once and for all the american people deserve no less
question sanders was asked was about want a permanent solution for doctor with me
the path to citizenship
well if i told you now what kind of take away the fun for monday but hours later in his conversation with reporters at the white house
the president said the solution could be a path to citizenship
after ten to twelve years

that


from new york times on michael barbara this is the
today
earlier this month the us government announced it would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to pakistan
in the time since afghanistan has experienced one of the most violent and deadly periods in its sixteen
how the two are connected
it's tuesday january thirty
would you tell us about this past week of violence in afghanistan will do less attack was this morning new jean michel covers afghanistan for the times it was snowing this morning so cold morning know about five o'clock dark of the night about five attackers
got into this mode or university at the heart of kabul raking over night nearly a dozen kelvin a terror attack on the afghan an afghan military base just the latest assault and a surge of violence and the afghan capital walk to the crack of gunfire early monday the latest in a wave of deadly attacks after weekend agree
and they fought for about five hours and they killed eleven soldiers and sixteen
they are holding eight by ten o'clock know the attack was over but it shit much with the city
just because it was coming off the backers a couple weeks
attacks is old comes after a saturday bomb and in kabul killed more than a hundred people
a little you
families are burying are dead their been three attacks in the space of a week
so the deadliest of the attacks of the past two weeks was on saturday where the taliban packed an ambulance with explosives
they drove the right to the center city you're using an ambulance why an ambulance because the city is pretty militarized and there are check point
every corner there bomb sniffing dogs so it was a good disguised for them special young street where they detonated it there was a hospital there was a major hospital and subsequent interviews security guards said wall we looked at the ambulance at the first coined we thought it's an ambulance you know it's it's probably carry
a do though they'll person to the hospital
they pass the first checkpoint at the second ship orange they detonate explosives and out about least three people killed more than did that
was damaged so that was the biggest of the attacks but about a week before the attack there was a long season over one of the main hotels and cobble to situation or solving and afghanistan tonight after forgotten been attacked the intercontinental hotel and this is the largest hotel tell the capital there's held hilltop until very historical seen
close
gunmen entered and killed about twenty two people most of them pilots and crew blogging one airline stuff going on airline that's where they could up all their foreign stuff they're mostly ukrainians the pilots from venezuela stay there because they thought that was one of the few safe places
that remained city
the attack been so easily just bug a lot of people's minds at but three guys arrive in a fan full of explosives deprived of and they just walk right in three other guys have stayed the hotel already infiltrated possibly state days and they start shooting from the inside and then the support
eyelids crew members and dozens of guess they're just cut their some of them you know jumps from the balconies and use their bed she's as makeshift robe and there's one guy is greek pilots
who had his own mattress and of try to hide in there and leave the windows of his room open to act out that he had fled the room you know because this was a fifteen hour see people would try and everything
so it is just been two weeks of very very back to back violence to a point where the dead of the first attack have not been counted for people are still searching for family members when the second attack happened some bodies are the more that still haven't been identified just because that's
how badly damaged they were it's just been that kind of intensity back to bed it hasn't given the residents of the city
breathing schools
who has claimed responsibility for these three attacks or do we hold responsible for the first to tax your claim by the taliban the third one was claimed by isis
but i was going officials were saying nobody should be fooled by that that this is all one concentrated taliban violence
you're describing a series of attacks that sound deliberately designed to terrorize and terrified people in kabul is that how it feels now are people just terrified yes yes i think everybody i've spoken to tear
fight
after morning the dead their sorrow has tend to anger they're striking where they can create the most fear and they've done that many residents say they need longer trust the government to keep them safe and every time an attack like that happens a good part of the city just shuts down because ages
turns into for military zone the city already is very military i see if you roundabout you go to u c security forces
main part specially a diplomatic area or the government offices are aware the businesses are that area chokes for traffic or day because every round about their security for surgeons vehicles and you know they have narrowed the streets to slow down to traffic snake a church
and the fact that the government is paid turning the city into military zone
cannot prevent these kind of high profile attacks in heavily guarded areas is what kind of takes a toll on citizens and a reminder everyday how vulnerable you know everything in the city is we want justice for our people we want senior security officials to resign as an afghan citizen
i cannot expect explosions and suicide attacks every day when we go to work we have no hope to come home alive how much longer do we have to put up
is this taliban's way of saying they can strike it will at the heart as the city close to government institutions and the government really can't do anything about it except few even more heat from his own people
not being able to stop the attacks

can you give us a sense of what it's really like to be a civilian in kabul right now hopeless feel what it's like to be there what it looks like what it sounds like is there any joy at all in life in kabul despite all this
i think there is joy but there's also a lot of guilt gil guess that people move on very quickly
an attack may cause them during lunch
and they made toned down the volume of the music playing at the cafe as the bomb goes off
and as the answer calls family members loved ones friends to say they're fine they go back to their lunch
i'll be
i'm talking in third person or an now but i should talk about this is my experience on saturday
on saturday when the big ambulance bombing happened i was at lunch with a friend and during the lunch we did not hear the explosion but everybody around a started getting calls and that is a sign when you know something has happened in the city
and everybody started talking to each other the say about aware was the bombings and trying to narrow down so he did call friends in that area rather than calling frantically around the city
so the music at the cafe was turned down for a few minutes
and the food stamps for a little while but wants to cause him paid and once people found out that it wasn't their loved ones
it was a year is sort of normalcy and yet
hash pay through returning to the meal my friend and i looked at each other and you're like this is pretty strange
every other day
people die like that
you try to go back to a sense of normalcy but you know it is not normal
oh this is not normal say it's that when i say guilt and that sense of guilt
gilded even when the scale of these and the frequency are so big that you've become inured to in a little
yes yes
and guild also that is so in your face the violence and the loss and the people suffering
and yet you still try to draw moment of normalcy
you know how widespread the suffering is

these three attacks considered a major escalation of the violence
for i mean even for people in kabul who sound nom who can go back to lunch when the music is put back high and the food service has resumed even for everyone like that
was the past week particularly gruesome and terrifying
absolutely absolutely in the past i've seen maybe last year or two years ago it will be say one dramatic attack a month or one dramatic attack every two months or so right
but now it just feels like not only the attacks are closer together but they have just done wade deadlier in terms of casualties and in terms of size of the bomb and in terms of the locations also where people with think don't have confidence of security but how easily they construct those areas
tell us more about that someone who's been reporting on this situation in afghanistan for years what's actually going on here so a lot of the escalation right now the violence is in a way related to a decision president trump took in december
he inherited a war that had gone on for sixteen years
two presidents before him had put their fingers on the root cause of the war but they had struggled to do something with it and that route cause was pakistan
that's very important for the people in pakistan and afghanistan to understand that america respects religion i am gravely concerned about the situation in pakistan pakistan shares a long border with afghanistan pakistan gives the leaders of the insurgency in afghanistan a safe haven
their leaders can just sit there and they're away from the american airstrikes stay away from the afghan forces taken his plan and no continue and execute attacks because pakistan uses this insurgency to gain political influence and afghanistan we have been paying pakistan
billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting for close to decades as invested in this proxy force to try to gain political influence and afghanistan to create the government wants in this neighboring country exactly but that
we'll have to change and that will change the president in december
said i'm gonna go after pakistan and i'm going to pressure pakistan president trump is split pakistan or knows cut about a billion dollars worth of security aid in pakistan and he told pakistan to stop harboring terrorists today we can confirm that we are spending security assistance security assistance only to pakistan at this time
until the pakistani government takes decisive action against groups including the afghan taliban and the how county network we consider them to be destabilizing the region and also targeting us person now the united states will spend that kind of security assistance to pakistan
when he did that everybody who has followed and observe got a son including afghan officials were saying there's going to be an escalation of pakistan and will not submit to us pressure so easily we should expect for increased violence across afghanistan particularly in urban centers
because that is just easier it takes a harder toll and one attack one guy coming what a suicide vest in a city or capture more headlines and it will show the afghan government in kabul as much weaker so that is the escalation we're seeing right now so the town and with these recent attack
facts are trying to weaken the afghan government as much as possible in a way that benefits pakistan's position in the region and ultimately could therefore benefit the taliban's because the two are nurture each other
pretty much pretty there is a big picture go
the immediate it almost seems reactionary also just to show to be americans and to trunk
we're capable workers kinder reach deep inside a city where a us back government has been better for seventeen years and it cannot protect it so good the united states anticipate that the action it took against pakistan might trigger this kind of escalation and if it did does it
assume that that is the cost of a longer term defeat of the taliban and stopping pakistan from from harboring it a lot of people including american officials expected this escalation
and a lot of them knew that they would have to be patients for this kind of bloodshed first brief period at least him before we could get anywhere
tours a resolution to the war
they expected this kind of reaction from the taliban
who
is there a world in which this escalation shows that the us strategy which seems to be a long term strategy for defeating the taliban and making pakistan stop harboring them is there a case of me that these absolutely horrible terror attacks are signs that the us strategy
is in some way working as hard as that is to conceive given that so many people are dying
i think so because the escalation was expected it's just that question of how much of this escalation can a week afghan government absorb and how much american attention there is to make sure if falls clues and gets to see you next step of keeping the pressure on pakistan
those are very very big if
that is what is making your question kind of difficult the signs are that it is playing out like that pressure on pakistan escalation but what is it question right now is next step and then next step because of the death toll makes that next step difficult and by extension makes a bigger short
your strategy difficult present trump is expected to address the situation in afghanistan
tonight in his state of the union address what do people in kabul and in afghanistan
want to hear from the us president right now is there anything that they could hear from him that would make them feel secure in this moment and that there's hope
for this city in this country
i think an acknowledgement that
brutality
that has happened last couple weeks and an acknowledgement that is seen within that focused limbs
i started pressure and
i expected a backlash an escalation
the afghans everyday average afghans who may not understand the strategy and this grand chess game
are paying the price i acknowledge him but we're going to stay on in to make sure that one hundred and thirty people killed in two weeks
it's not just another number in the long casualty toll of this war
didn't get us closer tourism
and
thank you thank you michael

we'll be right back



here's what else you need to another day on monday the deputy director of the f b i and andrew mackay abruptly step down following months of accusations from president trump and his allies that mccain had led a politically motivated investigation into the trunk campaigns ties to russia
but in cave is telling friends he felt pressured to resign not by president trumped by the director of the f b i christopher rain and in a news conference on monday afternoon white house press secretary sarah how could be sanders we enforce that version of the fifth
say president not flair
yes
it wasn't hard of this decision making process and we would refer you to dave
yeah i have were first foray serves as the director which as i said last week and i'll repeat against today the president has full confidence in him and has put the decisions and the f b i is he
we had recently expressed his concerns about an internal justice department investigation into action to buy mccain and other senior officials during the two thousand and sixteen presidential campaign when the f b i was investigating both hillary clinton's email used and the trump campaigns ties to russia
trump again criticize him a came after reports in october two thousand and sixteen that my kids wife good run as a democrat for the virginia legislature had received campaign donations from a close ally of clinton's
and we need to restore the credibility to the american people to me if there's nothing no national security being breached i think the american people should have access to this information republican members of the house intelligence committee voted to release a controversial nemo accusing the f b i miss you using its
in the russia has to he wanted attained a secret surveillance order on a former trump campaign adviser in two thousand and sixty in voting to release the memo which contains classified information house republicans disregarded warnings from the justice department that making it public would be quote extra
ordinarily reckless and they have infuriated democratic members of the committee like adam schiff who called it a partisan effort to undercut the f b eyes investigation sadly we can fully expect that the person united states will not with the national interest
over his own personal interest but it is a sad day
when that is also true of our own committed because today this committee voted to put the president's personal interest perhaps their own political interest above the national interest
the president trump now has five days to decide whether the memo should become public despite the objections from his own justice
he has repeatedly indicated that he wants him with

that's it for the day i'm like of a him

from new york times on michael verbal off the is the day
today from the moment he was appointed donald trump's administrator has been cast by environmentalists as an idiot
on a mission to destroy the very agency he was he sees it differently a conversation with scott through it
it's friday february second
initiator pruitt i think for most of us our introduction to you came when you are attorney general of oklahoma so take us up to that point in your career what was the story of scott pruitt before you became attorney general or does it start when you know i don't go too far
so i grew up in kentucky and spent most of my teenage years
i school and college aspiring to be a mutually baseball player found out that junior senior year after some surgeries and what not that that wasn't going to happen and started thinking about other things in law school took me in oklahoma so you know the journey the attorney general was something that i didn't anticipate either
and once you become a j general you make a series of decisions about where you're going to use your resources and you end up suing the environmental protection agency fourteen times and i wonder why wealth and mentally as we look at the environmentalist and it's michael that of minutes passed by congress and and miniature about it for a number of years
the heart of corporate federalism cooperative that allows it's the partnership of the states where states or vested with responsibilities along with the federal government to ensure that certain outcomes are g to protect the environment and so congress recognize that the inception of these environmental statutes that we adopted in the nineteen seventies that you can have a one size fits all strategy because the issue
facing utah the second most tri state in the country are much different than the issues facing minnesota this truly is a partnership that has existed since the inception of the day and sometimes that partnership gets out of balance
and there's an emphasis were perhaps decisions made at federal level or paternalistic in dictatorial and don't recognize how issues impact states in a different the time frame that you're talking about the fourteen lawsuits
from my perspective that was driven largely by this imbalance this use the statute some ways that had not been done historically were attorneys general looked at a statue clean water at clean air act and said authority given to a state has been taken away we need to ensure that we protect that right or that responsibility and that's what prompted the lawsuit and you believe
from what i can tell that under the last administration president obama that was overreaching or over stepping in its policies
help me understand and it's rulemaking humming ocean with that means what was that the environmental protection agency doing what in your mind was not just objectionable but illegal thing about it this way women are called the clean water act and what gives the federal government jurisdiction is a definition of something called the waters in the united states
jurisdiction of our agency is actually put in the play by weather or water is a the united states are not so the agents in two thousand and fifteen engage in rulemaking to define a lot of the and states and to find it so broadly it included dry creek beds and southwest oklahoma it included fennel drainage ditches in salt lake city utah
and so people that were seeking to build subdivisions salt lake or use their land and on the parts of the country the first place they had to stop was washington dc to say give me authority to use mile and farmers rancher don't instead of visions across the spectrum because the agency stretched the definition so broadly created uncertainty that's what i mean is that when you when you have an agency
taking rulemaking that takes authority to the point of words not recognise born with that you'd guess what happens is a result uncertainty it sounds like it with agencies like the patient should stick to the letter of things should be someone's describe you as an original i think that's fair term in a thing as a good description of what we're seeking a there is a very
rove the what's happened over the last ten years or so is the agency evolved and morphed into something that was almost like super agency where it was using his authority ways to displace that partnership that i talked about the very beginning why when you are trying to narrow of oklahoma was deviate such a target of yours
this agency
well when you look at the state of oklahoma and the responsibilities given the state of oklahoma to regulate for instance in a natural gas space that was a part of the clean air act that the agency to be before i arrived was using a weapon eyes fashion to force a federal plan upon the state the cost billions of dollars utility companies had to
convert power generation to natural gas were nobles and no coercion
represent the state's interest the state sovereignty issue with respect to our responsibility to get on that statue and exercise our responsibilities and clean air act were being displaced a certainly there were lots of of targets that you could choose as attorney general's the chief law enforcement official and that states
no he's our repel of but why the i did you see it is particularly egregious in over stepping in your mind against the interests of states to me in this goes to i think when a great challenges we have presently with respect environmental issues in this country today what is true mormonism and i think the agency took a perspective for a number
years that it's prohibition
that though we've been blessed with natural resources that help us literally feed the world and power of the world
that we should not what develop those natural resources we should put fences up and we should prohibit that in so in some respects michael the rule making that was being deployed by the agency was weapon eyes in the sense of picking winners and losers
weapon eyes and sense of saying we were going to favor certain types of outcomes in the market with respect to energy and environment that's not the rover regular the rover regulators may think regular to take a statute to use its authority to fairly enforce it against all those that are regulated by those regulations but not to pick winners and losers the agency for a
number of years in view was picking winners and losers in use and authority to displace states involvement in partnership and that's why the lawsuits at are giving my all that we've just discussed and the those lawsuits the logical question is why did you want to become the head of the environmental protection agency to fix this
and to get back to the fundamentals the basics of operating pursuant to roll long reestablishing process recognizing the partnership of federalism recognize that we can achieve better things together the he can't do business in a way that is disrespectful disdainful of rule of law speak to two partners that you've worked with the years
as what adversaries like the states all those things are in my estimation damaging into getting better outcomes and what we are to be doing together as a country to advance environmental protection when you were nominated for position i'm sure you know this their heads of environmental groups or anxious and they said so and a said things like having screwed in charge of
he is like putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires and and that may offend you
nato and they have a muse you but i wonder what it represents to you to oversee the and be so at odds with so many of the groups that seal as it their job that is not only been on a british don't know me the thing is what these kinds of comments represent is all it's wrong in environmental space today telling me well people put on jerseys charges
yes idea you're pro business i'm pro environment you're pro environment and it's it's a political thing it's not about results when we talked about superfund clean up and accountability we are thirteen or forty sites across the country these are parasites considered of a polluted almost beyond those most polluted sites we have any one of the country from the uranium to lead and these
sites have languished for years not language because we wanted the technology clean it up we just had a ne made decisions we just haven't brought the agency the point of saying let's figure out what's going on was figure out what the options are less make a decision let's get accountability to get clean up today i'm on announce westlake it's taken twenty seven year to get a decision
and this is misery misery uranium buried in the soil
forty year plus the you now imagine that agency put westlake on the list and nine hundred ninety one i came into this position twenty seven years later the agency stores and that made a decision on how to clean it up man to make the decision of an independent and now worth eighth and about that
are you saying that the expectation of eve is that it will blindly side with environmentalist or has been in the past and then you see the the agency as to follow the law and sometimes that will mean making decisions that environmentalist agree with sometimes that will mean making decisions that the energy industry he original as
the term is used earlier we are housed in the executive branch and fifth grade civics tells us what if you hang on the executive branch your job is to enforce the law okay so the only authority i have comes for is the authority given to me by the legislative branch and congress in if congress doesn't give me that authority i can't make it up largely what's happened with the bass administration is they did
latter they made it up
and look and that's what blame on a different kind of leadership stuff are different kind of approach but the fact that congress is dysfunctional in is not updating the clean air act or clean water act are all these very statutes that we administer the fact that congress that doing that doesn't give the to say was going to do it in your place with a pinch it because then what happens we're doing things
we shouldn't do there's a perception that their that in the first year of the presidency a lot of the work of agencies has been in deregulating undoing many of the regulations and the policies put in effect under the obama administration would you agree with that assessment that when it comes to the much of the work has been undoing rather
then doing look we've had a lot of work addressing these deficient rules so a good part of our work is cleaning up that mess the next day up with something that's often missed is getting it right going for like on on the origin i say we have a rule that withdraws it and we have proposed rules coming out in april that provides such a definition so is that deal
and is that regulatory clarity like regulatory certain elbows it's probably all those things right
so from my perspective it is what it is we have deficient rules in the books were addressing those and we're providing it or doing the work frankly or doing the work of the agency
point in the simplest terms what do you believe the core of the should be what should it be focused on in this month i mean technically our role is to administer of the statutes that congress has given us responsibility diminish your the toxic substances zero the clean air act i mean that all those acts
forcing later ministry that but beyond that it is to truly obviously as we do their protect the health and environment and this country it's that and i will tell you there are some in that environment of space that believe me know what you should use your power to the punitive in weapon eyes it to would eradicate certain forms of energy at the expense of others that you simply wrong
wrong headed it's definitely the statute
if there either way i want or need you on this role for people who aren't paying close attention to you and to the i think the last thing that they might know is the back in october you repeal the clean power plant a signature climate change policy put in place by the obama administration with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by pushing states
to move away from coal in particular
is there a place in this approach that you're describing this original ism for the
to fight climate change does the law and your mind allow for the service early curtail or even eliminate in some cases and industry that the scientific community and the government community agrees contributes to climate change perhaps perhaps though what we ought to be thinking about
his again what does the statute say so you're saying of has to change the law and order for you then to on climate change what i mean the past ministrations again pinch shit they filled in the blank they said we're going to die
well we're going to use it we're going to we're going to use power fill in the space to say we're going to do what we're going to try to force power generation shifting from fossil fuel to to renewable what we've done you mention october us issue that proposed rule withdraws he also didn't offer what also did in december is are issued something
got an advanced notice a proposed rule making you know what i said in that i won't comment from about across the country
provide input and information on the authority this agency to do exactly what you described so we've already begun what i think our obligation is which is to make a decision on really what does the scope what does the authority what is the jurisdiction under section one eleven the clean air act with led to power generation that we should not forget that we can engage in a result orient
brooch we just we have to ask the question as the authority there when you say it was all meaning like they're people who see an urgency to something like climate change and they want to just they want to override some of the regulatory language concerns that you're describing and your answer seems to be then give me the legal power or create a legal problem i'm going to do and
my own and this administration i can do it like the last one it just because the view exists in the scientific community that this is an issue that must be dealt with doesn't mean that i as he paid minnesota are going to deal with it just me and to deal with is infinite
you said it largely well you know the sense that it's the responsibility of those that pass the statue to give us the authority to gauge whatever it is that they want from solid waste as ways to whatever it is you have my be and i will tell you the jury is out literally and figuratively
on what authority exist under the clean air act with respect these issues in a lord acton talked about political atheism at times and and i think that's what you described is that you know we really don't care i get there the process stuff and rule of law stuff that's not that to get there was this do something what you know what they're doing something or that yielded and
the past no progress at all that's what's so fascinating to me about people say oh you're you're withdrawn clean power plant that's terrible well what is the clean power plant achieve the country
what part of that had any impact on a ban on our comes zero how do we know that everyone into effect why didn't they going to have it
the supreme court for the first time in history issued a day during the tendency of litigation because it it's concern about the unlawful us of the clean power plant adopted in two thousand and fifteen body so so if you really care about these issues you need to make each branch do their job and our branch is a branch that existed and forth
law so on these issues around do you care about these issues that issue
quite frankly i will get these issues i think the debate about the impact of c o two is important for us to wrestle with as a country there are some the believe that it's causes an existential threat and it's tomorrow i mean that the penetration that was more important isis you know what i can tell you this if that issue is more important than isis
i want to know about it
but here's my view on it there are things we know i think we don't know i think pretty arrogant for people in two thousand and eighteen
to say you know we know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year twenty one hundred now is that different than what climate change is happening yet climate change is happening
so as we look through these issues we need to ask be much more i think inquisitive and i think the american people deserve an open honest transparent objective debate about these issues because if you're gonna foreign policy around that that needs to occur but she's ask the tough questions less help inform public policy but after we do all that michael astra issue here
she is what what authority do if the last thing people remember is is the repeal of the clean power plant about your time in his first year is that okay by you will look i mean i think that that is a very necessary thing i think withdrawing the deficient two thousand and fifteen roll the clean power plant
is absolutely an important thing and i think it was reflective of an attitude of a what innovation as i told you with respect to how we did business strongly that changing so i think what will be something that would be more lasting is recognizing by removing that and moving to different way to and business we restored the way we done business historically and that means good outcomes an american forward
punisher per thank you for your time thanks michael pressure like was
no
when we come back we talk to the times environment or homeowner about our conversation with scott
hey it's like oh i make our how are you it's been so long it's been too long
now anti and i'm excited to be back coral davenport covers the for the times i just have this kind of philosophical conversation with administrator pruitt about his role at the the
central point he made was whatever the perception of him he's really just doing his job and interpreting the law that this has nothing to do with it
and actually by just following the letter of law he's not ideological whereas the under previous administrations in his mind has been what do you make of that well certainly at first blush there is absolutely a case to be need for that the a while
it's created in nineteen seventy by president richard nixon
foundational lies that it's charged with executing were aimed at cleaning up the staff that dumps out and smoke stacks intel pipes and interior local community
smog and chemical pollution that comes out of factories that was sort of the original idea of what they were supposed to deal and it is absolutely accurate that under the obama administration
the mission of the pay expanded and morphed and center and it became climate change now climate change and global warming are the major environmental concerns of our time we don't have new buys that are designed to do off am the only tool that the us government
really has right now to deal with global warming is the andes lies cast in the nineteen seventies and white scott pruitt it is saying is none of this was the intent of the hey let's go and this is his term he loves sees it let's go back to the let's go back to it as hazardous waste sites and knows hypes dumping and you are rare
that's what we're here to deal and the point of all this was never intended to be global warming sell let's get back to original mission for the agency so then how should we think about his repeal of the clean power plant which i think for some people felt like the nightmare of what might happen with pruitt as the head of the
but the way he's talking about it it was just a clear example of overreach by the obama administration and so he's returning the and his words to what he deems as legally responsible when it comes to something like one of our plan when you make about so hear things
get a little more tricky and nuance because the fact is the clean power plan is absolutely an example of the obama administration taking an old law the nineteen seventy clean air act that never anticipated global warming thing we've got this tour how can we use a in the most creative wave
possible to get a regulation that can help solve global warming sell skype relate and conservatives in general argue that they stretch the law they stretch the intent we've got all this back but there's one other piece of this and skype this which is there was a two thousand and seven supreme court decision that wade and on whether
it's those all lies and the yea can and should regulate fossil fuel emissions that cause global warming and the supreme court ordered to pay to do a study and make a determination fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution emissions are they harmful to pub
health in the same way that those old smog and chemical potions are and the under the obama administration determine yes fossil fuel emissions that warm the planet do in danger public health just like those old fashioned politicians and as a result under the clean air act the is now require
wired required by law to regulate those greenhouse gas global warming emissions and that finding has been upheld by the courts it's a done deal so scott prove it might say well it it's an overreach it's not what we're supposed to do it's not what the law intended but nonetheless doesn't matter who's in charge
urge the federal government is still legally obligated to do something about global warming so improved says that the obama administration was acting outside the boundaries of law with the clean power plan he might be right but he might be wrong we don't know yet this is still tied up in court sounds like exactly what called you make of
good argument that one of the flaws of the clean power plan was that it picks winners and losers in the energy industry gives the federal government the power to essentially put parts of the energy industry out of business
all these kind of rate because the number one contributor to climate change in the united states is burning coal fired power plants the coal pollution goes up in the atmosphere and it traps heat so the clean power plan is in the long run designed to put off
old fashioned coal fired power plants out of business because that's how you solve the problem
according to prove the clean power plant didn't achieve anything because it never went into effect and the reason it never went to affect was that it was held up by lawsuits claiming that it was federal overreach is that true first of all is he right that over which can be actually counterproductive in a lead to a legal term
don't just like this which make the law hang out and legal limbo
it's true it was never implemented the recent was never implemented is there were so many lawsuits the supreme court said hey this is such a big legal question we're going to put a halt on implementation of this regulation until all the lawsuits are resolved there's no question at all
all that the obama administration and when when creating the clean power plant they really did some legally interesting stuff in creating this but there's also no question that a lot of the rollbacks and legal changes that scott who has made in his less than one year in office have also been slapped with lofty whenever you have big environmental already
relations from either side you get hit with lawsuits that's kind of par for the course to prove knows better than almost anyone what it means for environmental regulations to be held up in court because before he was a administrator as attorney general in oklahoma he filed these fourteen loss
suits against the and we were trying to get to a heart of why of all things as attorney general of oklahoma he chose to spend so much of his energy use specifically targeting the what do you think the answer is important he's the attorney general of oklahoma
a major part of oklahoma economy as the oil and gas industry right it's fair to say that his home state industry really was getting head with a lot of these regulations it's also fair and very important to know that scar it had a really close relationship with a lot of those oil and gas companies
when scott prelate as attorney general of oklahoma pushed for regulations to be rolled back he would make the case to the that the regulations were are harmful to his tea but as the new york times reported a couple of years ago it turns out that the letters that he was standing on attorney general letterhead were based
copied and pasted directly from arguments and emails written by devon energy which is the major oil and gas company headquartered in oklahoma there's another piece of that relationship as well which is if you're the attorney general of oklahoma
it makes sense that you are going to argue cases that would directly benefit oklahoma to heavily dependent on fossil fuel companies so in some ways you can see how that makes sense for a state attorney general who is also arguing for states rights the difference is that we're still seeing scott
who advocate for the same kind of policies now as head of the federal agency that is primarily charged with protecting public health so you're saying as attorney general it made a fair amount of sense to advocate for companies in his state but in his role as the head of the day
more surprising yes that's what's really surprising synchro prove it talks about climate change has become one of the most controversial elements of his time as that of the day
so i asked him about climate change and what he said was that all he believes in climate change and recognizes that the climate is changing he thinks that they're still an open debate about how dangerous that is just that we need to have that to be was he saying here
has a fit in to his actions at the piano
he's kind of tap dancing around basic facts got through it has sad on television and in congressional testimony things that stand against decades and decades and decades of international scientific research he has said that if carbon dioxide does contribute to climate change it's not clear how much
i did an interview with the president and the national academies of science a couple of years ago who said to me that the consensus that human activities are contributing to climate change and that the planet is warming is stronger than that consensus that smoking tobacco is linked to lung cancer
so are their questions about exactly what climate change is going to do when or their questions about the the precision of the models as we look at what's happened over the next century sure but i would say this denial of the established scientific research on this topic is really surprise
rising to see from the head of an agency that sits on a lot of the peer reviewed research that has been done
this ban something that's been very difficult for republicans in general as they try to grapple with the established science of climate change
the science shows that the major contributor to climate change is burning fossil fuels that's coal oil and gas and if you have a good relationship with those industries if they are the basis of your home state economy or a big contributor to hear political campaign you're in a really tough position politically so finally coral for environmentalists prude is everything
thing that they fear any period when a trader with the number one a fence beating as we discussed canceling the clean power plant but do you think that he makes a good case for environmentalists seeing him differently should they simply view him as someone who's adhering to the letter of law and if they want things to change
they should take it up with congress
not with the
so crude makes a good point there there is no law on the books designed specifically to deal with climate change
president obama tried to get congress to do that
congress rejected it and so we're left with there's this problem of climate change there's no law to do anything with it
it's not necessarily the obligation of the administrator to take all laws and and try to adapt them creatively to this new problem but that sad uproot adherence to this original list approaching i think frightens a lot of environmentalists as well the reason the he was cry
created in nineteen seventy is that during the fifties and sixties we saw an increase in pollution as states competed against each other to have the most lax and loose in environmental regulation and the problem is you know pollution doesn't obey state boundary
and the idea was a republican president created this agency because letting the states work it out for themselves wasn't working for the country and potentially living states workout climate change might not work either that is the idea especially since it is a global problem
are thank you very much thank you so much my ankle it's always great to be with you
boom boom boom
use would else you need to know the classified memo that was drafted by house republicans and is reported to be highly critical of the feelers conduct in the russia investigation is moving closer to public release the times reports that president drop
who has the power to block it release on national security grounds will inform congress today that he wanted made public over the objections of both the f b i and his own justice department which argue it could jeopardize sensitive government information those who have read the memo
hey it accuses the f b i have missed leaving a federal judge when it sought a warrant to spy on a trump campaign fights suspected of working with the russians

that's it for the day
ah michael world
see money

from the new york times on michael barbara
is
today when republicans handed massive tax cuts to corporations most economists rejected their claim that the companies would give that money back to working americans so why do you
companies seem to be doing just that
it's wednesday february seventh
so when the tax bill was being debated at the end of last year
two stories out there chin tankers only covers the economy for the times the story that the democrats battalion that's where the republicans and democrats for telling was that the bill was not really going to help workers very much
this g o p tax scam is simply that from the american middle class and from every person who aspires to reach the bulk of the bill was going to corporations and corporations but largely keep that money and pass it on to shareholders who are disproportionately benefit from a reformed that's not the middle
class family and you can't deny the fact that there are many middle class families that are going to pay more as a result of this bill it would not find its way into most workers paychecks the republicans were it was a bit different so going to lower the taxes on this business so it's globally competitive so can compete with this foreign competition then we're going to get this business and ability to write off
the investments they make in this business to buy more machines to hire more workers to raise wages that to us is really important they believed that the corporations will take the money and not just invested but invested in things that would actually boost workers productivity making them more valuable to their companies and then the workers because they're more
valuable would get paid more and so by that argument eventually workers would see raises because of the corporate tax cuts
however there is no evidence that this is going to be a stimulus of the economy as nervous as a trickle down to the middle class there's no evidence that the middle class are going to benefit from the corporations are already sitting on record amounts of cash and if they wanted to reinvest it and if they wanted to pay people more money they would have done so i hope is that if there's a corporate tax code that it trickles down to
a regular folks who work every day for a living
let's go to the broad expectation was that most of the benefits of the bill would go not to your typical american worker but to hire and americans higher earning people corporations and their shareholders who tend to be the very rich
let's begin with some breaking his from over nine with tax cuts and jobs act is pass vice president my pants very case he had to cast the deciding vote if a major victory for president trample immediately tweet it in that state senate just past the biggest in history tax cut and reform bill republicans cheered as they pass the most sweeping
tax overhaul in three decades president from now on the verge of taking a tax victory lap
where were you when you learn that the tax plane had passed do you remember
our big what an hour but never got over it but our tried it my colleague sabrina tavern he talked to west carter the president of atlantic packaging in wilmington north carolina so tell me about your business is plain english as you can muster
when we were
okay that's good
op where a year old
our grandfather started a company an already
i quit bad reading material bader product
what's an example less white paper board
go around
are we do a lot of
the border guard
oh i've heard back
when on
your called not bother you know it
what do you mean you know we're going to have
sorry macabre you people and
it in a great opportunity
never had a situation where we had that much
it
and why
what we saw right away after the past was something that and i can't stress this enough no economists predicted was going to happen call it a tax cut a deity
it is giving more than two hundred thousand employees a one thousand dollars special bonus after that tax bill signed into law
the very first company that i recall seeing a press release from saying they would invest in america and their workers before the billion past was eighty and t and then there was this stampede of companies who did the same thing eighteen t and comcast now saying this tax reform package will mean one thousand dollar comcast
walmart or thing apple you're seeing some major fortune five hundred companies american airlines is the starbucks is also bank of america and then a whole bunch of other banks the third bancorp also pan out bonuses us bank income and retailers various car dealerships who are announcing bonuses for their employees tens of thousands of employees about to get a thousand
just giving one thousand dollar bonuses a certain one thousand dollar check thousand i've i've got a letter
i just wanted to add that extra emphasis to them to know that the reason they were getting and thousand dollars was because of the tax plan that the g o p and president trump had put to get it starts rippling through the economy and soon you had some three million american workers who are receiving bonuses according to americans are attached
you other major al bundy about point out it out
white added we bought our an incredible
do it
and you know about a week or a market about it
how do we want to do to you know we have a gallon of oil
figured out that would all going to break out in with what happened next what did you decide to do week rapid
and actually went out and our
edit about
baby or but we're outta we've been able to
without proper letterhead
wrote it oh boy
cracker orbit
everyone around and we rented out in my inbox
people walk him
a great
we weren't good how significant is a million dollars in the context of your business
million dollar big deal
we get about i'm on it
jim what's going on here in the expectation was as you laid out that big corporate tax cuts wouldn't actually benefit workers but isn't that what's happening
well sure these definitely benefit workers let's be really really clear it's much better to have an extra thousand dollars in your pocket the not and even if it's the government takes a kind of taxes from that thousand dollars you're still with a lot more money than you would have had so this is great for workers it is not however a sustained wage increase to get a bonus
as for the most part we're talking about bonuses we're talking about a temporary change of what appears to be and again the politics could change and it could get repealed but for what is right now written as a permanent bill so if you are a company like bank of america who is giving out any one time bonus to your workers that is out of a pool
of money that is a recurring benefit billions of dollars a year you are telling your shareholders you're going to have that is
a drop in the bucket if you look at the overall span of a lifetime of the bills benefits to you so what we're seeing here is that companies are actually getting a permanent change but companies are passing on one time payments to their workers workers are not getting a permanent change and what's going on here is that bonuses are kind of like a sugar high there and
nice thing to have you certainly to a park from it but it's not something he's in town on as a sustainable meal in the long run you don't budget house payments based on a one time bonus you might go out and buy a new tv but you're not able to change your actual quality of life for were a recurring difference in your bottom line
some workers are getting just bonuses from their companies but other companies are actually giving wage increases like melbourne which is getting minimum wage increase across its stores and faster timetable that before and this is where the question about whether to bill ends up raising wages
comes into play because if it doesn't raise wages that instability like a very bad trade off for the american war her but if it does maybe different story
when well wages start rising for most american workers it's a nagging question if you look at the last few decades from the standpoint of a typical american worker in their wages have basically not moved a majority of us workers have experienced a decade a flat wage well before the great recession wages had already started to
stagnant instead they have watched as the economy has grown a lot and the very rich have gotten a lot richer red line or corporate profits the blue line or wages and you can see that corporate profits are up by thirty five percent over this roughly five six year period now almost and wages are only a five point three percent and it's only been in the last couple of
years that those typical workers have started to see their paychecks increase and then last week two thousand golf at last month that to make number of the bigger headline know if then pay checks wage growth is way out any the fastest pace and seen in years and sal wages increase that the fastest pace since they seen since the recession
the years ago we had jobs report for the month of january that showed us the fastest wage growth since two thousand and nine great news for workers and a sign that wage growth might really be back and here to stay for the first time in quite some time
so jim what is it the wages have started to increase now
does your increasing now because the labor market is getting tight unemployment is low
there are fewer people looking for work which means employers have to compete more to hire people and hire good people which means they're going to pay them more and that is all happening before the tax bill even passes before any tax cuts start to work their way into workers paychecks and before companies try to see that the windfall from the corporate tax cuts
with see what you're saying is that some of these companies like walmart or already going to raise wages anyway absolute yeah it's if you look at the labor market right now it is hard to keep workers and so because of that walmart is bush league minimum wage and handing out bonuses and who made that possible
president trough mart is the latest company that make such an announcement directly result of the tax cuts
walmart has been raising wages even before there was a tax they were raising their own minimum wage that said that they can raise wages until they got their facts that bali starbucks has been raising its own minimum wage j p morgan chase announced this morning that because of the trunk tax cuts they will raise wages for two thousand and two thousand
and of their employees create thousands of new jobs and increase small business by lending four billion dollars so what we are seeing now is it may be an acceleration of the process to raise wages but also it's just a very good business decision walmart really up it's game the new republican tax law they say is the reason why and that's all thanks to new tax reform
bell for which j p morgan chase directly credits the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act
jim it sounds like some of these corporations are acting like the wage increases are connected to the tax cuts why is that the acting like it because it's a positive feedback loop with lawmakers and companies companies are appreciative of having more money and lower taxes from lawmakers the
turn around and say thank you to the lawmakers for giving them that extra money and in turn the law makers can tout the company's announcement see you're getting more money workers as proof that the law is working so what the companies and lawmakers are doing right now is locking themselves into this virtuous cycle and telling each other great job we did
let's keep going in hope of selling the bill so that it stays forever innocence
he announcements are kind of a pr campaign for the bill itself
when they are whether they're intended to be or not the announcements are certainly telling the american people hey there's good stuff for you in this bill which until it was passed was being derided and framed by democrats as being mostly for the rich not very much for you but i think it's much more likely that what they're really doing is seeing it
incredible opportunity for good publicity here when you are a company that says we're giving workers a bonus or a wage increase and then it suddenly all over the news that's great free advertising
and right here in cincinnati and is very beautiful factory floor the schaeffer cooperation announced that every single worker was getting a one thousand dollar tax cut boehner is your so generous thank you
congratulations everybody
why it some of the worry about tax reform in about getting business tax cuts that historically you know the surpluses don't end up an employee's pocket books but when he decided to give bonuses to all your employees after the tax cut
to announce that decision i mean was part of your thinking to communicate that the tax bill was a good thing in the tax bill is actually going to help real people
wow
i don't
early or motivate
we we are
we read it
air were outnumbered ori
for every one what do you work in our boat
eight men about our
maybe it out
our global warming
good i've been wondering about gary glitter
oh you already have
what your argument be then about your own company and the public relations thing going if someone if i would you say to you wes
seems like it's something that make yourself look good
our weird
i don't regret
what we're doing job
in any way shape or form about how
herbert our boy our boy urge you to one way to eat
we're going to help pay off her daughter
you're going to be able to do that time i have a manner that would really
do that we had another boy
what do you get it
you're really cool
okay don't ever want
a reputable right now but our reputation
oh pretty good



jim we've talked in the show this week about the role of confidence in the economy and i'm wondering regardless of whether this publicity is based in pr or something else
it's also kind of capturing or crystallizing this mood in the country that the economy has gotten better and perhaps that's been happening all along but this is the first time people are kind of picking their heads up and realizing it
whether or not the tax cut is really to thank for that is it meaningful that people feel better about the economy
yeah it's meaningful it's it's a good thing we should want people to feel better about the economy and whether that is rooted in a long running trend or a short term policy change if people are feeling more confident and optimistic that often leads to very good things we've of investment all that's really great and a relief we've been living through oh really
rocky economy for a long time the middle class has been feeling like they are struggling for years and years and years even after the recession ended and it is a great thing for america that people are maybe sort of finally starting to feel like that cloud is lifting what i think we would worry about is if that optimism turns
to be like the bonuses sort of a sugar high and people a few months from now are feeling less so
and then you could see a crash


engine in the back of my mind during this conversation has den the thought of the stock market crashing over the last couple of days
is it somehow connected with all this
yeah the stock market is reacting in a way that is very counter intuitive to this good economic news for workers investors in the stock market looked at it and appear to have said well we're worried about this they're worried that rising wages means rising inflation and when the fed is worried about rising inflation it raises interest rates
now raising interest rates then slows economic growth so what investors are saying is they're choosing to sell some of their stock now to beat the lower growth that the fed may have in store for them because they're raising interest rate so the irony in all of this and he be
basically it feels like the market is mean hey it's like most people one ordinary workers wages to go up but now that it happened the market is saying whoa whoa whoa we're worried about this situation
this is not a huge cascading crisis yet in the stock market but to some degree with they're saying is maybe stocks were a little bit overpriced given where the fed may be taking interest rates because of inflation concerns to packing a little bit of their gains from the long running time at the punch bowl so to speak and
they're going to take those profits and go home

thanks jim
thank you

will do attack


here's what else you need to an attorney
on tuesday during a white house meeting on m s thirteen gang violence president trump threatened another of government shutdown if democrats refused to agree to his demands on immigration reform if we don't change it let's have a shutdown will do is shut down and it's worth it for occur
love to see a shutdown if we don't get scuffed taken care of the comment which was seemingly off the cuff was at odds with a strategy by a republican leadership to separate the immigration debate from the negotiations over a spending which congress must pass by thursday to avoid a second
government shut down this year
it was an impasse over immigration that caused the government to shut down three weeks ago
at the time senate majority leader mitch mcconnell persuaded democrats to support a temporary spending and reopen the government by vowing to turn to immigration and the dreamers on their own tops after spending plan

that's pretty ah michael verbal


some news times ah michael horrible nice is the
today
this weekend at the opening ceremonies of the two thousand and eighteen winter olympics one hundred and sixty nine cleanly dressed athletes marched out in drab grey coats and bleeds competing not for our country but under the name olympic athlete
from russia
russia
in the last winter
to on them that punished

it's one of your marriage well
mr president
members of a
ladies and gentlemen the summer of two thousand and seven and five them are prudent it personally lobbying to bring the winter olympics to russia for the first time or becca release is an investigative reporter at the times he gives and passion pitch
sang so she has a unique place
all this you sure you can enjoy your flair in spring day this is the place for them but up in the mountains
i went skiing six or seven weeks ago and i know a real snows guaranteed this is where the you want the game to be our national police do you is
they chose of torture is are the best years he even seeks to connect the origins of the olympic games to sochi the ancient greeks believed their own it lots of centuries ago the last tiles at the games had been in the country was in nineteen eighty in moscow games that the united states had boycott
middle of cold war yes
they point out that us the break up over the soviet union
russia has lost all sports the and you in the mountains
so this would be a russia's first time hosting the games as russia would rather than the soviet union and the first time that the winter games had ever come to the region and to show be happy headed to see you in russia and in such it as our guests so it sounds like this would be a very big deal
for a post cold war russia gets and one more special privilege north face it jumps aprons
so after the sales pitch and office lobbying what happens
russia olympic committee
auto
announcing that the twenty second olympic winter games are over forty our orbit to the city or structure
olympic officials grant more prudent his way
the two thousand and fourteen winter games can be alive look at the olympic torch burning bright the heart of sochi russia wins the most medals of any country at the olympics or thirty three medals thirteen of them going
when saddam was team russia coming out on top of the by one really buy at the lawn cross country skiing a one two three gold silver and bronze they completed the podium in the men's cross country ski bob's play
said
so she is hailed as a huge sticks pass rush as an analyst getting a big new park after the olympic games and searching country is giving a mercedes to every one of us athletes who metals are in the games thirty three luxury cars for those meddling still aren't old enough to drive
their cars come what the driver russia celebrating its olympic high for the better part of thousand and fourteen but that same year and explosive report heads
this was you really just a part of her her husband vitali and are small son robert a german broadcaster comes out with the report they don't feel safe anymore in their native russian
by a former russian runner and her husband who worked for russia's drug testing agency i wanted to fight don't green
i wanted to makes for its
cleaner
more honest better the documentary says nothing about surgery but what this couple said is that all athletes in russia and open russia has been systematically dumping for years and that these plots extend to the top at the government is involved and dumping it athletes and
in extorting money from leads to keep quiet about their drug violations cannot achieve results that you're getting kidding
in russia
dopey and this is how it's done than russia
so those claims in that documentary prompt international regulators to react
there is no member twenty fifteen russian officials athletes and coaches are embroiled in a dope being scared and i am in switzerland covering this press conference that is announcing the results and then investigation that looked into what that german documentary had reported the commission
castigated allegations made a job a documentary last december which accused rusher of states opposite don't pick and indeed that investigation concluded that there is systematic dropping in russia in the swiss sunshine a dark day for the sport about politics the while are
has a core programmer have suspended from or graphics competition it's pretty opaque
but there's this name that keeps coming up of this person who investigators tried to talk to who didn't cooperate with the investigation and he seems pretty central to whatever was going on and his name is doctor agenda
who is doctor a off grigory read chunk of is the director of russians national anti dope in laboratory he is the top chemist who works with russia's athlete
to test their urine and blood to make sure that they are not taking any band performance enhancing drugs so i emailed him an address that i found online and to my surprise he not only replied but he engaged and he says i know so much it's going to
to be unbelievable when i come out with my full story it's incredible what i know and the levels of involvement of my government wow
and he sends an email
at what would have been three or four am moscow time and i commented on the time and he said well i live in los angeles now her he came to l a
because he was fearful for his life in moscow because two people who worked in russia's anti dumping efforts and sports died abruptly one of those people was his close friend and colleague nikita come i have and he had been in the middle of writing a book about his life and was planning on a tell all of what
had done in his work sure kinda feared that he was going to get killed guess and he feels that if he goes out there fully with his whole story then he is better protected because he will be seen as a public figure who version of offense has been established in the new york times
he thinks that by telling a story and becoming a public figure
he would make it too risky for anyone in russia especially and one type of the government to come after him and to do harm exactly so it's spring of two thousand and sixteen i fly to los angeles and he says
everything you saw him that german documentary everything that was announced as a result of that follow up investigation it's all true huge cheating across nearly every sport going back years and dictated by the government
what life is oh and by the way guess what we just did and jay
so over the course of three days in l a he tells this amazing story he details with pride
this inconceivable sounding scheme
that he helped design
no no got old
so weak
so it it will go
well youth can do in sport
states also be so it's a little
and just be clear the russian government the government of of her claim is involved in this or aware of how involved are they read chunk of says but this is all stemming from britain he is saying that he is taking his orders directly from his boss who is a deputy sports minister
and he's meeting also not infrequently with a minister in pollutants government who reported to president bush himself
to they're asking the leading authority and the country in stopping building to to start over
that's exactly right they turned to the person who has knowledge of everything that is prohibited of all of the way is that those prohibited substance as are caught in laboratories and they're saying to him what can we do to enhance our athletes performance and give them that extra edge that they might need while not
on
he spent all their lives in essence ages
see did you kill it so disgusting
sixty minutes
if you kill cheat to nineteen and is
whoa eighty for also you should we host
you
two in the months before the games
what stock much and cough actually do so he immediately snaps about his work and he experimented with drugs he talks to the top purveyors he sources steroids and he begins to stay this is the for me i am devising for russia top
olympian he creates a cocktail and he calls the duchess cocktail duchess cocktail and he produced is it in mass and handed off to russians sports officials and he begins to notice some people hanging around his lab in moscow who are particularly in
interrupt ed in the squat glass bottles that are the gold standard for drug testing samples and keeping them secure in international competitions they have these interlocking metal team they're like jaws that close and they are widely hailed as tam
for proof you cannot get into this glass bottle went to the field without breaking its cap in a telltale way and he begins to see that these people who he says work with russia's federal security services are collecting hundreds of these little metal rings sit around and
neck of the glass bottles they're particularly interested in how can one get into these bottles he says you can't it's like fort knox they're impossible to penetrate and yet they keep collecting these rings or scrutinizing these bottles and lo and behold the is federal security service staffers huh
have devised a way to get into these bottles undetected when i first time so the all
because
believes this is safe to the plan comes together in which it's determined that read chunk of is going to distribute his cocktail top athletes will take it and they will substitute out their dirty urine for clean year and that they will say
stockpile month
head of the olympics
while they're clean while they're not using any band drugs
your your goes of the push of the tamil off the solo so that we will then freeze at stockpile pilot transported from moscow to snow
at the olympics when nobody is watching their urine samples that will have been spontaneously collected through the games will be substituted out surreptitiously using the federal security service which has devised a way to break into the glass bottles
so how does all this
once the olympics start insulting and only fourteen
chunk of land and he inspect his lab the lab he's going to oversee and he also inspects this building that is adjacent to his lab that is run by the federal security service that has all of this clean urine stockpiled and he has a spreadsheet
it has been sent him by his boss the deputy minister
just before the games begin with the final last of which top russian olympians will be drinking his cocktail and will need to have their urine and substitute here
lease or is
the essence of your limited release those are all grown and then the games
lots
what happens if he has an office in this laboratory and nightly he waits for a staff of around one hundred people to leave the lab or tiny these are international chemists experts flown in from all over the world
and he changes out of his lab code he put on a russian national team sweatshirt and he heads downstairs and goes into a storage closet
that he and his team have rigged up to be his shadow laboratory and he takes the locked bottle that he can't break into and he passed as it through a small sort of hand sized hole in the wall
to a member of the federal security service on the other side on the other side who takes bad bottle and outside of run chunk of sideline manages to get its top off and he passes it back in then dumped out the steroids last year and rinse the
bottle and he also receives through this small hole in the wall that very same athletes clean urine stockpiled months earlier and he puts it in to the right battle and he makes sure that this the urine sample matches
and so he uses things as basic in crude as table salt an instant coffee grounds to make sure that the year in matches
the sample that was given by that athlete that very day
as a cool so i eat with all due to the unions and so is a week or a see or for groups or instant of it
see but
he's doing chemical experimentation on each and every one of these every night but that is exactly where exceptionally hard work it is and he's exhausted is complaining he's getting very little sleep he is working not just during the day in running this huge testing operation and
rather than have his day conclude when the normal drug testing and for the day it ramps up overnight
take the dirty or and pass it through the hole in the long get the bottle back down bout the dirty harry swap in the clean urine stop for a cigarette have a drink of whiskey tend to another sample tend to another sample tend to another sample yet
and he did this every single night for nearly two weeks
i mean
it's it's why of by day he's legitimately testing russian and non russian athletes for signs of dropping by night is systematically subverting that system and eliminating any signs of dropping but only for russian athletes correct so doctor or chunk of tells you to
incredible story
bowser reaction
we were incredulous it was a hard thing to believe
sort of major international scandal breaking today over to allege state sponsored bring scheme for pro russians athletes to go during the soldier gives what was the reaction to your story what was the result of that the president of the international olympic committee calls this
story if true and unprecedented level of criminality
and he says it's a huge attack on everything the olympic stand for but we need to see a thorough investigation and find out if indeed this was carried off and so the investigation happens
born out of russia says that russia operated a state sponsor drug program that benefited athletes who can that investigation confirm everything road chunk of says the international olympic committee has open investigations at the top russian sports officials and may borrow them along with all russian athlete it consults with him frequently but at all
also draws on other witness and scientific and forensic analysis it inspects these very bottles these glass bottles that had rational libyans urine in them and it finds microscopic scratches on the next obvious glass bottles were these in
locking metal jaws had clearly been manipulated to allow the cap off in a way that had gone undetected
the committee is suspended was too
we'll clean the russian else lives will be able to participate under strict conditions
the winter games through two thousand eighty
from the international olympic committee saying rather bray blankly and there was an unprecedented attack on the olympics
accusing the russian athletes and the search games so essentially being dirty and they are not punishing them in the next olympic games five banning russian athletes they say clean athletes will be allowed to compete but not under the russian flag though have to be neutral all of this no doubt getting him
reaction in moscow
the story that you're telling here
is a story about russia on the sport stage but i'm struck by how much it reminds us of russia on the political stage as well
in both cases the same country is taking extraordinary risks to get what it was there are absolutely strong parallels between russia meddling in the twenty sixteen american presidential election and russians meddling in the olympics in
fact american government officials have called them connected pal they have really is and intelligence report stating that they american intelligence officials believe russia meddling in the american presidential election to have been motivated in pa
part by the olympic dropping a scandal which they rode couldn't viewed as an american led attack while he has called is a year's worth of investigations revelations whistle blower accounts and effort to undermine russia attack
back on russia by the west so he's he's calling always investigations and americana attack on russia yes attack on russia and he has said and american attempt to meddle with russia an election his own election which is due to take place in march
so in that case these two episodes of essentially cheating on political on athletic they don't just look a lot like it showed interest parallel each other they're actually intertwined air related according to intelligence officials yes one has in some ways and
inspired the other and in some ways it's rooted back in the search the olympic laboratory
like to thank you very much thank you so much

and what about after a check of what happened him once your reporting was published
he was hoping that i talk came to us he would be afforded a level of protection but he has that he has continued to feel unsafe
the
oh
he is living under the protection of federal authorities in the united states and we don't know where he is so he's essentially in in hiding absolutely some in the country yes

as part of the punishment imposed on show by olympic officials for the national dumping operation the russian team was banned from competing in the new england decks
but one hundred and sixty nine
after being screened for past to accuse are being allowed to compete independently as olympic athletes from russia
they are wearing a new tool uniforms bearing no flag
the official record books
two one zero medals

huge what else you need to monitor
good white house official has resigned after being accused of physical and emotional abuse by his ex wife david swords a speechwriter for president trump is alleged to have won a car over his wife's foot put out a cigarette on her hand thrown her into a wall and grabbed her by the hair
while they were alone on a boat charges he denies sorensen his resignation on friday came two days after the resignation of rob porter the president's staff secretary who left the white house after two of his ex was accused him of abusing it was a low grade can't
terror of not knowing what i might get us that they are
what mood here with
you have on saturday in an early morning twitter post the president appear to defend the two many people's lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation he wrote some were true and central falls some are old and summer new there is no recovery for someone falsely accused
life and career go
is there no such thing any longer as to process
that
about

from new york times on michael barbara this is the
today president trump is calling for an overhaul of the us immigration
to replace family beast migration with merit based migration
what counts as married
and the school shooting in floor
it's thursday february fifteen
it's not i'll watch the morning
the show of fraud
the boat dog
border sugar to enter or other
immigration issue
kill killen what's been going on in the senate this week
the senate has taken this really unusual step of engaging in a kind of unmitigated hashing out of all things immigration caitlin dickerson covers immigration for the tops and that's because in order to convince democrats to reopen the government last month mitch mcconnell agreed to an open debate that's what they're doing
our promised would clear other words with both which matters is what
i promised i would sure of a moment
which both thought that all closure or discussion a boat
everyone should be focused on finding a bill to protect the dreamers and address border security that can get sixty votes that's all good and the goal is to build a new immigration policy from scratch so something that deals with dreamers but also if the republicans get their way the deal
that involve a lot more than than it could in fact overhaul our entire immigration system
our legal system as well exactly
and what would that mean the change that republicans are envisioning of are illegal immigration system
well the biggest thing that it means is a shift away from the core of our current immigration system which is family based acceptance family ties know right now we allow about a million people into the country every year and about eight hundred thousand of them are two thirds are allowed and based on who they are related to
that's really what makes up the bulk of who he allow into the country and the idea that republicans are hoping to sell democrats on his to really lemon if not totally get rid of the says that are based on family ties and focus instead on employment skills and education and on fact
that they believe are going to clearly benefit the american economy we will have show many more benefits it will save countless dollars raised workers wages and help struggling families including immigrant families enter the middle class and they will do it quickly and they will be
very very happy indeed
so how does this system of family based migration has actually work so the system allows people to petition to bring family members into the country specific types of family members so young children but also in some cases adult children who are married
siblings and parents but it's not as if you just apply and anybody who falls into one of those categories his shirt in the sponsor has to prove that they make a certain amount of money so that this person who is coming into the united states is going to be supported that they're not going to be a drag on the economy and then each of those category
mary's is subject to limit so just because again you qualify as somebody whose family member has enough money and as a sibling or a child of an american citizen
you also are gonna have to wait in line and in many cases those lines are years and years long and they can even be decades long so it sounds like you're saying there are limitations on this it's not an open door system to family but in essence this is a system built around the idea that eventually you can have
a lot of your family maybe even most of your family join you in united states yeah absolutely and you know people have looked back at three and four generations and seen a single and grant bring in more than one hundred people
and and this may be responsible for the name the president trump likes to use to describe this system which controversial
jane migration team migration exactly chain migration my my great ending
migration
god
common is the system you're describing around the world outside the united states
it's not common at all i mean lots of other countries they do allow some people based on family ties but even in places that do the american definition of family is much broader than it is elsewhere in the world other countries don't consider an adult child necessarily and eligible family member or a sip
ling and eligible family member so we are the most generous country when it comes to family based immigration so why do we do it this way why would our immigration policy be based on anything other than what's the relic the best for our economy
that we will find a revolution
not affect the lives of millions
it is still one of the most important back to congress
and of this administration
what's interesting is that when family based immigration was introduced in one and sixty five it comes along with a sort of surprising goal in mind which is to keep the united states primarily white primarily european merger that we will find
we're really make us proud to our fellow over the country
it will rank and
unseen way before that we had quotas that are based on country of origin under that system
a problem to her
depended on the country
and those were then considered during the nineteen sixty civil rights movement to be racist man of steel him town
or denied and the call came from chicago
you are from one of the development and so we moved away from a quota system and yet created another system that was intended to maintain the racial makeup of the country the demographic makeup of the country but of course shortly after immigration patterns shit
and we see a lot more people coming to the united states from basically everywhere except europe and so you know as a result this policy starts to really propelled dramatic change in terms of demographics in the opposite direction that it was intended to when it was introduced so this is really interesting kill him when the press
made is no infamous shit hole it he was talking about doing away with aspects of our immigration system that result in people from poor countries or people without her
hi and economic value coming to the us and that's also it sounds like what he's thinking about with this shift away from a family be system to america system but it feels like what you're saying is that that's what the creators of the family based system
wanted as well when that system was created exactly it does the exact opposite of what the architects of the policy hoped or and as a result the country has become a lot more brown
so with that in mind would a merit based system is thing the present from says he wants what it actually accomplish his stated core of bringing immigrants with higher economic value than the family based system it would replace it could it
pens on what the merit based system looks like because all that means in general is that as a country you decide on factors that are important to you in terms of who you want to bring in you assign each of those factors some degree of weight and then you use that sort of rubric to decide who gets a ticket and who doesn't
but when president trump talks about a merit based system he's being a lot more specific than that he actually means fewer overall immigrants and then have that much smaller number of people we allow in a much larger proportion of them being people who have high skills doctors engineers
h s entrepreneurs more immigrants who can slide into the upper echelons of the american economy and of american society and so if we think about his definition of merit based then yes that will be the result so we've been discussing this kind of philosophical question of what
immigration is for and this seems to be another philosophical question what is married and having high schools is just one way to think about it but it sounds like that's how president trump is thinking about marriage
right i mean i think one thing that's actually getting lost in this debate is that there's research that shows that people who have family ties actually fare better in the economy because they have a built in safety net so if you move to america and you have family members here you have someone who you can stay with if you don't have anywhere to live you have someone who can take
due to the d m v who can show you how to file taxes who might help you learn the language and understand the culture so there's definitely an economic argument that says people with family ties are actually going to do even better ben somebody who's a ph year who has millions of dollars to contribute to the economy but who doesn't have anybody to help them on a rainy day
when things go wrong
so do the case to be made that family based immigration
the having family ties when you're an immigrant arriving in the us is actually a pretty strong fair of marriage
absolutely a strong case and that's something that could be incorporated into america a system we could offer points based on who has family ties just like with the diversity so that we've talked about you could offer points for diversity is are all things that could be incorporated into a merit based system in theory but that's not what president
trump is talking about doing when he proposes his version of a merit based immigration system
what we're talking about would be a massive overhaul of the us immigration system is this actually on the table know
it is on the table and it looks like it's going to have to be on the table because on wednesday president trump came out and said that if whatever bill the senate comes up with doesn't include this idea of merit based in immigration that hill veto it he's really putting pressure on them to make this bigger and a broader than just a bill that looks at dhaka and he is pushing them
to try to come up with something that looks a lot more like what happens in countries like canada
but here's the thing what president trump has described as his ideal immigration system it looks vastly different than what actually happens in canada
and it's not clear how this senate is going to reconcile those new and ideas
thanks my mom

when we come then what actually happens in canada

current outdated system the oppressors wages for our poorest workers and coach great pressure on taxpayers nations around the world like canada australia and many others have a merit based immigration system
kevin present trump has said two things about america based immigration system one he wants high school workers to be the priority and to he sees canada as a model is that how the canadian merit based system works does
prioritize high skilled work yes and no it's actually quite a complicated system catherine porter is the canada bureau chief of the times so there are three stream
immigrants to canada there's refugees about fourteen percent there's the family reunification scream similar to the american one
then as much as sixty percent as this merit based system and the system a super complicated and back like if you talk to people who teach that they'll tell you is super complicated because it changes all the time but it's basically a points system
where you get a certain amount of points based on your age your education your language skills with a language
and time they called adaptability it's basically the idea that you're calm and you'll hit the ground running
not just the federal government but each province in canada and territory also has their own system
breaking and they can rank at based on what skills they're looking for now on paper it says that fifty eight percent of our system comes that way people who are merit but really most of those people come with spouses and kids so if you take them out of that equation and really only a quarter
of immigrants coming to canada who are picked specifically for their skills
so it sounds like the skill sets that are used to judge an immigrant are not oh is what we might think of is high skills and higher education in the last survey so that in not just people who have i teach skills are getting in but cook like shorter curtains people on the catering business
oh because each province territory because there's thirteen provinces and territories and canada making this easy or but he i'm gets a look at their own job market and see where the holes are that they want to filter they also have a very large failing fifty percent of the say of which immigrants come in so yeah know if not necessarily
the only ph d's although the more education you have the higher your point from this marriage system
haven't you know why canada bill their immigration system
this way
hair is actually a really interesting story so before the sixties there was basically people will tell you that are a race based system here are a very race the system where they give preferential treatment to people from white countries the even have a quota on how many
people from sri lanka india were allowed in every year and in the sixties that i'll change they monitor system that with colorblind that was based just on merit and they brought this new system and gradually and by nineteen sixty seven they put em like this point system to make sure basically the
bringing people based on math and nod where they came from or what they look like so is interesting though it's being held the right now in the united states as this model because with the debate in the states being so polarized around race right now in canada this was like an antidote to that this was seen as something to try
treat people fairly coming in and give everyone a fair shot well it's also interesting because we just heard from her colleague que and dickerson that the us system of family based migration was also a response to what was seen as a racist immigration system in the sixties so these
two countries responded to the same problem in two very different ways
so is this merit based system that canada came up with isn't working in canada do people like it
yeah a super popular like immigration and canada is still seen as a nation building everyone sees it as a way that we grow our economy makes this more competitive yeah it's really i would say like an essential part of they can your identity of being a multiculturalism is immigration
part of that as care brings in a lot of immigrants like they bring in point eight percent of the population every year and at this point more than twenty percent of the whole canadian population
are immigrants so the still a real embrace of the idea that immigration is something that is good and i think the they're based system is the special sauce and to that it does really promote the idea that were getting the best people from around the world coming to canada and not just that they're so lucky to come to canada canada's lucky to have them
here so that sounds like a case for this version of merit based immigration both why if president or in moving to america be system
is to limit the number of immigrants coming in and to prioritize the high skilled why is he pointing to canada as the model
it's the head scratching for many people in canada and cry to tell you because the model here is about bringing in lots of people based on an idea that immigration is really good for the country that it brings them talent and skills and fresh blood fresh ideas that it builds the country up
where is where the president in the states since the thing is he wants few are immigrants which is completely contrary to the canadian experience

can thank you very much thank you my mom

on wednesday afternoon oh broad bipartisan group of senators announced they had reached an agreement on an immigration plan it is narrower than the one called for by president drop the compromise legislation would boost border security
and resolve the feet of the dreamers offering them a path to citizenship
but would not address family beast migration
peaceful lottery program
but the president's insistence on his hard line plan calls into question whether any compromise legislation can make it past his desk


what happened was the fire alarm went off so he was going outside like a regular job
when i heard two gunshots
i just see a whole bunch of people start running my direction and
the administrators and teachers taught us to start running so i was just running
wherever and just find the crowd
on wednesday afternoon in kirkland florida about an hour north of mainly a gunman walked into a high school with a semi automatic rifle and killed at least seventeen people i thought it was just someone put the fire alarm and then i actually got scared like there's actually a shooter
and people are actually dying
police have arrested a nineteen year old former student at the school who recently was expelled and who was known to carry guns but they have yet to describe a motive for the shooting
it was the eighteenth school shooting in the us so far this year
on wednesday evening broward county sheriffs god israel held a news conference near to school
a truly makes me sick to my stomach
down and guess that's horrible catastrophic


that's it for the daily i'm michael barbara
see tomorrow


from the new york times on michael world
the
today
last october for us soldiers were ambushed in a remote desert in the share and the question became what was the military doing in africa and who was it fighting five months later the story from louisiana
it's tuesday february twentieth

well
earlier this month i drove for my based in atlanta a few ourself to south georgia
alan blinder is a national reporter for the times when i got into town i went for a drive with ginger russell and her mom years and the city limits an idiot
right now turns out not down
you're talking about
and as we get closer to tombs county georgia i started seeing these red white and blue bows these records that you'd see tied to street signs you'd see on the side of the road
we which want their fake
an outlier i wonder what really happened
is it still address as we get closer to where ginger and a lot of her relatives live hamas sister's house
she has no
in her flag on the front door
these urges people that neighbors were a long time that have their fly mac as saying he's have their rubens and grin and bear on mailbox after mailbox after mailbox this is my cousin katie
yes or no
that's my grandma's house and nobody lives better but they made sure that she got a better on her mailbox
these ribbons went up after ginger his nephew dustin right was killed in the share
work in progress
oh really
and right was a productive south georgia he was born and raised in small towns like santa claus georgia places like lions georgia
i've just had his grandmother at her house everyone knows as a wayne but he called her granny
it
does that was a big guy i mean he was a chubby kid oh
last
arrest records or there's a picture of him in front of an american flag in his army uniform
and everyone i talk to who knew him well said they thought he was having to try really hard to be serious
never figure that during the big
it is didn't will call it
looked goofy and
posted you just talk about military
you know
his dad was in the military so was his mom and the family can trace its lineage in the us military back to the war eight thousand and twelve
so he joined the military in two thousand and twelve very much following in his family his footsteps
but really from the word go he was telling his friends and family that he wanted to be among the army's best so he goes to training in georgia
does the army infantry school and he also does the army airborne school and eventually in two thousand and fourteen the army doesn't need of him as a great
one
okay
the
i'm at night
somewhere so distance home from one of his deployments and he and some of his buddies decides take a trip to the carolina country music fest and myrtle beach south carolina back alley of an outcry three it out
and i kept on he meets a woman named jenna the concert was like on the beats the last satisfying you know as area
and that song that was what i told you
i and from i the out
like i had on it
and i write a lot of liquid in carriers and i i said hey
hi
yeah i there
we dance and
it aired korea as a can't stand that i'm an adult as
it was like nasa call now me
my little nothing town too
man that manning
neither knowing he is
he's a schoolteacher in philadelphia he's a soldier signed fort bragg north carolina
but they're talking all the time they're visiting each other
he told his grandmother before he left that he had met the woman he wanted to marry and then it's happen
point it was coming
throughout their relationship they know he's a special forces soldier and another deployment is getting closer and closer it was time for said phyllis
his or her role
he didn't say much about what he was doing it at all
you failed to do
he said his family pictures of these beautiful landscapes and he told them it was the military version of a vacation
they all live
just paperwork and then he leaves for africa a country called nice share which is in west africa stadium
this as
it's raining africa or any skills
it's as if they were going into the as well
it's strange that us
and least it's as though
oh did you know i'm a diffuse and
yeah to pronounce year in a weird look at math see exactly where they know he was deployed to one of the combat zones they'd seen on tv somewhere like iraq or afghanistan
and the risk of his work just weren't all that clear to folks
it was a normal day harass you hit me up
i got as though
once time and money
at three thirty
october third
he told me that
they were a genius plans and they were going you now returned to that the battery
i love their levity and darling
aren't you as soon as i get it
it's families interception and a cleaner again
of the jam
so it was about midnight when two soldiers arrived dusted grandmother's house
don't they
he's laying on that
and his uniform came in
say these words
i'm poor wrong
obama long have been desk who have desk and you have has look you have this me

the tennis shocked when justin right as killed and when his body was brought back from africa
people lined the streets of the small town
they had to have his funeral
at high school football stadium
because it was the only place where they could fit the crowd that wanted to come

that's when members of his family started to wonder what was going on in africa in make apathy anything and lane
he was ever there the
how's it daily invested in it
say more that he needed to say it wasn't that he was intentionally keeping things feminist
there was not as close to dale said
i guess that's why i said to stop some members of his family still want a simple explanation of why american forces need to be a nice year and the first place
however with bush
united states that have been over there
and what is he doing in africa because you don't think of humanitarian effort and what you do this way
did take the world was it because of grassroots who was fighting
i busy fighting

when we come back what happened anywhere

we'll be back

i'm walking inside a military prison
northwestern nice hair
a woman who is
beating i think mullet
that's
what many call knocked covers a sex for the times me a couple of days ago i got back from me
where i went to ask the question what happened to these for american soldiers who were killed in an ambush in a forgotten and remote corner of africa
in a word that i think very few people understand
the pentagon has told the american people about what has happened has shifted numerous times they began by saying one version of events that then changed it changed again so wanted to get on the ground and i wanted to speak to the people who had actually witnessed in this that's the local
okay direct eye witnesses to what happened to think that he's willing to me
the most difficult thing was to try to speak to actual members of the terror group that carried it out
this guy hassan
they get permission to speak to him is going to help is a lot about the
ever
and i was able to speak to two in a prison in colonial era
a terrorist in area

and what did you find initiator can you start me the morning of the ambush so the morning of the ambush is october fourth i'm actually going to start one day earlier october third and it was at around six a m october third that a mixed patrol of american any sharing and troops left
the gates of their base the americans included queen brace as well as other troops and they set off on what they had planned to be a little risk routine patrol a classic hearts and minds exercise and what does a routine patrol
what the missionary and troops told me who were in the americans is they were told it's an earlier huddle in french that means go out and come back so they set off at six o'clock in the morning they spent all day they stop and villages they meet with local community leaders in the late afternoon they began heading home and they're basically a couple dozen miles away from the
of the compound when the convoy stops and their tools that that their mission has changed and what is the nutrition the order that they've gotten is that american intelligence agencies have honed in on a signal from an electronic device belonging to a suspected terrorist name to shuffle they've identified
what they think is his camp where he's hiding out in the far north of the terrain where they're searching and they want them to go and back up another american special forces counterterrorism raid as they go went to raid that cap
and this is where things start to fall apart
they go into the camp and they find nobody but they do find traces of the terror group they find ammunition they find the tire tracks of motorcycles that have sped off so they had somehow been alerted and had left the camp site before the americans got there
now the irony in all of this is that we're supposed to be the high risk think the raid on this camp site and they got there and they were find nothing happened they spent some time there and as the sun was rising they were heading home
and that's the real tragedy here because what happens next happens on an unplanned stop in a village they were not supposed to stop him but they've been out now for more than twenty four hours
in the desert they're out of quarter
the first village on their way back is a place called tongue tango and they stop at a well to fill up the water boils at this point the village chief has learned that there there and he walks out to meet them he tells them that there are several said children in the village and could they help them so as part of their hearts and minds
campaign they do carry supplies that are specifically meant to be distributed to villagers so they take out the medicine but they have and they start distributing add to the people that
but something's not quite right it's at this point in time that several members of the unit at tell us that they start noticing that the looks on the faces of the letters are not welcoming even menacing they notice groups of young men gathering they noticed several people on motorcycles speed off as if they're going to pass the message to somebody
and most of all they noticed but the village chief keeps on trying to delete them every time they get ready to leave he seems to have some other question or some other reason for them to stay they finally decide to leave the get on to the backs of their trucks and not even two hundred yards past the village they began taking her
heavy and deadly fire this is the this is the amish
the pentagon told us repeatedly that they did not leave the soldiers behind the new york times acquired the body camera footage of one of the for that americans and that footage it tells a very different story

in the footage you see three of the for americans could die on this day
and what you see is that they are outgunned and overrun by this terrorist group and that nobody comes to their aid
he specifically see a black s u v which is where staff sergeant bryant black staff sergeant jeremiah johnson and staff sergeant dusting right find themselves
one of them is at the wheel two of them have emerged from the car and they're trying to use the tasty of the car for cover their shooting over the hood they're trying to hide behind a wheel well
brian block is the first to go down
his colleagues rush to help him they pull him back by the strap of has flak jacket and try to bring him back behind the wheel of the car there then taking positions trying to keep firing at the enemy but the enemy is right upon them
and the surviving to just start running
and they're running and running you're seeing it through the viewfinder of the soldier who's behind the first they're running past shrubs they're running past tree is they're running past little hubs
the next filter jeremiah johnson his head
and you see him fall and roll
you see his colleague staff sergeant doesn't right stop running and take a position next to basically a desert trouble and try to hold off the attackers
one you a soldier one us know virtually no protection with no protection and is behind this bush that is so wispy that you literally see the branches of ricocheting from the force of his weapon
and he holds them off for at least a man and a half possibly longer but he's just one person and they descend on the soldier who was down they opened fire on him and then they turn their fire on sergeant right


okay so now we know what happened to surgeon ride and these three other soldiers but i think a lot of people including surgeon rights family don't really understand what the soldiers were doing in africa what were they doing there
nice air is now one of the battle france in the war on terror very much so in the war on the islamic state africa is where i actually started investigating tear this is where i began on the speed in two thousand and twelve when i was covering molly and weird this particular group
that goes on to attack the for soldiers began as an affiliate of al qaeda and so i won't explain to you the context of terror in this region
since around two thousand and twelve i've been following one particular guy who became a leader of al qaeda in the street and he then breaks off and creates his own group and he begins to actively recruit from a group of people who for traditional herders and no manager and who have one specific
france they are herders in an area where the government does not exist and they are being routinely attacked by armed bandits who are taking their cows and their cameras and who are killing their meant that made them extremely vulnerable to recruitment because this al qaeda group comes and offers to arm them an offer some protection and at the same time
princeton into to hurt us
so doesn't very much seem like a terror group just seems like a local government doing what these people most made which is protecting their life what exactly and you have to imagine that in this part of the world
if you're hurt or your animals it's it's like your four one k you know somebody comes and takes a camel that's like somebody liquidating your bank account great there is no other well they don't have bank accounts they don't have cash on them
this was an ongoing issue in this area and this one time al qaeda group moves and and by two thousand and fifteen a pledge allegiance to the islamic state so these herders yeah who wanted to protect their animals yes
there now pledging wales you to us
it took to isis exactly
so we're in africa fighting the islamic state or does that actually look like right so on the one hand with there to contain the threat these groups are thing and growing and taking territory and our presence fair is attempting to block that and howard
during that is by training advising and assisting local troops to fight the terror threat themselves and i know that this might be hard for listeners especially in america to understand but having lived in this area for seven years i have seen over and over again that when these to hottest groups go in local troops basically just rip off
their uniforms and run the this has been a trend adolescents at a fan of fear so the mission is train assist advise were trying to build up these local forces so that they can do it themselves so that we can in a way disengage and no longer be the forward element in these fights and it's a word
while go but it's a really long ground it's very hard to get these troops up to the level to do what they need to do so has this us mission in africa has it remained focused on containment or has it started to morph it's morphed i mean i think that what tonga tango shows is you have a putter
all that's going out there essentially training the nigerians who were with them and doing this very low rescue no interaction with local villagers and suddenly they're given an order to go and raid a suspected terror calf and if the americans who are in the lead their it's not an insurance that's no longer just containing the threat that's taking a much more proactive role going out into the
field and carrying out an from submission to try to to stop the track

here's the thing that is puzzling about the tongue at attack or soak so you have for american soldiers who are count which is obviously horrible but that would have been a blip on the radar in the days when where and polluter right in the days when we were actively fighting in afghanistan there are incidents in those two wars
where dozens of american troops died the same day and helicopter crashes that were taken down by enemy fire for some reason there is much less appetite and much less willingness to expand american blood on the continent then in the middle east
and i think that has to do with the perception of africa in the minds of people were africa is associated as a place of humanitarian catastrophe is of these endless what i think people assume our ethnic wars and where i think people think it's not our business to be there but what i know from having covered
these areas is that these terror groups specifically al qaeda and isis
their fire is aimed at us from africa they are not bear to kill local people they are there to kill symbols of western governments and specifically america which have seen as their enemy number one

what you're describing is a profound tension this way in our priorities it seems like united states of course wants to keep its soldiers safe in a place like new share my and wants to monitor and regularly and show the kind of restraint hard to do
do that but is it more dangerous if the united states is not in a place like new share and not being as active an offensive as required as does a visual and war on terrorism require the us to be there and to conduct itself in whatever
always are required to eliminate thread this is a part of the world that is incredibly of our town that has enormous and governed lawless spaces the very kind of spaces but these groups thrive i saw half of the country of mali in two thousand and twelve in a matter of days i'm not exaggerating in a matter of days be over
run by al qaeda as a result of local troops not being able to hold their ground
so i think there is an argument to be made for our presence in africa but if we're going to be there
i think that measures need to be taken to avoid the tragedy that happened on october fourth the troops that were there were sent in without close air support they were not properly armored and they weren't and to what turned out to be a very dangerous situation
that that was evident if you just looked at the statistics of how many attacks had happened there and yet they weren't prepared
and in my interviews with the missionary and soldiers who survived this ambush what they taught me is that they thought the americans had this under control
they think of the americans as all powerful they thought that they were going into an area and the fact that they didn't have the right weapons okay the americans would take care of them
and the profound sense that they were left with is one of abandonment not just of themselves but also of the for american soldiers who died and hunger tongue that
they were left in the hands of dna

thank you with me
thank you michael

here's what else you need to notice
ten off
on one as student protested in front of the white house demanding stricter gun control the trump administration said it was open to supporting a bipartisan senate bill that would improve the federal background check system for gone buyers
the bill introduced by form of have against and for democrats does not make it harder to buy a god but instead offer incentives to government workers to keep the system up to date with the kind of criminal and mental health records that would prevent our guns
millions of those records are missing from the background check system according to the national rifle association which supports the

that's it for today
michael border
here

from the new york times on my cobra
he said
today
president trough conservatives and the and are are all again pointing to mental illness in response to a school shooting but how can the mental health system stop a shooting when most shooters are mentally ill
it's friday february twenty third
i don't believe that this the same monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm
however i do not think that he should have gotten his hands on any kind of weapon
that's number one this individual was nuts
we don't know right now exactly why this deranged individual did is a man been on and a wacko came in and shut the five of us who were shot by this mad men and their homicidal maniac people like this with mental health issues troubled young man dealt with it rang the failure of america's
mental health system issues or mental health problems there was a mental have epidemic here would use computers for a gun problem this is a mental health issue this is not a gun and your common theme with these kinds of shootings his mental illness in this is something we should not be ignored

would you like me to code you like me to prefer to you
dr pretty nationally dr byron worst personally you can always come amy me about professional a doctor barnhart okay so doctor born hirst tell me about the day of disappointment
well it started out as to stay usual day in a busy crisis
oh i work as an emergency psychiatrist
in a crisis
that's adjacent to a impatience psychiatric hospital in california we see people who are acutely eller killing crisis maybe people feeling suicidal and depressed
maybe some folks who are probably because they were hearing voices and then the police brought this kid and he was a twenty one year old and his parents had called the cops because they had gotten concerned about some other stuff he'd been posting on social media
has person kind of gotten increasingly hostile but word generally vague up until the last few days where he had made some specific references to the columbine shooting and something about some death and destruction
and one of the things he referred to in his facebook page was a day of retribution
and when the police went to his house and spoke with the parents the brother mentioned that this patient had told him he was going to try to buy a gun and their brother thought he had done so but wasn't sure
and wanted the police bring him to your office they'd been told about this posting on facebook which is alarming
why did they bring him to you
well i really hadn't committed a crime
so they couldn't arrest him
but i imagine that the police were pretty worried about this guy he certainly had a lot of concerning signs and i think they brought him to us in the hopes that maybe the mental health system would be a way that we could prevent him from going down a bad path so what are you doing first what your role in this moment
it's my first thing as i get the chart and i flip through it and see what's gone on for this young man i probably would have had any records we had on him which was none and the legal hold that the police brought him in on which was just a piece of paper with a few lines may be something as simple as making threatening postings on facebook comma might have been
guns as brother
comma parents worried look in this case i had fairly a little accept that ominous information so i always build a picture in my mind of what people are going to be like before i meet them
but he did not really jive with my mental image that i had built up women if i met this young man
and he scanned for example like in a manic episode where he was impulsive where he was talking really fast where he was delusional and grandiose that i might be indicative that he was in fact mentally ill and then maybe this idea about threatening up at school
was secondary to your mental illness that could be treated and thereby we could prevent the shooting at act of violence
but in the case of him i mean he looks
not like somebody with a mental illness he didn't have any of those science
he was a nice enough kid not particularly angry to me although it was easy to see that he had some darkness and i think he was a little swollen and depressed
not happy with his social standing and how things had been going at school
he said that he didn't think he had a mental illness he didn't want treatment he didn't need treatment he seems more like a sad brooding kid who was hurt and realized he had done something wrong and really wanted to go home
so ultimately you're trying to determine if this post on facebook was coming from a place of mental illness
or possibly something else
yeah
some trying to figure out if he is going to meet criteria to be in voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital
and in california in order to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital and voluntarily you have to meet one of three criteria
do either be dangerous yourself dangerous to somebody else are gravely disabled which means that you're not able to provide for your own basic needs like your food clothing and shelter
and you have to meet one of those three things because of a mental illness so even if this young man is angry or showing propensity towards violence you'd need to determine that these emotions are coming from a mental illness in order to involuntarily committed right
so this point i'm making a primarily clinical decision about whether or not i admit this young man for treatment but i also know that my clinical decision to have legal implications for him
because there's a difference between an admission to a hospital and a commitment as dr what i do as i make the clinical decision to admit someone to a hospital
the commitment is a legal process that has done by the judge or the hearing officer
and that's the checks and balances in that system that makes sure that some doctor can't just admit people willy nilly and hold them in a hospital indefinitely with no liberties
and so if he is committed than his name goes into a federal database of people who are prohibited from purchasing guns
and any time a federally licensed dealer does a background check his name will come up as a prohibited person and he won't be able to buy a gun
but he'll still be able to purchase from private party sales and from internet sales and from controls were in most states they don't do background checks and so this is how someone like you interacts with the most people think of is the federal background checks and yes that's use forgotten purchase yes
this feels very complicated what you're describing because so often people are expressing violent thoughts but mental illness is not clear and yet as dr you want to prevent them from carrying out these acts
i assume so how do you grapple with people who fall short of that glaring mental illness but who are expressing violent thoughts
i mean it's hard because we do see people every day especially in a crisis setting that we we want to help but they don't meet that criteria for involuntary help and then help and so we have to let them go and sometimes that involves people with the potential for violence
and it is a balance between people's civil liberties and their right to make choices that i may not think are the best traces it's really hard from the vantage point of being a psychiatrist to prevent violence since most violence is not caused by mental illness
about four percent of community violence is attributable severe mental illness four percent four percent so that would mean the ninety six percent of the rest of violence occurs in the community has nothing to do with mental loss cracks
you know how mental illness little leads to mass shootings specifically in terms of cause and effect and scale
yeah i mean so this is a tricky question we get into semantics a little bit here because it's hard to stand by an argument that people who make posts like this or that anybody who goes into a school and opens fire and students is some paragon of psychological well being i think everybody would agree that these people are not mentally well
per se
but
that is really different than actually having a specific mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder a major depressive disorder
a lot of the characters of these mass shooters
are similar and that's up to say that none of them have metal and because some have but a lot of them are just really angry resentful that are young men who have similar histories of social isolation they've been bullied they have harbored revenge fantasies
they have an entitlement toward social standing and towards attention for women
they feel like they're not getting the popularity the attention the recognition they deserve that they deserve so there's this idea that they're better than everybody thinks they are and they kind of want to show the world that so how would the treatment of someone like that differ from the kind of treatment they would
and if they were determined to be mentally it seems like in either case some kind of treatment
is needed so what's the difference
well one of the big difference is we do have medications for things like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
we don't have medications for things like resentment hatred and anger at the world we can't fix that so well
so there's no way to admit somebody like that to a psychiatric hospital treat them over the course of the two weeks that we may be able to have them and then completely change the personality that they've spent their whole life building up and sounds like this young man who's standing in front of you fits that profile more than one have a clue
really mentally ill person absolutely he fits the profile of the angry socially isolated young man with no mental health history
so what's come to your head
as you make this decision whether or not to admit him
so in my mind
i'm thinking to myself this young man does not appear to be mentally ill to me
he doesn't appear to potentially be dangerous but that's not something that is going to be changed by many him to a psychiatric hospital on
and if i send him home then i'm concerned that i had my chance to intervene with the next mass shooter and i did nothing
and now he's back home has gotten

will do it back


so dr of on her you've spoken to this young man you've learned that he has posted on facebook something quite scary you've learned that he may have just purchased a gun you don't know and now it's your job to decide whether or not to commit him
first serious mental illness what do you decide to do he did not elect me like he had a mental illness
knowledge to me like he technically met the standards for involuntary commitment
but i really didn't want to be wrong and in the end i decided to admit him because there are some leeway in the statute so it's ultimately up to the judge to make the decision of whether or not he gets committed officially so i admitted him to you aired on the side of caution to get him into this kind of mental health
legal pipeline i did it sounds like you're saying part of you understood quite clearly that he might not be mentally ill but you are making a kind of civic as well as medical decision to keep him out of the general population i mean one of the principles are practicing medicine as that
higher the risk of the possibility the more certain you want to be that it's not the case
so if i'm worried that somebody might or might not go home and punch a wall
i'm willing to be fairly liberal in making a mistake they're much marceau liberal than if i'm worried somebody may or may not go home and shoot up at school
you can live you can live with one art dealer i am willing to let them a little bit of freedom if the risk of my giving them some free time and letting them go is that they might shoot a bunch of people in the school i need to be really really confident that i am rate and that is not going to happen
and what happened i admitted him to the hospital he went before the hearing officer a few days later and the hearing officer
yeah he was not dangerous because of the mental illness and then he's no longer up in voluntarily held use free to go to you had to let him go the system had a logo yeah we had a lot of go
so doctor does this man end up on the federal background check system given the latest has played out know because the judge did not certify his commitment in court
he did not land on the federal background checks systems list of prohibited person's but because i admitted him to the hospital he does meet criteria for a five year probation just with in california that prohibition will expire and a couple of years and were he to move to another state he would still be able to buy a firearm there in the meantime
do you think the this system failed this young man in this moment and as a result failed the rest of us
you know it's hard for me to say that this system failed this young man because this young man is not who the system was set up to help
he's not somebody that we have a treatment or care for
because he wasn't mentally ill
the unfortunate part is the criminal system
i couldn't help them either because he hadn't done anything criminal
so what do you think when you hear gun rights advocates talking now so much about mental health do you think there's an understanding of what that actually means in practice
i think there's not and i think it's important for folks to have a better sense of what it looks like played out in practice
which is it doesn't look very good there's not a lot that in actuality we can do for these people and the irony is i think a lot of the folks who point towards the mental health system has being less restrictive way of decreasing gun violence because they don't want to lose their rights to own firearms
the part about their missing because they don't see what happens in the real mental health world is that if we were going to really try to prevent violence and mass shootings
within the mental health system we would have to expand the net of who we were allowed to and voluntarily detained and hold enormously in order to find those one or two people in thousands that might actually perpetrate mass violence would we have to therefore expand the definition of mental illness
i mean it's hard to expand the definition of an illness but i think we would be talking about dramatically expanding their reaches of the mental health system
and largely the involuntary mental health system because mostly were looking for people who are not seeking treatment on their own so what that looks like is that we will lower the bar really far in terms of who we will be able to and voluntarily commit and it would be almost every angry young man who had a history of social isolation
boyd who had an interest in violent video games and collecting guns who ever made macabre sounding facebook posts are comments about wishing everybody his school were dead
that's actually a lot of people and it's easy and hindsight to look at max theaters and say they showed all the warning signs but when you look forward that's a lot of people that you would have to take out of their world and out of their lives and in voluntarily detained in the mental health system and probably to not much and
what do you mean to that much and well eventually we have to let them go is unlikely that we'd be able to fix them
so even if we were allowed to keep them for three weeks or three months
i don't know that we would be really solving the problem we would just be keeping them out of circulation for a little while

i wonder how often you think about this young man who he admitted and then who the court system of the girl and who now
rooms the world
i think about him every time there's a school shooting

thank you
much thank you

hughes what else you need to know please welcome me executive vice president of the national rifle association wayne la pierre

from the new york times on michael are
is the day
today
for years republicans have campaigned on gun rights while democrats running for office have avoided the can issue altogether
will this year's midterms finally be about gun control

it's wednesday february twenty
tim walls a gun owner he grew up hunting and spent twenty four years and the army national guard tim walls is a house democrat from southwestern minnesota pretty rural district it he was the classic archetypal the boy
rural democrat
tim was you know growing up putting taught me a lot about responsibility and respect lessons i hope to pass on to my kids ran for congress with pro gun credentials jonathan martin covers national politics for the times got money from norway and an order to a radio from the and so when you're in that district this
a resume that really works pretty well i'm proud to stand with the in our a to protect the rights of sportsmen and gun owners that's why i approve this message tim was he works for us
paid for by walls for congress
now though he's running for governor
i imagine jonathan that this is the kind of candidate that democrats are looking for right now in this moment particularly in red states and purple states he had ah craps who lost the presidency because they fell short and a series of states and industrial metal ass are now looking for a political comeback
of path back to relevance and you've had somebody with military credentials pro gun credentials name sounds like a pretty strong state wide kill it from minnesota which by the way hillary only narrowly carried twenty sixty so that all sounds quite good so why are we talking about this guy today well because
i'm a way to being the ideal candidate running for governor in a purplish stayed till walls has come up against a challenge
one of the credentials that made him so appealing to at least strategist and the democratic party his support for gun rights is now increasingly unacceptable to activist in the democratic party people around us failed and
if they continue to fail us name will no longer be in office because soon we'll be given the abilities clubs and we will vote and outs and the people around us have been out in the wake of the horrible shooting and for though he is facing a real challenges from his laughed as he runs for the democratic nomination for governor
so he quickly has moved to detach himself from any connection to the and our a he posted something of an apology on facebook talk about how his views have changed on guns i will not i've taken no money image gubernatorial campaign i will not break any
i expect that the opposite of what happened in a lot of a money will be used against me he is basically cutting all ties to the in r a and embracing gun control after the shooting because he recognizes that this has created a clear and present danger and his march to the nomination for governor of minnesota it should be expected
that our legislative leaders should follow the will of the people is and if you have a walk in a coffee shop over the last week and fifteen conversations on how this must and you're not getting out and about and i'm here
so why it was just now doing this why would he have ever been campaigning as a gun loving democrat if you would push away democratic voters yeah i think this was the challenge for democrats in the recent past the gun issue was not the motivating force for gun control advocates like
it was for gun rights activists ten and one not well i think that in the universe of the most ardent gun rights activists that was their top issue in they voted the energies a political force in american politics because they have an ability to galvanize their supporters and drive them
the polls in state after state and election after election and democrats even if they or support of of gun laws didn't necessarily show up and vote on the issue in the same way it was not the sort of central for for a lot of democratic voters in general elections could also be jonathan the because it is a motivating factor for
republicans democrats just haven't had any success with can control the republicans have been winning that fight so it's not really an issue or campaigning on or voting on it there's no one is really expecting the democrats to get anything done
great point you make the party had affectively wave the white flag especially in the senate you know it's pretty tough for democrats to retain a senate majority if they are not winning and hold it in a lot of rural states
so what are we seeing taunton from republicans they've so effectively blocked of control for so many years now and mass shootings haven't seem to affect any of that if anything the narrative has been that the mass shootings have strengthened the and right and therefore the gun lobby and made the possibility of don't control seemed even less likely yeah that's right
different now is that the party is facing deep challenges in the mid term's across a lot of suburban house districts
facing challenges and a lot of governor's races and states that have large swath of cities and suburbs you add to that fact a president who is uniquely unpopular in modern american history where he's is popular michael is the issue for the republican he's not unpopular in some of the more rural reaches of the country where
a gun raised or treasured he's deeply unpopular in cities and suburbs in so if you're a republican and you're trying to figure out a way that you can create some distance between yourself and donald trump with suburban voters then you can criticize him but you can also create space on policy issues where is one obvious
policy issue or you can say look i'm a different kind of republican i support commonsense gun restrictions
can you give us an example of a republican dealing with this post parkland batter yes i'm brian best candidate for congress here in eighteen congressional district there are some in florida and near where the shooting happened including brian managed to a combat veteran who lost both of his legs who
is a junior house republican face a potentially difficult reelection i think most people who know me know that the second amendment is something that's very important to me mast was a supporter of gun right and i would encourage our lawmakers who are out there cause for gun confiscation to take a look at some of the horrific events occurring around
the world they all could have been prevented
where there are people president who are prepared to defend themselves the opposed restrictions on guys outlaw almost a lifelong and are remember i know the pride of owning a weapon of collecting of going out there and hunting shooting with family doing claes going out there and putting rounds and to steal my kids i
do it all the time but we got to look at keeping our community safe and protecting our children are protecting our schools after this massacre though he has had a sort of change of heart my community my country is not safer with this unfettered access of anybody that's eighteen years or older having access to this platform and is now calling for it not
expanded background checks are raising the age of those weapons he actually is calling for the banning of song automatic sales that pretty significant from a republican seeking office it sure is and especially somebody who seek the office in a state where most the republicans are pretty soon
supportive of gun rights you don't see a lot of florida republicans deviating from the and line
and in who is mast facing pressure from well the pressure masters facing is from his constituents because he is looking at a potentially competitive reelection this fall and had a district that straddles the atlantic coast in florida and this is middle class upper middle class floridians a lot of them who have moved to this day
stroke from parts of the northeast they just don't support the gun rights orthodoxy did folks in more rural districts in other parts of the south do so the kind of suburban district you are talking about where there's some skepticism about the president and can control might be the sort of thing that would when voters over
that's exactly right so this the district where the president's numbers were already on stan eat because of the demographics there and if you're somebody like brian massed you don't want this gun issued to be the final brick him the wall that walls you off if you will from those voters who are trump skeptics
so is the take away of what's happening to walls and mast a democrat and republican who are now both walking back their positions on gun rights is the take away that the whole country is now leaning toward gun control
no that's not necessarily or what's happening i do think that it's clear bet if you take any suburb or city across this country i think you're going to see an increasing openness if not it to me infraction on guns and i think that that's the same whether that's broward county florida
seattle what have you what has also certain is that if you're a democrat running in a democratic primary now for state wide office it doesn't matter anymore what state you're looking to represent party activists are going to demand that you support gun control
it's not gonna be a sweeping nation wide phenomenon gonna be a phenomenon happens and politically crucial regions
so let's talk about how this might actually play out in the elections returning to walls the n r a supporting democrat walking that support for the enter a back how our voters in minnesota responding to him doing that
well so far he was for seen as the likely nominee for democrats going into their primary and he is now under fire
rebecca auto who finished second to walls in this month's caucuses blasted walls new stand some his rivals for the nomination are swiftly tried to use against him say to a little too late to little too late
i've been meeting unless he's following the reason he's changing his mind is for rock political reasons he took money from entering in two thousand and eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen you also anger your old allies a long gun right support me so walls is now catching heat from the supporters of gun rights to see a one time out
i abandoning them and they're obviously not going to forget that so i was offered a really interesting test for just how damaging past ties even tighter that a recanted to the and are a could be in a dominating process
so if was is any indication and turning against guns upsets those trump leaning moderates and republicans he was hoping to appeal to doesn't have this sort of and democratic candidates like walls who were building their campaigns are around appealing to more moderate and republican voters yeah i think this is the risk is that
by moving the left done guns to fend off challenge his in his democratic primary for governor has walls and turn created new difficulties in the general election by sharing his tires to the and are a and losing what had been a political asset that he had among room
voters the ability to say i'm a democrat but i'm a different kind of democrat on the kind of democrat that you can support for governor and what about for these republican candidates like masked what's the risk for the them of walking back their support for gun rights well they don't want to necessarily rule out additional gun control because they think maybe this time
his dear friend perhaps this is the moment where we are forced to act on this issue with the more sweeping away but at the same time they're also loath to embrace gun controls because they don't want to be on the wrong side of the an array if a week from now like we have in the past we've kind of moved onto the next big story and it's not nice
sarah a clear michael you gained as many or more political allies by doing this because the people that maybe most appreciate the fact that you've moved on the issue and him ryan mass still might vote against you
send a message gets drop right or they may not believe that transformation is sincere genuine exactly
it feels like whether it's walls or last a democrat or republican candidates were talking about are now calculating that that's something meaningful has changed in the politics of the gun debate and they're betting that advocates of gun control are now as animated and likely to vote as a
rock as gun rights violators have been in the past is that the thinking he had that's the big take away from this is is this finally the big one is yes
the gun violence moment the has be calibrated the politics of this issue so that there's going to be something close to parody when it comes to people who vote on the guns voting because they support gun control rather than voting on guns because they support key lives the post on control right because the question your your
asking and candidates are asking his his gun control finally an issue that voters will vote on rather than just gun rights yes that's the issue we didn't have we now gotten to the moment where it is it is as safe or perhaps even safer in some parts of the country to run calling for
gun control because you know that people are going to show up and vote on the issue of gun control is that now the sea for political that then we in the past which is assuming that only the advocates of guns are going to be the ones that show up and vote on the issue when was the last time that we were in this position
we're out there
lurking in the darkness thinking unpalatable twisted thought is the next year buddy
preparing to slaughter of innocent on armed men women and children
and when that day counts as tragically and surely it must
the nation will turn to ask that gun owners and say you are the cop was on this and that is what we must work to counter the last time that guns was a major issue in an election was nineteen ninety four democratic politician said at one time you're done
allow themselves to be corrupted either clinton administration when president clinton had signed the assault weapons ban as part of the cry and will have a lot of democrats especially rural parts of the country lost their seats not a single republican incumbent lost a race for the house senate or governorship in tuesday's mid term elections
the election results of course give control of congress to the republican for the first time and sub forty years
now they didn't lose their seats entirely because of the guys that there was a larger discontent with clinton in the democratic party driving that but certainly and somehow seated it was one of the major issues so in our case the lesson for democrats will is not to pushed on control now have the opposite less seems to be happening for republicans
yeah in the mirror image parts of the country by the way to been a lot of the democrats who lost and ninety four especially in the house where from more rural districts and how the republicans who fear a similar political backlash on guns are the ones running in suburban parts of the country
so this is a test essentially of were moderate america really stands on guns
it's a test of how willing a moderate americans who are unquestionably in the ranks of gun control supporters how will they are to vote their passion on guns are those centrist voters finally going to show up in the in the polling place and know make guns one of their
top items that's really the question
thank you very much
thanks mikey
we'll be right back

here's what else you need to know your chief of staff general kelly has recommended ending the purpose of granting interim security clearances to members of the trapped in se asia
if that precedes what you be willing to grant a waiver to jared kushner when a senior advisers
what an outstanding job i think he's been treated very unfairly is a high quality person the president's son of jared kushner has been stripped of his high level security clearance limiting his ability to view highly classified information so that will be up to general kelly a general kelly respects shared a lot
general kelly will make that call i won't make that call i will let the general who is right here
make that call like many top white house officials kushner had been operating on an interim security highlights for months because of delays in completing his f b i a background check
kelly has begun to evoking those clearances after another white house aide who was relying on to rob portman resigned over allegations of domestic abuse
officials have not said what has held up cautionary background check
the f b i closely scrutinized contact with foreign officials and questioners meetings with russian officials have been of interest to special counsel robert mother in his investigation
the interim security clearance had allowed questioner to see the presidential day in the brief the top secret summary of intelligence given to the president every morning
and the u n reports that north korea has been secretly shipping supplies to syria that could be used in the production of chemical weapons
the report comes as the us has repeatedly accuse syria of using chemical weapons on civilians including in a recent attack in a suburb of damascus that killed dozens of people their deaths
was an affront to humanity
these hate his actions by the assad regime
can that be tolerated
un experts warned that the relationship would facilitate both countries in violating international laws helping syria maintain its chemical weapons supply while payments for those supplies would help north korea fund its nuclear missile

that's it
i'm like a small

from the new times on my fault
that
today
in the days since the shooting in park and for a small number of outspoken teenagers have reason to national prominence for their activism and there cause for gun control
but more than three thousand students attend stone and douglas high school
my colleague jackie you sat down with six

it's one march

so i flew down to portland florida and spend a week trying to get to know some of the kids who you didn't necessarily you see at the vanguard of the movement that has brought up in the wake of the shooting
one day
outside of the school i met brooke harrison and her parents denise and robert
we talked for a little while and couple nights later
i met up with brooke and several of her friends

oh you know
the girls are going to a certified together to talk as their parents sat out silent era and chat with each other
early
so they were korea
in
two bills near madison lady and madison they call each other
annabel
and bro and
we talked about the activities that they pursue
yeah
a little bit about what they love to do is is gets
like just
so they were telling me about school and english class and writing an essay
hey
yeah
desks
nobody wants to be honest with a blessing
a lot easier to iran
no my desk is what usually i now
yeah no i just was for the door that's why it's not that guy because when i looked up i saw you did
has a this way
yeah why
and then they started telling me about the shooting
that's very my essay and we hearing gunshots using it was one it was like
yeah so in my head i i
the firecrackers
nice and anyone ever set off firecrackers and school before
just a you know it's like okay firecrackers and i remember the glass door brady and for some reason i ended up
do i remember it's price can i play but i remember being on the floor i want to see like a crack of like shower now it
oh i remember make opened my eyes i was on the other side of the door i was fully the teddy bear had guy and then i guess that's when he came in i realized what was happening
their entire classroom explodes we've gunfire
and i remember putting my hand over my head like a tornado drill just because i didn't want anyway
glass or any any any because you can you can feel like this stuff like following this now yeah
the elite i cannot describe vets now it wasn't like a fire it wasn't like any know how their own you when you smoke
ooh that's it got a guy and there was a lot of snuck a healing
i can't even explain it was hard to it was a definite yeah because they don't think wow
now that we've got yeah yeah
i was a black encourage per is there some way
i mean it's done in tibet and xinjiang bullets
honda about this i do really well
yeah
but there's no like fully in their you know a bullet casing was really fat in there was tear
one of the things
girls have done to try to understand what happened to them
a grand scale is to try to understand moment by moment where happened to them
a micro scale so this is the diagram okay you can see this is the door is the law that connects to the hallway mr
tonight reach added
draw a diagram of their classroom with each cluster of desks was which student was sitting at which desk and where the students fled once the bullet study
he will remain
the true images of were certain students were when they died and they do images of were they believe the bullets were coming in from
this was it was just like a map of the day that their childhood good
yeah
he's so the this is where i was sitting i was facing the door
alyssa was facing me and the shooter was firing through the window of the classroom door
which the student said was mocked this harsh i guess having some kind of cardboard so i kind of like top down and put it over my face to show i don't keep when i lived at least really i just thought that if you saw my eyes he would shoot eat because i was right across do it range so i'm like yeah you have to cover myself
i feel the whole world was spinning in everything was going in slow motion to vent the shots were just boot
know when you are you watching a movie and you see it happening but you're not there
wow didn't know already
we're excited yeah
i
when i i've thought about this about being in a school shooting and the one thing that i've always said that i would do is text you
thank you for everything and i was so like map and everything i wasn't going to be able to get to do that and now it's going to die and not let my mom know that i loved her
and then she shoots dillard our door and those classic all over lake in front of me
and then i just feel like a few shots happen over here and then i feel they said she's just sixteen days and then check falls back and then on
go silent
and i'm like skittish
and screaming your name
and then she i can't say

when does i yeah
the next door and they were young they only injure that yeah i would get out the really have the classes and i remember bear
screaming think he's come get us to without these computers he's coming out and i don't remember how i felt like hours from that to ours
swat officers stormed into the school they yelled into the classroom and asked whether there was any danger and of the classroom anyone with a gun
the students had no there wasn't and
they fled i received the tongue he put your hands yeah yeah i remember just for just like see like all these mass shootings in people running out with their hands
the person they thought was i then it's just put my hands and that's when i ran
they fled through a hallway that they described as being lined with swat officers and they burst out into the daylight and trim through a parking lot and to the edge of the school grounds and that's what i remember like running for my life getting my her
yeah i remember seeing the dog party doesn't want to keep them think then get out of here
yeah i ran from school
so far
as far as it's really i was a jeans they ask whether they hand i remember
good luck
still he took my femur outfit for evidence is there was blood on i was learning
oh i went i wash my teddy bear and be asked me up and on a i say no
you know i know but yeah we're getting the watch the committee months now as a tendency that teddy bear was the only thing i got out of that class when it was the only thing i was going to

in the two weeks since the shooting they have been spending a lot of time saw each other going to sleep overs going to memorials we were going to another after we act
you ain't got to gina
what we thought was genius hearing but are instead he walked in my best friend and i we walked in with our moms and
it was kind of weird because we were all wearing that pins that the ribbons and are and they asked what what the remnants or floor and we were like okay this one's for jamie and this one's for jenna and this one's for our stove and employers in general
and they're like on that floor and then mentally walked into the funeral home and then handed the us this car and we were expecting to see like jean his face on it but it was this guy named wrong
and it's all
as i leave mine to the wrong can yank it out but it was like the wrong
these girls are pretty resilient and they've actually been able to find some light moments in all of this
romney wrong
things run for me
so when we talk to girls were incredibly composed and even laughed at times
but then they are still just by tomorrow back into that day that's all a me to the like it's fine
i feel defeated
that's not like it's not raining down on my mind it's not going to be thought i'd say never you know if i

this week marks the first full week back at school for the students at stone the douglas high school
on saturday despite weeks of lobbying by the students the florida senate rejected a proposal to ban the sale of assault weapons
we'll be back
here's what else you need to know having to take your questions
a fairly strong manufacturing center in this community and i'm pretty sure that because your what your government plans to do on tariffs announced on them student yourself
we require be in of the new tariffs rating tariffs on steel or aluminum between our two countries is absolutely unacceptable
a week he was treating which to retaliate against president troops plan for tariffs on imported metals
with terrorists have their own on everything from american leave motorcycles to furthermore the level of cooperation and integration of our militaries are defensive north america and are working together on a broad range of security issues in canada prime minister of justice
trudeau said that trumps rationale for the terrorists that imported steal from his country was a national security threat to the u s
makes no sense
the president doesn't really do this because if he doesn't screw that
just going to be a huge turn on american citizens back in washington senators from the president's own party including orrin hatch in utah and then sas of nebraska
openly opposed to the tariffs seeing the would hurt american consumers by raising the price on goods don't use aluminum and steel in a steel mill today was great for you if you consume stale and every american family at the start and i not something that has different metals to there is a bad day for you in an interview on
fox news
the president's chief treated like peter nirvana
was asked about the criticism from republicans are sas and hatch little the chair of the senate finance committee
wrong
and of course they're wrong and in terms of the republican party to remember this don't shop for and against sixteen republicans none of those republicans supported donald trump's positions on trading read every one of

that's it for the ah michael moore bottle


from the new york times on michael barbara
is the day

saturday
in announcing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum president trump said they would protect national security
but what if the threat to national security are the terrorists themselves
it's thursday march
peter when's the last time that we were in a big trade war the nineteen thirties that's the classic case of trade conflict yielding catastrophe peter goodman covers economics for the times from roughly eighteen seventy told the first world war
that's a period economic historians consider you know the first wave of globalization where there's a lot of trade a lot of development of new markets and the world's been nipped together in a way in which it had not been proven
and world war one and did that and produced a lot of nationalism distract economic insecurity and all of this lives on through the first decades of the twentieth century where you have this retreat to protectionism to countries
putting tariffs and other sorts of restraints on trade to protect their domestic industries and the crescendo of this is this nineteen thirties law adopted by a republican controlled congress called the smoot holly tariff fact i'm broke
which comes as the us sinking into the great depression obama
robin job but rarely come in under an unmarked
and the republicans in congress resort to protectionism as the fix they jack up tariffs on hundreds of products to levels that had not been seen in a century and this is supposed to put a wall around american factories and farmers and protect them from the ink
persians of foreign competitors but the results are immediately disastrous
no longer bring my job
yeah
a moving out from home
had become habit of our moms and radical talk boiling
america's trading partners in europe in latin america start imposing their own tariffs so suddenly american farmers to we're supposed to be protected now can't export their wares to other markets around the world and the economy which is already in the depression sinks deeper into the
it's certainly not the cause of the great depression but it is widely seen as a cause that exacerbated deepened lengthened the great depression and trade grinds to a halt really and around much of the planet
so even though these terrorists holly tariffs were meant to be defensive measures to protect the united states economy and its industries it sounds like it ends up being offensive and very provocative well it certainly has that effect i mean when you impede imports
from another country you are effectively hurting the livelihood of the people in that country who make their living selling stuff to you and they're not real happy about that and then domestic politics in other countries then demands similar retaliation people are angry and accusatory and now
suddenly just about every country i'm in great britain france nazi germany response to these american tariffs with their own tariffs that's what the effect of the smooth holly tariffs ultimately had we had tit for tat terrorists
out overnight and economic bunker
india
the on grinding robert
chanel other fewer opportunities for everyone and as a result european nations that are already feeling tremendous hostility and insecurity toward one another have a new reason to feel that way i mean it enhances the nationalistic animosities that have been unleashed across the continent
there is a blame game and it's easy to go and blame the people on the other side of border for effectively damaging your your livelihood any it is certainly a contributor to what becomes world war two so in this case a trade war actually is a factor in a real or it is
certainly a factor
so does the us and the rest of the world absorb that lesson after world war two yeah very much so
oh yeah and watching guy named examination up by congress convenes during one of the caution okay
mm hmm a cabin on a white be arrive on a private i'm trauma and
so the powers that emerge victorious from world war two and the united states is if the top of the list build this new economic order world economic cooperation and essential
and the fundamental idea is that if people are tied by commercial interests if they're trading with one another if they're engaging in commerce together than they are less likely to develop murderous impulses to one another
weymouth no other or the reconstruction of world
and
my own international system and ring
this idea is that the center of the global trading or that emerged from the war first with the so called get the general agreement on tariffs and trade which starts up in the mid forties and that gives way in the mid ninety's to the world
trade organization which is often described as the referee for global trade show their own agreed upon rules are now one hundred and sixty four members and operates by consensus everybody agrees you extend a deal to one world trade organization member if you lower your tariff on some product and you have to extend that same deal
to all the others and if they're disputing then you have this institution that adjudicate and looks at the rules and proposes remedies and it's it's all about settling disputes before there's a war
so after trade had contributed to a world war and it sounds like a driving idea behind this global trade agreement was that the opposite of could also be true and that having friendly productive trade relationships could actually preserve peace yeah exactly right
that they connected in his through trade would be a tremendous disincentive against war because war with them beating erupting something that depends upon peace to continue that's the fundamental idea
so has the global trade agreement and the de vito worked in terms of preventing the kind of devastating treat conflicts that we saw in the nineteen thirties yeah it has but there have been some flare ups i'm in in in the early eighties japanese production of automobiles
is almost twice as great per worker in america we did come pretty close to trade war between the united states and japan japanese steel workers are produced their american counterparts by about twenty five percent when reagan took on the japanese over surging exports of cars to the us now this and because they're about
our workers are match the american working man or woman again study one wanna were so what happened with reagan and the auto industry and japan in the nineteen eighties so reagan comes into office in january he want the american auto industry is in a generally pretty rough shape new cars and you
cause stand like shining tombstones in the showrooms in parking lots of the nation's car dealers on loved unwanted and unsold the seventies was the time of oil shocks gas is really expensive people can no longer afford to run cause that do twelve miles to the ghana and americans have now acquired a taste
later smaller more fuel efficient cars and detroit just isn't producing them
toyota that's country tough and city smart to stop and go you be asking for toyota and we'll japan has stepped in and suddenly flooding the united states with fuel efficient cars americans are buying them up and their landing and dry was all across the united states can enjoy the high
highest it cause you can put a price
and is under pressure from the auto industry to give them some breathing room so that prompted reagan to jawbone the japanese and to threaten tariffs that ultimately landed on some other products as well but the concentration on cars resulted in japan to voluntarily restrain their own export
the voluntarily or voluntarily yeah so how was it in this case that we avoided a trade war with japan why did japan basically agreed to do what reagan asked well in this case both sides of a lot of interest and avoiding a trade war the us has got military bases
in japan is pledged to defend japan and event of attack and there's just no scenario where japan's gonna have sustain hostilities with the united states and for reagan reagan fancies himself a free trader he doesn't want to have a trade war he's he doesn't want to have a breach with the world trade organization he doesn't want to be seen
as as unilaterally disrespecting the rules of global trade so both sides find this financial i so called protectionism is almost always self destructive doing more harm than good even though it's supposed to be helping advocates of protectionism often ignore its huge he hadn't crossed that far outweigh any temporary
benefits so this is an example of these global trade roars and global trade institutions working this is an example of yes the rules based global trading system working and also the pragmatic interests of business and consumers which generally carry the day
hey over the kind of screening of protection the european union has not treated as well
and it's been a very very unfair trade situation i'm here to protect him one of the reasons i was elected as i'm protecting our workers on protecting our companies and i'm not going to let that happen
trumps trade advisers will often point to the nineteen eighties example with japan and cited as evidence that if you stake out a tough position if you sell people on the idea that you're willing to go to war then that can be a fruitful prelude to negotiations to get your which won
but the situation today is quite different from the situation in the nineteen age
will be i


so peter from everything you've said tariff should be imposed carefully to solve a problem because of their power to trigger a trade or so what problem are the terrorists that trump is proposing on steel and aluminum supposed to address will trump is rhetorically going
after something that is in fact a problem in the global economy and has way too much steel being produced regard governments around the world subsidizing steel production there is a large glut of steel on world markets and a lot of it's coming out of china the us and the european union plane china as been dumping steel products on
the global market will just hurt their own steelmakers oh steelmakers continue to fight a losing battle against for studio
china the models feel make a giant mix all other countries buy and sell for less than a plant here to make
the issue here is that these terrorists that the trump administration has outlined would hit not china which sells only about two percent of the steel to the united states that's consuming notes states but every other american trading partner that sell steel canada which is the number one supplier
south korea japan taiwan germany mexico these are countries that view themselves as key american allies that are committed to the rules based global trading system that are suddenly being hit by the impacts of these tariffs
so the math that you just laid out is pretty remarkable present trump says that these terrorists are about cheap chinese steel but we only get about two percent of our steal from china so actually these tariffs are mostly hitting the other countries that we get our steal from including may of our allies but does this
and least solve a problem for us manufacturers
the idea is that you help american steel producers were operating in a global climate where there's all this surplus chinese steel that's bring down prices and making it very difficult for them to be profitable and certainly the steel industry lost a lot of workers there are a lot of weight on your workers and the industrial midwest
the steel producers themselves are happy about these terrorists the problem is that in the american economy there's something like eighty times as many people who wake up and go to work at companies that buy steal as there are workers who go to places that make steel so when you help the steel companies sure
up their profits by protecting them from overseas competition you've hurt everybody who depends upon buying steel many automakers have to pay if these tariffs happen the companies that make farm equipment construction equipment some of these are really big companies like caterpillar that are selling their
where's around the world they're going to have to pay more for steel so there would actually be potentially more american workers negatively affected by these tariffs then helped by though because more people sound like working companies that use steal that would be more expensive as a result of this then people who would benefit because they work
in domestic steel production of this is precisely why much of the american business world is up in arms about these terror well our biggest complaint really is that tariffs our taxes
the beer industry potentially three hundred and forty seven million dollars a year in taxes i'm very concerned there's significant risk here these tariffs will raise prices on american consumers of cars and trucks that are actually built in america
not just increase prices and in disruption to the supply chain but the fear of of retaliation that's already been stated by foreign leaders around the globe this is in fact the mainstream view among economists and businesses that you're helping one industry at the expense of everyone who depends upon buying the goods that that industry produces this is why
why gary cone the president's chief economic advisor walked out the door having failed to carry the day with this argument that the economy would be hurt by these tariffs so then what exactly is the president's justification for doing this the justification for these terrorists from the trump administration i mean we
in defense we need great steelmaker is that import of steel and aluminum constitute in national security threat to the united states so the idea that americans are not as safe as they would be because we're buying steel and aluminum from canada so he's the president
saying peter that any event of war we would need plenty of steel plenty of aluminum presumably for weapons for ships for planes and we need to make sure to protect our own domestic manufacturing of those materials instead of relying on another country for those medals is that basically the argument yes
plus it is this idea that there's something sacred about steel and aluminum and it from out of control of it if you don't have our own supply of it at home than work harold but let's remember that something like two thirds of the steel the we're consuming in the united states is produced in the united states if the us
generates two thirds of the still that we consume how could there be a national security threat of a suddenly not being able to produce enough of our own still well if mr trump goes through with this plan that's a question that some judges in geneva the world trade organization will probably be wrestling with so this could actually
up in that global rules system that you've been describing well we have
they a statement in response to the announcement that president
donald trump i mean european union in as signal that it's likely to challenge these tariffs as illegal under debate year
stand ready to respond to family and in the proportionate manner
on the bases and that's required by two routes now that present something of an existential crisis to the world trade organization because built the end of the world trade organisation is a lot of deference to sovereign nations and they may be tempted to say we may or may not agree with this rationale
but the united states is sovereign nation has the right to determine for itself when it's national security is on the line if they rule that way the result of that will be no a giant hole in the rules based global trading system because that would presumably open the floodgates to lots of other assertions from other countries that are looking for
an opportunity to protect favorite industries
on the other hand if the infallibility these trump terrorist if they say no we're not buying it there is no real national security claim here that could prompt the drug administration which has been openly hostile to the world trade organization to either to disregard the referee and let the game go on in which case they were
all have undermined the power of the world trade organization or to just pull out all together then we'd be in uncharted territory
so you're saying that his proposal by president trump has the potential to really throw the global trading system
in to crisis current so power of other countries responded to the threat of these tariffs on aluminum and steel it is at traditionalist being discussed h will now be shared with member states i mean european union as already signalled that if these tariffs happen they're gonna put retaliatory tariffs on a bunch
sensitive american products i would say that on the least they're steel products that are industrial products in their agricultural products and certain types of that is indeed on the list bourbon which has produced overwhelmingly in kentucky were shown mitch mcconnell anxious hand harley davidson motorcycles
which come from state of wisconsin home of house bigger paul ryan and other sensitive proud are he done in the trans decision to impose terrorists unseal an animal in court has fueled the of an escalating trade will canada mexico china australia brazil and the european union are are threatening retire
earlier toy measures against us product so we regard the imposition of any new tariffs and rating tariffs on steel and aluminum between our two countries is absolutely unacceptable
firmly and commands to defend our interests
we're no longer talking about individual industries were no longer talking about protecting strategic industries were talking about using trade to inflict harm across borders
so if these terrorists that the president is threatening on aluminum and steel if they don't really address a national security threat and if they wouldn't actually do all that much to change the global trading math around steel and aluminum and if it's really just can end up
setting our allies and provoking all this retaliation is there some other reason why president trump is doing this
we're going to put american steel and aluminum back in to the backbone of our catch these tell fulfill a very prominent campaign pledge that this president plan on we're going to put the miners as steel workers back to what and allow him to go and be greeted warmly
by steel workers i mean in places like indiana illinois and one of the hardest as this
state of iowa manufacturing jobs you steal jobs ohio michigan pennsylvania and when i'm president guess what steel is coming back to pittsburgh at a lot of other things are coming where steel workers have seen really really awful unemployment have lost hope
have lost savings mean this is a way of saying i feel your pain folks i'm going to do so much about it's going to be so easy
i've done something about it
and he talked to trade expert and they see it as a sort of cynical ploy word you're effectively damaging the economic interests of more work in people in exchange for that photo op but the power of that photo op is an opportunity for this president who is very good at speaking directly to his base to
with a victory flag wall a bunch of nerdy economists run around screaming actually it's a lot more complicated than that and it seems to be a bad that those people will be drowned out by the sheer power of that imagery of steel mills hiring people
so this is about domestic politics but it sounds like there are very real
and potentially very destructive consequences
of these terrorists to the american economy to american workers and to our relationships with countries around the world yeah exactly right
the president is invoking national security as we discussed in trying to justify these terrorists but you think these terrorists actually threaten national security i mean if you believe that it's important for the united states to have the trust of its allies then there is an argument to be made that this jeopardizes
national security
i mean look out of the carnage of the second world war came this idea daily for commercial interests are linked if we're trading with one another there were less likely to take up arms against one another and go to war and the united states the largest economy on earth is now run
by a president who does not seem to believe in their basic idea that as a direct challenge to the collectivist notion that has driven not only trade policy but diplomacy in the post world war two era and it's coming in for a stiff test
and one could argue that that is a threat to american national security
peter thank you very much
thank you very much

on wednesday the european union announced the tariffs it plans to place on american made products in retaliation for the us terrorists including bed linens chewing tobacco cranberries and orange juice despite those threats the times reports that president trump is back
the to sign the terrorists later today
here's what else you need to meditate
the times reports that president trump has attempted to speak with the witnesses in the special councils russia investigation about what they told investigators in one case trump asked his former chief of staff right to treat us what he said to the investigators in another case the president has a
white house boy done began to publicly deny our report in the times that mcgann had told investigators that trump asked him to fire the special counsel
again never issued such a denial
the encounters could open a new line of inquiry for the special counsel about whether the president sought to tamper with witness testimony

that's it
my on him

from the new york times of michael for oil
is that
today venezuela thought it's loudest political prisoner had finally been silenced
only he had
two of the story
it's tuesday or thirteen
so for the past six or seven months a couple few times a week i will suit down at my laptop
and open up a video chat service that we believe is secure
and i will create a room private room that only leo lopez and i can access
i wait for a few minutes and at a certain point
the screen of flickers
that situation starts to swirl around and
after a minute or two i can see and we start talking you think it would be and okay
go back to your experience in some ways to warn
we didn't have much knowledge of a okay
right
we should we should get
you will how risky is the his decision to talk to you
oh it was always risky
yeah because the speech or me
my name is
remember leo lopez was under house arrest serving fourteen year sentence will hilton rights for the times magazine and the government that imprisoning him has said in the clearest possible terms he is absolutely prohibited to speak publicly and if he does so
he will be punished in a greater way than he ever has been before the white van right around the right
that night and he knows they're monitoring him all the time we took it for granted that there were audio bugs in his house at a minimum but it seemed fairly obvious that the secret police outside of his house with an assignment to surveil him would have some access
to his internet activity and in fact every so often
the shit
a white truck would pull up outside of his house and knock out his video and audio and internet connection area
and we would have to wait a couple of hours before the van laughed to resume contact
i think that
he said
fascists
but despite all this he was determined to keep talking so we took whatever precautions we could like what
we were you
couch yeah
college friend
for example would pretend to be college friends and this college friend is they get about shut down there and wondering is very little talk about journalism essentially non
yeah and over time i got to know our leo's kids men while was in elementary school own show
and then leopoldo junior
who was only an infant really when his father went to prison is now four years old and it's really getting to know his dad for the first time we alien
helios wife lillian which is kind of pop in and out and say hey it's good to see i haven't seen you for awhile and things like that the kind of keep this looking friendly and not like an interview setting
in sick
i don't know
play which can only be a couple of people
it's not for shaking thousands of as from tuesday
the thing is we often did joke around about the circumstances because despite the short term risk of him getting caught talking to me there was this larger ambient hope around my
be possible in venezuela
we saw people in this pro or position area waiting hours to vote vote and to recover democracy to recover democracy here in venezuela last summer was a moment in venezuela and modern history today's that could start turning point for venezuela controversial president nicolas or headlines all around the world we're talking
about this being a turning point for venezuela today's election could be a tipping point for a country that holds the world's largest oil reserves a lot of excitement here and all that this is the moment many here have been waiting for the opposition parties were rally getting into the political ranks to take some governorships and take more mayoralty s and hopefully put up a press
financial candidate who could win today venezuela rosa did ready to see that is not negotiable
and so when he and i started talking i think there was a very strong sense from both of us that while the future was unknown it was entirely possible that by the time this story came out leopoldo lopez could either be out
of house arrest and deeply engaged in the political life of the country or even possibly a candidate himself
allegations of election fraud in favor of present looked as ruling party won nearly all twenty three contested state governor show venezuelan president nicolas murderer consolidated power in an election us officials consider to share but as the weeks went on it became clear that the material governments
grip on power was only tightening depth and that st nicholas and the terrorist government is consolidating power isolating the opposition at of next year's presidential that said as white as president nicolas my a little has bought opposition parties from taking part in next year's presidential has been bought three opposition parties to running in the election a desert
solved opposition parties one by one they ended up prosecuting and chasing politicians of all different opposition parties out of the country or arresting them and so the picture of the electoral change just darkened and then shot
no one really important day in the fall i was out for a walk with my kids in my phone pain to the message from leo
telling me that he was afraid that he was about to go back to prison right away
i think it said a male have a few hours
you get audio know so i hurried home and we made the connection
okay
yeah over it
last night around at an early
out
thirty
political elite make any right
a
bird and
regular american have been working with need or needed
they'd taken his chief of security away and no one had heard from him since you're right
me and union
any charter
and eighty
and eight eight
you wrote about
able to complete your know
right
that i would money
oh

and now was for me a moment when i began to see what we were working on was not gonna end up coming out at a time with less penalty for him
and it may come out at a time where the penalties would be even worse but do you radio
are about any that
i am absolutely sure
oh my god
orchard
great you're in or or
get out
it was clear to you that this interview is going to come out while he was still a prison her and with the stakes being
quite high as high as possible
and maybe even higher than they were when we started
wait you will
we all are
i'm not what do go
yo
or you know that happen
you will be the only
or month and i will like you okay

well i'm struggling to really understand why is leo doings why is he continuing to talk to you
man i
i wish i knew i mean i'd ask we talk about it i try to understand to i don't think i don't think i can wrap my head fully around it i mean the honest truth is i wouldn't do it in his position
but i think part of the explanation for him
is the despair of the country around him
yeah i had any
before sunrise hungry venezuelans are waiting outside grocery stores praying for food trucks to arrive by midmorning there is little
those only better now i am only men design as more the chaos in the country of venezuela is profound each day at dusk the unemployed converge on this side white trash heap in downtown crack at average weight loss in venezuela now twenty five pounds according to three universe you have masses of
starving people sound even dying from simple infection is due to a lack of basic medicine
to country in the next five
dad levels of crime and violence
i can imagine here the highest murder rate in the world in caracas their living standards have one declined pulverized by triple digit inflation and a collapsing currency the exodus of refugees fleeing venezuela is on a scale
the western hemisphere has never seen before that compares to the syrian refugee crisis or the flight of the romania to bangladesh same way that my money and very annoying only god knows what we're going through acres in truth when he's hoping that we have a government that doesn't get over it or another
at this moment
he used to saturn and leaders should to take risks and so in a certain way his suffering is totally different or less than what most venezuelans are going through you're not willing to suffer like a dick are bring in a different way
a century thirty's now
we're not vote for a banquet very hungry because you know different ways
shades of the same lack of liberties and
so he sees his role as a definite leader in this moment
as experiencing some form of pain that may mirror what's happening outside this house
yeah i think it comes from this place of believing that he has a fundamental right to speak and if he doesn't exercise that right and take that risk
then he's being defeated and he's not standing up for the principles that he thinks all venezuelans should be out in the streets taking the risk of protesting and standing up for and so i think for and there was a sense that he can be rebellious and defiant in the way that's avail
double to him and in this case it's just speaking
right
change
he made it clear that it wasn't my decision
that it was his decision
and so absolutely certain that it was the right thing
to do
by this is an extraordinary experience i have to imagine as a reporter
to know that your work
we'll put leo in grave danger
yeah it's it's it's horrible and away
i mean look
you're a journalist they're going to be some stories where you think some of the people in the story belong in prison
sometimes that's what journalism and see that's the job
this doesn't feel like the job i mean it it feels like the job to tell his story but it doesn't feel right to know that the subject to a story could be imprisoned just for talking to me
it's been very easy to imagine the at the end he might end up in prison in venezuela might still be spiraling into in comprehensible past trophy and
i will have been gone he pulled on himself
and would that be okay if a country continues to spiral and his back in prison
it just seems like a very difficult position to be in
yeah i would turn it around on you
we're doing this in this is part of it
why what how do you feel about it
well if the daily as part of the the reason goes to prison and i don't know what to do with or maybe you do
i don't
i hope he's ok

big
yeah
will our leo and his family feeling the night before the story comes out i called them before the story appeared on line to see how they were doing
you should
crazy
summer
you from
lillian wants to talk to you
you
knowing how are you
had a conversation with lillian
there's a real reason why don't you
are you feeling about that right now

average

but lillian was also fully committed

yeah
history

julio lopez is totally undeterred leaving me voice messages in secret from the next room with the invasion force early feet away from him
because he's been speaking to me
the best rebellion
the test nonviolent protest that i can make at this moment is to speak out and chose to do with you
ask you please don't feel better about
what
please tell your people
now to leave me a stray please
as the only thing i asked for you and your people
forget about us


will his dad what this is about a refusal to be silenced clearly but also about getting the rest of us the rest of the world
to pay attention
i think without a doubt
part of his hope here is to get the international community engaged and invested and i think if his imprisonment
would create crater international pressure it pushes towards a regime change
that would be for him
the ultimate impact of the personal sacrifice

and so far they have not fulfilled the order for these arrests pulled all of those is still at home with his family with this increased military presence
we don't know what's going to happen
but threat of imprisonment
couldn't be any higher
and which is going to have to find out

see them


from new york times on michael barbara
the day
today she was the most famous black woman in america who exposed the systematic lynching of blackmail
when she died the times failed to write an obituary
how the paper of record is trying to fix that
it's friday march sixteenth

and
so how did the two of the mood to know
etc about ice i think that's why people love so much they're related their interest a little nuggets of history at a concert with dreams bro
often about things he never knew
the cause of death was cancer
the winner work and it's almost as though your have to be part sarah interest when he talked to families oh boy
back what you're hearing was this sudden or was a feeling for a while and almost consoling ma'am in some cases may get very emotional are you my dead
same thing i know good stuff you trying so hard to understand every detail about this person without ever having that
what do you do and it's a difficult thing to do when you're talking to somebody is breathing so i feel like you have to wants a job like this
thank you okay a good good old jews
bobo
i think who against remembered and how inherently involves judgment
it's news judgment
awesome farm judgment
and so look back at the obituary archives can paint a picture of what society evaluated and
no
amy pod nano he works on the old it's desk at the times where every morning dozens of submissions pour into her inbox candidates for a new york times obituary
so here we have our unless at the top we have the people we know are definitely going to do we're just waiting to sign ma'am we have her order free and then underneath our we have a less have to be added and in this case this morning i heard about ethel stein who was credited with getting the patent for a sock puppets so we decided to his side
on that one right away
the
i'll ask each other questions let make each other's brains about wow they really do this wow are they in the first to do that well islands are good story it now i think approximately one hundred fifty thousand people die between one edition to the newspaper in the next of course we don't hear about all of those in here about a sliver and then of those we have to pick three
three it's difficult job for sure
shortly after she joined the team she started getting emails from readers who are noticing the people left out why don't you have more women and people of color in pages you focus too much and white men
and as a woman of color this resonated with me and i wondered about it too and unkind and tucked it in their corner my mind
then one day amy discovered that the woman who brought tennis to the united states never gotten an obituary center i that away and corner of my mind and it sent her on a journey to see who else to new york times missed we often say that obituaries are kind of a review look at this i
yeah i'm representing society as we see today they're representing couple of generations ago and a couple of generations ago
women and people of color we're not really invited to the table to make a difference the way white men were so we thought maybe this was the perfect time to tell their stories the list was law there are a lot of big names spend surprised sarah's diane as brilliant photographer sylvia plath up
oh it fair
charlotte bronte the writer who wrote jane eyre another one whereas i'd be wells she was a journalist and sephora just who pioneered the anti lunching campaign she was one of the first people to create a newspaper i a black person or a black people specifically
and she is considered one of them most successful black all alive at the time and oddly we had a notice on the front page of the new york times when she got married but we had absolutely nothing about her death
when the editors came to me with this project i can't say that i was surprised to learn that the new york times didn't write about i to be wells death
but it was very very striking kill him dickerson is a national reporter for the times
be wells was born a slave in eighteen sixty two and holly springs mississippi this is the heart of the deep south
and the next year slaves are emancipated so she grows up during this period of reconstruction where you see dramatic black advancement black people go from being slaves to being able to vote including out to be wells father knew even see some being elected into state legislatures my earliest recollections
of reading the newspaper to my father and and admiring group of his friend he was interested in politics and i heard the words ku klux klan long before i knew what they meant i knew dimly that it meant something fearful by the anxious where my mother walked to the floor at night when my father was out to a political meeting our
job was to go to school and learn all we could
and then when i to be wells is sixteen years old her parents and a sibling she's one of eight they die of yellow fever so she takes on caring for the rest of her siblings she starts to work as a teacher after she drops out of high school and she finishes her own education at night and on the weekends that i think there's experience as hard as it
was it really embolden thing for her more than anything else right she's sixteen years old a black girl in the south but it gives her the sense that she can do a lot more than i think another woman in her circumstances might have even been able to fathom
and she applies bat boldness almost right away because there's a dramatic whiplash in the south almost all of these advancements that come out of reconstruction are reversed in the form of jim crow this is where you see racial segregation codified into law and with jim crow
oh comes a kind of cultural acceptance of violence against african americans and the worst example of this is lynching
so there's a period from the eighty nine used to the early nineteen hundreds when lynchings number in the thousands and you see crowds of people gather to watch these murders take place in cold blood
arriving here at twelve o'clock the train was met by a surging mass of humanity ten thousand strong a chair
and celebrate almost as if they're watching a sporting event
the nigger was placed upon a carnival float in mockery of a king upon throw so a is a journalist at the time she's moved from mississippi to memphis and she's watching and covering and watching and coverings lynchings here smith was placed upon a scaffold six feet square and ten feet high security
round within the view of all the be holders
here the victim was tortured for fifty minutes by red hot iron brands the rust against his quivering body commencing at the fee to brands replaced upon him and to buy and then so they were thrust against the face he played in rise in bodily and mental pain
then kerosene was poured upon him cottonseed halls place beneath him and set on fire she's observing these lynchings take place and she views them as what she calls a violent form of subjugate mission to terrorize black people so much that they become scared into submission
his clothes were torn off piecemeal and scattered in the crowd people catching this reds and putting them away as mentors and even when it's over people mutilate the body is they take fingernails and pieces of rope as souvenirs it was horrible every grown from the fiend
contortion of his body was cheered by the sickly packed crowd of ten thousand persons hundreds of people turned away but the vast crowd still looks calmly on
killing this sounds like an especially could have an awful
be data of covering lynchings you have here an african american journalist and editor who seems to have made it the focus of her journalists and how did she handle that how she react to it
i think it's hard to overstate how difficult this coverage must have been for her as a journalist and in fact there's one lynching in particular that really changes everything for her that's when a close friend of hers name thomas moss is himself lynched it was part of a grocery store
since i've been killed over a fight breaks out between black and white children and were playing marbles he's arrested over this fight brought into jail and then in the middle of the night a mob shows up at the jail they drag him out of his jail cell in his pajamas and they murder him in cold blood
after thomas masses killed to be wells changes the course of her life

we'll be right back

the free speech memphis tennessee may twenty first eighteen ninety two eight negroes learned since last issue of the free speech one little rock arkansas she sets out on a reporting mission across the south and she chronicles dozens and dozens of similar cases to find out what's really going on
she conducts extensive interviews she pulls official records she does data analysis august thirty first or yarborough taxes and on september nineteenth as houston a call it man was found lynched but so little attention was paid to the matter that not only was no record of made as to why these last two men were lynched but even their name
we're not given i mean in in many ways wells comes up with blueprint for investigative journalism that we still use today
and she doesn't because remember she's a black woman in the south who was born a slave
she doesn't have any inherent authority says she has to create it and she does it with evidence so this whole genre is kind of created out of necessity
through because of her position her status as a black woman who is probably didn't have a professional networks it sounds like the that's what forces her to be so thorough to be so enterprising and so dog it exactly to come up with these airtight arguments
that why people who may not have otherwise listen to her can deny and
what kinds of cases she find who was lynched and what was the reason given for the lynching rate attempted rape alleged rape suspicion of rape and the vast majority of cases she finds they begins with a black man who is accused of raping a white woman and said that particular allegation she
really is euros and on she decides to question it
and she does a systematic study in which she finds that there is very rarely any evidence of a sexual assault having taken place
and instead in fact she very often finds evidence of what was it consensual interracial relationship and she publishes her findings in a series of editorials and the newspaper that she compiles under the title southern whores and her findings are really upsetting to people not just because of what
she says but because of how she says it she writes nobody in this section of the country believes the threadbare old lie that negro men rape white women and then she really does not pull any punches at a time when it is not accepted for black men and white women to be together so
she's through were reporting showing that the rationale for word is already kind of shockingly unjustified act is bogus
his fiction

killen why was this important to wales why did she feel the need to document these lynchings in such fine detail she writes about how the people who are lynch
sort forgotten there very often nameless faceless no one knows their stories and said that becomes really important to her shootings it's important to remember that these were of real people with full lives with families thomas mass had a two year old child and his wife was pregnant when he was killed
my eyes filled with tears as outside of the list of unfortunate they had no requiem and like many a brave union soldier their bodies lay in many an unknown and on honored spot
she writes that if she didn't tell the stories her subjects would be forgotten by all save the night wind no memorial service to bemoan their sad and horrible fate
how did people react to the third uncomfortable line of reporting very aggressively very violently stories are written about her that call her a harlem and accord is on in the press and she's seen as this sort of time
packed less aggressor the likes of which people really have never seen before and they don't know what to do it
her newspaper is ransacked and she's lucky that she wasn't there are many people think that she would have been killed her life is threatened and she actually has to leave the south after these editorials are published and she never goes back because she's not safe anymore
who
then what happens to her
she moved to chicago where she continues to work as an activist she helps to found some really prominent civil rights organizations including the n double a c p but it doesn't last she's soon edged out of the leadership of this organization and others by names you know like poker to washington w e b two boys people who
we're much more conservative in their tattoos who were much more willing to be diplomatic when it came to the way that they communicated their causes and she just wasn't diplomatic with the white community exactly so her popularity really ebbs pretty dramatically later in life she runs for the state senate in illinois and but cheap
loses pretty badly
and then she dies when she's just sixty eight years old of kidney disease and nineteen thirty one in even though she is arguably the most famous african american woman of her time
her death was barely notice that a public she doesn't even get an obituary in the new york times


it strikes me is painfully ironic that it was her life's mission to document this era
and these injustices but then she herself and her life
didn't get documented
it is ironic and she's left out of a lot of black history so you know i think she came so far before her time
not just as an african american but as an african american woman
for his much of an impact as she was able to make she was one person so she knew how easy it was for this kind of thing to happen and that's precisely why she focused so intensely i'm keeping records and proving the humanity of african americans proving that black people are worthy of the same treatment as whites
and in fact she writes the afro american is not a beast your raise if this work can contribute in any way toward proving this and at the same time arouse the conscious of the american people to demand for justice to every citizen and punishment for a law by the lawless i also feel i have done my race of service
other considerations are of minor important


the writings of the wells were voiced by michelle duster
who for ten years has been trying to dedicate a monument in chicago in recognition of her great grandmother to be wells

from the new york times on michael vaughan

today it was a young comedians data expert who came up with the plan to harvest people's personal data off facebook and use it to influence their voting behavior
why the brains behind cambridge analytical is now dog whistle blower
it's wednesday march twenty first
when did you first get introduced to christopher wily so i was london in august and a reporter wanted to be introduced to this kid crist for wiley who had been one of the people op sound cambridge analytical man rosenberg was one of the reporters who broke the story
three of cambridge analytical we met in east london are staying at this hotel is kind of hotel in east london
and in walks this guy he's skinny sort of webster ish a twenty year old like east london kid was in from canada
he's wearing a bikini from the obama two thousand and all the inauguration and is come in there and it's all it's all about how he found this from that you know what's supposed to be the arsenal of weapons and steve bands culture war to reshape america into a right wing nationalist country
and what was interesting about this guy store and why did you care what he had to say so you know by the summer twenty seventeen we all knew cambridge america and work for the trump campaign we also knew that there had been facebook data somehow he used by this company
chris had to say was that it was tens of millions of profiles it was scale and scope of data are seeing that we did not know so chris understood how cambridge and let it go
had used facebook in a way that hadn't yet been disclosed or understood by the public yeah he's he was integral to it
you at this bar in london with christopher wily what's the story that he tells you i home to start of the beginning he has a high school drop out from british columbia in canada he left high school after suing the school district over inclusion issues chris is gay very openly so after dropping out he drew
to to ottawa where he started working for the liberal party and canada and there he mac can straw summer who was obama has a date a guy new thousand and eight and can kind of became his mentor and tottenham about data science and using it for elections
after a while though he kind of want to go back to school he gets into the london school of economics and heads of the london
but while he's there i mean he has this seeming kind of passion or compulsion to do political data in a
mama he sucked back into the data world and ends up with this company called se ela elections now
as part of the bigger company called the silk group which has a lot of defense and intelligence contracting it's like a research communications company and as sale elections their election division is this a small part of this company but it's run by this guy hours and or next who is very posh britain and alexander niche really wants to get a bigger chunk of
of the american political market
it was to break into the us he really wants a break in the us and mix is on a flight from london to new york and as is completely habit sense meeting with people work for herman cain the republican presidential candidate
and threw them they get into the world of the kind of far right of the republican party and that eventually leads knicks and wiley in the small dated team assembled to steve ban and robert mercer the kind of kings of american conservative politics get knicks and while he gets know the merge
teachers and see ban and it was braveheart empires exploding and he's now setting up rape or u k and really wants to reshape american politics
and how are they going to do this so they've got this idea that they're going to take a new field of study called second graphic research and they're gonna sell the mergers and ban in on this idea of creating a political data from then instead of going out and polling people make what issued what do you support on country
do you think about taxes you're to go out and you're going to figure out the actual per se what emotionally drive each american voter and you're going to tailor messages to them
and through that you're going to be a particular voters can be influenced them it's that whole idea that break or idea of kind of politics been downstream of culture that if you want to change the politics can change the culture and it's sacred graphics is this key to doing so and now where did this idea of psychotic research come from this it originated few years
earlier at cambridge university to be called the sake of graphic center which is dedicated this idea of using big data to kind of map personalities so chris have been hanging around the center an ad that center a graduate student had developed this technique to predict personalities by looking at facebook likes and this grad student had done this study where he'd gone
through facebook and harvested likes and at this point based because wide open likes by default republic so scraping them is very easy and he found an average of sixty eight likes you predict amazing things like your skin color with ninety five percent accuracy her sexual orientation when eighty five percent accuracy
these guys to develop this technique that they claimed could reveal tremendous amount of with people's personalities even semi lakes and they would know you better than your friends at one hundred fifty that in your parents at three hundred better than your own partners so this research said that two three hundred likes you could be known by an outsider better and your spouse pretty
much you know after kind of harvesting all this facebook data they would unleash the algorithms that had been developed in kind of cradle hands correlations they'd find like let's say you like hello kitty kitty brand the family with a lot of accuracy that you are probably a very open minded person but not particularly conscientious if you like the wu tang clan your her said
mel so guilty as charged
and you know big claim people's personalities could be simply measured to facebook likes nothing yeah chris sees this and he's like what we can do this
you know at the same time he's kind of hanging around this and are learning about this
well is working with the mergers and small pilot project to kind of tests like a graphics in the virginia twenty thirteen gubernatorial race
you can catch nellie the republican who when they were backing running against terry mcauliffe who was democrat who that was the one they weren't using and in the face but data for this the chinese polling data and other kinds of dated to measure personality the results were in the us but promising enough that the mercer said you know what let's go ahead we're going to try and create a new company here that focused on the
idea of of collateral groceries he's actually and then by june of two thousand and fourteen the mercer said put in about fifteen million dollars
steve banning was on the board one of the founders and these guys suddenly had a problem because it was easy enough to get that kind of polling data and all kinds of other data points you needed to measure personality in in some small virginia counties
they'd only tested two counties virginia
getting that kind of data on a national scale was just didn't have the resources to do it or the time
but chris busy have been hanging around cambridge knew that there was a data set out there that could work to measure personality and that was that facebook data that the young phd in an been or alice
the graphics and or they wouldn't play ball and give that data over know so they found a professor familiar with the research also at cambridge university an assistant psychology professor name alexander kogan he's a russian american and he agrees to do it he agrees to recreate the dataset
so here's our word people would take a personality it was i think it's really important to know when listeners your facebook was there thinking some kind of quiz like what kind of vegetable or you are which game of throne of archers that's not what was going on here
they are told that this is for academic research when we get paid a small sample to this very standard sally
there would then log into facebook and download an app and for taking the swiss would get a small payment coat that's how they we get paid meanwhile the app and scrape era of data and other fans and that was you know basic bio data and what they have liked on facebook
the researchers would use the answers that these people are provided on the proceeding with and their facebook data can create the algorithm that tells you if you're going like that tang clan or whatever and then once you felt that algorithm can predict that kind of thing and enough accuracy you with an omniscient on the tens of billions of friends
asked for which you have no answers you know how the personality was answers
almost all this harvesting of data was done in june and july and little bit of august two thousand and fourteen and they came up with about fifty million profile fifty million yeah
this system seems to exploit the fact that you can get permission from just a few people and once you're in their world you can gather up all the information you need from their friends which is the whole notion of facebook anyway exactly now i think in all fairness the facebook while this was going on they were already tightening up their permissions
in april twenty fourteen new apps for no longer allowed to straight friends like this but any apps that had already existed in coggins did exist or grandfather in for another year so this was told the allowed by facebook at the time
go on and take all this data the thing is is you weren't supposed to give it a third parties you we're not supposed to say you were doing it for academic research and and handed over to a political data from that also it's a commercial are that's a problem
it's also a problem for the researcher who was an academic you know there's not an academic study on earth that allows you to deceive people
what to chris and cambridge analytical ultimately get out what do they learn by doing this research they're getting the data they need to build the tools in a psychological picture tens of millions of americans and so they're testing messages office they're saying okay we've got an erotic voters here let's show them a wall so that people sneaking over a long
like a wall with mexico yeah any increase showed me some the slide some of them are like you see people coming in over a wall and it says like there's more than one kind of national security leak stuff like that how can we appeal to people out in the appeal of their fears most it was fear based from what i saw there wasn't a whole lotta hope is so if you fit a particular kind of personality profile
ow cambridge angelica is going to start to build messages and you're going to get served a particular kind of ad based on exactly a it's so interesting this idea of using social media to tap into people's kind of crime or desires and fears is the same tactics that we now know
no russian used in the twenty six you know actions in their own effort to influence the results and to try to hurt hillary clinton and favor
downturn
yeah

will the way back

chris starts telling you this whole story back in august why do you think he came forward he been called now a whistle blower but this whole thing was in many ways his idea it sounded like so i think chris was really wrestling with all this he had joined up
as a twenty three and a twenty four year old kid it was really into his idea of playing i researched how to get people and out of their views he was doing a phd in kind of fashion and fashion marketing i remember the name has mental where was the name of his and he wanted to use the site your graphic research try
predict kind of consumer fashion choices any crypt to me i remember sitting there saying he wanted to be in fashion not fashionable and i think he really saw the bands and mergers and their ideas the waters leading to fascism in a way that he and deeply apart
he left of the in two thousand and fourteen so i think by then he knew what he was getting into what he got into they don't have a lot of pretty friend right wing american candidates one of his colleague told me about a moment when a bunch of evangelical christians showed up and his colleague was also gay and they wanted you know the like a graphic research was good for identifying on
it's actual so they can message them to in much about these guys knew they were running or
what happens after chris tells you this story what are the big questions for you and where did you go next with the story
so chris said he had a whole bunch of documents you wanted to show us we wanted to see those documents the documents that showed the scale and scope of the date hours doing that show cambridge america's involvement and also documents that sure what facebook new and what facebook doesn't know and when he's home is they are documents including letters from facebook seeking to make sure the state has been deleted
wait so facebook knows that this amount of data has been harvested it's never said a word publicly because if they're asking for the data to be deleted presumably they knew it had been harvested exactly and we now know facebook shut down the app and they started investigating and the throughout first have thousand and sixteen they were chasing down kogan
chasing on cambridge and they were chased now chris and others to try and get that data delete it in twenty seventeen when we started coming out with some figures about the data that was out there facebook still buddhist you would think it's fine nothing to look at here and suddenly we're sitting with this guy who's got these documents that say well actually there was some look at your this law
hot out there so these documents are making clear that facebook new this information had been taken and taken without permission and from everything you can tell they do not alert the people from home it was taken without their permission me i know they did not alert them and one of the things about this data said it this like a graphic research actually work
it's it's not something you need to update every few years you know people's positions i'm can control or taxes me change but if you're an erotic at twenty four you're an erotic at forty four maybe a moderator your personality of a personality is a constant so the data is good for decades presumably
this is what you're arguing
a lifetime's worth of psycho graphic information about tens of millions of voters yes so do you go to facebook with this information of course i mean we went to them
more than a week before the story was supposed to publish and facebook decided knowing this story was going to come out they decided to preemptively put up their own statement and say you know we're going to come clean this happened in were trying to get to the bottom of it and really present themselves as proactive and in fact hadn't been proactive it's hard to see somebody has proactive
when they're putting out statements that what they're doing and to fix something less than twenty four hours before they know a story that includes all these details published which she was more like saving face but actually than actually fixing it yes
now what's happening now what's been the result of all this reporting and chris decision to come forward and talk all hell broke loose for facebook their stock has lost nearly fifty billion dollars in the last two days
lawmakers can both the us and britain calling for the mark zuckerberg come testify that they've got state attorney general's in new york and massachusetts opening up investigations and i think for them it's becoming this real crisis of you know what kind of company are we had a people see us and what you can we do to fix you know is is their business model
i think people
facebook is a fun place you know through your kids pictures of area kind of like a country star or about guy and you tell people about your life and what they're realizing now is in you tell people about their life they can try to manipulate you can look for ways to find her vulnerabilities and either sell you something whether it's
a new jacket or a political idea
that's something that that scares lot of people you know there's something i don't think people are used to living in a world where where there's massive surveillance and people think it smells it's cameras people in your phone but mostly it's putting yourself on facebook and letting a giant company know about it this is one of those stories that helps bring them home to people it's not the only story is not a new idea
but it is one of those moments where people are thinking that and for public facebook it does represent a real crisis
that the same time cambridge let it because really they had our stories and that's been immediately followed up by channel four news in britain which told the independent of us had done their own investigation where they had sent one of the reporters posing as prospective client from sri lanka one of the higher cambridge to help their political allies when elections that
blanca and of alexander next the ceo on a secret camera they were using where he's telling this fake client that you know where we can go after your rivals we can use people to pass bribes to them was in women to entrap them and we can see the film at all and then put it on the internet
that's a pretty remarkable thing for the ceo of a company that was hired by a winning candidate and the us presidential election today he he was suspended today
so the ceo of cambridge america is no longer in charge yes
what do you think that the next questions are in the store or what are you interested in now
so you know what cambridge athletic a did turns out it wasn't very hard it and take him on a special mission especially before twenty fourteen thousand and fifteen so how many other people were doing it how many of them had more time had more money and were just better at it and how much detail as yeah

thank you very much it's my around

here's what else you need to know
call when president
congratulated him on the victory has their electoral victory
during a news conference at the white house on tuesday
didn't trump described a warm telephone conversation with vladimir
about his overwhelmingly election as russia's president
not as couldn't about the fairness of the reports that was poisoned a former spy in britain or russia's meddling in the twenty six election and the president not raise the issue of rational actually meddling in
really they came up on this specific call by is something that we smoke and extensively about continue to look at ways and steps forward to make sure it never happens again instead the president focused on what the white house called shared interests including north korea to ukraine
any escalating arms race between the united states and russia were at a very good call and i suspect that will probably be reading and math tutors and if you can discuss the arms race
getting outta control and a second woman claiming to have had an affair with president filed a lawsuit on tuesday seeking to be released from a legal agreement requiring her silence
the playboy model named karen mcdougall says she was misled by the company that owns the national enquirer
which paid her one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in return for not discussing the relationship her lawsuit comes to weeks after stephanie clifford an adult film actress challenge a similar confidentiality agreement both woman claim their contracts are invalid and that they should be free to this
their experiences with the press
that's it for the i'm like moore bar

for the new york times ah michael barbara
this is
today as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators prepared to march on washington in response to the school shooting in portland florida
students on chicago's south side felt sympathy but also frustration why hadn't the gun violence in their community
the nation's outrage
it's monday march twenty six
queues are
no one's ever
the current
so on a typical day quiche on your man who was fifteen years old has trouble waking up because he is fifteen years old and he said like eight alarms on his i phone they start very early in the morning and they go like every ten minutes and he keeps snoozing am finally one of them work and get that bad a bad
he lives on south outside of chicago with his mom and his older brother it's a two bedroom apartment him and his brother share a room they're both teenagers
his bedroom is plastered with posters there is basketball players and then there's also a poster of our okay on the wall so mean me and recently reported from chicago meanwhile his mom the sitting in the other room just calling out the time to make sure that her kids get to school on time
saying it's seven ten seven twenty they've gotta get out of the house by seven forty and finally it had some forty and she comes out of the room and sees her kids the door
and off they go
so tell me about this commute to school every everyday when he leaves the house he has to keep in mind that he's going to walk through some neighborhoods that are not going to be safe he has the think about has walked to school
go can show
oh you know being wrong place
i have to make sure the
stay safe is more for kids so i don't be the next kid the been served from the virus has been going on in the neighborhood it's about ten to fifteen blocks he can cross a major street and on one side of the street a certain gang controls that area he goes to the other side of the street and the
different game controls that area and he might not have anything to do with either of those two groups but simply because he lives on one side of the street and goes the other side of the street is now in a dangerous territory
so he has always watch his back
you have to pick and choose what to do and where you go to so you can be so so if you orca
oh is just look around you so even if he resorts is so good
they were toy one worked to the next work he told me that he was tied by his mom at a young age if you take one route one way take the other route back because if someone's following you then they're going to be confused his mom told him that if you have couple of bucks in your pocket and you're paying for something only take out a dollar at a time
he lives in one of the most dangerous cities in the country
beyond that his neighborhood is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in chicago he lives on the south side of chicago in a community called auburn question and the homicide rate in that area is nearly twice the average for the city it's nearly ten times the national average ninety percent of homicides are key
carried out by guns so there are a lot of guns on the streets in this neighborhood but he lives in
moreover he was walking back from tokyo girlfriends that it was though
yes in his father also try to say are so those who are you go down as he's walking
it was in wrong place at the wrong her and those a pseudo down
now turn
q on her the the my hair
okay early comprehend
oh so
angry prayers
is is
just a lot of work

so it's march fourteenth and it's a month after the shooting and parkland florida the school shooting there and students are preparing for this national school walk out the entire school is participating there's a lot of anticipation in the hallways there is little posters up on the lockers about the national school walk out there
some kids holding placards with the faces of of the kids that were killed in kirkland florida there's also kids with posters and pictures of some of the kids that were killed in chicago
and so this walk out for a ban is also a statement on their own community
the articles for recently in me him
i like me
you can just be late for that
can one said anything what he's going on with his a game playing good cute
you just never know was go have the least
for me i know it's different to me i come in here
your teacher but i've lost three students of us years three years and i've been here
and so that's why people
he shine is participating in the walkout and he's also going to be speaking at this rally it's a community rally were three different schools are going to be there so key schon it he's never spoken publicly he's got a lot to say but he's a shy kid and he's really nervous
preparing his speech him and one of his friends are both speaking and so they're kind of huddled on the side in the hallway writing on these little cue cards looking at stats on their phones
pacific
your statistics
you know this month transition
a treasure trove right
going to transition from provoke
go
the number
after three months
one hundred and ten you have been shot
so he's been murdered he's rehearsing you could tell that this was something that was a really big deal for him
there's this bout that goes off that signals that it's time for everyone to start walking out and then you see kids streaming down the stairs going outside of school and there is a massive crowd there's lots of media they're they're kind of all crowded around the area where people are speaking
key sean and his friend both who are speaking pay elbow their way through the crowd to get to the

though
sorry
remove the one on google
contrary to me
and one
no no no
and while he's speaking he pauses and them at all because he's so nervous and he adds cheers from the crowd
any also gets a little emotional he talks about his brother and he talks about how that forced him to speak out and fight for changing as one no morning or agree with you angry
you're angry
you can make a game were removed them

so after the speakers are finish they really seventeen white balloons or the kids and park or in florida they release thirteen yellow balloons for kids that go to keep on school who have been killed
and then fifty red balloons to signify chicago kids who have been killed and that's not an exact number but it's to signify the amount of people who have been lost to gun violence in chicago it's hard not to notice the numbers bigger bang number is significantly bigger and for them it was on a comparison
but more of a frustration about how we deal with this every day we need to be involved in this conversation as well
and this is our reality of gun violence
and want school oh really think of his clothes for shooting cause most most over happens at school
thanks so to the school to to or
most say okay me me after school in the the great the so school
you a place hordes of the word
soon why did these students think that the violence in chicago doesn't get the kind of attention the scale of attention that a mass shooting garners in park on florida so i think the kids understand bad seventeen people being killed at once in a school
it's horrific and terrible and the scale of that is powerful
but at the same time they also wonder given how long they've been dealing with gun violence and how present it is how many of their loved ones have been shot and killed in their neighborhoods
why that is events cause for a national movement why that is cause for people to have a similar reaction those are the kinds of questions that they were grappling with so what will work out of my them a walkout touches later
most of the schools around the country
you really do have after asia
this is my school
i went with he shot to this violence prevention youth group that he's part of its in the basement of a church and lamar johnson who is the leader of this youth group asks them a question about what are the differences and similarities between you guys and the kids in portland
we have
asia was some
filling the trauma

listen to what
now
from than of course that she was really answer and will get the same sympathy and compassion

do you are know the media in a car which i mean the average income of a person and pardon
so is between one hundred and twenty five hundred thousand dollars a year per house
okay so compare to do you know the median income for a person limit our membership
i again
so people cargo and makes three times more to you your family as you grow
so lamar's the youth group leader is trying to help these kids grapple with these feelings that they're having a frustration but also of of remorse for what's happened in portland and he's trying to guide their conversation trying to guide their energy you mm angry a partner
no our partners with those the vague knowledge of the phone the reason why do you have performed because they privilege
they are really sincere about helping create change here just as well as the so when are angry at them
when i want you are to be angry is the whole system itself easy the girls are said
easy access to go for who
we talked about as the day out been happier
how he wasn't for the a good bigger
so the same way how easy is it for you good
so nasa you get o two into now you gotta get what similar was dayton ohio right because they're so now we take those similarities and divisions now you say this is why would to say we do with the same amount of time everyday would have same age
and we had the same easy access to guns but isn't that right that we give viewed negatively because of our roof
because we don't have as much money as though you'd been fighting for peace and justice for long term a non stop know so use this moment
anger frustration this momentum and takeovers it
so when we go out of your own be ready
then this remarkable thing happens
ahmad thousand on the bottom
since one of the
and we're going to me
a few months
students
some of the survivors from the park land shooting come to chicago to meet with these kids the church that lamar works with facilitates this meeting and it's one saturday that they come to chicago and they meet behind closed doors
he shined is going to be meeting and gonzales become one of them are well known survivors from portland shooting for the first time
he said
some kids from brooklyn speak key on speaks at this point he's become a bit of a pro at doing this than spoken a few times
those who were no
what does
as a said
it his words

sam
today
no
this isn't just in schools
this isn't just
this isn't portland
this
united states
and this is the only had has its problems
so these two groups of kids who lead dramatically different lives but also have had really dramatic experiences with gun violence
acknowledge their differences but also land on this theme of commonality between both of them and this idea that they have all been affected by gun violence whether it's been a mass shooter in their school or whether it's walking down the block and having
to watch your back because there are bullets flying in the neighborhood
and as far as this chicago kids are concerned they were frustrated before at the attention that they didn't get and now they're saying you know what whatever it takes to light this match the we want to be part of this movement because this affects us
losing somebody is losing somebody getting shot is getting shot it doesn't matter if it happens to me or if i happen to someone in florida the fact that you've lost somebody because of gun violence it's going to feel the same
what i have in common with kids and park lose that our know how it feels to lose someone those close to you they have conversations about their shared experience is they have conversations about how they're going to push this movement forward together
these kids who have come from parkland are very aware of what these chicago teens ace and they are very committed to making sure that their reality is included in this movement that they're kind of leading at this point
hello one tee shot
i'm from chicago know and all its him for split to try to school so he on with his peers from chicago goes to washington to march with the kids from portland
no we don't have learned on their shoes
they should earn the national march for our lives against gun violence
and they're they're meeting with people from across the country and really talking about that the type of gun violence that they face in their community this is why i'm here because we know that when this becomes the norm chicago
do you toys is rising across the country
especially in chicago
it's clear that change his
it feels like what we saw on saturday in washington was using one tragedy a tragedy that happens less often than a horrible mass shooting and then in this instance affected or a white community to elevate this violence that happens on a far more routine
even daily basis to a mostly african american community
and for the kids from chicago this is their chance to really be recognized
yeah i think think for the kids from chicago who are marching in washington this is their chance to be part of a national conversation this is their moment they have been working in organizing in their own communities for a long time and now there is this opening on the national stage and there
taking it and they're running with it

thank you
very much thank you
this weekend at the march in washington
sean and students from other and question rallied alongside the students from florida
the efforts at inclusion by the marches organizers were shaped by the conversations that happened in chicago
between the two groups of students and the connections they made their
skeptics and cynics who told us to sit down and see stay silent
wait your turn
welcome to the revolution
it is a powerful and peaceful one because it was of by and for the young people of this country
my name is camera casting since this movement began people have asked me do you think any changes going to come from this look around we are the change
we'll be right back

use what else you need to know day
you were twenty seven he was six me where you physically attracted to
not at all
did you want to have sex with him
but i didn't i didn't say no i'm not a victim or not it was entirely consent oh yes
guess in an interview with sixty minutes on sunday night the a film actress stephanie clifford said she was dread and for trying to tell the story of her alleged affair with president trump and agreed to remain silent to protect herself and her young daughter i was in a parking lot
not going to a fitness class with my infant daughter as taking the seats facing backwards in the backseat diaper bag getting all the stuff out and a guy walked up on me and said to me leave jump along forget the story and then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and a beautiful little girl
shame if something happened to her mom and then he was gone the emerged thread occurred soon after clifford had sold the story of the affair to a tabloid magazine which feel to publish it sixty minutes reported for fear of being sued by trump you target is a drug throat absolutely i was rattled i remember going into the work out
cause and my hands are shaking so much i was afraid i was going to drop her with that dread in mind
clifford said she signed an agreement to keep quiet in return for one hundred and thirty thousand dollars from lawyer in october of two thousand and sixteen eleven days before the election the president continues to deny the affair or clifford was paid to stay silent about it
watch sixty minutes who's watching to where would you say her
he knows i'm telling the truth

that's it for the daily on michael moore borrow and more

from the new york times on my car
this is dave

today
as pressure was mounting on to have president trumps former advisers michael flynn and paul metaphor to cooperate with special counsel robert mark a lawyer for the president came to the men with an idea what if the president or two
it's thursday march twenty by
were
march shrink hey it's michael
hurry of bed were actually were actually are you i'm in north around
i'm a vacation destination
better work stations anyway not be having a good time and i'm sure it's probably a little consuming to do all this but i'm very good landline taught manners that's all it really matters
one of these things may think that's what i want to make it
i have to do things i need a great land line in a refrigerator filled with coke
no
mike schmidt weird is this story begun the story begins last fall when i started hearing different tips about mike flynn the president's former national security advisor your plane was under investigation by that special counsel robert mahler for a wide range of thing
things including his contacts with the russian ambassador during the transition
flames lawyers and the president's lawyers had a joint defense agreement illegal arrangement of swords that allows them to work together and share information and have it protected by attorney client privilege in a way that shields it from investigators so investigators would never be able to get it it it allows a free flow
information a sort of protection as they try and work together in the face so what they would have said at the time was an overzealous overblown investigation by mahler
so that it seems like for the special counsel robber mahler and his team they would want to find a way to divide this team up can separate the white house and separate flan like you would in a police investigation where you want to keep the witnesses and
in different rooms so they don't coordinate their stories i think that mahler was less concerned about that and he was gaining flames cooperation if muller was gonna do a thorough look at the contacts between the russians in the campaign he had to talk to flint flint had been at the center of those
contacts he had discussed with the russian and master how they were going to respond to the obama administration implementing sanctions flint had lied to the f b i have doubted there were all of these questions and if muller was going to truly turn over every rock he needed to know everything that fled new
but to get to flint it sounds like muller needed to break him out of this new troll legal defense arrangement that he has with white us earlier last year our colleague matter puzo had said that we should keep an eye out for defendants or witnesses pulling out of disagreements be as he said it would be
the first sign that someone was going to cooperate with the government and they were no longer on the same team they were becoming essentially adversaries and i sort of to put it at the time
a puzo turned out to be right in what way on thanks giving i got a call from someone who said that fully in had pulled out of his joint defense agreement with the president and what did that tell you for a suit was the first in best in greatest signed net flynn was going to
flip that he was going to cooperate with smaller and tell him everything that he knew and lo and behold within a week flynn except a plea agreement flips and becomes a witness
and so what are the tips that you're getting in the midst of all this flint please set off a lotta new information that was coming into us and the most interesting and salacious one was something that i didn't even believe at the time that i heard it which was that john down the president
lawyer had offered a pardon to flinch lawyer
last year
why didn't you believe them
well the problem is to be a good reporter in the trunk or i think you sort of have to have an incredible imagination for a d impossible for things that you would never think would happen before but it just seemed like such a aggressive moves that would look at least politically very damaging
the president it showed the severity dad the president and his lawyers were taking the investigation that they would go to such lengths to use one of the president's greatest powers as a way of essentially defending himself
so what would be the intention of the white house in making that offer when it did will certainly one of the biggest possibilities would be the fact that they were trying to stop flynn from cooperating with smaller in telling mahler everything that he knew bitch
what would the assumption be if you're flynn and you get that offer the assumption would be hey there's no need to cooperate will take care of you will literally part and we will make sure that you face no legal consequences for all of these questions asked the table and you will be fine
least legally so what do you do with this step i put it my notebook and i tried to figure out other ways of getting it confirmed but a grin into debt and after dead end with it i couldn't find anyone else said it heard about it and it was something that was very tightly held so early last year i thought i'd taken it is
far as i couldn't and i didn't think i had enough to worried but then another reporter began to hear similar things not only about fun but about manifold paul metaphor yes paul manner for the president's former campaign chairman
and when you begin to fear that there's another example of the behavior
gives the original tip about flame a bit more credibility you start to say well okay so this information is coming in from another way about manner for then what does that mean about the new information any really sort of galvanized are reporting and say okay there's something here we really gotta go
after it and what's the context for this offer being made to paul manner for what was going on with him manifold it was in a very similar situation define last summer mahler was building an investigation against him but he had not been charged yet but as i recall man for is quite resistant to working with a special
ah council there's been a big distinction between flynn and man afford since the beginning and the investigation man afford his had the body posture of i've got nothing to give up i've done nothing wrong i'm going to fight this to the end of the earth sign has been very different his lawyer has been very quiet
i have not made any pronouncements about trying to fight is and if you were reading between the lines and looking at flynn you sort of wondered maybe he really does have something to offer some like i'm not trying to shadow why make the pardon offer if it doesn't look like manna for is at risk of flipping the way that
finance well that's a good question that would sort of lend itself to an argument from the president side which is the president simply thought these investigations of manifold slain were out of control there was nothing to them and for the better in the country day should be pardoned in like go but why with the president offer
people parties before the investigation is even complete before we know exactly what they've done well i mean i'm not sure how much we can read into it in the middle of the investigation this was a cloud over the white house this was something and had really derailed the president distracted him created headlines that or
not certain about his agenda or what he wanted to do there was a widespread perception of least among democrats that he had done something wrong and the people around him a done something wrong and he could simply say work i know there was no collusion i know we did nothing wrong these guys did nothing wrong this is completely unfair they're being swept up in a police
tickle fight and i'm going to and then because we need to move on from this and had of the lawyers from and four and then respond to these offers well obviously if you look at flynn side they took a plea a safer path agreeing to cooperate with smaller working with smaller realizing that perhaps a
a path of the pardon would be perilous they've gone with the prosecutor instead of waiting for the president on man afford side he's told others they didn't wanna take a plea because he says look i did nothing wrong this would make it look like i did something wrong and i think the government has abuse their power and i want
fight this and a certain point like you feel comfortable along with your colleagues reporting this understanding that this involves a lot of confidential sources
it's now six months since you started hearing these terms we did what i often called diligence on this information and after talking to lots of different folks
on background about what they knew and using a lotta reporters there's five bylines on this story which is unusual for one of our pieces we got to the point that we felt comfortable with the information and ready to move forward
so has the white has acknowledged that this happened at these offers or made that dowd went to the lawyers for fun and for a for and offered them essentially a pardon
will take to questions
on the table
one involved in russia
sarah the new sanders stood up in the briefing room on wednesday and said i would refer you back to the statement from ty cobb in the report that you're asking about women which he said i've only been asked about pardons by the press and every team we responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion or under concern
duration at the white house say unequivocally no one here is discussed pardons in this case i can say that
ty cobb is the person that would be most directly involved in this and he's got a statement on the record saying that there's no discussion and there's no consideration of those at this time of the white house has worry about what might have there were no discussions about this
and what does that mean what does that mean does that mean there are no discussions about it at this time
i have never been any discussions about it or this is something bad they're planning on doing the problem with this white house instead you cannot take what they say from the podium too seriously because they have such a history of providing incorrect information
in just to be clear no one in the white house has officially denied this reporting the president's lawyers ty cobb and jay secular said they know nothing about discussions between down and anyone about pardons endowed is no longer in the white house down's no longer in the white house but he told me
me on wednesday dad he had never made such offers a gun he did say i don't even know what we would pardon fun for i'm not sure what he did wrong
which is an interesting refrain which of gets back at the notion dan dowd and the president doctor case against find was flimsy
and my do we know from your reporting whether the president knew that dowd was making these offers or discussing the possibility of these offers to flynn and metaphor cool that's the biggest crush and that's where we get into and this stage of the story what did the president know and when did he notice was down simply out
freelancing running his mouth talking to lawyers just trying to do anything to stop these guys from pleading or was he directed directly by the president to engage in these discussions and to plant the seed in and lawyers mine said this was something that could happen
that's what we don't know what did the presidency know what was his involvement and if you talk to folks dead no doubt that have worked to down they find it hard to believe that you would go out and do something like this simply on as are i also get the sense just from watching all the reporting of the past few weeks about the present legal team that he's deeply in
evolved in managing them end hiring them or firing them
well i think it's more that the president thinks he is his best lawyer
his best spokesmen his best strategist but he thinks he knows how to navigate this better than the lawyers do one of the reasons that dowd left is that the president wants to sit down with smaller form you interview because the president believes he can explain to monitor how he did nothing wrong god who knows that the president often doesn't tell the truth thought this was a terrible idea that there was a lot of downside
to this new president could just increase his legal exposure does
this feel like the essential question to you the president or on this now that's so much of the talk around the mall or investigation is about the question of obstruction of justice and this seems like could fall into that bucket dc is similar to other things to president has been accused of was the president trying to
drunk justice when he fired the f b i director was the president trying to obstruct the investigation when you ask me to end the investigation and defined in february of two thousand and seventeen was most part in some sort of effort to try and stop these defendants from cooperate
the president has the power to pardon he has the power to fire the f b i director he has the power to end an investigation but was he doing that for the betterment as a country because he knew there was nothing here and to simply try and move things along and get his shadow offered him and move the country and a direct
that it needed to go into or was he doing these things to protect himself that's the central question of the obstruction investigation was the president doing these things were corrupt and ten or simply as a way of being the chief executive of the country and saying i need to do these things for the betterment of the country and i know there's no
one here and how old we ever figure out the answer to the core question of motivation and ten well you'd have to get inside the president's mine

in a sense the stories on was unsatisfying because it is exactly where we been all along
has the president and his lawyers done things because they have something to hide need to protect themselves
or is it that they know that there's nothing here and they're just trying to move it along that is the central question isn't that nice story unfortunately doesn't answer that and while this is interesting in into new piece of information i still can't tell you what was it the heart of the president's intentions in anything which is why
over a mile or so badly as you said wants to talk to the president himself to understand why his muller could get the president to truthfully tell him what he was thinking then we would have a much better understanding of these different events
thank you my thanks amd

we'll be right back
hughes what else you need hundred eight on wednesday the muller investigation least a document revealing that in the final weeks of the two thousand and sixteen election
top trumps campaign angel
gates had frequent contact with the person the f b i believed had an active links with and russian spy agencies
the document also shows that gates wasn't aware that this person had ties to russian intelligence he is identified in the document only as person egg but the times is reporting that he is constantine cullen who for years was manner for his right hand man in his business
dealings with ukraine
and after weeks of speculation that he would fire his secretary of veterans affairs david shock and the president ousted him on wednesday and replaced him with his own dr baloney jackson in summary the president's overall health is excellent his career performance during his physical exam was very good
news to enjoyed a significant long term cardiac in overall health benefits that come from a long term of abstinence from tobacco and alcohol
this here and jackson performs trumps annual physical and declare can both mentally and physically fit saying that tramp who is seventy one has more energy than just about anybody is very articulate and past a cognitive tests with a perfect score
the fact that the president thirty out of thirty on that if they think that there's no indication whatsoever that he has any cognitive issues
on a day to day basis like i said before it's been my experience that the president he's very sharp
he's a very articulate when he speaks to me and found no reason whatsoever that they fit the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process
all clinical data indicates that the president it's very healthy and that he will remain so for the duration of his presence

that's it

today
the second amendment is just twenty seven wards law but post twenty seven world are among the most cryptic and controversial in the us constitution
why the supreme court is reluctant to better define
it's tuesday april third

adam can you set the scene of this nineteen thirty nine supreme court what's going on time
so it involves a guy named jack miller who was a small town
bug in a day of midwestern bank robbery in the al capone era in the great depression who was a member of a gang that rug a lot of banks
he turns government informant
he goes kind of straight for a little while
but he's caught between oklahoma in arkansas with the slide off shotgun and he's prosecuted by federal authorities for violating again recent gun control law called the national firearms act adam lip tech covers the supreme court for the times so miller charged with this crime says wait a second isn't there a second image
don't i have a constitutional right to keep and bear
on any challenges the prosecution on second amendment grounds in this case makes it up the supreme court which in nineteen thirty nine for the first time ever tells us something about what the second movement means and what question is the court trying to answer in this case out of the basic question for the court
it's how to make sense of the second amendment which has two competing ideas and it let me read it you and you'll see what i'm talking about this got too close the second amendment says a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state so that announces something about what the amendment and wants to accomplish is it the only
it wants to accomplish is it just an illustration of what it might like to accomplish and then there's a much easier part of it to understand where it says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed if we only had the second clause that would be cleaned that would be like the first amendment congress shall make the law abridging the freedom of speech
but the introductory claus has caused people to scratch their heads for centuries about exactly what the framers of the constitution meant to accomplish whether they're right to bear arms protected but the second amendment protects a collective right concerning state militias or an individual right that every citizen has it just so
what exactly is the tension between the two causes a kind of collective claws and the individual and one way to think about it is the first cause it gives an example of a reason why you might want to have a right to keep and bear arms it's in order to have a well regulated militia but maybe not the
exclusive reason to have a right to keep and bear arms the second way of thinking about it though is that the first clauses limiting the first is this is why you have a right to keep and bear arms the only reason why and that is to participate in a government run militia and so in this case
of miller and his sort of chalk on and the question of which clause and a second then that should prevail what does the supreme court decide it doesn't directly answer the larger question of is this a collective right or an individual right rather it says that because shot guns have no reasonable relationship too
the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia we cannot say the second amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument in other words it's saying all we need to decide here is sort of shotguns have nothing to do with militias and therefore you don't have a right to have one now many people think that's suggestive
it's buying into the collective version of the second amendment but it doesn't say so stone so many words it just says to the extent the government wants to regulate kinds of weapons it has to be the kind of weapon you conceive of being used in a militia understand so in practical terms the court has imply
wide that the second amendment is a collective raid the miller case cryptic an opaque though it was did sort of set the tone for the conventional wisdom the consensus view for decades and decades on in the public consciousness and in the legal academy that the second amendment doesn't protect an individual right to
keep and bear arms but only a collective one
and how does this impact the american conception of guns and gun rights
the next several decades people across the ideological spectrum including law and order conservatives really believed in the second amendment has nothing to say about gun control laws being those in only pretend to collect the right
the best example of this really is a comment by just and burner
no
nixon a point in a law and order conservative who goes on television having heard the view that the second amendment like conceivably protect than individual right
that was one of the greatest
and
special interest group have originated
even in conservative circles where people may relish their guns and their right to own guns they interpret the second amendment to refer to a collective bright own guns related demolition that's right that's not to say that people didn't want to make sure that gun rights are your they just started with something you do in the political
prices in legislature that it wasn't a question the constitution was going to help them and
that makes sense because the only supreme court case that has touched on this implied that it is about a collective mind
exactly right
and when when things start to change in the late seventies early eighties you start to see the and are a exploring whether there are arguments three made on behalf of an individual right to bear arms and they get some surprising allies some fairly prominent law professors sanford
levinson synod texas akira amari ill and lawrence tribe perhaps the most prominent constitutional scholar of his day start to grapple with the second amendment in somewhat to their own surprise find that it's a part of the bill of rights that should be considered a real right
second amendment provides a decisive response
the government is not constitutionally incapable of disarming everybody we may not like what it does but we need to take seriously every part of the bill of rights we have expanded first amendment rights by taking the first man seriously and to be intellectually honest we should also look seriously at the scope of the second amendment so how does it
this idea improbably shared by the ira and these men in the scholarly circles make it into the real world through litigation
litigation the great engine of american progress
a rich libertarian lawyer named robert leave he picks up on these ideas he's not a gun owner but he has ideas about what the constitution means i don't live and a dangerous neighborhood and i don't feel the need to have gotten for stuff and i do feel very much concerned about those people who do live in a dangerous neighborhood including the plaintiff in our case park
and he launches a lawsuit in a case that he hopes will get to the supreme court and revolutionized second amendment law to leave he doesn't even own a gun so why is he interested in the second amendment he told me i read and some years ago he told me that he's not particularly interested in guns but he pursued the case to vindicate his libertarian principles or what the
confrontation the weather it's the first amendment or recommend it set up a presumption that we have labored it doesn't mean that government cannot trunk hate are right but government had to jump through some considerable hoop in order to do he believes in free markets private property individual rights strictly limited govern
mint and this fits into that libertarian conception of if the constitution gives you right to have a gun he wanted to make sure that the government couldn't impinge on that right we feel that this is a violation of the second amendment to be your constipation so how did he go about building a case that he hoped would make it to the supreme court
he first of all identifies the strictest gun control law in the country which use in the district of columbia
and then he starts interviewing plaintiffs and it's like a casting call he said he wanted gender diversity racial diversity age diversity income diversity
the robert levy recruited six people and a lot of people would find their stories very sympathetic one of them was a woman who'd been trying to rid her neighborhood of drugs and wanted to keep a gun in her home to protect yourself because people were breaking into her house
a second plane was a gay man who been accosted by a gang using ugly language about him any wanted to have a gun to protect his own life
so these are to a lot of people's minds very attractive candidates for such a suit but one by one they get knocked off on various technical legal grounds but he managed to maintain one plane if one plane of survives a security officer named dick heller i moved into washington d c and nineteen seventy six and in october
dc city council passed a law that said you were no longer allowed to own any kind of a firearm and d c but you could be grandfathered in by coming down to the police station and registering your firearm and who is this guy heller
he was a security guard who carried a gun on the job in federal office buildings but was very frustrated because he wasn't allowed to have one in his home so i said why would i want to register it is because they want my address why do they want my interest because they want to come and get my gun and for confiscation and i said no
the us supreme court might be hard to believe but not once in the history of this republic has the court ever said what the second amendment right to bear arms means in there the first time in seventy years behind hormones he kept the constitutional right to bear arms so what happens with this case
at his name becomes attached big get the supreme court
thousand and eight each the biggest case on the right to bear arms ever heard by the supreme court
one of the most closely watched highly anticipated supreme court cases it's one of a half dozen huge gazes will be your court led by chief justice john roberts has the case that decide that the first time ever buy the second amendment guarantees americans a right to own a gun him people are very focused on whether the court
dominated by five conservatives will revolutionize second amendment blog by finding an individual right to keep and bear arms aligned to get into the court according to the associated press began forming two days ago we will your argument today and case do seven to ninety eight district of columbia versus helen
three downs are good morning with the chief justice at least the court
so how does the court ruled just discreetly also his opinion this morning and case zero seven to nine the district of columbia vs calories
the court rules five to four with justice antonin scalia writing for the majority this case is here on reddit tertiary to the united states good of appeals for the district of columbia cirque that there is an individual right to keep and bear arms at least we're self defense in the home by law abiding citizens we all with the second amendment
antes an individual right to have and use arms for self defense a little and that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be rendered in operative violates that right
so in this rule and unlike the lying in nineteen thirty nine the court finds that it is an individual right that's intended by the wording of the second them rather than a collective right that's right and if the hundred thirty nine decision was a little hard to understand this point in justice
his opinion was crystal clear so what happens as a result of this ruling to the surprise of many almost nothing the lower courts read the heller decision people challenge various gun control laws on all kinds of topics background checks waiting periods assault weapons and the lower courts almost universally
sustained those laws they don't think hillary is made a difference in how you'd have to treat those loans hundred the second amendment so the lower courts in a sense kind of ignored the fact that the court seem to confer on the whole country the individual right to bear arms which suggests that they would be ready to invalidate a lot of these gun control laws
well they certainly treated differently than other provisions of the bill of rights laws that violate say the first amendment get a very close look and not infrequently are struck down laws said to violate the second amendment don't seem to get quite that level of scrutiny and seldom get struck they're so what then was the effect of this wrong
if the lower courts are not applying it to gun control laws around the country
good guy shouldn't be forced to break the law to exercise their god given cost there is no right to protect themselves and their families
the effect of the ruling in public consciousness in public debate was to allow proponents of gun rights they start making arguments that one about policy you're not only about policy
protecting a part of the constitution it's always been we the people all the way back to the founding of this country the founding fathers were not afraid to trust the people with arms it was the people with arms who had ignored the freedom of the new nation
guarantee if the founding fathers had known this kind would have been invented they wouldn't have rewritten the second amendment they would have to find it in stone
and that cast this kind of glow in oran around gun rights arguments that really is a gift to gun rights proponents from the supreme court the founding fathers agree and armed citizens make good government history clearly shower is that our interpretation of the second amendment is the same as what
americans have always known and the founding fathers intended i think that they be proud of us for staying the course and disgusted by the politicians and media personalities who are so eager to deprive us of our rights
so in a sense it's bringing kind of ability to the whole gun rights to be
think how far we've come michael in nineteen thirty nine the poster child for gun rights was a hapless stoke gangster in the great depression and now the energy use able to argue that what they're protecting is something that was handed down to us by the framers in the constitution and what's happened on the supreme court since this
rolling back in two thousand and eight almost nothing in two thousand and ten they said the second women also applies to state gun control laws in addition to federal laws like the one in the district of columbia and then the supreme court got out of the business of telling us anything about the second amendment turning down case after case after case to the great frustration
of the more conservative members of the court justice antonin scalia while he was alive and just as clarence thomas now will fairly often right we don't understand why you're not taking these cases you're treating these constitutional right as a second class right and it's our duty to tell the nation what the scoop of this right is bike
comparison this term the supreme court has five first amendment cases and it will routinely explain in refine the scoop of first amendment rights and you might think with so many unanswered questions in the second amendment irina the supreme court would get into the business of explaining what the scope of this right is
it's simply has not in doesn't seem to want to do it and and why hasn't the court taken a second and then the case's what's behind that the court doesn't explain its decisions to turn down case is so we can't know for sure but i guess i would suspect that at least some elements in the court justices in the middle
voted for the heller decision but maybe a little warily and i'm thinking of justice anthony kennedy and chief justice john roberts may well have gone as far as they're prepared to go so this court which has told us that the second amendment gives us an individual right to bear arms it seems like
they have moral and legal reservations about taking that to the next logical place which would be refining and explaining all the ways in which gun control laws might be illegal
this inference and speculation but that is what i believe they've gone as far in this realm is they are prepared to go even in hell are they carved out all kinds of gun control laws that they said they didn't want to cast doubt on and that they're not going any further at the moment at least with this composition of the supreme court to expand
second amendment rights no should do one or two members of the court leave should present in trump get two points and new people he certainly is constantly pressing his broad conception and the second amendment we might start getting some different answers


about a week and a half ago
hundreds of thousands of people especially young people flew into the streets
to protest in the march for our lives

and that gets the attention of justice john paul stevens who wrote the descent inhaler who's retired from the corridors ninety seven years old
and i get word the supreme court that he's interested in submitting a letter to the editor
i provide the court with the right email addresses and and even as i'm doing that
i get an email from our opinion pages saying we've just kindness submission from justice stevens by fax by fast i got an email from somebody they're saying this thing came over the facts it has no contact information where do we do with it how do we get in touch with justice stevens this is great but we just discovered we had a fax machine
and what did this faxed submission from former justice
stevens say he is clearly not done regretting what the supreme court did in the decision but he's no longer talking about tweaking email or decision or returning to a collective rights view of the second amendment but of repealing the second amendment entirely why would a supreme court justice of all people
call for the repeal of a constitutional amendment
well it's a sign of real frustration supreme court justices of course are in the business to interpret the constitution not encouraging wholesale changes to the amendment process and the fact that a former supreme court justice a very sophisticated demand somebody who's studied this question quite deeply thinks the answer is to throw a part of the bill of rights
org tells you that word a place in our national debate where people are trying like crazy to find a way out of what they perceive to be a terrible terrible court were terrible harm is done by guns and yet our nation's founding document
protects or right to have them and limits the ability of society to address this question right i mean if it's possible for nine people to stare at the same twenty seven words and come to diametrically opposite conclusions about what they mean that might be some reason to think that it's time to take another look
him to clarify what we
adam thank you very much
thank you

michael barbara

the new york times i'm michael

hi the news anchors all start by saying our greatest responsibility is to serve our communities
what they are forced to say next has drawn attention to local news stations
and who they are actually being asked to show
it's funny people six

a complete report a wife barbara
michael bay bridge what the weather wrong
broke transport and the eye witness news team
hello there here's what's happening at ten for arizona
eighty is just eight hours away my mom was an anchor he was the first female evening anchor in the state of arizona
every day with voters choosing a president a congressman and senator and various local offices as a supervisor fifth or and through son is a place that he moved to and she was a child went off to san diego for a couple years but she moved back became an evening anchor couple of years after that i was born i've seen video
a news story that ran the day i was bored when they sent a camera over to visit my mom and hospital room so are you essentially brought into this world on tv
i mean the camera wasn't there as i was being born it was there a couple hours after aaron ways worked in local news for fourteen years i went off to college and wanted nothing to do with journalism i majored in theater and after college i went off to microsoft and did the tech
thing for a couple of
and it was only after i'd been there for about a year that i realized i was missing that instant gratification
so i took a week off and went back home to tucson and hung out at the station for a week and wrote some stories and went out on a drug bust proved i could do it and so they hired me as a producer so you started to work in the newsroom where your mother was an anchor i did though i very rarely saw her most of my time
there i was producing the morning show she was anchoring six and ten so we would literally past and the night she'd be wrapping up the late shows i was showing up for the overnight shift and how did you like the work i loved it it's incredibly rewarding you get to make something every day and see the results of what you do
every day and then you come in the next day and you've got a blank slate and was there something about the fact that was local news that made you take pride in it
it's that connection to a community
it's odd because local news is a very trains in business very few folks stay in a market for years or decades and the ones who do tend to be those trusted local anchors my mom could have played the tv news market game and left to son and picked
the family every couple of years from a to san to a phoenix to a los angeles and bigger and bigger markets but she didn't she chose to raise her family in tucson because it was a sense of place and i always be thankful to earth for that
oh my
really
so what was your first big break in the news bears
so i was going to son for about a year and a half and decided to see what else was out there and ended up heading up to a portland oregon
so i took an associate producer position bottom of the wrong pretty quickly worked my way up and after spending my twenties in portland which is a great town to be single and in your twenties in i got married had a kid and we decided it was time to head somewhere else so i started looking around for other positions
and ended up getting offered a news director job in sioux city iowa
and it was a big promotion for me at that point i'd been a manager on filling basis in portland getting to run the newsroom when folks went there but getting my own newsroom my own shop was a great opportunity so we packed up and moved the midwest
this is single and news etc
hey fourteen
police say this man is passing counterfeit bills and they want your help catching and i ones who are terminally ill make it easier access to end or more with your vision and as needs director for writing this tv station much problem for me it was the chance to build something it was a small
all struggling station that came from an ownership group that had gone through a fairly spectacular bankruptcy a couple of years prior was still basically being held by the bankruptcy court and the creditors
and you know in a market that size that you're going to be working with maybe a few veterans but primarily new reporters and that me it was exciting
you knew going into this job at this was a small station that it was financially struggling and it sounds like those two things or in some ways or a draw for you because it meant that he had the ability to to put your own imprint on yeah it was that feeling of being a part of that place
yeah
when did that
it sounds like this was going well and that you're enjoying this work when did that feeling start to change so after i'd been there for about a year and a half we got word that sinclair was looking at buying station
these things take a couple months to close sinclair ended up officially buying the station in fall around october twenty third
losing their was banned it in nineteen seventy one bite and current chairman bought a million embarrassment he was an electrical engineer
that deep curiosity about new broadcasting technology sydney ember is a media reporter for the times and the companies started are very small it was why radio station and why and television station in maryland in baltimore by a wanna get bigger and started buying more and more stations which cohen
sided with this sort of deregulation they allowed company is to our and more station we saw no reason no harm to the public that would result from networks are acquiring stations and after all the touched on has changed to meet not are not to be the interest of the hollywood producers or the networks or
the group owners but rather whether or not the viewers in particular markets are better off and we believe they will be if we permit groups to be able to acquire other stations and it does mean that independently own stations will do very well they do do very well and markets depending upon the owners and their management capabilities but there are
but economist or some very good efficiencies result when an entity he was able to grow larger and there's often time served are people very well in our society and we ought not to lose sight of and so there might have been in time where company could own a set number of stations might have been a cap and suddenly there was that's exactly right and enough are aligned handicap
i think five and then a new chapter seven and and twelve suddenly it's possible for a company to own not just a handful of stations but a very large number of oh to be safe
yeah and by the early t it as and sinclair and something like sixty stations across the country
we knew the station was up for sale and someone was going to come in at some point and by the fact that it was sinclair looking at us was also not a surprise and on paper seemed like a good thing because you've got a very large well researched company coming in the hope would be an owner like that comes in
and starts giving you more reporters you start adding news casts the sorts of things that you hope to see when a well resources company comes into what had been a poorly researched station and
hope they would have seen what we were doing there is something that had a lot of potential for growth
so what happens at these stations that sinclair is buying up what changes about the actual day to day operations so sometimes the stations are happy to hear that
he likes and claire is buying than he has failed now have resources to go out and report local news resources that they might not have had before sinclair came in pretty quickly the station started to realize that things aren't as crazy as they see and
yeah
so right around the time the sale is closing i fly down to north carolina for a meeting with news directors from other stations that had been recently acquired by sinclair
and were all at the airport we get on a ban on the way to the hotel
talking
someone asks about must run pieces so unless master in is a segment that is generally centrally produce that sinclair assets stations here and it sends out these segments to aid stations across the country and its as run he is during a specific period of time
not a polite request it's generally not a player request now it orders the stations around them
the explanation that came from another news director who'd been part of the group for probably a couple months
was just the yeah these stories come down and you bury them at like five a m when no one's watching and yes are conservative but he just run them and move on and the implication was not a big deal and corporate wasn't really watching or cared when they ran

and
hyman we made so and after the sale to sinclair alistair one is the first time that you interact with content that surprises you may even startles yeah it was probably one of the mark hymen commentary pieces is the deal j being used to silence media groups that hold the obama administration accountable islamic
radicals believe it's they're calling to convert or kill all nonbelievers it's time to ignore the craze and adopt the same energy policy to turn a blind eye to those who fit the profile and to invite them into our communities is irresponsible black churches and those counties organized they sort to the paul's campaign to drive obama voters straight from church
vote who may soon she and other islamic state from more the story visit the headlines dot net force of what facebook a market i mean they were clearly labeled as commentary and that continues to be sinclair his defense to this day is well we label or commentary his commentary but you're still using your trust
local anchors who do not have a bias and have spent decades plane completely down the middle you're using those trusted local anchors to give credence to give wheat to that commentary what did you make of the fact that these directors or being handed down within it
company to the stations and that you really didn't have much of a choice about how to respond to them
that was new and is still to this day completely unique to the way sinclair operates i've been part of other large and small station groups both before and after my time with sinclair and the way corporate works in every other station group in the country
is that they'll provide guidance on the broad picture of the way you cover the news or present the news but the day to day content decisions about what each station runs in every other station group is left to the local news directors and if there is
he is corporate content that comes down it's something that stations can run if it fits and there was actually not a whole lot of it in other station groups at all
sinclair it's it's different it is something that you must run and you must put it in your news cast and you can't touch it and that made me as as a journalist very uncomfortable did you ever ask your anchors or the reporters on air
for fill these orders
yeah sometimes i i wasn't keeping very close track i guess partially because i probably didn't want to know so you didn't wanna talk about it because you are in some ways ashamed of it owed a deeply ashamed uncomfortable whatever you'd like to call it it would just have a fundamental moral quandary on my part i i just couldn't do
it comes down to that sleeping at night looking yourself in the mirror in the morning
was at that point i realized i needed to find something else
so is it safe to say that you
left the station
because of what sinclair was asking you and your colleagues to do because you had a fundamental objection to what your new corporate parent was doing
absolutely
twenty four it mean sinclair has continued trying to grab the game basically hit a wall and it might be has regulatory limit on how many seasons
and when has interim like david sinclair in its chairman david men began pushing very changes to the regulatory limits on a number of stations in l a
if you believe is i do for the federal government has no business intervening in the news then we must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business
and that is why this afternoon
i shared with my fellow commissioners and order that will reform our media ownership rules and help pull the government once and for all out of the newsroom and quickly the federal communications commission began rolling back regulations and one of the things he did was a easy cap on how many stations that broadcaster cut down
and sinclair benefited immediately
counting and deal for tribune media company you may recognize because it used to be a company that owns a lot of newspapers the los angeles times that today they are a lot of local tv stations
so in buying tribune which is what their wants to do it would be buying up dozens more tv stations
this merger would allow sinclair clarity i reach seven in ten american homes and it would have more than two hundred stations across the country and when that makes the largest owner of tv stations and the country sinclair in fact was already the largest donor stations across the country and they still would make it even
bigger and city what have we seen with and clears programming in the past few years since november two thousand and fifteen sinclair has required at stations around and daily segment from what it calls it's terrorism alert desk for example commit terrorism alert as in washington i'm wednesday mass some british officials say terrorism related
had a record hi honey is are generally i heard us near mongering hate segment on has sixteen percent increase from the year before and they also will run conservative commentary from pundits like mine came in and boris epstein who is a former a spokesman for president
the latest conservative talking point where their aids media sudan along with other cable news networks is struggling to stick to the facts or north korea the president sending a message that comes out on that if you do not bad down and diplomatic discuss elizabeth olsen here gonna have the deal directly with donald trump whole be a lot
less interested in mason or healthcare government directed healthcare can be deadly or terrorism
terrorism has not the most would continue to be under constant threat of attack or taxes half of us are paying for everyone else are terrorists the new tabs on steel and aluminum are pushing our trading partners to engage and fair trade with the united states and they're definitely right leaning segments that are then shown on
local newscasts is there a sense that sinclair has gotten more liberated to do this and might even be doing it more sense trump was elected i don't know if they're doing and more but people are definitely noticing more
hi on fox san antonio is jessica headley and i'm ryan love our greatest responsibility is to serve our a san antonio community were extremely proud of a quality balance journalism that fuck san antonio produces so we are concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible one sided news stories plaguing our country the sharing of biased and false
news has become all too common on social media more alarm and he will really started noticing what and clarence doing last weekend when the when they dead been published and video that showed anchors i dozens of sinclair stations reading the same anti and mean yeah i would say their media more alarming family outlets have less the same thing
stories about checking facts first and fortunately his from members and the mania use their platforms to post their own person by us and i intend to control exactly what people think it's an extremely dangerous to our democracy they must friends in that has have generally been introduced by an anger with his granted but then there be packaged segments this
differently in all of the angriest were actually reading the same script so the anchors became the segment the anchors became a segment that the sharing of biased and paul smooths
all too common
yeah
unfortunately
country
really dangerous to history through this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous star democracy

so what did you think when suddenly just a few days ago this all exploded
in the national media with this video on dead spent what were you thinking when sinclair his relationship with his tv stations suddenly became national news
i was deeply sad for everyone in those videos
they are people they were people i knew people i'd work with people i mean and not have worked with but have seen on the year for years and to some of their credit they gave that video all the sincerity of a proof of life hostage video meaning they looked uncomfortable
clearly uncomfortable by what they are be expected to do and say i don't think any certainly not many of them truly believed what they were reading but they had no choice
sounds from what you're saying that you're sympathetic toward
these anchors had to do i'm absolutely sympathetic and that goes back to me growing up i think about had that been my mother in nineteen eighty three
five six seven years old
and my mother was told to read something like that she would have had the option of stand up for your values as a journalist and quit and lose your job and in find some way to feed your family or he could have read it and done it and sucked it up and said are it's bad
but i've got to work and i want to be a journalist
and every single one of those anchors that has a family that has a spouse that has a connection to a community that they have lived in for twenty or thirty or forty years every single one of them was in that position and what does your mother think about all of us to watch that video of other sinclair
you are saying exact same thing saw it i'm sure she was as horrified as the rest of us
she's been out of business for over ten years now
yeah he lives in seattle now she gets como sinclair station up there but she doesn't watch much and honestly don't think she watches much tv
and honestly i don't watch much local tv anymore either
we don't have cable anymore and where i live up in the mountains you can't get anything over the air so occasionally i'll streamer a local news cast on my phone fun feeling nostalgic i guess but i guess in some ways i've moved on to sound that both of you in a sense have started to give up a bet on tv news
i think we have
oh thank you very much appreciate michael
been my pleasure

we'll be right back

use what else you need another day
and answering a question for a reporter aboard air force one
president denied knowing about the one hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment that his lawyer michael cohen me to the adult film actress stephanie clifford weeks before the two thousand and sixteen election
a payment cheese was meant to prevent her from discussing an affair with in two thousand and six the clean could complicate the president legal battle against clifford who has claimed that the confidentiality agreement she signed is invalid because the president never signed by denying that he
knew about any green the president appeared to be confirming clifford's argument which could allow her to bring her silence without consequence

that's it
a mother

from the new york times on my cobra this is the day

today day one of mark zuckerberg today marathon hearings in washington
behind the hours of questioning about these books practices was a larger and more difficult to answer a question what is this
it's wednesday april that
so i don't go to a lot of congressional hearings in fact that was my first congressional hearing in d c and so i didn't know what to expect i showed up a few hours early and it was a total zoo
hi
like i cannot tell you how many hundreds of people waiting outside this tiny little hearing room kevin was at the hearing on tuesday and there were protesters in costume
there was a woman dressed up as a on
which i thought was very clever
oh my god
oh
loads of tv cameras and yeah it was sort of this circus like it was packed and wall to wall the entire thing was filled there were forty senators who are questioning zuckerberg so even by their standards this is a large group you were actually in the room for this what was it like when it's walk walking while it was v
very very quiet i mean so he started walking in the room gets hushed and then the cameras start going quickly

because it's become like an iconic picture in just suck or bird sitting down at his death
to prepare to testify and just the swarm of photographers were crowding around the really does look like this with a moment that everyone had been anticipating a long time
and he sits down and also as notes and they're off we welcome everyone today's hearing
on facebook
social media privacy
and the ocean fish and abuse of data and it was about five hours from start to finish we have forty four members between our two committees
that may not seem like a large group by facebook standards
what it is significant here
for a hearing in the states senate and i was through this whole thing i was in the front row and the front row of of press there a couple of rows of people behind zuckerberg and then press section started know is right up there and so actually you look on cspan i don't want to brag
arm and part of my hand her visible in about five hours or as the testimony written into history yeah i should have gotten in munich here
source my pleasure to recognize the chairman of the commerce committee chairman thrown for his opening statement
a german grassley today's hearing is extraordinary
extraordinary to hold a joint committee earring
it's even more extraordinary to have a single ceo testify before nearly half of the united states senate
but then facebook is pretty extraordinary it started off pretty tense let me just cut the chose if you and other social media companies do not get your in order none of us are going to have any privacy anymore there were some opening statements
sort of the senators to grassley nelson so the senators who have been leading on these issues and they were pretty aggressive how can american consumers trash folks like your company to be caretakers of the most personal and identifiable information was october it had
a long term opening statement about oh he had made mistakes we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake
and it was my mistake and i'm sorry
i started facebook
i run it and i'm responsible for what happens here and he started this thing in his dorm room he kept mentioning his dorm room at harvard i started facebook what i was in college
we've come a long way since then given why do you think that zuckerberg kept mentioning the origins of facebook in a dorm at harvard get it over and over so we have made a lot of mistakes and running the company i think it's pretty much impossible i believe to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we're at now without making some mistakes i think
it's just a sort of humanizing detail
why of people know the story of facebook
american dream narrative he was you know just a kid in a dorm and now he's one of the richest people in the world only in america etc etc but i think there was an interesting strategic race there because on one hand yes it's a humanizing detail
he needs more of those he wants more of those are the other hand like if your goal is to convince a bunch of senators they you are old enough and mature enough to be in charge of this gigantic technology platform
billions of people's lives around the world like you might not want to remind them how recently you're in college
i realize the issues were talking about today aren't just issues for facebook in our community there issues and challenges for all of us as americans
thank you for having me here today and i'm ready to take your questions
and then it sort of went off the rails i mean i never thought that this was going to be the most new discussion of technology policy and the intricacies of digital advertising mana well i watched a couple congressional hearings before like these are not subject matter experts most of them there for you consider my purse
personally identifiable data the company's not my day is that it
no senator actually the first line of our terms of service say that you control and only the information and content that you put on facebook and so it felt a little like a five hour tech support call
it felt like trying to explain to someone very patiently how their i phone works and what to do if it's on the fritz there will always be a version of facebook that is free it is our mission to try to help connect everyone around the world and to bring the world closer together in order to do that we believe that we need to offer a service that everyone can
ford and we're committed to doing that were have so how to use the state of business model in which users don't vote for your service
senator we run ads or most of them i would say their understanding of just the basics about facebook not even this russia stuff for cambridge analytic about just how does this thing work how does it make money how do people interact with it like that seem to elude some of the senators so
people people now give you permission to track specific devices in their contract if they do is that a relatively new addition to what you do
senator oh sorry i am able to opt out of i will say it's ok for you to
track what i'm saying on facebook but i don't want you to track what i'm texting to somebody else off facebook on an android oh okay
yes senator this kind of confusion about exactly how facebook work seem very much like the theme of the day and or thinking about that is that these book has become all powerful we know that they haven't done a great job with this great power that they have and that
lot of these senators are angry on behalf of their constituents for his kind of nebulous thread that facebook represents but what it seems like the settlers and the rest of us don't quite know it's like where'd you go from there because we don't really understand how facebook works great and to be clear
like i write about facebook for a living and i don't understand how facebook or like it's sort of fractal in the moment you start thinking that you understand part of it you discover that there are ten different parts of it that you don't understand at all and because everyone's facebook feed is tailored to their specific interests like know two people
see the same thing when they log on to facebook different it's literally different for everyone and so that makes it very hard to create a unified theory of facebook and how it works and i think that's the thing that i was seeing is just the senators were trying to grapple with okay is this a technology company is in a website is an immediate
companies that a political campaign tool is it's something that we should regulate like it's the news publisher is it something that we should regulate like it's a bank is it's something that we should regulate in some other way that we haven't figured out yet a really seemed like that was sort of the essential question is not what did facebook do in
twenty six sixteen it was what his facebook
mr zuckerberg outcome in peach
i was particularly struck by this interaction that zuckerberg had with john kennedy who is a republican senator from louisiana and sort of a guy who's been tough fun tech executives before i don't want to blow to have to regulate facebook
but now god i will
binge on you
i'm a little disappointed in the sharon do that
i just don't feel like that were connecting
show me try to lay it out for you from map and one of you
i think you're really smart guy
and i think you have built an extraordinary american company
and you've done a lot of good some of the things that you've been able to do or magical
but are promised digital utopia
we have discovered has mine fields
there's some impurities in the facebook punch bowl he started off pretty strong i think he expressed a lot of this sort of frustration that some people in the room when kneeling
then it can on an island off the rails as a facebook user are you are you willing to give me more control over my data
senator as someone who uses facebook i believe that you should have complete control over your data okay are you willing to go back and work on on giving me a grinder right to erase my data
senator you can already delete any of the data that's there are we going to ban that work on expanding man
senator i think we already do what you're referring to but certainly were always working on trying to make these controls easier are you willing to expand my right to know who you're sharing my data with
senator
we already give you a list of apps that that you're using and you signed into those yourself and provided affirmative consent and just keep saying senator you can already do this we already built this it already exists
you can see him sort of patiently explaining like us we thought about this yes we've addressed are you willing to give me the right to take my data on facebook and move to another social media platform
senator you can already do that we have download your information to all where you can go get a file of all the content there and then do whatever you want with it and then asked him you're willing to give me the right to say i'm gonna go on your platform
and you're going to be able to tell a lot about me as a result but i don't want you to share with any but
yes senator and i believe you're you already have that ability today people can sign on and choose to not share things and just follow some friends are some pages and read content if that's what they want to do okay
my be sure and about out
time or goes faster than this exchange kind of because like a microcosm of this entire hearing because kennedy is angry he wants facebook to do better but he doesn't quite understand what the problem actually is and ultimately the questions that senators like kennedy are asking
are kind of beside the point
they think there's some value in forcing someone like mark zuckerberg to answer really simple questions about facebook street for details way so simple questions but important ones to get on the record store cupboard would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you see in last night

no
think that might be with this is all about
you're right to privacy
the limits of your privacy but then there were sort of the odd ball questions that just seems like people had may be thought of them on the fly or it was their pet issue or their bill that they wanted to push it was sort of a grab bag concerns do you have any idea how many of your users actually read the terms of
service the privacy policy the statement rights and responsibilities and the actually read it
senate are you not my state and from west virginia and thank you for visiting and next time you visit if you would please bring some fiber because we don't have connectivity in our rural areas like we really need and facebook could really help us with that on guy like whipped out a tablet
and like showed off his facebook profiles that i am a proud member facebook and he was really surreal important now my son charlie who's thirteen is dedicated instagram so he'd want to be sure i mention him while i was here with with you
this always happens railing i remember listening to congress grilling wall street executives in two thousand and nine after the financial crisis and they were asking all kinds of crazy questions too but what came out of the had was a sense that this was a sector that had to be reined in things have gotten out of control
that there needed to be comprehensive regulation of the sector that would keep something like the financial crisis from happening again and out of that process we actually did get regulation in dodd frank was the big bill that passed through congress that tried to address some of the causes of the two thousand and eight financial crisis and the
congress people in those hearings with the bank executives they were not experts on mortgage backed securities are credit default swaps but they still managed to understand in general terms what the issue was these banks were taking on too much risk and then they had their staffers and experts who actually knew the subject very well
come in and draft legislation that would address those problems and i think that's the step we're not seeing it with a spoken with the tech sector is we hadn't yet identified what the problems are they were trying to solve and congress doesn't seem to be united on that and i'm not even sure they're particularly close
to identifying what they're trying to do and then after that going out and actually doing who's your biggest competitor
center we have a lot of competitors who is your biggest
i think the categories of did you want just one i not sure i can give one but i give up
bunch so
give this entered islam credit mean there were a number of interesting and relevant questions i think zuckerberg got pressed a lindsey graham about some of the questions are on whether a facebook is a monopoly did anyone at facebook have a conversation at the time that i became aware of this breach and
have a conversation where in the decision was made not to contact the users he got pressed by comma harris center from california about specific issues related to cambridge analytic face books failure to notify users so there was some ground broken i don't want to give the impression that this was
all just a total three ring circus but i do think there were a number of occasions on which just asking a follow up question there was more pointed i think zuckerberg was very good at answering the questions that he wanted to answer part of that is because he's been rehearsing for this he hired a team of fancy experts to come in and
him for the session like presidential candidates would do before a debate so he was prepared for just about anything but they didn't really plumb the depths of what people might have expected them to ask so would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry absolutely okay would you submit some
proposed regulations
yes and i'll have my team follow up with you
how do you think that he did i didn't did pretty well i mean i think he started off pretty nervous but i think as a war on he started to realize that this is not going to be a totally hostel in totally sophisticated group of prosecutorial center this is going to be a mixed bag and i think he got a lot more comfortable as the day went on but i think
did well when investors think he did well to the stocks up almost five percent so clearly he reassured some people
one of the key issues here is his facebook to power are you to power in do you think you're too powerful
but i want to touch on this other thing that i was feeling today because i i felt that pretty acutely when some of the senators were talking to mark zuckerberg and sort of asking him for advice on maybe how they should regulate him how they should think about these things
it's a little bit more like a tutorial than a regulatory hearing and i really started thinking you know these senators are part of a legislative body that makes the laws for a population of three hundred and some million
mark zuckerberg by himself controls of supranational entity that's two point two billion people so he is like in a very real sense more powerful than any of these individuals' senators or maybe even the senate as a whole he can't launch
nuclear weapons or start a war or collect taxes but he can shape the behaviors and the mental states any information diet's have many many more people around the world then these senators can dress with their work
as a technology writer i assume you more or less knew the answers to most of the questions that the senators were asking but did you learn anything in his hearings
yeah i think i learned a lot about how senators and lawmakers view technology companies and view the work that firms like facebook do and i think it's sort of a mixture of reverence and skepticism and a little bit of fear and i think all of that mixed together explains
a lot about how the next few years are going to go for technology companies saying they're not getting less powerful rate in the absence of new regulation or something crazy happening in the economy they're not going away and so i think will start to see more and more of these types of hearings and my hope is that with each successive here
success of opportunity the law makers have to ask questions of people like mark zuckerberg the get a little bit better and a little bit better and pretty soon we'll be having the types of discussions you need to be having
kevin thank you very much
make that

i should ask you like a dick durbin start question which hotel you day until i'm staying on my brother's futon
the nicest hotel in washington enjoy
well i'm going to guess

we'll be right back


here's what else you need to know the times reports that the f b i agents who did the offices of president trumps personal lawyer michael collins will looking for records of payments to two women who claim they had a
fares with trump as well as information about the war of the publisher of the national enquirer in silencing one of those women it's unclear exactly why the agents are examining the payments but critics of the president have claimed that they amount to illegal campaign contributions to drop bit
because they helped him win the white house by hiding publicly damaging stories on tuesday trump continued to lash out at the department of justice for the raid
calling it a total witch hunt and saying quote attorney client privilege is dead and afternoon
as she know the president welcome to the emir of qatar to the white house today
during a news conference at the white house a reporter asked press secretary sarah how could be sanders about the possibility that the president would fire special counsel robert
over the raid which began with a tip for his
power firearms
as certainly believes he has the power to do so
in fact the president does not have the power to do so
that power realize with the deputy attorney general rod roses
who the times reports personally authorize the raid on cohen's office
that's it
i'm michael horrible
to
from the newest tons ah michael barbara
nice piece

today
the coming battle between trumps
and the state of california
and james comb goes on national television to call the president a danger to the nation
it's monday april sixty
ladies and gentlemen
i've come to feel great affection for the papers of the world
because they've always been so welcoming to me it it is is a body building gym in was a movie star private citizen or as the governor of the great state of california so the standards that we have today in the united states are among strictest in a strange and in the world and
oh that largely to the state of california cool davenport covers energy and the environment for the times well ladies and gentlemen something remarkable is beginning to do something revolutionary something historic and transformative
let me give you some background back in the early two thousand that state of california was going to vary a corrective only move ahead of the rest of the country and put these very tight car emissions standards and place that would be stronger than the rest of the country we're doing is is changing them
panic
they're being the way and encouraging the future so the new standards would force automakers to make the it all that get an average of fifty four point five miles per gallon by two thousand and twenty five that's almost double what they were when the standards were put in place so that's pretty ambitious very
ambitious
crow how is it bad
one state california has the ability to set its own emissions standards i tend to think of these things as national have one standard for all these days so eager about great
lamb
maintaining an improving environmental quality under the terms of nineteen seventy clean area of new laws to protect the environment
and we are mobilize the power public i'm from california especially allay had some of the worst air and the country the worst smog and the country here we are you should be able to see the mountains you should be able to see our beautiful city with it can't you can't see anything california got a special waiver that stronger air pollution standards than the rest of the can
he has that was what was necessary to clean up their alley smog and clean up some of the most polluted air in the country which at the time as in california that all of our cars were operating efficiently we would have a significant reduction and all of this pollution and junk in the air that's what we need to do
and so ever since there has been this waiver for california to sat tighter clean air standards than the rest of the country
porn is a very powerful state a very powerful blows the men they do something it has consequences
and here's what we're doing for in is mobilizing good in a larger financial aid and political divide deal with climate change

so what ends up happening is there a couple of years between two thousand and four and she thousand and nine were the standards are considered and debate in and put into place and california but they haven't yet been implemented and the auto industry is totally freaked out
they are terrified that the standards are going to be fully implemented in california and they are going to face what so many automakers have described as sort of their worst nightmare where there's one set of standards for the state of california and a different set of standards for the rest of the country and they're going to have to create two different kinds of cars for these to die
markets and how giant is the market in california california market is huge it's about thirty percent of the entire us auto market it's like all of the ways in which he manufacturing your product you have to go into your factories and make two entirely different kinds of the same product automakers just saw this as a logistical and
financial nightmare and they were desperate to come up with some kind of wage our faces and of course what they wanted was for the federal government to revoke this waiver that california has so there wouldn't be two different standards governor schwarzenegger had a different idea
what was the day good good news
from washing though governor schwarzenegger is ideal as this morning as spoke with carol browner lose the president's advisor on climate change to work with the federal government after the election of president obama to take the california standards and instead make a national the goals to serve one national stand there will rapidly
increase fuel efficiency without compromising safety this was something that obama really wanted to do because this was a major climate change policy that i want to applaud california governor schwarzenegger and into california delegation for their extraordinary leadership
they have led the way on this as a of and so many other efforts to protect the environment and how to the car companies respond to the prospect of stricter national standards not just in california but suddenly being adopted potentially by the president across country
this wasn't ideal for the car company is it wasn't exactly what they wanted but just at the moment that this was happening that proponents of district your standard the state of california and the obama administration had a lot of leverage we can and muslim that we will not let our auto industry simply vanish because
federal government had just given an eighty billion dollar bailout to the big three auto companies who are on the verge of bankruptcy i'm talking about as using our existing legal structure as a tool that with the backing of the us government the make it easier for general motors and chrysler to quickly clear away all that
that are wearing them down so that they can get back on their feet onto a path to success
so if they're option was to separate standards or wine stricter standards that was the least worst of the options and all these forces came together to create these strict new standards based on the california standards so the auto companies buckle and they to these national standards yes but with
one condition
and this is really important
sad we would like to be able to go back in two thousand and seventeen
and they specifically chose that year because obama will definitely no longer be an office we would like to build in to these strict regulations the ability to go back in two thousand and seventeen and reopen and if that turns out that it's too difficult for us to meet them we would like what they called and offered
amp the ability to go back and reconsider the regulations and loosen them or a week and then if we can show that they have been to onerous to the plant else planted a last onset clause that might make these standards expire that would make it legal for another administration to go back and and tinker with them and and can
then president donald trump delivers remarks at a rally in detroit michigan on his plan to boost the us auto industry and job creation
it is truly great to be back here in michigan
the automakers are ready and waiting for this moment with in the first few weeks after president trump is inaugurated this o's of the big three automakers had a visit with him in the oval office in the very first thing that they asked for a wise to revisit these fuel economy standards
is that they're too onerous they're forcing us to build all these electric cars consumers don't want to buy them this technology is too expensive and soon after that that has also wonderful to be here with the leaders workers engineers
and suppliers afford and feared chrysler general motors has an inch and visit ed and automaker in detroit where the announced that we're going to do this i'm sure you've all heard the big news that we're going to work or the cafe standards so you can make cars in america again
have american automakers make the car as americans want to buy this big announcement there is more beautiful say an american made car no more
so the administrator got her start preparing to do the legal paperwork to file their legal documentation required to actually go in and rollback these regulations so we knew that was coming and we also started hearing that there would be a big and if
media flashy shelly media announcement
further the illustration announcing today another big rollback of obama era environmental i know why the trump administration could challenge california is ambitious clean energy goal the administration rolling barack obama era fuel standards proof says the if he is working with the appropriate emission standards
established under the obama administration are too high then he wouldn't tell us what was happening or where is happening or anything we heard sorted through other sources but they were playing announcement at this chevy dealership in suburban virginia and then like midnight the night before we heard that the announcement
with off even though the policy was still going to happen and then they said they were gonna do it at that sort of closed door announcement actually just at the offices so what actually happened at the last minute there were some automakers and auto dealers that we're starting to get cold feet about this announcement when they
started to hear what the administration appears to have in mind which is a very aggressive bad since overall back i've heard even a number that's been talked about is rolling them back forty percent well they could end up in exactly the situation that they hadn't wanted in the first place which is two different markets if they roll back the nash
standard in california is allowed to keep its legal waiver for its own cleaner standards that is the nightmare scenario for automakers and so you know one person i talked to one expert said they're like the dog that caught the car wait a minute why do i do now is this really what i wanted to car dealerships and car companies
all worried that the trump administration will go too far in the process and upsetting california creating a scenario where there would again be this tension between california and it standards and the rest of the country and their standards that is logistically their worst nightmare in general it's pretty
consistent that industry
doesn't want regulation but even more than they don't like regulation they don't like uncertainty industries will say that's even worse we want to know what the ground rules are so we can make long term investments and if we don't know the ground rules it's a lot harder to invest in what we're going to do in the future the uncertainty hurts worse hurts industries hirst invest
months and probably hurts the economy worse than clearly defined regulations
why would the trunk of injuries and it's period
why would a rollback these emissions standards beyond what the auto industry is comfortable with and potentially rile up the state of california and injure the very industry that these or intended to assist hasn't and tramp himself as the great
the regulator of these the american industry
american cars may travel the road
american players will sort of the skies and american ships will patrol the seas built in
and he loves especially to talk about rolling back regulations on sort of these iconic american industries like coal mining or automakers we want more cars made in the u s a and going in comparison to be john i think with the terrorists as well
no he said he's created these huge tariffs and some of these american companies and american industries are saying well wait a minute this actually might not help us you know it's a lot more complex the nuance than just slapping on some terrorists that's a lot more complex and nuanced than just rolling back these regulations and i do think that the
president wants to help the auto industry but it does seem that some of the nuance of that messaging perhaps as been lost
so where does all this leave us is sounds like california still holds a lot of the cards in this situation could california scott all this plan to roll back emission standards pretty dramatically by the white house
well they can't scan the plans to roll back the national regulation
the white house absolutely can just do that the question is can the white house force california to comply with the new lower and so we will see the answers to this unfold probably in the next few months
there might be a deal in the offing were california and the federal government would work together for a very very slight loosening of the standards but california is government particularly under its current governor jerry brown is very aggressively environmentally focused they have no problem clashing
with the trump administration in fact i think sometimes they seem to delight in it
and the tramp administration seems to feel the same way and i have no problem clashing with california and they are very very focused on an aggressive deregulatory agenda so if their new numbers are way way way lower than the obama numbers more than ten twenty thirty percent they will pretty much have to
who do illegal failing to revoke california waiver to a stronger standard california will jump right back with a countersuit so we'll see that legal fight unfold
and then the question of whether or not california i can keep its own tighter standard or not i think we'll go before the supreme court probably in the next year so
what would these rollbacks that the president is pursuing look like for the auto industry and for the consumers who buy cars eventually it will leave the market where it is if the standards were to stay and play as we would see a pretty aggressive transition away from gas guzzlers into words
cars and ideally technological breakthroughs where you can have an electric or hybrid or fuel efficient se ve day
roll back the standards essentially we won't see that progression we won't see that evolution will just sort of see things remain the same so the air wouldn't get any dirtier it just wouldn't get any cleaner yeah i wouldn't get any cleaner but you know greenhouse gases would continue to trap heat in the atmosphere know the planet would keep getting hotter
her
pero thank you very much appreciated thank you always a pleasure
on
mulberry bush


thanks
you were the president is unethical
on tethered to the truth
his donald trump unfit to be president
this would not in the way i often hear people talk about a boy who stuff but him being mentally incompetent early stages of dementia strikes me as a person of above average intelligence
who's truck in conversations and knows what's going on i don't think he's medically unfit mother whose moral room for improvement
on sunday night former director james komi gave his first interview since his firing as he begins to publicize his memoir which is scheduled to be released on tuesday a person who she is moral equivalence and church who talks about and treats women like the pieces of me
who lives cards to live a motors big and small and insists the murder people believe that a person's not fit to be president
on moral grounds that's not a policy statement him i don't care what your views are on goes on immigration or taxes
something more important than a should you know it almost and that is our president must embody respect and here to the values are the core of his country the most important bring truth this person who was not able to do that he is morally on food to be president the interview with a b c news is george stephanopoulos is to first
have a weeks long media blitz that amounts to a remarkable public saw by a former high ranking government official on a sitting president displayed the deep concerns he expressed about the president who me said he did not want to see the president forced out of office if you're right what is
the remedy should donald trump mph
impeachment is a is a question of law
trucked and politics and so that will be determined by people go new citizen you have a judgment auto give you a stranger i hope not
because i think impeaching and removing him from office would let the american people off the hook and have something hope and indirectly that i believe their duty bound to do directly people in this country to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values will fight about guns will fight about taxes will thought about all those other things down the road
road but you cannot have as president so someone who does not reflect the values that i believe republicans treasure and democrats treasure and independents treasure that is the core of this country that's our foundation console impeachment in a way with short circuit that
so in a series of tweets center before the interview was aired president term repeatedly attacked corey calling him a slime ball and a liar and claimed that cool me will could go down as the worst
f b i director in history by far

hughes what else you need to another
are there any consequences for a patrons russia and iran who continue to protect him
so let's say you will feed that russian sanctions will be coming down secretary nature and will be announced goes on monday if he has already on sunday the troop administration said it would impose new sanctions against russia to punish it for enabling syria to use chemical weapons against civilians
they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to us and chemical weapons shoes and so i think everyone is going to feel at at this point i think everyone knows that we send a strong message and our hope is that they listen to it
the sanctions follow american led airstrikes on friday
which struck syrian government facilities linked to chemical weapons
and are meant to signal that the u s pulled booth syria and its allies russia and iran responsible for the chemical attacks good on sunday serious president bush sure oh sod publicly celebrated his partnership with russia during a meeting with russian law me
acres in damascus assad priest russia for shooting down many of the us missiles launched at syria in friday's attack

that's it for the deal on michael mobile


from the new york times on my this is the special episode of
today
the islamic state has attracted tens of thousands of followers from over one hundred nations around the world and at their peak controlled a total lamp larger than the united kingdom
what is that drew so many and what is that they're really trying to build
it's thursday equal

we here at the daily have been working on a new series focused on the reporting of my colleague who can kill a mocking and today or bringing you the first two installments of that series starting with the prologue

are to kill people
is there anything your doors
we adults to focus on we also have coats of ballistics job it would feel a lot lonely
inside the blue suit job of facts were major organs and be
slaves practice be headed step practice kind of what a medical student would do
a new had to have to know how to use and knife on a human




test one to has us okay yeah ok
can i go back to the and of course
so can you describe what we're looking at
yeah
it's a man standing in the cancer
he's clad in black
his face is covered all you see is a for his eyes
he has a knife in his hand and he stabbing at in the direction of a camera
at his feet is another man i wish i had more time this one is wearing an orange jumpsuit i wish i could ever hope afraid i must say my family once again his name is james foley he's an american freelance journalist and he's been kidnapped by the islamic state this is too hard for an american citizen of no country
and he's about to be executed and aggression towards some extent
and the bloodshed
this is basically how the world meets isis yeah and now breaking news out of london are deadly terror attack over nine years later isis is a van plowing into a crowd of people out of play enjoy a saturday night a bunch of guys in a van gogh or plowing
to pedestrians on london bridge pulling out kitchen knives stabbing people on the streets where they're going to search bags in san bernardino mass shooting identified it's a husband and wife
rapid shooting just build build bill bill bill who had to a christmas party and san bernardino california and come in guns blazing breaking news an explosion at the very busy port authority bus terminal it's an immigrant living in brooklyn who straps on a suicide vast and tries to detonated in a subway tunnel in times square
just a block away from my office he told investigators he detonated an explosive device in the name of isis this is isis now
and i truly believe is defining moment in history isis is the latest incarnation this is clearly a case of good versus evil of a war we have been fighting now for nearly two decades and make no mistake about a good will prevail


yeah
but here's the thing despite the billions of dollars we have spent despite the thousands of lives that have been lost both our own soldiers and civilians caught in the crossfire there are more terrorist now in there were on the eve of september eleventh not just trying to get your head around that there are more terror groups now
now not last there are more ways that they attack there are more strategy is to do so there are more tools that they use there are more of them not last
so
as for you
in the simplest terms what you're trying to find out
i am trying to answer one question who are they
this is something you learned in the training
the
you know it's going to be hard for you guys killing and or even who are they really they should first time which going to affect your logic in and resurgent gonna be sick in you might even feet from the blood who is a couple you're really fighting but what you have to do is use a drink demos emotion remember you doing this regard women

like garbage out of buildings
the nicest panther him so in the place and when i tell people about their part of your job
was always ask two questions first there's a backpack are to to such but i'm scared when i hadn't thought of isn't that dangerous they can be a good book a trip to cuba and i'm always like yes could be very dangerous
and the explosion that's close
gunfire a smug visitors in airstrikes
charlie
and the other question they ask is how is that worth it
link
what what do you say to them
so look every reporter that covers conflict and war knows that you have to be there you have to be on the ground if you want to try to understand the story
and as for me i'm trying to understand isis
and one thing i've learned is that if you're able to get to the buildings that they occupied right after they are underrated and i mean right after the community to describe what you're doing her and on in a run off the side of a church that isis had used as a base
nope of here you often can find the documents that they left behind if the little guy is like day by a dick these are not documents that are meant for publication
it's since a prayer mat and then over there are these aren't the rockets the man
investment if you walked into my home right now if you walked in right now you would probably find my bank of america statement if you found that you would find all of my daily transactions you would know what diet i have you would know that i have a penchant for buying a certain kind of rice milk
the stores that i go to shop at so you might conclude that that i'm probably middle class
if you walked over to the bookshelf you would find books in romanian in english and in french and you could deduce from bad that i most likely speaks three languages or that members of my family are bilingual or and well if you went upstairs and he went into my bedroom and you found my diary you would find my most private thoughts and you're saying yeah you
and i did so i am doing that to isis them
i am looking for isis has diary i am looking for their internal correspondence their receipts their personal tips with coworkers some of which end up getting sent to the equivalent of isis h r
the things they're struggling with but they're writing letters back and forth about so the documents are generally what you are using to answer this question who are we really fighting yeah
you drove to syria went with your friend from from and right for go go gold own lives on the are you of course i'm a journalist so i also want to talk to them
we need people who are willing to give the love especially who's that
that's incredibly difficult but has been able to speak to around two dozen of them both in prisons in europe what did he do before i came here courage and to stall homemade volatile and in jails in both syria and iraq
watch your for have i
he worked for months with him as a mechanic those interviews have been crucial for me and understanding the general framework of how this works and the motivations that push people to join them
but many of those interviews have also left me frustrated the toilet
them over here because he chopped off his home
the overwhelming pattern is that they'll have witnessed an execution have witnessed a beheading have been present when a stoning took place when he has other things that you feel fucked her stomach military action
haiti
claw shocked but they never took part in that i'm stops
to me that many times along the way you said no
they weren't getting suspicious of you know there were no all looking at me and asked him why you eat and over and over this is the story to tell us go away but both when they did so he said i don't want to work with you anymore so he quit they were a cook there were a driver they were a translator
bashir do you want to tell me what really happened or do you not want to be interviewed at all
they present themselves as having been witnesses to her but never having carried out the horde themselves i've lost interest because he's controlling found himself so many times i just can't tell them anything things true
that's usually occurs
usually

you know in these suicide attacks like the paris attacks
obviously children and women were also count
how do they justify that
he said
they using exotic soon justification for every attack
third the do it tour solely due to them
palmer are women and children indiscriminately we do to them
certain point either said that you want to quit
can you can it was there one woman here serious moments said
already been killed someone


what do you what are we going to orbit in a call on the canadian he wants to call him up who say safer this is his code name that he's chosen this this has been on the care as they call it and every isis fighter has another garrett they don't entered the terrorist group with their own name and the reason they do that is
as a security measure to try to protect her identity so who's if a book was safer
yeah i had he designed them it started with instagram
so he came to my attention through a researcher named on at eight ram she like me trolls
the chat rooms and these platforms and she had gone online and found who safer as instagram feet and and that instagram feed she was able to put together that i will say for is a canadian that he had been inside the islamic state sometime we believed in two thousand and fourteen
and that he had returned to canada and was somehow living in the general population
did you ever see his instagram yes yeah
you've got you've got these are screenshots that you took a screenshot that that honor to tuck he's taken a town since then
okay so basically has his profile just shows the smiling kid
looks like he's wearing what may be a workout shirt
but if you go back through it there are some things that are that are somewhat disturbing so for example he repost an image of a knife and not only find it
paired us to me it looks like a combination between a screwdriver and a normal life that has the circular this kind of spiral shape so that wherever you inserted
it doesn't get along just one edge and cuts in a spiral direction
and and there's a caption on the image that he reposted the caption says deadliest knife ever it takes a team of surgeons to seal the wound victim bleeds out and minutes this is one evil knife
so honored ended up doing a report on this and she sent it to me and i pass this on to our research team at the new york times and they were then able to cross reference that material with his linked to an account
on his linked an account we found his email and i sent him an email expecting like always do that these people are not going to respond to me they would what did you say in or email
i said to him what a hobby say which has my name is rick many calling marquee i'm a reporter for the new york times where i covered on al qaeda and isis
and i'm very interested to learn about the islamic state and your experience are inside it
of course i sent this expecting the obvious which has that either he will not respond or he would say that but
like many here from the new york times how are you
good i am i getting you while you're in the car
oh okay to my true surprise a couple of days later he responded
not
yeah in the email very gently asked him where his phone number once they had his phone number asked him if he will not call him that i called in and then i asked him for permission to come to canada to see him and what do you allow me to come with my team at every step i thought he was gonna say no
no i mean that's that's kind of of see you as a fact that he said yes and the fact that it had been so easy to find him started to make me feel nervous
i remember thinking is there something i'm missing as this is this may be a fake order
you
oh right
why doesn't want to talk to you know why why would you want to talk to me so can you show me certain things like can you show me your the stamps in your passport you have images from theory but what kept me going is is is that could also hear the tennessee in his voice
and so i had to take the taps so test test so the next step is is you and i booked a ticket
both here and we flew to canada we're not going to say where we went from faces
get your voice
add up ourselves in in this hotel room i texted him the name of the hotel the address the room number and he agreed to come after the end of his work day because he was working i believe at a restaurant
and then we started wait
and he was initially late by fifteen minutes than twenty minutes than thirty minutes
we're still waiting
he says what's our i'm texting him and and wondering if we're going to be stood up
around an hour now
by
at a certain point
i almost gave up i thought this is we've basically just thrown away a plane ticket to canada
and at some point i remember that you turned around to asked me do you think there's any chance that this person is dangerous
when i asked you if you ever got scared
what you did now
a reverse
a vacuum cleaner suddenly foot down and turned around us which scared
and then
the
you hardly turn off the microphone hundred it's your turn off the record your head and hope and then you told me a story and i think the would you told that story now about the nine one one call yeah yeah
so i don't usually scare easily but in twenty fifteen i get a phone call from the f b i
to many much yes i am a may i come to see you right now i can be at your office and the next twenty minutes
and we went into a conference from not far from here and the agent read a prepared statement
he said you were the subject of a targeted threat from the islamic state and we can't tell you more
that was the first serious threat but it's started to percolate in our summer that they were noticing what i was doing since then i've seen how as become a presence in their online chat rooms they talk about my reporting the dissect my
tweets they sometimes insult me and these insults
if he can just as though sometimes are pretty funny i think they've figured out that i'm sensitive about my weight so they sometimes call me think many many many like pig fat much
sorry
i mean there's something ironic about big fat shamed by isis
so you know don't make jabs about how it's put on a couple of towns based on my latest you know tv appearance
but then sometimes what they say is dub serious so for example when i was in mosul a couple of months ago they started talking about how they were hoping that i would get killed in mosul just like the kurdish journalist who was killed there at the same time in the city
but let's see what are the others
you have a folder on your phone or you keep the threat is when i'm here yeah i like my one of them is a masked man who was holding up a knife that he's pointing towards the camera and he said under a picture of me wanted to be kill this crusader a woman that refuses to join to islam many cleo marcie please enjoy
joined to religion before be heading or truck from our soldiers of islamic state okay pretty by said
so they created a channel where they're pretending to be me and then they're pretending to post in this channel as me and says i have to confess something here i started covering isis because they are real man i always fantasized about getting raped by them that's all my fantasies this is the sole reason i made multiple trips to most or just a captured by isis so that they can fulfill my
desires
so unused to the stuff now but back when the f b i first came it didn't really sink in it was so unbelievable that honestly i i just
i think i just started away somewhere else
and then weeks went by there was another apparent terror attack and your best time in germany and months went by a series of deadly bonds at least one packed with nails killing dozens injuring hundreds and in that period of time i covered attack after tax returns storm the chancery morning master priests kingdoms and choose
hostage and a planned a deliberate attack in suburban sydney starts to just marinate in your consciousness german media reports the attackers shouting allah akbar as your heart out the passengers and then about a year later
i was home alone late at night
so i'm home alone and i'm by myself because at this point in time my husband was working the overnight at his company at twelve thirty i think at night i'm getting ready to go to bed i'm i'm actually under the covers and i'm upstairs with my two dogs and suddenly
my rhodesian ridge back which has a big dog
grayling
the hair on his back straight up immediately afterwards i started hearing somebody ringing the doorbell downstairs
and they're ringing continuously it's not like it's not like knock knock and and go waves like
knock knock now
i'm thinking to myself what is this like who who is this what does this
so i get a hold of my husband who assures me that it's not him at this point of turned off the lights in the second floor bedroom because i don't want the people who are asked to see where i am
so the dog is barking the knocking is going on and the doorbell is ringing and ringing and ringing
at this point i'm so scared for my hands are not even working
now i'm ron right you're right
ma'am
what a what
so the f d eight and who had come to seeming had told me that they had alerted the particular police precinct were left he said if you ever have any issues all you have to do is call nine one one they have you on a list but rather that you call rather than waiting for you know for something to happen i mean how the market have to work again
what are your heart but yeah the operator who picked up must have thought i was crazy
you know i
i will be great
or whatever and i can remember exactly what the woman said but it was something like ma'am are you trying to tell me that isis
doorbell
robert mcnabb
so she calls me back and just as ma'am
i am calling to tell you that we've investigated and it happens to be the the water department there's been a water main break on your street and as a result of this they're going house to house to tell the neighborhood that you're told that is not gonna flush what do you think the moral authority is ah
that's true moral that story with wires of the best the store you chose to tommy when i asked you if you've ever been afraid i guess the story illustrates how
i got and stared into the very thing that isis is trying to do because in the end the purpose of these acts of savagery and violence
our to terrorists they're trying to scare us right they're trying to make themselves into bogeyman and live in our imagination and that night
yeah they got me that night
yeah
so back to the hotel we were we were there for about two hours yeah and then suddenly out of the blue there was
a knock at the door of our hotel room
and i was struck because i had expected him to go to the lobby and that the lobby would call us but and study had managed to walk past the lobby
hello
yeah and i open the door and he had a hood on and the hood he was pulled so far forward that i could barely see his face his face wasn't shadow
he kept it kind of pulled down like that for some time
we that way
and both of us being really friendly
overtly
going to sit down it isn't he
there was
and then and then we sat down and started talking right
thank you so much recover
you're obviously taking a risk i'm speaking to us
is so i just wanted to ask if it's okay that we call you are boo hoo say stuff
problem was enough
so as you know i'm money
this is andy
and as i explained to you when we talked earlier
i'm trying to understand the ideology of isis
it's obviously an ideology that has a lot of paul tens of thousands of people have joined this group and i'm looking to in the hopes that you can help us understand it better
does that sound okay

from the new york times on michael barbara this

today
when the owner of a hong kong bookstore went missing
questions saw what had happened
and what did the chinese governor of she didn't pay have to do with it
it's tuesday april twenty fourth

in downtown hong kong there's an area called causeway bay and you walked down one of those streets you'll find tucked in between an upscale lingerie store and a pharmacy there's a grimy little staircase and there are signs all over twenty you upstairs or beauty parlor an apartment buildings
but if you stop on the second floor landing you're going to find a tiny little store called causeway bay books and inside there's just a few shows a couple of tables stacked with books and the owner of this bookstore is a man named lamb when key he's got a proof of grey hair tiny little glasses and
nervous energy about him he's always smoking a cigarette
and one day
he just stopped showing up to work
alex palmer has been reporting on what happened to i am wiki well turned out that lamb wink he wasn't the only one he disappeared at the end of october in two thousand and fifteen and within a couple of months people started noticing a curious trends that other people connected to causeway bay books and to the pub
swisher that own his store
they were also disappearing
street in hong kong is now the center of a growing mystery a bookseller in hong kong went missing three hong kong booksellers who went missing in china
is the fifth totally from the same book publishing company to have disappeared since hoped to find made have disappeared
the assumption was that chinese authorities were involved somehow because the thing about causeway bay books and about lamb when key and the man connected to him is that they weren't just ordinary booksellers they were selling a very special commodity in hong kong something known as banned books which often talked about chinese officials and way
ways that inside china you could never get away with this is hong kong rowdy unruly raucous free press bears works that touch on the darkest secrets of communist china the greatest seems of the party but then you also have another side which is what lamb when key and his bookstore
we're more famous for which are tawdry are so you have pulled be grocery store novels about the sex lives of high ranking communist officials and their tawdry affairs and the corruption the back stabbing and the party basically hong kong books show that the perfect stayed image
put forward by the communist party might not be quite as true as the chinese government and like its citizens to think
what does a ban on books in mainland china
mean for a bookseller like lamb is in hong kong it means a couple of things it means first of all that a lot of the customers who he sees in his book store every day are people from the mainland coming to hong kong for vacation since it was handed over to china nine hundred ninety seven from being a british colony it's been good
and teed a measure of freedom that the rest of china has never been able to enjoy so hong kong has freedom of speech freedom of the press other freedoms that only it enjoys within china so chinese tourists come there to get a taste of that kind of freedom they go to these banned book stores which offer them insights into
their own country that they can't get what they are inside china
but lamb did something that other books others weren't willing to do he would ship books and mass to his customers in mainland china so that way they didn't have to come to him he didn't have to go to them but he could still get his product out there and
he developed his own methodology his own tricks for doing this so he knew only ship to the busiest courts where these works were less likely to be caught in the huge flow of goods coming into china he will slip false dust cover as onto his book so if official just takes a look at the packet it looks like something
perfectly acceptable within chinese laws but really be opened the pages it's exactly the stuff china doesn't want giving him so he learned how to perfect the system and he said that more than ninety percent of his books made it through
lamb ever been caught for doing this he had he had been caught once in two thousand and twelve he was interrogated for six hours given a warning but by the end of that session they were laughing like old friends and he was let go without a problem
so he essentially talked his way out of trouble yes and he'd always been able to do that he knew how to talk to the officers he knew how to play dumb you know how to crack a joke offer them one of those cigarettes he always had on hand lamb has a certain nervous but radiant energy and he knows how to navigate situations like this it's ben is
profession for years and he's very very good at it but on october twenty fourth twenty fifteen suddenly that failed them

that day lamb was going from hong kong into the mainland and when he tried to pass the custom checkpoint he was stopped an alert when up when he put down his passport and a few officers started pointing towards him
if you officers started surrounding him than a gate in front of him swung open and a whole group of officers came and rushed him into a corner and lamb started asking what's wrong what's wrong what have i done what's happening but no one would answer his question they shoved him into a room and he found himself sitting across from two officers and one
was man named lee we recognize from is running in two thousand and twelve when he had talked his way out of the situation and a one point they were left alone so it's just and lamb and lamb trying to smooth over the situation makes a joke and really just explodes enemy and says how can you be talking about this
part of a special invest in a taskforce we know what you're doing and it's our job we're going to shut down to hong kong elicit publishing seen once and for all and lamb was stunned into silence that was the last thing least said to him
after that meeting with louis in the other official at the custom checkpoint lamb was put onto a train blindfolded handcuffed with a hood over his head and when he got off he was driven for about forty five minutes and move to a facility where it was put into a cell and
told to go to sleep
so he is genuinely confused he's doing what he always does and suddenly he's whisked away and far from home with no idea exactly what his legal status that's right he had been allowed to work as a please into both to get away with skirting these chinese last for a long time
so he wasn't sure but there was one paying that was different
after a mysterious secretive process china has chosen it's new leaders and foremost among them the new party general secretary as expected she jumping at the end of two thousand and twelve shooting pain had become secretary general of the chinese communist party few months later pilots official china
has a new president in march two thousand and thirteen he became president of china so as were looking at this situation with lamb in two thousand and fifteen this is right at the same time that she's paying is consolidating power power in china it began back in november when it became the president of the party the head of the military and now the head of state ousting rivals he's cracking down on
corruption and president changing things anti corruption campaign has purge the party of many of his real or perceived enemies and rival and bringing everyone to heal more than eighty thousand communist party members had been investigated so for some have lost their jobs and others have been kicked out of the communist party
and no one no matter how high ranking appears see from she's purge it was taking down even the biggest names in the party showing that nobody is above his control and that he was going to take down anything that threatened his rule so whether that was corruption or whether that was information and these kinds of books that he didn't want to see
the hands of ordinary chinese it turns out that lamb and causeway bay books they just spent about to publish a book called choosing ping and his lovers which perhaps writing about choosing ping himself touch a nerve like nothing had before
okay
game
once people realize that lamb have disappeared and his colleagues had disappeared all under these mysterious circumstances hong kong exploded in theory
oh
there were protest marches of thousands of people holding lambs picture holding the pictures and names of his coworkers
okay signs reading today we won't tomorrow you and me and people feared what would come next if they can take our books that they can take our people then what freedoms do we really have left
if it unsafe helpless
us is no longer
this is evidence that people hong kong china is not honoring its commitment to hong kong freedom exactly
what to say
oh

and all this is happening in hongkong people protesting lands harassed and leaving notes for him
at the store what's actually happening to lamb lamb doesn't know any of this wasn't happening back and hong kong he has been restricted do is so interrogated every day not given any contact with the outside world any news any information he was watched twenty four hours a day by rotating teams of two men who
talk to him no one would tell him how long it banned there that he wasn't given access to any calendar anything like that but he devised a way to keep track of time he told the new thread off the clothes he had been given and each day who had type one not into the thread to keep track of how long you've been imprisoned and one day
about three and a half months into his detention he was put on a train without explanation and he was moved to a sumptuous sprawling villa called the kyle and villa and he walked into a room and the villa and he saw around a table his coworkers
ebay books
that must have surprised him yes he didn't know what to expect no one had told him anything he had known then the other coworkers had been taken so they were all very cautious they weren't sure what this was if they are being set up why they were being allowed to meet each other all the sun but they sat down to this dinner there were served
of course after course of the vegetables and pork and tofu and under the watch of security cameras in a guard they tried to talk in whatever terms they could about their situation and one of the employees a man named lee bowl with ben coal owner of publishing house that sold its books through causeway bay books
he told the other man just cooperate this is going to be over soon let's just do what they say and the also handed each of the men one one hundred thousand and hong kong dollars and he said that this marked the dissolution of their company that they were out of business and that they should put it all behind them so it seems that in putting these men together in a room
chinese officials thought that this would be a good way to end their company and make sure that ever knew that if they just one along with what was happening they'd be okay
does this mean that all of these detained men including lamb are now free not quite so isn't carriers come back to i'm i may say they've got a deal for him he'll be allowed to return to hong kong if once he gets there needs to go and get a computer from his former boss the man at the dinner who
i told everyone to cooperate oh and bring it back to chinese officials on the mainland and the reason he wanted this computer is because contained information about customers about authors so this was going to be their ticket to figuring out exactly who had been buying the books and expanding the investigation to the mainland
one more thing he'd be allowed to return to hong kong permanently after that but only if he kept working this bookstore and served as a more for the investigation so it keeps selling his books keep welcoming customers that every time somebody bought a banned book it take their information down he'd take photos he keep records and he would turn those over to officials
on the mainland so in real time may be able to know who's buying what and where it's going if you did that a to let him go
so what did land decide to do he agreed instantly he said that after being in detention for that long after being interrogated like that he was ready to cooperate he just wanted to go home so anything he could do to get to hong kong he was thrown to do it he was broken
he formally agrees to this deal offered by the chinese government that's right so then in june of two thousand and sixteen they put him on a train and he heads back into hong kong for the first time since his capture about eight months earlier and he goes to the police station he tells them just as he had been instructed to do that he was find that he can
taken that they should drop any investigation into him and then he followed the instructions again lamb one to leave those house he got the computer and after talking with lebeau in private this time lamb returns to his hotel room and he gets ready to go back to the mainland the next morning with computer and hand to hand it over to chinese fish
channels but he been given a cell phone by his handler so that it could keep in touch with them and they had strictly forbidden him from going on the internet are looking up any information but sitting alone in his hotel room that night he starts searching for his own name and he starts searching for causeway bay books just to see what's happened in these ones that he's been gone and what do you
and the first opportunity it sounds like to do that that's correct
being on the mainland with censorship and with internet controls he wouldn't have been able to find anything anyway so sitting in that hotel room in hong kong it's his first opportunity to see if anyone's even notice that he's missing or what's happened to him and his colleagues at that resonated all any start scrolling your what do you find his
is that chinese government
sometimes
i think is not
it's not need a hong kong is only fight
the page after page of videos and articles and he sees that six thousand hong kongers had bart through the streets chanting his name chanting the name of his book store and his colleagues and calling for their freedom calling for their release this was the first real indication of the reaction in hong kong to the disappear
once is the mood was angry he sees that this story has been picked up all over the world that people are worried about hong kong and he stays up all night just reading and watching
yeah
the next morning he goes to the train station and he's getting ready to go back to them a man he has the computer with all the information in his backpack and he's almost ready to board the train but he stops to smoke a cigarette
and he starts thinking and is
monks another cigarette and he keeps thinking about what he seen and what this means and by the time you finish his third cigarette he knew what he had to do any walked over to pay phone and he called a former customer of his a hong kong legislator named alberto and he said this land when key on the man who's missing can i come in and talk
do i need to tell people what's happened
and an hour later lamb when key was in a room packed with reporters after photographers with video cameras and it seemed that all of hong kong was waiting to hear when he had to set
what's incredible how about this news conferences that lamb was the fourth of his coworkers and employees to return to hong kong but the other three who had come back they had been parity in the same line they said there was nothing wrong we were helping with an important investigation
mainland china that's all i'm going to say i can't talk and lamb suddenly come back and puts himself from the news cameras and lays out in extensive and painful detail his entire ordeal from the day he was captured until the day he found himself standing in front of those cameras narrative what had happened
really
call so lamb and key ended up saying whatever in hong kong had feared all along but haven't been able to put words to it took him coming back and in that press conference to really articulate what hong kong it feared all along
and what happens after lamb holds this extraordinary and news conference well pretty much everything he expected to happen which is that his coworkers denounced him they said he was lying anyone connected to him on the mainland said that he had been tricked that this was all a ruse some of them were arrested including his girlfriend and them
mainland who who denounced him and was briefly interrogated for her role in bringing these ban books over his girlfriend publicly denounced as that's right his coworkers his friends his girlfriend he was ostracized so and presumably at the behest of the chinese government that's right so even as he becomes something number here
within a hong kong for speaking up and for putting into words what people had always suspected that personal cost was pretty immediate and pretty clear
and what about the bookstore causeway bay books what happened to that and i guess to the larger industry and ban books and hong kong in lambs absence the books had and bought by a man surname chan who immediately closed it so the bookstore was shuttered still there
and if you peek inside you can still see some of those dusty shelves in some books on tables but it's been closed ever since he was taken he's hoping that someday it'll come back but if you look at the larger publishing industry and what's happened since lamb monkeys disappearance and return that seems unlikely because law
i'm with keys case was not isolated it was actually just a harbinger of what was to come for the wider industry the banned book industry is in freefall people won't publish people don't want to read it people don't want to be associated with it because to them it's not worth the risk
space for dissent or contention used to exist before shooting pain it's closing if not gone already both within china and now it seems in territories connected to china or even with chinese people overseas anyone who might be stirring up trouble anyone who might be trying to crack
that perfect image that the chinese communist party and choosing been put forward about their rule that person is seen as a threat that information is seen as a threat so anything inside china or out that tells a story that china doesn't want people to hear that's no longer safe

oh thank you very much appreciate my pleasure thanks for having me

you
now i'm across the room on the dirty
the come in and give you know his press conference and and i'm going to be with him
going to speak
but she's going to stand by side with a lawyer and it
of going to talk about the create
the
kevin feel in the guy as this case zeal to this investigation was a man who had spent decades preying on women
the drugged and sexually assaulted and a who and evaded this moment it's a day
so far too long
used to celebrity he used his wealth he used his network of supporters to help him conceal his friends now we really know today who was behind that act the real bill cosby was anything
scared
our money
kurt and you may be many
to go
so we hope that this case sends a strong message that the victims of these types of crimes can come forward and be heard on what happened to them
you know
back in the bible
than half of our office
we are
sorry
four
what happened
but
we got a chance to make up for it can
hopefully have milton yeah
a work
oh
it would encourage it
or emotional about
that people recognize that kind of courage like this late
think she showed carefully she stepped off she went forward and and and we got to the right result and and she stayed through this she didn't she didn't have to start down this journey with us she didn't have to come here for the first trial she didn't have to come here for the sec
trial but she did you know this is this is the first criminal conviction for a well known figure accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault since the meeting movement essentially it blew open
oh

fourteen years later
may be easy to forget that she was that first courageous person
up in public to go to the authorities and say that bill cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her
her courage or resilience in the face of horrible an unfounded attacks upon her and her family has been so inspiring to a whole bunch
there's been a lot of talk about the idea that the main difference between the last trial and this one
is that the me to movement happened in between do you think that's true
yeah
i what
it out every member
edited it be normal or way
a wait
or fun or to open up a perpetrator or beat normal or away
back
you know i've got it and their weight
what are you up
you remember a garbage bag
why did about game
or girl or the average area
here
your and eight up
i could not look at your waiting your report not look at air going back there perpetrator
look at bear
get an arbitrator actor he raped them
it it not eat normal eight your upgrade
i want to thank jury justice has been
i stand here in the spirit
king said the arc of the early universe is long but today it has bent towards justice we are vindicated we are validated and we are now part of that tsunami of women's power and justice
are not shutting up and we're not going away
get over it i spoke to one of the women after the last for two and accuse bill cosby of sexually assaulting her and i'm sure you spoken to many of them and they were so crushed after that last for they felt like they had and their minds been robbed of justice but also they thought that every other woman had been robbed of justice too
and so i wonder how the reaction today feels in contrast
i mean women
the only one criminal trial
late
to be
a warm
and they didn't get it
obama
do you get the sense that that these women feel as if this verdict even though they might not have testified that this was their verdict too
yeah
we living room
bored and being
i'd been to
england
that record in the morning
what i need to me
coding eight o'clock at night
bit
really what does this verdict mean for you personally agree
a bird it made me a bit your greet her humanity really what are our i'm on it
i regret your
humanity
not only restored my baby in a mad at me ready though
and remember that honor or only leaving my mum will be a book
the jury in the cosby toil found bill cosby guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against andrea constant the judge has not yet said ascendancy with each count carries a
penalty of up to ten years in a state prison
we're back

he was what else you need to know how much of viewer legal work was handled by michael cohen
oh yeah
yeah my overall little tiny little for action but i go
it may and represent me and dumping he represent me like with greatly stormy
you represented me
what i hated i have absolutely nothing wrong with doing a wide ranging telephone interview with fox and friends on thursday morning
president trump acknowledged for the first time that his long time lawyer michael cohen had represented him in efforts to silence stephanie clifford the adult film actress who said she had an affair with trump a decade ago
trump had previously denied any knowledge of the one hundred and thirty thousand dollar painted by cohen to keep daniels quiet
a payment that is now the subject of a federal investigation another gift from the heavens in this case they keep coming out don't know i don't know how our lives
fallen into such good luck in this case but i'm going to take it to shortly after the folks here
clifford lawyer michael as a naughty was asked about the president's disclosure on m s n b c s morning joe what's the impact of that
huge casually damage in admission by the president because according to what he said on air force one a few weeks ago
a thing about the agreement know anything about the payment michael cohen went off and did this on a lark and mr trump knew nothing about it we now find out that that's bogus

right here on the day
see you monday

from the new york times ah michael barbara
this is the deal
today
forty nine questions
the times obtained the list of what the special council wants to ask the president of the united states about what happened
and why
it's tuesday
may first
number one what is your knowledge of calls the general fund made with closely act in late december of two thousand and sixteen
number two what is your reaction to press accounts on january embers flying do thing and in what do you know regarding sally is number four hours a decision made to request the resignation of general i've learned a professor at a meeting with jeans and me on february did you say ankle in what did you do about that
president do attitude general cleaners i learned what he calls or efforts made by reading the intelligence community assessment
number eleven and number sixteen number seven twenty what was special occasions after the january twenty
mice that tell me about these questions that you got your hands what we have is a list of forty nine question that robber mahler a special council wants to ask donald trump about where are these quests
guns come from if you can say these questions were written down by trumps lawyers in a meeting with mahler's investigators in march mahler really wants to sit down interview trump trump actually wants to do the interview as well
but the president's lawyers at the time led by john down thought it was a very very bad idea
and what was going on was that mahler's folks were trained get down to come along and agreed to let trump do the interview
so what happened was his they brought down over to the special counsel's office and they said look here are the questions we want to ask and they started rattling them off
down the other lawyers their took it down and created this document these forty nine questions that they knew mahler wanted to ask trump
it was an effort and transparency and never did trying to win them over for the interview now you have to understand is that dowd looks at these questions and says this is not good this is not a good thing for the president this will put the president in a very difficult spot he doesn't have the
confidence in the president to give the interview without making a false statement are going off on a tangent
dad tries to make that argument realizes the president is not going to listen to him that the president wants to do the interview and down says i can't have a client that's not going to listen to me i think him going in as a terrible idea
i'm going to resign he leaves a team
so let's read these questions how do you break these forty nine inquiries from the special counsel down how do you organize them
the lawyers terms lawyers broken into four categories
general mike flynn
the former national security advisor who was fired less than a month into trumps presidency after it came out that he hid misled the vice president about the nature of his calls with the russian ambassador during the transition get every one category to call me former f b i director james call me the third
third category
is the prisons relationship with his attorney general jeff session
the fourth one is about russia
connections between trumps associates in russia
if you step back and look at it it's interesting because what began almost two years ago
as a counter intelligence investigation into rushes meddling in the election and ties between trumps campaign in russia
is focused almost as much if not look three or four categories on obstruction
let's start with the first set of questions about michael flynn what is the focus of those questions
flynn questions are fairly straightforward and arrow along the lines of questions that have been out there in the public since flynn was fire in february of two thousand and seventeen what did trumped know about flings calls with the russian ambassador how is the decision made to get rid of flynn
one that stood out at me with question number eight which said after falling resigned what calls or efforts were made by people associated with you to reach out to general flynn or discussed flynn seeking immunity or a possible pardon
this gets it his story that we had written last month about how the president's lawyer john god had discussions with flings lawyer about a possible pardoned right well the question is was the president or his associates her lawyers trying to use a pardon to
stop flying from cooperating so here you have mahler in march telling trumps lawyers about this question even before we made a public in april showing then mahler knew about it before we publish the story
let's turn to the second bucket james call me call me what the questions are under the same ones that we have saw did trumped ask call me down the investigation what were his motivations did that happen why is it that trump asked call me for his loyalty
dinner what were the president's motivations behind this war we're all of those trump call me interactions about we've obviously heard a lot from jim call me right out how this went down in how he saw it all but mahler wants to know mr president what was the purpose of the january two thousand and seven dinner meeting you
had with komi was loyalty disgust did you communicate with comedy concerning his status at the end of the dare those are the questions them mahler wants to ask trump to understand his side of this right so much of this is about true men and a room and we've always had that his element
factor and so now we finally get the other person's take flights but mahler's also saying okay what did you mean regarding your statements to leicester hold about call me in russia this is the famous interview that trump gave to leicester whole right after he fired call me in which he said he had rush on his mind when he did it right what does he mean by that
correct in what was the purpose of the may twelfth tweet they call me better hope there are no tapes that is the tweed they call me says led him to have his friend leak the memo about the february fourteenth interaction the oval office when call me says trump bass in the end the fun investigation so mother wants to know what present rotten
meant when he wrote that tweet correct okay so that's one two three was about attorney general sessions what are those questions emphasizing from other the long tortured relationship between the president and his attorney general jeff sessions
what did you thinking what did you do regarding sessions is recusal disease in february of two thousand and seventeen there's reports out there that sessions may not have been forthcoming with congress about his meetings with russians during the campaign the president goes nuts as the white house counsel dawn began
try and lobby sessions not to recuse himself
the president looks at the person running the justice department is someone who should be loyal to him that the most important thing to him he's very upfront about that
the question mahler's trying to get at here is what is it that was motivating the president to have someone so loyal to him run the investigation did you have any discussions about whether the age he was going to protect him what efforts did you make to try and get him to changes
minding reverse about to accused or and what of these questions from mahler about eight sessions or do they driving at legally and and that's totally what the question is was trying trying to replace sessions to get someone in place who would and mahler investigation would it be someone that would
not be were cues from the investigation and one new guy actually oversee it and could do with the president wanted with the russian investigation right and this is an ongoing situation because jeff sessions remains attorney general and his estate to recuse himself from the russia investigation and all that has happened as a result of that continues to infuriate the president it is
in issue that has not gone away and it has been something that people around the president around sessions say all continued to get worse if the russia investigation intensifies the fourth and final bucket fourth and final bucket russia question good old fashioned collusion
the original question of the investigation interestingly mahler wants to know about the two thousand and thirteen trip to russia this is this trip trump took to moscow when he on the missed the universe pageant they had the miss universe perjury in moscow what communication or relationships do you have with the aga laura
you were paying trump to have the miss universe pageant in moscow in any russian government officials there were discussions did you have during the campaign regarding any meeting with vladimir potent what discussions did you have during the campaign regarding us sanctions towards russia
what involvement did you have and the communications strategy regarding the june nine thousand and sixteen trump tower meeting in the release of dawn juniors emails concerning the same this is how did the white house train explain the june two thousand and sixteen meeting when don junior sits down with the russians promising dirt on hillary clinton right
what interaction and communication is that you have with michael cohen whose office in residences were raided in manhattan
earlier this month is part of an investigation into his work for the president cutting deals with women who had made allegations against the president and a guy named feel like seder and others including foreign nationals regarding real estate developments in russia during the period of the campaign
another one which is sort of a central question of the entire russia investigation what knowledge good you have of communications with the regarding roger stone person's associated with roger stone julian assigned your wiki leaks the question being what did the president no of the release of the russians emails they had hacked from democrat
did the president know anything about there
and this final line of inquiry is as you said mike about that sort of foundational question of the mother of investigation which is russian meddling and the election
a subject that has of course expanded a lot in the months since the investigation began i'm struck that this final set of questions is much more fast paced what happened
what did you know when did you know it or as all the other questions in the first three categories about what's happened since the campaign are much more about the president's motivations and feelings this comes back to a discussion john down had with robert mahler in one of the meetings about
the interview
john god says look will answer all these questions for you will given que and writing you need this information we will give it to you
in mahler says i need to question the president to know whether he had criminal intent what was behind the decisions what was truly motivating they're looking at how the president pulled the lever of power since he came into our
office how did he wield his power why did he wields power legally the president can replace his attorney general he can replace his f b i director he can even trying and in investigation of you thinks it's a real problem for the country
but the question is what or the motivations what was the intent i'm curious though when it comes to a federal investigation it's easy to prove that someone is lying about whether something happened right either a did happen or it didn't happen and the person was honest about or they warn isn't it hard to know if someone is telling the truth about how they
fell about what their motivations are can't they just inherently fig that because we can't know someone's head will you touch on one of the difficulties year proving and ten is one of the most difficult things prosecutors investigate and unless you have someone at the time seeing yes the president told me i did
this because of acts
in the person can hide their intent if you did something and never told anyone your intention no one will truly know why you did it and will mahler saying is then i need to question him directly about that simply getting written responses to this is not enough i need to understand directly from him why he did
did the things he did
at this point does the president planned to sit down with mahler's team and answer these forty nine questioned and any other questions they have the president wants to sit down and do the interview and the president has lawyers now that will go along with that john down was not one of those lawyers and that's why
would i do you think anything changes for the trump team or the special councils team now that these questions are public because of your reporting
no i don't i don't think so
maybe they can send me answers to the questions would be good or a better idea
our colleague matter puzo had was trying to get me to interview trumpet only ask the forty nine questions that isn't intriguing maybe a good prop open golf course and say hey and hope that he says yeah i can do the interview
finally my whiny you think that these questions are being made public now i recognize that's a tricky question for you since you are part of the recording process making a profit but why do you think that someone even if we can never know who would give you these questions to make them public i think there's a lot of people in washington
who are our nerve by the president and believe the more sunlight and attention that anything related gets is going to be something that is good
and they feel bad pushing information out he is a way to do this and to keep the public's focus on the issue bud light bulb mahler i don't know everyone's intentions and was this more or less what you expected these questions to be a questions that mother would be that we were
kind of sort of laughing about him a bit thing
these sat us down and say hey come up with forty nine questions they asked donald trump about the rush investigation they probably be very similar to learn a ton new here but
the depth and breadth of it is deal something that strikes me you sort of cover this story different angles and narratives pile up and then you can have a bank in your readers go wow there's a lot of questions about the president's time and office and of stuff that went on and the campaign
doubt we still don't know the answer to that the president still has not answer
and we still don't all the why correct
you know sometimes the truth takes so long time for us out
twenty six did you have a discussion about whether he directly the purpose of wasn't even sure if you don't mind going to have a nice it out
national cancer
he says she has raised
three
give us a losers an obsession
the two thousand and thirteen
our town meeting real estate development and in russia or any meeting with me
yeah
he like
thank you mike
thanks for all be right back
here's what else you need to know
tonight we will present the world never before exposed information
on the television achievements one of the biggest israel
no in a theatrical televised presentation on monday night
the prime minister of israel benjamin netanyahu accused iran have repeatedly lied about its nuclear program just days before president trump is set to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal with it
going to show something like a world of never seemed to an art gonna review no conclusive proof of the secret nuclear weapons program
iran has been hiding for years from the international community
and it's a comment on netanyahu presented viewers with a massive archive of records stolen by israel from a secret warehouse in toronto that he suggested undermined the nuclear is what the files and crowded
nominated and documents
prominent in charge comment
president urged me how many parents
edit photos
and video
but netanyahu did not provide any evidence that iran had violated the terms of the nuclear deal since it went into effect
raising the possibility that his real goal was to give president trump rationale for pulling out of the agreement later this month
as trump has repeatedly threatened to do in response iran deputy foreign minister called netanyahu's presentation quote very childish and a prearranged show with the aim of impacting trumps decision

that's it
i'm like obama seat


from the new york times ah michael barbara
these are they
today
detective pong balls was on the verge of retirement having never solved his decades long mission to catch the golden state killer
then he had an idea to upload dna evidence to a genealogy
it's forty before
how i want to start at the beginning of your career what were you doing so nine nineteen ninety four i became a deputy sheriff criminalist with the contra costa county sheriffs crime lab and what does that mean
i would be out a crime scenes analyze knows crime scenes collecting the evidence bring in the evidence back and performing the laboratory work in order to try to figure out what that evidence meant to try to solve the case
the lab that i worked in had this amazing library of old old textbooks and old old forensic science bookie but there was this file cabinet tucked away in the corner it wasn't labeled it was just a plain for draw or file cabinet
so i decided well what's in here and i started pulling open those drawers and in the bottom two drawers where the series of manila folders with the tab on the folder labeled with this red e a r e a r e a r e or what is this this is weird look and so i learned opening up these folders
and in each folder was a case file
i started reading nice case files and recognized that this was documentation of a series of rapes that had occurred predominantly in the east bay in rancho santa the gal in walnut creek is said to be one of those areas where you could safely leave your doors unlocked when you go out to walk
the dog at night but to recent rapes said at least temporarily changed that attitude rapist
moved into contra costa county in october striking three times and just over three weeks trying and conquered want in san remo saturday night be pried open the back door and entered the bedroom of a thirty two year old and on this east area rape a series that one ear stands for bed is exactly what year stands for many of those involved with a k
say the east area rapist lives within the area where he operates that he picks up on blocks and homes within neighborhoods jumping from one to the other the police have one last bit of advice and that is don't panic because that alters your judgment and the way that advice goes at anyone in the bay area not just the people have conquered because with this guy an extra
could be anywhere it wasn't just in contra costa county or the east hey this guy was up in sacramento and down in stockton and then he came out to the east bay residents are restrictions on women general
a sleepless nights after a few nights they feel is really need a good night's sleep and and i don't know who have actually done it sound
just out of fear i believe so we had fifty attacks that had occurred between june nineteen seventy six and july of nineteen seventy nine all over northern california by late fall when the east area rapists began planning two and three victims a month citizens began buying everything they could think of to protect
themselves
local burglar alarm distributors report a run on alarm systems with technicians backlogged four days in an effort to keep up with demand but we lost track of them he just disappeared back in nineteen seventy nine

and at that point in my career i was absolutely fascinated with serial predators and cold cases and so those east area the series just hit home with me as i need to look into this and what i ended up doing

in nineteen ninety four
new fangled dna technology was coming into play and it was so much more powerful even though this was an early early form of the technology was much better than what we doing so i thought you
see if i can track down some evidence then see if i can use the dna technology to try to solve the series
since the statute of limitations had passed usually what happens with law enforcement property rooms is there's the destruction process where they no longer have to hold onto the evidence because the cases done it's a beauty gated so they go through a routine process of destroying evidence in
to make room they can't just keep everything forever as a routine aspect
fortunately the original investigators and laboratory staff that were involved in this back in the nineteen seventies recognized the seriousness of this offender and put non destruct orders on all east area rapist evidence in the property room contra costa
county sheriff's office is the only agency in northern california that did that so that was the only evidence
so i found three sexual assault kids also called rape kits from three of the attacks and contra costa county and was able to get dna evidence from all three cases at this point
i need to find some suspects to compare to this dna profile
and that's when i turned the to one of the original investigators and see if you had any prime suspects and what did he tell you he said you know though we don't have any prime suspects we always thought that this guy went down to santa barbara and possibly committed and attack down there
may have killed somebody down there
well now i kick into investigative mode by decided around on a call of santa barbara and ask them i spoke with a detective their saying no you know none of our cases are related they don't sound similar at all but you might want to call up irvine
that detective said yeah you know we've got two cases that we got the same dna from the victims
so he referred me to the orange county sheriffs crime lab to talk to the analysts are about the dna that she had but different lads were using different technologies it hadn't been standardized yet
we do a direct comparison it took us four years to get the new technology in place
so i ended up assigning a dna analyst to do the new dna technology he did
and few hours later he walks into my office
monotone way said so we've matched your samples to some homicides down in southern california
that things like a very big deal
oh now that's huge so they only knew him down south as the original night stalker
this was a merger of this east area rapist and northern california and the original night stalker down in southern california
and he became known as the golden state killer
okay see you need this huge discovery what do you do next how do you pushed this forward and try to solve the case i'm now actively communicating with the lead investigator for orange county sheriff's office larry pool
i am sending him everything i have access to the case files the evidence the photograph and we also ensured that the dna profile was put up in the f b i d dna database but the search didn't result in any identifications so it was obvious that the guy we were looking for just wasn't in the database and
this case centrally goes cold again candidates for like a one step forward two steps back thing where you you've had a big breakthrough and yet it seems like the case hasn't really move forward much at all that's exactly it
you see as the you know this case was moving through the decades there would be flurries of activity and then it would just die off and you push away i pushed away from this case multiple times going i think i'm done i just can't do this to myself anymore
yeah
he were starting to taking up hope when i would push away eventually you get that toga back to the case then i'm back for boar and i had established relationships with multiple victims and having seen in person the trauma that they still lived with to this
day you know there was an obligation to continue
kind of spurred me into my last phase of this investigation in terms of sitting in my office in two thousand and eight two thousand and nine and i'm working at the file drawer that contained all those original cases with the red eat a are on
i've got to start looking at that case again it's unsolved let's see what i can do and since that moment in time ten years ago i have been working this case twenty four seven three sixty five my office gets transformed into a war room on the case and so i have
maps for the attacks occurred pin to my wall i've got suspects he had their their photographs pinned to my wall my computer screen is constantly on one of the case files that i'm trying to read so somebody walking into the room would go now he's working the case again

we'll be right back

what's the next big thing that happens in he's so that's when i decided i need to do something different to advance this series and identify who this guy was and what wasn't that you decided to do differently
i decided to pursue looking for relatives of the offender based on the offenders dna
so how does that actually work
this technology using relatives can you walk me through it initially we have to be able to generate a dna profile that is compatible with upload into just an open source geological database
once we got that and searched that database we got a list of distant relatives and when we reach a group of individuals that meet the criteria that we know about our offender he was likely born between one thousand forty and nineteen sixty we know he had a sacramento connection
and those individuals end up becoming somebody that we will look at hand as we develop profiles of those individuals we start assessing which ones rise to the level of getting a dna sample from to compare to the offender can just make sure i understand you already have a dna profile
have a suspect
you are familiar with the fact that there are now databases all over the place that allow people to put their own dna profiles and to find relatives long lost cousin his grandmother's grandchildren that tripe
that's right and he realized that if you combine these two if you put the suspects dna profile into one of those genealogy websites or services that up my pop relatives which is the point of those sites
that's right so to essentially you have to create a fake profile and attach this dna information
create an undercover profile pardon me
is there an ethical question around that undercover take whatever want to call it of have uploaded a person's information you know under the pretense of law enforcement work rather than private citizen there's plenty of case law that allows law enforcement to pursue undercover activities to affect an investigation so this is
something that is lawful is something that is this frequently done within just about any type of the best vacation
and how narrow does the pool become as you keep investigating it became very narrow winnowed down to roughly five individuals to we're not really strong at all
and then we had one that we were able to lemonade and then we settled in on this town
side of the family you down to two members of the same family
yes
and so what do you do with these two potential suspects this
point we're looking at these two individuals one was not lining up at all in terms of his physical bags and terms of his height weight is complex and was not consistent with what we understood of our offender and so he fell in terms of priority and then we ended up folk
pissing in on the last individual
i've been on this case now for twenty four years
and my retirement date was coming up so i look at this individual i started talking to people who knew him back in the day and as i talk to some individuals
he became interesting enough to wear on my last day
hi drove up to his house i drove from the bay area up to sacramento area and parked in front of this guy's house
on my mind i'm looking at this going what's the likelihood he's actually guy it's probably not the guy i should just go knock on his door introduce myself to my typical say oh i'm just here to work and to an old case and you know do you mind if i ask you some questions and establish a rapport and then eventually asked for a dna
a sample and then move on and show he's not the guy but then i i just stopped
i don't know enough about him
and decided not right now and drove away
he said this was your last day of work at this stage when everything is kind of coming to a head you you decided to retire that's right and that was leading up to this that was such a tough decision to make that how could i retire in this cases unsolved
and as i told people during this time frame some of the victims that i even communicated with during this time frame as i'm retiring from the job on not retiring from the case so how does the team continue to pursue the sky and are you just kind of hanging back and letting them do their thing
no
i really had no change in terms of what my role was with the team i just don't change to a private email account and we were still communicating as if i were active so the f b i and sack sheriff's office formed a surveillance team and followed this individual around
around and i received a phone call they had actually recovered a discarded dna sample from him and the lab at analyzed it and whoa what does that mean a discarded dna sample so when when we're trying to get dna from somebody and we don't want them to know that we can follow them around and if they leave
leave their dna in a public location it's something we can collect and have analyzed and it may be chewing gum it may be the saliva from a drinking straw could be clean acts there could be you name it if they've left it we can grab it so that's what happened is there was a sample color
did during the first part of the surveillance and the lab tested the results and that's when i received a phone call while i was at p have changed
what are you doing a pm change i'm enjoying dinner had just put an offer and on a house
and your retirement home
my retirement home and yes exactly
so i excused myself and i went outside and that's when i had received a call telling me that the results came back couldn't tell a soul
but the results were consistent enough to say that this guy joseph de angelo was likely the golden state killer

an arrest team had been put in place just waiting for the dna results
and then when we got the dna results mid afternoon
and had an arrest warrant signed by a judge the team was already in place watching de angelo and then at a certain point the team leader
sees an opportunity to be able to take de angelo in custody
and he just basically told them go and then it's a silence
and then about a man and and a half later
he says suspect in custody
and then the war room he wraps at that point
there as high fives are looting and hollering because for so many years we finally got him
paul you you know this
you have been drawn to the power of dna throughout this process started out your career and you understand it's potentials
but in the time since you've been in messiaen his case we as a culture and society with kind of better understand that the any potential and we've seen how powerful it can be and a lot of people are wary and even scared of what we've learned about the power of dna and i don't want to you a little bit about those
concerns there are people who are beginning to understand that story and to look at it and say that it's wonderful that you him but at what cost and what do you say that well i think first one when i think about it for people who are scared i try to
those fears in terms of we aren't accessing anybody's actual genetic information we're just seeing how closely or how definitely related some people are too who are fender might be the thing about pursuing this stretch
prodigy is that everything we're doing his dna based in our investigation is driven by dna which we know is a solid science there was only one person that we had to go and talk to and get a dna sample from through this particular strategy
versus the thousands of tips that have come in because somebody looked like a composite drawn back in the nineteen seventies or because somebody was an abusive ex husband or boyfriend or even we had tips come in where somebody just was mad at a person and decided they were going to call them in because they want
fall under suspicion by this investigation it's almost like a form of swat he he using this is less invasive than that it's very much less face of we gather dna from hundreds and hundreds of people because of the tips and because of circumstantial evidence within the case file i absolutely
understand people's fears about privacy and fears of how this dna is being used by law enforcement but it's not what their visualizing it is very innocuous in terms of what we are actually able to see and it's obviously very powerful
i guess that's a little strange to think about as i reflect on what we've been talking about is that my aunt's decision to italy go on a website and upload her dna might eventually implicate me in something and get me sucked into the criminal justice system in a way that i never signed off on i never on website and
about it at the same time you're aren't could call and the police and say you know my cause it's kind of a strange guy why don't you go investigate him as the golden state killer which happens thousands of times in these types of the metal nations
so you're out of control no matter what right
i do think the academic debate and the societal debaters important and healthy
from the law enforcement suspect of hope to be able to see utilized so that we can get these types of monsters off the street
but i fully understand that there may be some sort of brackets put on how this technology would be utilized moving whore
paul thank you very much appreciate it
now has been my pleasure



here's what else you need another day in a series of tweets on thursday morning president trump confirm that he had reimbursed his long time attorney michael cohen
for the one hundred thirty thousand dollar payment he made to stephanie clifford a payment trump had previously denied knowing anything about the president's do legal advice rudy giuliani had first disclosed a reimbursement on fox news wednesday evening saying that it proves the payment did not
present and illegal donation to the trunk campaign because the money came from trump himself not caught
why the president of the only yeah
still happen
why the president was not sure either
during a news conference at the white house on thursday afternoon press secretary sarah huckabee sanders was asked why the president had previously misled the public about the as mayor giuliani stated and or a free back to his comments this was information that the president didn't know at the time but eventually learn
sanders said she herself was unaware of the president's role in the payment until she her giuliani announce it on fox
when the president so often says things that not
president of white house show what appears to be a blatant disregard for the truth how for the american people to trust
one set by the president we give the very best information that we have at on i do that every single day and will continue to do that every day i'm in this position

special thanks to sam donate the cable bouchard david crackles stella tan and fitzsimmons and jennifer camp
that's it put the daily i'm michael barbara
a reminder that tomorrow will bring you the third chapter of our new series caffeine
right here on the daily
see you monday

from the new york times ah michael barbara this is the daily
today
the cia is waging an unusual campaign to make gina hospital it's next leader despite her polarizing past why agents their see her most controversial quality as her greatest asset
it's tuesday me
john thanks your being and hair
honor and pleasure to be too i realized it's not often that you sit down with the new york times nodes not one of my preferred activities
adam goldman who is john that jon benet was one of america's top spies the also was in charge of our national contests time service the spire armor
hey when president obama ordered the raid on the summer bin laden compound and pakistan in two thousand and eleven
so how unusual as the someone of bennett status especially in such a clandestine world sits down and talk radio on the record in front of a microphone
it's something he has rarely done since he left the agency in two thousand and thirteen and fact i've tried to contact yeah huh
and he is now responded to then why is he talking to you now
like any good by john has a mission
he wants to get the word out about jena hospital who's been nominated to be the director of this yeah
and what do we need to know about can ask
i think it's important to know about you know as ball that she is a highly respected case officer who joined the cia and nineteen eighty five
he's been running a aggressive campaign get the word out about her they've been relying on twitter news release is giving information on reporters are brin month a stories about her and part of this public relations campaign is getting former agency employees people like jon benet to talk to reporters and why would they
have you do that or want to do that why do they need to get out the good word
hondas cia official
because there's really only one story that's been told about jena hospitals history
and that story is about a role running a black site where and are kind of suspect was tortured him and her role in helping destroyed tapes of these torture sessions
it has both seen as a very competent case officer prior to nine eleven choose the deputy station chief in ankara turkey but after nine eleven she began working and counterterrorism center it was a little sleep be prior to nine eleven but after nine eleven
it was infused with the agency's best talent and billions of dollars and to counterterrorism center was in fact in charge of waging war against al qaeda and interrogating detaining suspects
the prisons around the world
what do you know adam about has both specific war in the counterterrorism center after nine eleven i know when she joined a she was put in charge of surveillance teams while doing their job
i asked her to go to thailand to be what is known as a base chief she was actually put in charge of this secret prison in thailand which is about two hours outside of bangkok
it was an infamous side there were two individuals brought their one and now para suspect name ability of beta and another al qaeda suspect named up email machinery is debate was water boarded eighty three times at this site at this site the first go to a prisoner to be water boarded was abu
debate these enhanced interrogation techniques were designed to break the prisoners as a beta was to be the guinea pig abuse data repeatedly water boarded became completely unresponsive with bubbles rising through is open foul mouth he actually had to be resuscitated he actually died
on the water board wow but was revived both robot correct and after he was water boarded an exposed to these harsh interrogation techniques it's my understanding that has arrived and she was there for about six weeks and while she was running this secret prison and assure you he was born three
times and also exposed to some of these very harsh techniques
i don't know anybody who joined a to run interrogation center it's not a job we were trained for it's not a job we had the experience for but it was a job we were asked to do in the moments of greatest uncertainty and anxiety in the aftermath of nine eleven
so gina and others did their duty
as it was defined for them at the time i think bennett like many people in the cia realized that they needed to take action and had to be robust and they needed to take the fight to al qaeda that the thinking then they could be possibly facing another devastating and terrorism attack
they don't want that to happen
i thought they were certainly unprecedented in extreme measures but it was an extreme situation and franklin delano roosevelt interned thousands of little japanese americans abraham lincoln suspended table
corpus joan adam shiny alien and sedition acts american presidents when they've been faced with an extreme thread who'd taken extreme actions which often times in retrospect were seen as incompatible with our core values so i think this probably falls in that category it was an extreme reaction to an extreme event
when a personal level is something you would have taken part of his just something you would i would have carried up my duties as they were defined at the time
what a what a little harder to find that inbox water boarding i think that's where you get over the line
and why is water boarding the line that for bennett and maybe for others
cannot or should not be crossed what is it about water pouring water boarding itself simulated drowning so you're actually creating that sensation of drowning of death and that itself under international law is prohibited
bennett is saying is that he's conflicted about some of these tactics and least when it comes to water boarding do we know whether haskell is similarly conflicted about what she is doing during this post nine eleven period
one of the mysteries of passport what she thought at the time and what she thinks now has posed never spoken publicly about her time in this backside about her time overseen water boarding we don't know from has bowl or self whether she thinks this is in fact wrong but better
and i talked about that and i would say the fact they said gymnasts pool given her sound judgment in her balance emotional balance i think she if you're going to have that type of facility that's exactly the type of officer you want air not somebody who is a zealot or somebody who
has lost their perspective on what it is therefore i think it's unfair to assume that is somebody who's an advocate for water boarding mean that was one of the tools that was legally available at that site but it's not a tool that she invented or advocated so he saying that a hospital was brought their because she's
not somebody who's viewed as embracing the harshest possible tactics after nine eleven to deal with suspected terrorists i think she's brought their because she wasn't going to let things get out of control remember that individual who is water boarded under her time was only water bought it three times now for him
each one is an eternity but the previous individual albums a beta was water boarded eighty three times that didn't happen under her watch there is somebody describe get a job there as clean up and close up which they did in december of two thousand and two after thailand she returns to the counterterrorism center
langley virginia and she takes up a job as deputy to the chief of operations pushing rodriguez who is running the counterterrorism center that time thinks highly of her and what does he do he plucks has bowled to be his chief of staff and while he's running that clandestine terrorists which is a big
job and it's a signal to the rest of the building that has ball is highly respected and she's gone places she's she's going to move up the ladder after this to she has promoted after this work and thailand it sounds like correct and what does haskell do as chief of staff to rodriguez well know most notable thing that
haskell did his draft a memo that jose rodriguez sent to the station in bangkok ordering the destruction of these tapes of people being water boarded thin so to be clear the memo orders the destruction of tapes of people being water boarded including at the bar
aid that has pull herself oversaw correct but there was a problem with that order jose rodriguez was specifically told the white house counsel myers and by john rizzo the act in general counsel
a to not destroy those tapes who do not destroy those tapes
and yet and yet our day felt he had all the legal authority he needed and push the button on that cable and those tapes were destroyed
tapes are no ball jose rodriguez destroyed them they would have been devastating have they ever will become public but he remains unrepentant i am proud of the decisions that i took and green their destruction of the tapes to the will work for me
i have no regrets he had no qualms we made some al qaeda terrorists with american blood on their hands
uncomfortable for a few days
oh we did the right thing for the right reason
and the right reason was to protect the homeland and to protect american lives so yes i have no qualms i can tell you that i fully supported osage decision because i thought was necessary to protect their officers in the future there was no doubt in my mind that at some point in time
this material would get into the public domain aggressive reporters again and goldman would would never have couldn't have resisted the opportunity to oh you're right on that gap in
you know we weren't to protect our officers not just from al qaeda but from the public perception of what they had been asked to do it vanished and gina were supportive of us and russia draft yet well yeah she was she drafted the cable but let's be clear what her role was jewish the chief of staff she wasn't the command
gina had no authority to order the destruction of the tapes nor did she have any authority to counter me and hose a's decision any more than the chief the station who received that cable was in a position to ignore it so i think jose has been very clear and every occasion the he and he alone made the decision to destroy those
tapes
i think most people this order sounds like the cia trying to cover up something that they knew perhaps in their heart of hearts was wrong and destroying tapes
as a student of american politics and history almost always feels like the definition of hiding something when the new york times revealed that in fact these tapes have been destroyed it was a huge scandal what was on the state and war they destroyed and if so by home the tapes were destroyed and after the destruction one of the big issues
is that congress was not notified many members of congress say democrats on friday were calling for an attorney general investigation what happened what do you think was on these tapes in why do you think they were destroyed well if a special the courses at all
called enhanced interrogation technique are depicted tapes
that's very significant because of what it means about illegality of the underlying contact depicted on the tapes and also the reliability of the information that came with the result of health care gate
and there were real questions about whether laws have been broken in fact under president obama federal prosecutors looked at whether a crime had been committed and i'm certain that federal prosecutors interviewed hospital about her role in this and her actions
the right back
what effect adam did hospitals are all in this episode have on her career at the cia wants to torture program became public it certainly seen from the outside like this was a blight on agency was considered a black mark on
hospitals record inside
no in fact her career really took off and better and i talked about that the people who took on the hardest jobs it's the most critical moments were widely respected they weren't seen as tainted a not just you know
asphalt mean people's careers were certainly not damaged by having taken part in our most aggressive progress because those were the priorities
the president at the time and of the agency and we put stuff our very best officers into those programs because if it's your most important priority you want your best people working for
so the fact that hospital and others worked on the torture program it's as i didn't at all prevent them from rising through the ranks that it actually boosted them especially as correct once trump wins the election and becomes president she promptly named deputy director of this yeah which isn't and downright is an extraordinary
job of agency and she's at the highest levels of power and in the united states government's a big job and then president decided he wanted palmdale then director of the guy to become the next secretary of state and now suddenly she's nominated to be the cia director so now that has is a nominee how law me
curse thinking about these experiences that we've been talking about the water boarding at the back side and thailand and the destruction of the tapes documenting this kind of interrogation now that she's up for this far bigger job as these lawmakers prepare for a confirmation hearing on wednesday
hospitals going to face a tough confirmation hearing in particular from democratic senators and some republican once as well and she knows it and they know it and this is what precipitated a crisis on friday when has been one to the white house and basically said
good luck i don't want to put myself through this and the through this and damage both of our reputations
if you're not committed to standing behind me and she had second thoughts and she offered to pull out of this thing and she thought about it and and i think by friday night the crisis had been resolved and she said okay i'm going to do this i'm going to go forward with this and in fact just today on monday she was spotted on the hill walking constantly meeting with senators so the cover
nation is on track what's at stake from the point of view these lawmakers who are going to be sitting across from hospital and asking her these questions for them all what is the point of this hearing
think for some senators it's simply about electoral politics some lawmakers want to send a message to their constituents that this behavior was okay and we supported maybe their constituents actually believe that torture works or this program was effective and then there are other senator senator from california die i'm fine
then who's running for reelection this is her legacy she actually led the investigation into all the bad stuff that happened during this program for others i think they have bigger concerns such as what message and they want to send to the rest of the world
are we going to support and can farm an individual who participated and what many people believe was torture right what message do we send by confirming has power is the next director of
that is the big message and i think our position as the leader of the free world we set the tone and has a of going to react to that they're going to say well i guess is that okay
can you imagine these people these animals over in the middle east that chop off heads sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a heart problem with what about it we should go for water boarding i wish you go tough and they asked me what do you think about water boarded with that dropped by said i love it
and i said the only thing is we should make it much tougher than water boarding it feels like the critical question at house confirmation hearings will be whether as the top official yeah
not just a subordinate anymore she would be willing to walk down this path again because even though she would be running the cia she still answers to one person and that would be the president and this president has himself advocated for the most aggressive forms of interrogation he seems quite comfortable with them
and so would she say yes again now bennett said she wouldn't be the agency down that path again asked to i think she would certainly be the type of director who would not be afraid to tell president this is wrong
it's not smart
and we're not doing it know they might have a new director the next day
but i think she would certainly be prepared to pay that price to do what's right
so a bennett is saying is that if president trump or to ask her to do this but the president might be very disappointed by her answer that and she would say no based on the lessons of this era that's right but that would open up to some pretty were questioning about whether she thought it was wrong and if she thought it was wrong why did she go through it in the beginning
right if it was ok once when she had a very large role and could have stopped it why should we believe that she won't do it again when she's the head of the entire sky
and i think she's probably gonna have to answer that question in various forms of many times when she faces some pretty tough senator
do you think that one of the reasons why jon benet this top spy who talks to no one said yes to your area
always to deliver this very message that hospital would be a check on the president that she would say no to anything resembling torture yeah i think bennett and others who have spoken to me about has ball day believe that she would be a check on an erratic pressing and right and i think they were
the american public to know that she's a safe bet she's a safe bet in a chaotic time what ben and others would say is she not stopped across certain lines rain you get chalk on your cleats
but you don't go over the line and i think ben and others believe that she will guide emergency through is very chaotic period in american history
have possibly because she wants cross that line because she has so much talk on her place there's no doubt that has ball has learned a few great lessons from being a involved in the interrogation program and destroying those tapes and one can assume hospital doesn't want to remove this moment
thank you
thank you
few more questions what makes a good spy what makes a good case off to me one of the real qualities that you need is an ability to deal with ambiguity because it's a very gray world it's a world where in essence didn't have to just find me
to mean you're dealing with some very in many cases unpleasant people are corrupt people or people you were necessary want to take home for thanksgiving dinner that's not always comfortable so if you're a person who sees the world in terms of black and white good guys bad guys right wrong and you're not there's not an ability to deal with moral ambiguity in turned to the greenest
espionage i think you're going to have a hard time
hospitals senate testimony is scheduled for tomorrow morning

he was what else you need to meditate in a highly anticipated announcement this afternoon president trump is scheduled to declare whether he will pull the us out of a historic nuclear deal with officials familiar with the president's thinking tell the times
he's inclined to scrap the agreement and we impose sanctions on iran despite please from allies including britain germany and france who have argued it would be a major diplomatic air and the attorney general of new york eric schneiderman resigned on monday night
hours after he was accused of physically abusing for women
the women told the new yorker that schneiderman the state's chief law enforcement officer and a prominent critic of president trumps choked and slapped them in a statement schneiderman disputed the allegations but said they would prevent him from carrying out his job

that's it for the daily i'm michael barbara see them

from the new york times ah michael barbara
this is the daily
today
childbirth is killing black mothers and their babies at staggeringly high rates in the us
why their deaths have everything to do with the lived experience of being a black woman in america
it's friday male of it
and they will
the states
yeah
so the same
miss them
variation
in
so some on landrum is a young woman living in new orleans who was pregnant
your about her
gradually increase a little greg during pregnancy
and i met her with her do
watch it out
yeah it's when you know when
he's only twenty three years old has a great upbeat personality but she's also clearly very nervous about this pregnancy
linda via rosa is contributing writer to the times magazine
know my
yeah
like she would say i'm really nervous i don't want to die having a baby i don't want my baby to die just say like if you have a flash pay a man in this way i remember last year
think it's okay but i was out
remember day she just was afraid that she wasn't going to make it because of what happened last time
those scenes
my grandmother is a sense and see because their grandmother mama mama had died recently found out that
beautiful
so she thought it was kind of divine order that she was having a girl she wanted to teach your daughter had a thing she loves music know she had already decided to name or harmony and then you have dylan who is turning seven and what's your other son's name is kay
case or okay
but then during this pregnancy she noticed something different okay with that
see
hey let's say hands
the hurt so may still day
is like shaq pains in a haze way
so the headaches were blinding so much that she was working as a waitress and had to leave that job and so she talked to her doctor about the headaches and he kept telling your well you know just take some tylenol and she complained again the headaches are quite bad and he said just take more tylenol and she wasn't comfortable with that but she wasn't sure
what else to do
so then what happens when you got closer to your due date
when sex and i do day i remember once
it's november and some own is noticing that she's really not feeling that well she's having swelling she still having those headaches that tylenol is not really helping so she goes to her regular prenatal visit with a lot of things to talk about my blood pressure was
in when it was high
any as they just let russia go down
high blood pressure is always dangerous but especially during pregnancy because it can lead to hemorrhaging it can also lead to an abrupt shun which means that the placenta detached from the uterine wall and that's very bad for the baby because the baby can't get the nutrients he or she needs bad for the baby bad for the mother it's like that
for both i was just
may they may me a day and it was fun
next day
nailed the usa
stay in his life addicts how he had a vacation
she was really freaked out and she said watched i do and a doctor said to her well you know you could go up to labor and delivery now and we could deliver the baby and she said well wait isn't too early and he just said well i'm going to be out of town and so i guess is when i could do it or your other choice is just to sit back cause
calm down and try to get your blood pressure down
that just
that area
yeah
but she was also afraid and he was listening to him because he thought he was a good doctor is so when a check it again i assume there is lower
meats and just go home and ito and a father
ages
make sure she don't really do much less than base
babies so she thought okay everything's fine again
so tell me how it happened and like what happened
okay i was laying down wasn't selling
a lay them
really get a while
and they just
it's four days later and someone has gotten much sicker she's very tired she's got boned weary fatigue she can hardly get out of bed
was to them
the analysis like all just
please
she was in the car
but i thought it was no arbor
when
as same way
on the seat and so she ended up actually getting an ambulance and going it was an emergency situation
in there
yeah i mean you
let me down
it's blurry she's coming making they just kept on h
and i felt like a see in the time
it wasn't of says it oh
when i that an air
in a day to check to see if she was free and stuff
when they pay the day
it was that because i kept saying she okay
cage in that way in england
she you know a wow
in any
well the soul
never be there

and then what was your condition like what you probably know now
it is worse
me
sounds like you are most
yeah

what exactly had gone wrong with this pregnancy
so pre clamps here is simply high blood pressure during pregnancy and the symptoms were obvious the swelling the high blood pressure as well as the headaches but it was ignored and it led to an abrupt option that led to hemorrhage and so the hemorrhage almost killed her and actually did kill her baby
alamo there
me so happy so happy now
it was there
come back
i felt it was they you know i wish does she suffered so i don't know what it banks of those the beads
the combat units say wow
bit off a phrase
insist
the
every may
yeah

i tend to think of maternal and infant mortality as a problem from an entirely different era or i tend to think of these problems something that afflict countries that have a lot of poverty i don't think of this happening
inside the united states in two thousand and seventeen two thousand and eight do
well it shouldn't be happening in the united states in twenty eight team
maternal mortality is a huge problem here in the united states we are the only developed country where the raid is actually going up the and then at the same time our infant mortality rate is high it's thirty second out of the thirty five most developed countries wealthiest countries so bad again
is odd and both of these rates are driven by black women what's going on with black women and babies so a black woman is two to three times more likely to die in childbirth or almost die then a white woman and a black baby is two point two times more likely to die been a white baby
this racial disparity is actually larger than and eighteen fifty during slavery it was narrower than when black women were slaves and you're saying that the problem of infant and maternal mortality among black women is so significant that it drives the entire us rate for both
up it drives the rate for both up
and why does this disparity exist how can we account for this difference
i first heard about this in the nineties i was their health editor of essence magazine and we had been told this narrative that infant mortality is a problem a poor black women weren't taking care of themselves and black women aren't getting proper prenatal care either because they are irresponsible or because they just don't have an
access to it but then studies came out that said no actually when prenatal care is equal black women still have small and preterm babies one of the statistics it really struck me was that if you're black woman with a college education and in fact an advanced degree you are more likely to die in childbirth
or lose your baby than a white woman with an eighth grade education oh i did not believe it i was like no that cannot be right
how could this be because the narrative was always oh this happens to poor women who don't take care of themselves and don't get prenatal care but then this study in nineteen ninety two just crash that whole thing apart this had nothing to do with that so then the next bang was okay this is got to be genetic so maybe the
there's an inherited difference that women of african descent have that is causing low birth weight so to me and colleges in chicago looked at black women immigrants who had come from africa and the caribbean so when the women first came their babies weighed about the same as white babies in the united states but then after to generation
the black babies immigrant babies turned out the same birth weights as african american babies which is to say low low low birth weight but you didn't see the same thing in white immigrant women so white immigrant women came to the united states and in those two generations their babies actually got larger so and healthier
and healthier and so then it became wait this isn't about genetics this really is about something else something about growing up as a black woman in america is bad for your baby's birth weight you can come into this country with a healthy pregnancy but your child and their child if you're back
something will happen to you yes it is in any of these other things it isn't poverty it is it irresponsibility it is an inherited and so now we're looking at race and racism the lived experience of being a black woman in america essentially being a black woman is bad for your pregnancy
in america something is going wrong here

the back
so i want to understand how this actually plays out in these pregnancies
reese as a force in an expectant mothers experience
well it happens in two ways the first is what happens in the healthcare system there had been study after study after study from in the nineties more recently that talk about what happens to you when you walk into a medical facility black people are treated differently there was one study that looked at medical students and
they had ideas about racial differences that were not true one that struck me was that black people have much higher pain tolerance than white people so need less pain management which is not true black people have thicker skin again
not true or the idea that our blood coagulate somehow differently maryland medical professionals who have these assumptions these are medical students who had these assumptions and so that is frightening because that's the next generation of doctors and i think those two studies were very eye opening for me at least so what you're describing is a kind of unconscious
but perhaps contrast medical racism guess what's the second way that this plays out the second way race plays out is in some ways more insidious it's more scary but something happens to black women because of our lived experience of being in america
the way it's been looked at by scientists
is about a kind of toxic stress so what of the leading scientists in this area coined the term weathering and weathering means that the body actually age is in a way that it shouldn't be aging according to your biological years because of a kind of toxic stress and she linked the toxic
stress to race in america racial discrimination and this one weathering is very evocative because it seems to describe racism as live day in and day out as a kind of storm that the slowly ravages of body and the body might look more at my seems stable and maybe even healthy
but layers if it had been stripped away that's right
it's the idea that any time something happens to you that makes your emotional the systems of your body breaks up the fight or flight syndrome is protective but if it keeps happening over and over so that your pulse races your heart beat harder your systems change and it's constant and it keeps happening over and over
and over it actually where there's your body
change your system and it makes you more vulnerable to all kinds of illness i guess we think of racism as a societal problem and we think of medicine as a science a hovers above all that but maybe that separation in our minds is a false one
i think it is very false and i think that racism and race is baked into every single thing in our society and medicine is not immune
how you been
they're attacked any anyway
stress
hey
you
we were
just every
max the age
what is the ages
it's
so what happens with some own and the second pregnancy
so with her second pregnancy she is very committed to not letting what happened to harmony happen again
she has a new doctor she has a dealer who is trained as a labor and delivery nurse and who is making sure that she is going to her prenatal care appointments and she's checking in with her and making sure she's taking good care of myself
yeah baby
here here
yeah says a way so she was a little cautious she was superstitious she didn't want to have a baby shower she want to buy clothes for the baby because she just wanted to make sure everything was going to be okay before she really let
her heart open up to the idea that i'm i really have this baby
so this
he never had
they really
you say
this is the way he said
because it it
a
yeah saves his name
and so what happens with this birth so while the doctor said we're afraid of you having a post term baby because this baby wasn't we thought the baby would be coming earlier but he wasn't and so weird
kind of nervous were thinking that by thursday we're going to induce him so this was monday and it was a premise is running a little bit late it was a little bit late so we went to the doctor on monday and she was just getting the usual test just seeing how the baby was and it seemed like the baby wasn't doing so well
his little heart was going any me me me me it didn't look normal on the screen and so the woman who was reading the monitor said i need to call your doctor right away i think we're going to have to take this baby out now she's having the baby today
so she got in her room and they started giving her the potatoes and a medication that induces labor and then about five hours in the pain got pretty bad so she needed an epidural so little to do and i had to step out of the room
when we came back some was not in a good way she was very upset she was clinching your fears she was very angry and this sub zero of course was to make things better better but they gave her an epidural that was more like if you needed c section not just the regular epidural just to alleviate the pain of on labour too much it was too much
well someone was really angry because she couldn't feel her legs which is not how it's supposed to be in this kind of epidural but also we saw her blood pressure going up and we saw the baby's heart rate kind of moving all over the place so much toner she said we've got to get some own calm down and so the tone it was very smooth she started my
massaging her hands and she started saying we just need to something terrible has happened it wasn't right and she had the medical personnel calm and explain and actually they said we're sorry
given how the wrong day has given her the wrong dose she was right
so then about one a m it's time and so a whole bunch of residents come in and then this man who i've never seen before simone had never seen before and he said oh i'm doctor so and so i'm going to the with your baby it was like who is
who is this man so it turns out that black women are much more likely than white women to meet the provider who's going to deliver their baby for the first time during labor in childbirth which has it's own for stress which was really stressful but some of them was way beyond that she was like just get this baby out of me
and then finally someone was just in the zone and she was pushing and latino was at her side saying polish you can do this you got this and i was even doing it to someone pushed the baby out and the baby came out and he was very still
so they put the baby on her chest and i was holding my breath and some mom said is he okay is everything okay and then all of the sudden he let's out this whale and we knew he was okay
encountered some seem in this moment when she's finally holding his newborn it was everything i've never seen somebody have so many emotions it once she was crying she was gasping she was happy she was laughing at everything it was all this pile up of emotions because she survived
and she has this baby and she made it and she named the baby kingston and his middle name is blessed
it's kind of remarkable to understand after everything that you told us here that more senior that's simply surviving pregnancy mother and son
that is a triumph that that is against in some ways the odds childbirth is supposed to be this wonderful beautiful natural experience but for so many black women and so many black babies it isn't

from the new york times on michael barbara
is day
today for his release it's a historic milestone for the jewish state
ferguson's it's the latest portrayal of the palestinian people to views of the relocation of the american embassy to jurors
it's tuesday may fifty
on behalf of the forty fifth president of the united states on america
we welcome you officially and for the first time to the embassy of the united states here in jerusalem the capital of israel
think here
david what's happening in jerusalem on monday
the longer term jared kushner arrived here we could treasury curry were ago america members of congress much better
remember a virtual return from jewish community a joke community and
period her big ceremony marking the movie it's good from tel aviv you to jerusalem david healthy is to jerusalem bureau chief of the dogs
reasons we are melting in a ceremony
remember it's the cell phones now going back to the formation of a third of israel jerusalem was going to be certified and away unto itself as a base create international study it wasn't given to either stock and for israel today which you know increasingly won't be known as the nation's
period of the jewish people to the united states to declare the juice from the capital of israel tend to move come be here you produce food vindication
acknowledgement of what very few has been denied her some time now
ladies and gentlemen please join me now in me and david friedman
it began with the ambassador of united states david friedman who use the former bankruptcy lawyer for president from has an orthodox jew on this exact day seven years ago
almost this exact time
david ben gurion declared israel's independence
just eleven minutes later
president harry truman cause the united states
the very first nation to recognize the reborn state of israel palestinians you remember that time with a very different sort of emotions
may fifteen for palestinians is called back the day it's the way they consider their catastrophe hundreds of thousands of them were expelled from more fled from their homes in what became israel and for them for gay really of morning and through the idea that united states was going to be making their move
on the eve of that particular anniversary was seen by millions quite a provocation seven years since down memorable events almost to the minute the united states slightly takes the next step
step awaited voted upon litigated and prayed for for all these years
a we open the united states embassy in jerusalem
mr
friedman
number of times said he was welcome them to the embassy in jerusalem israel
for many years american children born in israel when they got their passport
those passports would say jerusalem has the city and the country would be left blank mr freeman was making a note and on that away their that this is no more that could be united states to islam a very much a part in matches
part of the state of israel so right from the beginning we have this far right representative of the united states president provocatively claiming that jerusalem is the capital of israel that's right you know the palestinians have always felt that the united states was not exactly a neutral unbiased
arbiter of the peace process they've always had complained that you know israel was an ally and the palestinians always have to compete with that but now they're basically saying work or pretend there's been dispensed with the united states and israel are solidly like just about him the same shoes not just know side by side
and why should we treat the united states as a fair minded mediator can he talks they've responded by walking away from the table and slamming the door
no are looking for somebody else to fit them in december of last year president trump announced to the world that the united states would finally recognized the truth that jerusalem is the capital of israel
we went from my basket a free men to invoke a trunk and jared kushner by moving our embassy to jerusalem we have shown the world once again that the united states can be trusted
we stand with our friends and our allies and above all else we've shown that the united states of america will do what's right and so we have
we've invested a freeman has been really quarterbacking the trump administration's attempted a peace process
i am here today as a proud american and the grandson of holocaust survivors he harken back to his grandparent who had to bribe the holocaust after the war they built a new life in america a beacon of hope a land of limitless opportunity in my office in the white house i keep a photo of them on my desk
to remind me of how high the stakes are when nations fail to recognize right from wrong
and the decisive power america has to tip the scales in favor of the righteous
it was an interesting idea and effect i found myself wondering from when were suggesting that know like his grandparents who put the holocaust behind them the palestinians
really just put the past behind them and move on it is now my great honor to call upon the prime minister of the state of israel benjamin
you know and prime minister netanyahu is your mark green energy to them that i hadn't seen before what a glorious day remember the small ones
there's almost palpable really there is genuine excitement
he talked historically but he also talking very personally and spent the first three years of my life
rude he had lived just a few blocks from the embassy site and recalled walking through what game or fields with his older brother
and being warned don't go too far don't go up where the embassy actually fits now because my mother told me
you can't go any further
this was due to border
it was exposed to sniper for because that would put with them and sniper range from the jordanian side
this is now
the most
pursuit of the most powerful nation on earth
greatest the united states of america
yeah born and making forty nine you know he's just a year younger than the country itself
he's he's he could hurt his own life
life cycle last december
president trump became the first real leader to recruit most jerusalem as our capital and today the united states of america is open opening gets embassy right view and jerusalem
thank you
president trump for having the courage to keep your promise
david is all this happening because donald trump is an office in other words does this reflect a larger shift in the way that americans are thinking about israel or is it all about his administration and its vantage point on this that's the really interesting question i mean what are we talking about are we talking just about
the embassy move every time a recognition of jerusalem as the capital if we're talking about those things i don't think they happen under a different president i really don't but i think you're touching on another question because i'm a little bit more to do with prime minister netanyahu the jewish population and and states is still heavily to the left with federer
many of the things and the policies that has committed guy who's right wing government has been pursuing in israel
have alienated american jews aggravated them made them question their support for israel or made it difficult to defend their support for israel a number of wins and at the same time
now who's increasing so tightly to president shrimp
for democrats united states
increasingly hard cake and david would have on average israelis how did they feel about the relocation of the embassy from tel aviv to do is just as a very divided country politically but he moved the embassy
pretty surprised to learn that he didn't left leaning israelis and politicians really could get behind it for many people the fact that israel alone really in the world had this very recognizable very well established capital city that was denied a recognition that they believed
was going in reading and to have that lifted finally is a really welcome thing there is broad agreement among israelis that to islam should be seen as their capital and treated as such for the rest

he and finally did it was there any knowledge none of these deadly protest at the ceremony today in terms on which is just gets a few dozen miles away yes jared kushner actually good make some note of it just glancing my been other than that
there were appalling and president they were listening to the lyrics of how leah
but it was a very striking contrast to what was happening just an hour's drive away

thank you did television crew me market
all the bad


so devlin we just spoke to her colleague david helping and in jerusalem after the dedication of the new american embassy in there what's going on in gaza as that is happening
well michael it's been put it simply have been the bloodiest day and gaza thousand and fourteen deck and wash covers the middle east for the times today we had fifty five protesters killed on the palestinian side of the fence that that brits gaza from israel and we had approximately two thousand
and four hundred people who were wounded in those classes
either by rifle fire from israeli soldiers positioned on the other side effects or from lesser injuries
here
to be honest i can mostly describe it as it look something like a medieval battleground today where you have a long fence running down the middle you have a long burma on the israeli side that has military post with soldiers inside them daughter along the fence and on talents
inside where the protesters have been burning tires so gears been filled with the inky black smoke
you have skype bombed kite bucks that's right yeah protesters they make these cards that they paint palestinian thugs are emblems own and then they attach sort of crude explosive devices in many cases it might be say a bag of sugar that is soaked and gasoline and then it is attached to a flame device
they set the kite into the air and then as that is burning and has the flaming tail the guy to towards the israeli border and they tried to landed in fields on the other side to set the israeli crops on fire
you have israeli drones that are monitoring or in some instances and appears firing tear gas as well over the area and then you have ambulances that screaming rushing to pick up people has been shot a wounded and then when you push further back away from the front line
you have a whole staging area where families are hanging out where people are speaking to my bones trying to urge people forward and where there is music and food
leaders in the main factions in gaza addressed thousands of worshippers they launch a lot of rhetorical attacks against united states which they described as the great satan
they attacked trump and they spoke about this decision to move the embassy to jerusalem as a great betrayal because of course for muslims and particularly for the palestinians they considered resume to be sacred city and they consider eastern jerusalem to be a place where they could potentially have the capital of a future palestinian state

for many palestinians the declaration by the current administration that it was going to move the embassy to jerusalem really signalled that the americans are no longer willing to play at the rule of being an impartial mediator between them and the israelis no historical struggle and so a lot of the rhetoric that i
heard on the ground today these protests was specifically directed at the united states
gaza is this area that he's been under an israeli blockade for the last eleven years and haven't territory is controlled by the note and group hamas which is by iran hamas has several wars with israel and very destructive that have reduced rubble
large parts of gaza
some of that is now rebuilt but nonetheless this remains a very impoverished place it's also a place that is largely cut off from the outside world all supplies of food medicine cement all the basics are strictly controlled by the government of israel and the people who live here for them it's almost him
possible to leave so so many of the young people i spoke to today who are participating in the protest they have not only never visited other countries in the region most of them haven't even seen israel so for them their view of an israeli or for israel looks like is be limited to the soldiers that they see stand
at the border posts along the fence and right now he very concessions effort to stop them trying to bridge that fence or to come across it
so we've seen through the day people will come towards the fence there will be warning shots then tend to shoot people in the leg but certainly anybody who has gotten as close as the fence seems to be in danger of suffering a lethal shots so there were a number of people were killed at the fence today and who
appear to have been shot in the head by israeli snipers who are positioned on top of terms that over the fence and provide them a few over what's going on
are you surprised by that use of force gunshots especially to the head of people walking up to the fence
i mean the israelis say that this is what is necessary to prevent people coming through and to protect the sovereignty of the country and also to protect the israeli communities that are living on the other side of this fence but you know any palestinian that you speak to will tell you and certainly some international organizations
who will complain that this is a disproportionate use of force when you speak people were trying to go across fence and you say you know what would you do if you actually get to the other side it's hard to get a strong answer and you get the impression that for many people the goal is to breach the fence and to make this kind of symbolic gesture
rather than to get through on the other side because i think most people realize that there is such a heavy military presence all the way along the fence that even if they were to breach it i mean at the very best i possibly be arrested and at worst they will be shot dead but this may be an opportunity for them to win international sympathy to play
in the court of public opinion but of course at a terrible terrible cause disease or with so many people shot and wounded today right even if they were to breach the sense you're saying it doesn't seem like it would really matter the be matched outgunned that this is really about the symbolism of drawing attention to their cause
and perhaps that's really the goal i think that's right has anyone breached defense defense in reality is actually several layers in many places so there will be an electronic then there may be a ditch then to be a high burma on the other son so there have been instances where a protests
truth have pulled back the wire and maybe gotten through the first layer but certainly nobody seems to have gone through the multiple layers and come out the other side and israel proper
some of the protesters i spoke to today they described how they had spent the afternoon
they hadn't gone to the front of the protest they had run the risk of been shot by snipers if they managed to push forward to the fence itself there were engulfed and these clouds of either tire smoke that their own side had created or their engulfed in tear gas that the israelis were firing from the far side
and then one young man speaking to told me about how one person beside him was shot in the leg and other person coming up behind him will shorten the head he managed to avoid all of that but at the end of the day i said what did you achieve and he said well i managed to pull back and number of pieces of wire and then i got through the first layer and i hid behind
a little concrete wall for a while and then i ran back and he said for him that was successful today that was an achievement
at the best the goal is to cut some wire and pulled back a couple of bales of wire and those are the trophies that feel like then you see young people came back from the fence these lumps of wire that they've managed to take out of it but not really put a serious breach in the fence that so
i have to say that seems extremely futile and kind of sad that people who are demanding something so big are going away with something so small
yeah i mean you gotta ask yourself why you were young guys and you would want to take these huge risk your life to push towards the fence knowing that you could be shot down by an israeli soldier on the other side and when you talk to people and you get beyond the the rhetoric and the politics what you really get too often is just this
sense of desperation young people who will say i've never left his territory i have no job i'm living my parents but i'm unable to get married because i have no money and so there's a sort of attitude of people saying well to be honest i don't have much to lose so for me these protests were up option
usually to express myself and even if that involves a threat to my life for the potential of being killed that's the threat that i'm willing to take in order to make this point and trying to project their point of view into the world
funny our colleague david was saying that when the israeli state was recognized seventy years ago this joyous moment for israelis that same day is remembered as a catastrophe for palestinians and it feels like here we are again seventy years later to the day we have these two groups experiencing the same thing
ang the declaration of the embassy as in one case a moment of great joy and in the other as the ultimate injustice
that's right you use left to look at the contrasting scenes on this very small patch of land you know today we you have in jerusalem the ceremony at the embassy and then sixty miles down the road inside gaza you have the scenes of despair of violence and really i think for palestinians even the things that they thought
that they could count on for instance the fact that the us when at least consider holding out the position of the embassy as a as a bargaining chip and potential negotiations with the israelis that has been snatched away from them as well and the decision to move the embassy was really seen as an emblem of what they called that treachery
a deadline thank you very much it was a pleasure to soak to thank you too

in washington a spokesman for president
russia
blamed the casualties on palestinian leaders in gaza where where the reports of continued violence and guys and today
the responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with hamas hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response
as a secretary of state said israel has the right to defend itself
the


huge what else you need to know
on monday the supreme court struck down a federal law that had effect of the band commercial sports betting in most states to the past twenty five years
the case revolved around a nineteen ninety two lot that prohibited states from authorizing sports gambling
who who fears that it could lead to cheating by athletes and coaches but a majority of the justices ruled that the law violated states rights under the constitution
the times reports that as a result of the ruling sports betting is expected to quickly expand across the country


that's it for the day i'm michael see the one

from the new york times ah michael barbara
if the day
today
white house reuters see special counsel robert mother will not indict the no matter what he finds if that's true one year into the investigation
what's that all four
it's frightening made

my tell me about this meeting between lawyers for the special counsel and attorneys for the president so last month rudy giuliani comes on as the president's lawyer in somebody has to defend the president urged my job and he's going to bring an end of the investigate in his mind right is mine and as part of the
that he goes in and meet with mahler and his investigators to talk to them the biggest question being an interview will trump sit down with smaller for an interview in that could be and at least in trumps mine and the reality of that's my job my job is not lean over what the hell out of that what was going on before i got here it's my
job to make the case for the president leonardo it's very it's a very proud of that and go very different now than it was a couple weeks ago
why i got involved the giuliani goes in we i asked him specifically if they if they realized or acknowledge they didn't have the power to and day and both in the course of that meeting the question comes up can the president be in date
mike schmidt covers national security giuliani says no they push mahler's team for a one of mahler's prosecutors says probably not but malo doesn't seine he just sits there doesn't respond
and one of the system said they acknowledge they had to be bound by justice department politics
and according giuliani is telling there's no real answer that given to them in that meeting it's only a few days later and then the next day of the day after they clarified it for jay who was with me as a meeting that they didn't have the power to indict giuliani says that mahler's ninth is call and say we do not believe
the president can be indicted
so giuliani has gone to the special counsel's office in order to retrieve an answer to this big existential question can the present a united states be indicted
and over a number of days the answer comes back that the special counsel does not believe that he can indeed which would suggest that president trump will not be charged with a crime by the special counsel correct my does that just the mother has reached a stage
stage in his investigation where he is determined that the president hasn't committed anything illegal know it doesn't mean that it all it just means that if muller work your find wrong doing it does not believe the criminal court system the place dead every one of the country would go if they broke the
law would be the place for the president to be dealt with but the question of whether the president can be charged with the crime is not settled one there is a justice department policy guidance to prosecutors that the president should not be charged with a crime these power
is in place because the justice department believes under the constitution that in the president would create such a distraction for him it would be such a burden dad facing charges something so significant that he would hurt the president's ability to do his job
because of that can't be charged that's pretty fascinating doesn't that essentially mean in practical terms that the president is above the law know because there is a way under the constitution dad the country deals with the president dad as done something wrong
that's called impeachment
through congress correct
and i'm not afraid to the trial of it you're not i made my mistake
my years ago require i have never happened
never profited from a picture i earned every show where does this department of justice understanding that the president shouldn't be indicted where does that come from the justice department looked at this question under nixon when there was a special counsel investigation and i think too that our country
in my are required
i don't have examination because people have got to know whether or not bear president
and i'm not a crook i burn everything i've got they looked at the question under bill clinton when there was an independent counsel i have accepted responsibility for what i did wrong in my personal life
and i have invited members of congress to work with us to find a reasonable bi partisan and proportionate response and they concluded that the president should not be indicted so this dates back to the previous two presidential investigations that in one case resulted
in a president being ousted from office or for his behavior nixon and a second bill clinton were that almost happened and in those cases the department of justice determined that it as an entity couldn't charge a president with the crime and left the question up to congress
but i want to understand if the president of united states did commit an obvious crime let's outlandish the sun just killed someone
law enforcement under this policy would not prosecute they would hand this issue over to congress well that's the question about this where's the tipping point on this policy if the president was to do something extreme in the moment like the example you laid out would do justice to par
feel the need to allow charges against the president to move forward
in that is why it's a policy it's not all it's not like the constitution says the president can't be chart that's not in the constitution right this is an interpretation of the constitution the way the justice department has tried to figure out how he deals with the unusual standing of the present united states the head of the executive
it's incredibly unique position the most unique position in the country so it sounds like there's enough room for interpretation air that trumps lawyers weren't certain that muller would conclude the president cannot be indicted so why is he showing his cards now by telling white house lawyers that that is
in fact what he believes will i think there's two reasons why mother may have done it the first is that the question of the interview is hanging over the investigation whether trumps sits down with special counsel will trump answer questions to monitor it appears that mother has gone two lanes to try and get the press
getting to sit for the interview in march is investigator sat down with the president lawyers in went through the questions day would like to ask writers were in this case they're saying what the president doesn't have any criminal exposure
maybe that's a way of winning over the president to come in sit for an and saying there will not be so great a cost if you come to this area the other thing is that the president has considered and wanted to fire mahler last june as we reported the president went to
don began the white house counsel and say call the justice department it's time for mahler to go so if your mahler bother probably doesn't want to get hired either mahler probably believes in what they're doing and if the president knows look i'm not going to have criminal exposure on this maybe dallas wages
be that calms him down a bit because here's the other scenario ears flip it around rudy giuliani walks into the oval office and says hey we work with smaller today and he says in dating used on the table and even gas to or so
could be rubber mahler making sure that robert mother remains national council or it could be wrong our say look i'm going to be transparent with you in trying to be up front as possible in i don't intend to do this and what about the president's lawyers why are they pushing muller to say that he won't invade i think the president's lawyers have to
two big problems
they have a client that needs to be kept at bay and told that everything is gonna be okay why don't i just fire mother well i think it's a disgrace what's going on we'll see what happens but i think it's really a sad situation where you look at what happened there many people have said you should fire him
again
they found nothing
the issue with the present in the past year since mother was appointed is the president's loader trying to stop him from firing mahler a fundamental issue in the entire thing we have a horny
on average cloud over my hair and i've been able to do really that cloud mattered now everyone know
and i think did john down in ty cobb the two lawyers that recently left the team were very good english ensuring the president throughout this process that firing mother would only create more problems
yeah shaun
growing on where people in that department
yeah but what can i get another united going on i didn't and i don't have good
maybe out and got i want to not be involved were pretty athletic department i will wait
so most team and the white house lawyers are both saying that muller won't invade the president maybe for the same reason for the trump won't fire mom correct
we'll be right back


okay so now though we know that the avenue of charging the president and through the department of justice special counsel's office is more or less closed let's say that the end of his investigation robert mother finds that the president did in fact commit a crime what does he do
the notion out there in the media and amongst democrats dead mother is going to just send a report directly to congress that he would finish up write a report send it o'connor's it's not that simple
if muller wants to send a report to congress it has to go through the deputy attorney general right rosenstein while just not have the authority to simply give this to congress to allow them to deal with this has to go through the person overseeing the best in this case rad rubenstein rosenstein makes a decision about what goes
to congress in one done in that is why the question of who is overseen the investigation is so important because whatever muller find has to go through the pipe the person in the in between of who's overseeing it at the justice department in this case is rad rose is debbie tourney general because the attorney general
jeff sessions is recused is recused so one option is that more rights of a report sends it to the deputy attorney general who then passes and along congress to act on it or not act i'm leaving it up to garner current do you deal with this we found these issues in regards to the president here's what it is you deal with it so
then congress will die just this report but even then congress's in the hands of republicans both the house and senate who have not shown a great appetite to take action against us president to is there another option for mother to take if he believes the president has committed a crime
the other option mother has his to do what was done under nixon which was to make the president in unindicted coke conspirator and what does that mean nixon was in unindicted coke conspirator in the watergate greek and a quarter
right
her
hormone
among
under water
her his name was not in the court papers of the indictment that was filed he was unindicted coke and spirit or never won or some alias but it came out several months later that he was that person that he
was someone that had conspired with the people who were indicted and that was very damaging to nixon at the time
mahler and the justice department for that matter has the ability to name some one zero now as an unindicted cope conspirator it's highly unusual but there is nothing that prohibited so if muller felt there was incredibly important information dad he had about the president's involvement in a car
that was committed by someone else he could get that information out by making human and and a conspirator and what is the point of making someone an unindicted cool conspirator because it's not like to me is a bunch of people and robbed a bank i'm charging three of them and there's a fourth person new drove the getaway car and i'm not doubting that person but i'm going to
name him in a court filing maybe it's because that person is cooperating maybe it's because that person has provided with something be that person is fled the country or maybe that person is the president states and there's a policy in on the books
of not charging him with the current okay so this is essentially a clever way that would not necessarily involve congress have publicly identifying wrongdoing by the president yet you have to understand what we're doing years we're trying to figure out what mahler may do in a situation that we have rarely if ever
ever seen dad is very unchartered territory legally in were sitting here without the ability to see the world their mother's eyes to know everything he knows to try and figure that out so you have to interpret it in that sense is not like we know here are the roads and such
this is a very unusual thing this is different so what has been the president's reaction to this discovery by his legal team or this concession they've drawn from a special counsel that they won't indict him he's always seemed very eager to have people know that he's not under investigation of these we charge
so is this a relief damn it doesn't appear so at least by what he was treating about today on thursday morning he took to twitter and it being the one year anniversary of bob mahler being appointed the present in training it on that saying congratulations america we are now
into the second year of the greatest which hunt in american history in there is still no collusion and no obstruction the only conclusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite spending have far more money and then following that out with despite a disgusting illegal in ah
unwarranted which we have had the most successful first seventeen month administration in us history by far sorry to the fake news media and haters but that's the way it is so if getting this acknowledgement from mahler that he i've been doing the president was in part about
putting president trump eddie is why is the president and still so upset about this investigation if he knows he's not going to be charged because the cloud still exist
there are still these enormous question to doubt his conduct in office about his campaign
and bob mahler still investigating and he still looking into things in has indeed several members of his campaign
it's not clear where he's headed
thank you very much thanks for adnan



use what else you need to know the trump administration will announce a new on friday
it would cut off federal funding to clinics that provide abortion
or even discuss the procedure with patients
the war which takes direct aim at planned parenthood is a top priority of religious conservatives and is the latest move by the president to impose curbs on abortion rights and chinese negotiators are preparing to offer united states the promise of buying up to
two hundred billion dollars in american goods to reduce the trade deficit between the two countries
and fuse president trumps frustrations with china's trade policies
the times reports that the promise by china would allow president trump to claim a major victory in his campaign to read balance america's trade relationship with its biggest economic rival but economists say it's not practical and critics say it could impair the president's
more ambitious agenda
to punish china for pressuring american companies to hand over valuable technology
finally fifty for the news or forty five and the nomination is confirmed and the president will be immediately notified of this action on thursday the president's choice to run this the gina hospital was confirmed by the senate despite
bipartisan misgivings about who war in the detention and interrogation program after september eleven

from the new york times on my cobra
these
today
president trump is calling on the justice department to open an investigation into itself
instead the justice department is giving the president's team access to evidence being used in a special councils investigation
why would it do that
it's tuesday may twenty second

the present really using twitter this morning to slam the new york times and air their grievances and frustration meanwhile the new bombshell new york times article there's a big debate raging and more follow continued from or the president is back on twitter he's a lashing out at the justice department and also the new york times this were a new report about a previously unreported
meaning a trump tower with a foreign country
so the times published story over the weekend that looked at and different trump tower meeting and the one we've all become familiar with were donald trump junior met with russians you are promising dirt on hillary clinton julie data is covers the white house for the times this time the meeting was with officials from saudi arabia and the united arab
emirates and they are discussions with the trump campaign officials about potentially helping out the campaign the reason it matters is because it's the first indication that we have that muller is not just looking at whether the trump campaign worked with russians during the election season but
also whether they may have worked with other foreign governments you are either offering op or actually providing help to donald trump and whether they were also coordinating with the russians so it just gives a sense of an avenue that we weren't really aware existed in this investigation of the entire russia meddling picture so this is
the latest sign that the muller investigation continues to expand its scoop and this time it's literally expanding to entire other countries that's right and it may well be that mahler has been looking down this avenue for quite some time but it's just now that we're getting wind of it and every time one
these things becomes public the president gets another a little bit of a glimpse of how big this investigation really is how much smaller and his team really know and you know it's just continuing to go on and on and that makes the president extremely angry and it makes them want to lash out let me read your what
he has just treated things are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked but not as crooked as hillary clinton new york times has done a long and boring story indicating that the world's most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia and me so now they are looking at the rest of the world but interestingly
he didn't take issue with anything in the story he didn't call it big news and there's a pause of a few hours and then he tweets again and he says here demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the best the slash deal infiltrated or veiled the trunk campaign for police
typical purposes and then if any such demands are requests were made by people within the obama administration to tell me more about this incident the trump is asking his department of justice to look into what happened
well for a long time now he has been complaining about the fact that we know that several of his campaign officials were wiretapped but the more recent factor for the president that has hand talking about whether his campaign was infiltrated his some information that we reported on last week that the f b i actually
he had an informant the new york times and washington post reporting that the the i had an informant go talk to a couple of members of the trump campaign according into the report the f b i did indeed said an informant to talk to three trump campaign advisors after receiving evidence that they had suspicious contact with russia the informant who according to the
washington post was a retired american professor interacted with trunk campaign members george papadopoulos quarter page and zoom clovis when this first came out the president was really angry and talked about how inappropriate it was and he alleged that the person was spy out it was planted in his campaign we've come to learn through
shorting of my colleagues here in the dc bureau that the reason that these informants were sent in was because they had uncovered contacts that champ campaign officials had with russians and they wanted to look into what they were and further there was a sort of political timing motivation here not in the way that the president is representing it that they were out to get the campaign but
they were close enough to the election that they didn't want the spectacle of doing a big f b i interview of these people than it would be you know they thought a more practical way to go about it to you have an informant ask them questions and see what's there really anything to this or were they going down or wrong path but it's not as if they were double agents
when applied for jobs on the term campaign so they could spy on people they were doing the work that an fbi informant often does where you know you get a meeting with someone you go to dinner with them he talked to them you try to get information out of them and the leftover way than you would in a face to face interviews saying hello i am julie davis from the f b i plead dance
he spent question and is there a reason for the president to be outraged by this arrangement given that this was happening under a democratic president and in the middle of a very heated presidential campaign as he's running against hillary clinton
i think this president is very paranoid about this whole investigation so he believes there is a very good reason to be suspicious it happens while obama was president so he then believes that it was somehow directed by democrats but it's very typical to have an informant and a big investigation like this are several him
formats this is not necessarily considered a huge deal it's not necessarily something that goes all the way up the chain of command and certainly not to the president himself so the notion that barack obama was sitting at his desk saying i see we're going to help hillary clinton by sending a spy into the trunk campaign it's just not the way these things tip
working but that's clearly the way trump season and that is the way whether or not it's true he is representing it to the public and i think he's trying to undercut the whole investigation which has been doing all along but i think is also trying to set up this narrative where the public and particularly his own supporters say
see the mother investigation as a democratic partisan motivated witch hunt hoax just the way he does and that there's two different sides basically to boil it down into this fact free partisan spitting match between him and his democratic detractors but
the president in this treated is asking his department of justice
to look into this and determine if it was in fact a political act intended to hurt him and if the obama administration was somehow involved
that's right and you have to understand that this is not just any old matter he's asking the department of justice to look into there is an ongoing special counsel investigation into this issue of whether and how russia medals in the presidential election so by asking for this other investigation he's essentially intervening in and
ongoing investigation he saying hold up i want you to investigate the very basis for that special counsel probe right he's asking for an investigation of the investigation of him
correct
julie could this be construed as the latest piece of evidence that this president is trying to obstruct just when it comes to the special counsel investigation
absolutely he has basically dispensed with any idea that he is not trying to use his power use his office to try to influence the way this investigation goes he's called for an end to it he's fire the f b i a director he thought about firing the deputy attorney general and
and this is just the latest example of hamster of throwing all the usual standards out the window and saying i want this thing over i don't think this thing has a basis and i am going to use my power to try to act on that the irony here is that the more he tries to influence the muller investigation the more he tries
speed up its completion the more he seems to be contributing to and prolonging it and giving the special counsel more things to look into

all the way back
so how of the justice department respond to the president saying that he was going to issue this order and demand that it investigate itself
so there was a several hour lol on sunday after the president made this demand by tweets and wasn't hearing anything from the justice department i wasn't hearing anything from the white house about how he planned to carry this out
in the intervening hours i spoke to a number of people who are very concerned about how rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general who is overseeing the special counsel investigation it's going to react to this they felt that you know it's pretty clear that the justice department can't just say how high when the president says jump and that is
inappropriate and that rosenstein being a career justice department person would not be willing to do that and again he made this comment recently that the justice department won't be extorted so the question was what are his options that is not willing to do that will resign instead of doing that will he say no and be fired by the president for not do
and finally on sunday evening rosenstein put out a statement and he found this kind of middle ground where he said the justice department's going to ask it's inspector general to look into the question that the president had raised and he said you know of course if there's somebody who has
infiltrated or surveillance a campaign for political purposes of course we would want to know about that and act on that but in doing that you know the subtext of that also is and while that goes on the special counsel investigation is also going on uninterrupted we are not opening and justice department investigation were not devoting justice
department resources and investigators in layers into essentially carrying out what is politically motivated investigation into whether there is an already existing politically motivated investigation so he's essentially avoided either extreme and kind of came down somewhere in the middle and in the
process issued this statement dad in essence legitimized what the president had asked for without accepting it
but it's kind of like having your hr department look into the question of do we do something wrong here can we improve our operations right it's inevitably not as flashy as an outside investigation
well right and in particular because the inspector general doesn't have prosecutorial power if he found something wrong he could write a report and that might force action by congrats are five someone else in the administration but it would not lead to criminal charges and then that is clearly what the president would like to see
if something was done wrong so given the term knows that do we know if the president is satisfied by the compromise that rosenstein took here
well rosenstein and christopher re the f b i direct our were at the white house on monday talking to the president and i would have loved to have been a fire on the wall but i was not in the meeting but afterwards the white house did put out a statement that seem to suggest that the president at least for now is satisfied with but there was a second line of the statement that actually
was a lot more significant and that was that they said that john kelly the white house chief of staff will be convening a meeting with the f b i the justice department intelligence community to review all this information about the investigation
and for such a long time they've been resisting the treaties from the white house from the president himself from republicans on capitol hill to cough up some of this information potentially including the identities of these informants that the president is concerned about and they've said no and they've pushed back and they found ways around it and now there's
don't be a process where in some of this information is going to be furnished to the white house
so the justice department is agreeing to give the white house access to what it has the sort of evidence and the sort of information that the murder investigation is built around to at least some of it and you know the interesting thing here will be you know now they're going to have to kind of all go back to their desks figure
out what they can share and agree amongst themselves what are they going to show to the president but essentially what you have is the justice department pushing back and saying we're not going to let you intervene in this investigation but we are willing to give you some degree of access to what it is but working well
then why would people in an apartment just as why does rod rosenstein do them
well i think you have this immense pressure by the president of united states you have pressure from the oversight committees on capitol hill it really create this potential confrontation between the president and zone justice department it's really untenable and so the way these investigations work some of this information is highly highly classified as
others not so much so they may be thinking if there are things that we can tell them if there are ways that we can lay out what the basis was for this decision or that decision it's better to do that than to get ourselves down this road of a confrontation between the president and the justice department
so they have to figure out short of resigning and leaving this to someone else when they think it's a pretty important and vital and of the justice department how they can continue to operate how they can continue to keep this thing on its tracks that's but they're focused on and so they have to figure out
ways to maneuver in this new reality that the president has presented them with and i think that's what they're trying to do it sounds like rosenstein is trying not to have to resign or to get fired
perhaps helps explain why he's been such a difficult to decipher figure on the one hand we know he wrote that letter that became a justification for james komi being fired
as the director
on the other he has allowed robert mahler to run this investigation despite how infuriating it is the president and now back on the other side he's giving the president access to justice department evidence right i think that he is trying really hard not to resign
nine and not to be fired but he also has an attitude of i am going to do my job the way i think is appropriate and i'm not going to worry about whether i'm gonna get fired or not i'm going to worry about whether this investigation can run it's legitimate course even as he is doing these things giving questions that the president raises to the
inspector general trying to have this middle ground on information that they're showing the white house he is also approving lots and lots of different requests from muller who investigate this to investigate that i mean he oversees this investigation mahler can't look into questions arose and stand doesn't think are know an avenue that he should be pursued
so he's kind of got a very bifurcated role here and i think he is china play bone at the same time and so that sometimes why it looks from the outside like he's whip sign between one thing and another i think he's got to really important jobs here and he's trying to give up
so presumably rosenstein would have also approved the decision to investigate that second meeting a trump tower and the one that so infuriated the president when he read about it in the times yes it's definitely the case that if there were a moment where mahler presented this to him and said hey can i look at this he said yes because this is clearly
now a point of investigation from our
thank you very much

president trump abruptly cancels a historic summit with kim jong il
the world and north korea in particular he writes has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace
it's friday may twenty fifth



i'm here in north korea's nuclear test site kong eighty a place for journalists have never been a while before and we are here in north korean government says to witness the destruction of this site they say it will never be able to be used again thursday began with this carefully selected group of journalists who have been flown into north korea to witness the demolition the blowing
up of an underground nuclear testing facility
clinton or covers the white house for the times the north koreans had made a very big show of inviting this group of outsiders to witness is that we travel around fifteen hours to get here first by bush through the coastal city of one song
apartment seven here we are then some twelve hours by train they had to track them to a very remote site by plane by car they even have to hike a certain amount of distance to get to this place this viewing site where they could watch this facility buried into a hillside blow up in front of them
recall remaining right
grandma
meat
and why did north korea demolish this site and such a public fashion
this was meant to be one of a series of confidence building gestures by the north koreans halting missile tests releasing three americans who'd been detained in north korea gestures to the united states and to south korea that the north koreans were serious when they said they were ready to give up their nuclear arsenal
and all of this of course was aimed at building confidence in advance of the big show the meeting between kim jong on the north korean leader and president trump so yes thursday started off on a very promising know

welcome again to our of the us here in the united states and around the world significant breaking news on this thursday morning the plan summit the historic summit in just a few weeks between kim jong il and president child is now often it's coming in a letter so very soon after the end of this highly public exercise in north korea the demolition of this nuclear site
the white house puts out a letter and about nine forty five in the morning late afternoon in north korea from president trump to kim jong on in which the president essentially says are meeting is off
and did anyone know that this letter was coming know it came completely out of the blue and frankly even more so because president trump had recorded an interview with fox the which aired early in the morning on thursday june twelfth are you going to be in singapore we'll see what happened in which he spoke quite optimistically
about the prospects for a some there's a good chance and it will be a great thing to north korea if that happened general be a great thing for north korea
most importantly it would be a good thing to the world so we'll see what it really truly was a bolt from the blue and mark what is this letter from president trump to kim jong un actually say well it begins dear mr chairman we greatly appreciate your time patience and effort with respect to our recent negotiations
and discussions relative to a summit long sought by both parties which was scheduled to take place on june twelfth in singapore we were informed that the meeting was requested by north korea but that to us is totally irrelevant
i was very much looking forward to being there with you sadly based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement i feel it is inappropriate at this time to have this long planned meeting therefore please let this letter serve to represent that the singapore
ur summit for the good of both parties but to the detriment of the world will not take place
you talk about your nuclear capabilities but ours are so massive and powerful that i pray to god they will never have to be used
oh yes
there was a lot to impact their their it and i'm struck by the line we were informed that the meeting was requested by north korea but that is totally irrelevant i was very much looking forward to being there with you
why say that as an introduction to cancelling this meeting well one of the points the americans have made from the very start is you guys asked for this we didn't ask for you came to us we didn't come to you
that said president trump particularly as time has gone on and he said more time to get used to the idea of this meeting and to look forward to it has become very attracted by the prospect and he's put a lot of time into cultivating his relationship with kim jong on even though the two men have never met president trump has spoken about cam
and very personal terms for quite a few weeks now so i think that this line captures both points one you came to us but to i really was beginning to have a relationship with you
this kind of an earnest sentiment here that he wanted this meeting to occur and is kind of a little crush that it's not that's absolutely right and in think one thing that's been very clear about present a trump particularly in the last two to three weeks is he really really was looking forward to this meeting his wasn't a show on his part
he wasn't being dragged into it he didn't even really have misgivings about it on a personal level he was savoring the opportunity he was excited by okay so then the present rights that the meeting is cancelled because of what he calls tremendous anger and open hostility from north korea what exactly
is he referring to well the most immediate thing he's referring to is a statement that was issued overnight by a top north korean official the vice foreign minister
and in that statement the official goes after vice president my pants calling vice president like pants quote a political dummy says that he misunderstands the north korean position and he is saying uninformed and stupid things so there is a personal insult that's being lobbed here at the vice press
didn't but beyond that the statement goes on to say that if you don't meet us in a room maybe you'll meet us on the battlefield you know maybe we will have a nuclear showdown while so there's actually a very serious threat here of military hostilities that's also being rolled out by the north koreans but why would north korea call
the vice president of the united states a dummy
so now to exclusive interview with the vice president starting with that meeting at the white house will vice president pants invoked libya you know there was some talk about the libyan
ashley
you know as the person and made clear
you know this this will only end like that libya model ended if kim jong un doesn't make a deal remember the libya model which we've discussed here before libya promise to get rid of its nuclear weapons in exchange for economic hell even though it will be a gave up its nuclear weapons or it's program that eventually
lead to an overthrow of libya kim jong un is likely mindful of gadhafi is bloody and as opposition forces in his country gained power i think what's at play here is that the libya model is a particularly provocative issue for the north koreans and so the fact that vice president pence brought it up
only a few weeks after john bolton the national security advisor first floated the idea may have lodged in their minds as a sign that the us was not getting this model out of its head and so they needed to push back hard on that so i think it's a combination of anger at the libyan model but a growing recognize
mission of just how much distance separates the two sides
personal trauma made it clear the united states of america
under his leadership is not going to tolerate the regime and north korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles to threaten the united states and our allies
to trump ends this section of a letter that you read with a pretty explicit threat pointing out that the us has a massive nuclear arsenal and it would be a shame if we had to use it why would you do that
i think this goes to the second part of what the north koreans were saying in their statement which is this kind of threat that if you don't meet us in the negotiating table maybe you'll meet us on the nuclear battlefield i think this is the president reminding the north koreans you know we have more of those than you do it was really i think no more ca
complicated than that
it's a little in congress to have the president say how sad he is to not do this meeting he really wanted to do and simultaneously say we might nuclear
yeah no kidding i mean there's a lot of paradoxes but there's been paradox is in president trumps relationship with kim jong un from the start rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime this after all is a relationship that began with i'm calling him a little rocket man rocket man should have been hand
long time
and then almost overnight things have changed radically from a few months ago
you know the name calling and a lot of other things turned into this very strange courtship he really has been where he wound up referring to him as a gentleman who had behaved honorably think very honorable from everything wishing there has been this paradox in how trump has treated came from the beginning and i think we do see it even in this letter today
so how does this letter n or you read the last two paragraphs trump rights i felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me and ultimately it is only that dialogue that matters day i look very much forward to meeting you in the meantime i want to thank you for the release of the
hostages who are now home with their families this was a beautiful gesture and was very much appreciated
if you change your mind having to do with this most important summit please do not hesitate to call me or right the world and north korea in particular has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth this missed opportunity is truly a sad moment in history sincerely
yours donald trump president of the united states
what do you make of this second part of a letter
well i think there's a couple interesting things to zero in on one i would point out is his phrase that the only dialogue that matters is the one between you and me that may be a way of saying to can forget about john bolton forget about my pants and forget about the libyan model what matters is what you and i talk about across the table from one another that's what's important
then he goes on to say some day i look forward to meeting you and i'm thanking you for the release of a hostage is the hostages was a major gesture on kim's part it was something they gave president trump an enormous lift at home i think he was genuinely grateful for and then he goes on to say you know if you have a change of heart you know how to reach me which you know
again as an exceedingly strange use of language in a letter between two heads of state that have never met one another it almost feels more like a letter you might send to someone you had a fight with and you're hoping you can make up in the future but that's kind of the underlying tone of the whole letter this letter is a deeply personal one and it is worth noting
the president dictated every single word of this letter himself while yes this was not a letter written by committee or drafted foreign secretary of state using time tested language this was president trumps own language put down on paper
so
right back
it still feels like there's a little ambiguity around exactly what happened here there's the obvious surface theory that starting with john bolton and then like pence that language from the us spooked north korea and so they issued
turrets and that unsettled the president and he cancelled the meeting
but what do you think is really behind this historic decision to end this historic summit
i think there's a couple of other elements that are intriguing i'm not sure they're absolutely the main cause but i'll mention both one is the united states sent a group out from the white house to start making arrangements in singapore and they were in singapore for three days waiting for their north korean counterparts and the north koreans never show
they send it up the american group and that group included the white house deputy chief of staff joe hagan a man whose planned presidential trips going all the way back to george h w bush so that i think was seen as quite problematic quite a major snob on the part in the north koreans i think the second area that's worthy of exploration
nation is the role of the chinese president cheesy and paying kim jong un went out to see she didn't paying twice most recently a couple of weeks ago he went to visit him in a coastal chinese city on and as soon as he got back to north korea there was a perceptible shift in north korea's tone toward the united
states the big question and president trump himself has raised this is what happened in that meeting machine right i will say i'm a little disappointed because when kim jong own had the maybe with president xi in china the second made the first really we know about the second meeting
i think there was a little change in attitude from kim jong own so i don't like that did president she tell kim jong on to go back to pyongyang and take a tougher tone or alternatively did kim jong on say to president she you know i really don't want to do this meeting if i pull out well you have my back
don't know the answer to that question but i think it's a major part of what may have happened here
i wonder if there's some it was doomed from the start based on the depth of that's trust these very different goals of both countries the us demanding that north korea immediately the nuclear eyes north korea saying we can't do that we won't do that we fear that that leads us to giving up
are protective shield or was this a case of both sides the president and his people and cabinet and his people mocking this all up with their actions and their statements
i think if you speak to american diplomats that have been involved in previous negotiations with north korea they will tell you it was doomed from the start because the gap between the two sides was simply unbreakable
i think what president trump manage to do interestingly enough by sheer force of enthusiasm is kind of make people rethink their assumptions about north korea well maybe if the president of the united states can get kim jong on across a table they can do what thirty years of negotiators have failed to accomplish
they can actually bridge the gap to some extent the last week has been a reality check on that euphoria it's been a kind of an exercise in people throwing cold water on both trump in chem and now we emerge at the end of this period with even president trump thinking maybe i got ahead of myself maybe they're simply it
is too much distance between us for even a dealmaker like me to bridge and i think that's what the letter also reflects his conclusion that as exciting as a possibility as this was it's not actually a good idea and probably never was yeah that's right because the price of failure is high
hi once you've had that meeting at the leader to leader level and you fail to get to the goal where do you have left to go i mean one of the interesting things about what president from did here is he inverted the normal sequence of diplomacy normally you would have begun this conversation at a much lower level you would have met at a
ministerial level maybe you would have moved up to the secretary of state and the foreign minister and only then if you are making progress would you bring in the big guns to actually close the deal or president trumpeted here in effect is he said let's bring the big guns in for the first meeting and i think what he discovered is the risks of doing that are simply too high

mark there's there's so much going on here so much reading between the lines both with this letter and with all these comments from all these sides leading up to this latter being written us partly blaming china north korea is blaming john bolton what do you think all this is really about ultimate what does this letter really represent
i think for all of the complexity all of the different forces all of the agendas this letter really comes down to a relationship between two people and an attempt by one of them president trump to salvage the relationship with the other kim jong on to salvage relationship even as he
ends this historic summit
i think maybe the president's thinking is i gotta take this step now to preserve the relationship down the road

thank you
thanks michael

from the new york times ah michael barbara this is the daily

today the sole survivor of a brutal murder identified three white men as the attackers
so why did police ignore those suspects and put a young black man on death row
it's wednesday may thirtieth
on the morning of june fifth nineteen eighty three and chino hills california bill and marianne to use were a little bit concerned because their eleven year olds and had not come back from a sleep over at a neighbor's christoph is a columnist at the times so what about noon the dad built use drove over to pick
it's time nobody answered the door so he looked through the sliding glass doors and all he saw was red
it dawned on him what he was seeing he kicked down the door he rushed to the body of his son who had been stabbed to death
dougan peggy ryan both forty one was found in their home hacked to death along with their ten year old daughter jessica and a young neighbor eleven year old christopher hughes and the other son josh ryan a eight year old hosted sleep over it had his throat slashed and his head
cashed in but he was still moving

yeah
it was about as gruesome murder is one can have and
who's there immediately and idea of who had done this a suspect edelman seized on
there were some clues almost right away nothing was taken from the ryan house except the family station wagon
we're looking for the ryan automobile the ryan station wagon had been stolen and several people had seen three white people inside that station wagon driving it away
people who had seen three white people at a bar with bloody clothing
and then soon afterward a woman called out and said that she believed that her boyfriend had been involved in the murders he was a white man who had recently been released from prison for murdering his seventeen year old and he had come home late on the night of the killings
in a vehicle that resembled the ryan station wagon and he had left his bloody coveralls on the floor on top of that josh the kid who survive said that three or four a white men had done this already got to require ask them how many people are there are one two three and his why a while he was recuperating
just maintain that there were three attackers and so the police initially put out a bullet am looking for three white killers and were those three wide suspects
arrested
no instead they arrested twenty five year old black man kevin cooper who two days before the killings had escaped from a minimum security prison and where you were serving standards for burglary

oh wow brought up and walk
good got reporter
will go error
but what are all
i've gotten
i'm going to work at all
gov
oh are here
what drama and where did you go next after you walk away though
oh well
whoa whoa
good our governor cobra
euro dollar an hour
i worded here
so cooper please the prison any hides out in an abandoned house which unfortunately for him is just one hundred and twenty five yards away from the crime scene
i think the police simply looked at this and it was just too much of a coincidence how could it be that you have a desperate escape felon who just happens to be staying in ban and house so close to where it is brutal crime unfolds
and frankly i think there was also an element of racism they looked at the mug shot of kevin cooper in here is this young man his rap sheet showed that he'd been arrested ever since he was seven years old he had a long criminal history and i think they just decided this is it ah the
mobile alabama
educated
what
oh yeah
our right
mama a
so the police are looking for kevin cooper but they're not finding a lot of evidence linking him to the murder scene they don't find fingerprints of them they don't find his hair's they search house where he was staying and initially they don't find any evidence they search the car
they belong to the ryan's you've been stroll initially they don't find anything they are either
and then mysteriously evidence begins to appear

they find a hatchet chief it had missed the first time and a prison uniform button and they also find cigarette butts that he had apparently smoke i think the authorities thought they were acting on the side or just just i think they thought that given cooper was a multiple murderer
and they were frustrated by the lack of evidence to show that so i think they help the process along a little bit so you believe from your reporting that the police department planted evidence against kevin cooper having could is in their minds that he did it and the day were doing a public service by putting evidence there
that would make it possible for them to arrest and victim that's exactly right
hurt her
a quarter or
right
it all away or
or
our
don't either
oh no
what
the way to go to rio bravo
bought our background
when i got down here
our there a ago our record
you're all wrong
oh oh what what are her around
right well
probably go about it
wow
he is tried in the end the jury said that if they've been one last piece of evidence against him they might have voted to acquaint kevin cooper has been convicted on four counts of murder and run counter i'm attempted murder they took a week to convict him a jury has to decide whether cooper said be sentence
the gas chamber and then he was sentenced to death
and so he was scheduled to be executed in two thousand and four

why would not epic
nearly get to go against anita mean you get get get but you're not a big job
how about it again
before meet everybody walk under every game make walking near came out in a body bag of the first one ever walk into your car out and walk out


granted stay to say down whether given to greece blood on that he should some in or and
a test tube of these bloods it's been taken by is yours
i'm going after he was arrested and so the court said that they could test that bloodstained to see if it had a blood preservatives cause he
it it's good exists
exactly and so this was basically and mc was that blood planted or day he bleed and the commission is a crime so what happens when they actually do the test is your designed signed elevated a bloodstain so it seems has come
on from get to bruce arteries and veins but rather from the test to that's been taken of his blood held by the sheriff's department does it's the evidence on the t shirt was planned was planted and to to back up they went back to the test tubes that be taken in the check the blood that was in it
it turned out now they have the blood of two or more people so it seems that some blood had been spilled out on that shirt and then to top it up date with somebody else is blood in and so that wouldn't be suspiciously low
so what happens to kevin cooper astor that discovery displaying his judicial appeals have essentially run out so he is making political appeals to allow the evidence to be tested using advanced techniques and hadn't existed before and so he makes these appeals of
governor schwarzenegger who at the end of his term says well this is actually pretty serious but i don't have enough time left in office and i have my it's accessories will review this carefully he appeals to come along harris when she is attorney general california and her office she refuses to allow advanced dna testing he appeals to give
brown and one of the reasons i wrote about this case is this is not alabama this is not mississippi this is not text this is a do democratic this is california this is a democratic liberal governor jerry brown who is refusing to allow testing camilla harris before that and say evil for whom liberal
policies around law enforcement have become default absolutely so
let's see whether we managed to get justice in california under a democratic governor and that will be a measure of the degree to which things have changed which there has been real progress in criminal justice on race since nineteen eighty three
so it seems pretty clear from what you've said and from your reporting that the police planted evidence against coburn but for years now many high level thinkers would seem to have known this or has been brought evidence of it and cooper is still on death row
are we missing anything here about why that would be the case is there a version of this story where perhaps evidence was planted but cooper is indeed guilty of this crime and i'm trying on my head around why so many smart people in positions of power could have known so much of what your now bringing
forward and yet here we are east on death row i've been racking my brain to try to understand how this could happen that session and grudges case of framing of an innocent man on death row and i can't come up with any explanation other than just the jury to wish
institutionally once somebody is found guilty there is this resistance to defense appeals and this system kind of sets in motion this process that ends up with somebody on its trajectory to be executed
what's been the reaction since you wrote a story for the times and she revealed you have found camilla harris called me up next day to say she felt terrible about the case she issued a statement calling for advanced dna testing in the case so we're forcing herself from our time as attorney general of california that's correct and several other california
politicians have done the same a candidate for governor candidate for attorney general sen dianne feinstein the other senator has done the same jerry brown has not spoken san bernardino county district journey put out a statement saying that kevin cooper is guilty that there should not be testing
so he's sticking with the conclusions of this case despite everything that's exactly right

and since
nick published historian the times senator como harris
has come forward and she has urged governor brown to do what you're asking
my boy
already robert
your go
mark over the counter
oh so you're not as a preventative is she might think
a lot
to do you think that you have a chance now

oh
oh
oh good
yeah why
go work
what are you want
apartment for every car
what what about about problem
how we make okay show
to your mind the more the situation movies theoretically towards justice the more the system
finds a way to move away from justice to to kind of keep the status quo
oh probably go
about about it
oh what
at be and what we wanted
oh
i wonder
when you think about all that's happened to you
who in your mind
do you blame

kevin cooper remains on death row
as governor jerry brown reviews his request for additional dna testing last week the san bernardino district attorney my remus filed a petition opposing such testing citing could false claims some cooper and his propaganda machine
designed to undermine public confidence in the just verdict
yeah
use what else needs hundred eighty on tuesday north korea's top nuclear weapons to go sheer kim jung troll arrived in new york to meet with secretary of state my pump hail the strongest signal yet that of possible june twelfth summit with president trump
may still occur
kim jung troll is officially barred from entering the us because of sanctions put in place in two thousand and ten following accusations the he was responsible for torpedoing a south korean navy vessel which killed forty six people
and in the latest effort to count the dead from hurricane maria
researchers on tuesday estimated that the storm killed four thousand six hundred people in porto rico last year many of them from delayed medical care
that figure is dramatically higher than the official porta rican government tally which found that just sixty four people had been killed because of the hurricane

that's it for the daily on michael barbara see them wow

the

from the new york times and the team that brought you the daily this is kathy
just one to okay
are you saying me of something
swiss
oh i forgot the words it's a joke
electrodes michael one when in iraq did you first hear george
a nineteen ninety eight believe
i was at home
there was this
on t v a local tv there was some some videos like western new songs music videos music videos
there i have it
i was moved by the and how it a soft touch my heart
no i love metallic
oh then i guess a better question is how does somebody growing up in mosul fall in love with metallica
no offense to my in there were like in your in cars
some guys and it called metallic should listen to it
there's like work to buy any of these reports in there isn't any here and much as it was embargo a to remember that time and everything for or english or american it's like something forbidden
like given hush hush but you go to that's record show it was like one record shop yeah
the dire muscle and we were so lucky to have it
there's like and good looking at all
pictures of western music and everything
and it was so new to so i told them
me do you have metallic is yes of course which here you go two thousand and
anything know it does doesn't just give me some busy
best hit hit
but the first time after that
what the fuck is focus
just ah nice and kill
crying and another chapter
but after like two three times i listen to it

most of his songs totally this is your out
arnesen wars and why are we dine eight and a thing

say was born i've seen nothing in this country but wars and more wars and words
made some kind of connection that still deep with me
and from that
that's why i'm looking for

that has gotten to recapture nightfall this has been an occupation essentially by isis i'm all than two years and was the largest city in iraq captive by ice or find has now it's the only one they have black death as the beginning of what could be a long battle
ninety nine months of growling and all has left my and in ruins isis is hold on the city is down to less than half a square mile and so now and heavy urban guerrilla warfare
he settles into isis has pitted against the panels and and you're gonna eat
the full force and to us coalition

chapter seven mosul

good morning good morning
so
worth asking
this is where we got the seats
yeah there's a my p j s
pretty basic questions this morning
actually start off with on this
what what days
it's saturday night eighth two thousand and seventeen teeth has to seventeen and where are we were in iraq finally and basically iraqi forces are poised to take back most will be hearing that they're going to take back the city in twenty four to seventy eight hours
that timeline seems to be somewhat stretching it keeps on changing but no matter what i think it's somewhat eminent and after three years of isis holding the second largest city in all of iraq iraqi forces with coalition backing are poised to take a back
yeah
r c just came off the phone with a b m
and we're going to aim to leave around eleven i am so aim to be ready you an anti for eleven am i mean we need to be suited up in our bags bad for an overnight just in case yeah just in case
and you're going to meet you down the lobby
if anything changes hormone

let's start with the drive yet
so how can the current map study were in north iraq in the safe sound where were staying at a hotel
two hours
we are trying to get to western muscle to basically the last holdout that isis had i had a tip about a building that was in that area that i knew had been the headquarters of the has been under isis
and i just knew that if we could get there i mean i thought that if we could get them right when it was liberated we would find the motherland of documents
a year
as a checkpoint
in the car
we have are amazing drive her body
they don't need an awkward
we also have to security advisors one of them is rocky near and then we've got our international security and hi sorry
here you want me to talk about putting on under her job and then your heart
yeah how do you want to be identified
hawk of course am actually of spending quite a bit of time sitting with him in the backseat what is your pants do i learned a lot about whether his teacher
i used to be the i learned that he loves both george michael and metallica i started writing poetry
i don't know just came in and inspiration
but you've known them a lot on my have how is that you would describe hawk hoc fuck off
like huck is my translator and fix her so that i did like this program and he's asked my friend
he's really funny
oh my god like the half the time them with were laughing
he's a fabulous translator what's the frenchman
bella hope a law he's very methodical in terms of providing the accurate information providing me good translation about got caught by law who
lot he's a native language to grow up
he's born and bred in mosul i'm a descendant of these great great grandfather and what a lot of people don't get about muslim again
go back or budget and history is that this is in way one of the most ancient cities in the world
used have of cultures and religions province
area in which muzzle is located is mentioned in the old testament it's a history dates back thousands of years and they weren't the ones who started writing a very first thought it was near mosul that one of the tablets on which the epic of commission was written was found this is considered the earliest work of literature supposed to run grandfather's
mobilize the very first we'll in history
it's also a modern city it was the economic hub of the return there was a major university and if you were to walk through its were of flames
you could easily stumble upon villas that could have been airlifted out of santa barbara manicured lawns orange trees lemon trees and running through the heart of the city is the tigris river
it gets place where i want to clear my mind and if i'm like i said there something i would go directly to the record
sometimes i go for a depressing
just by the king of the revolution
magnificent feeling thanks will be
take all the stress you out
the moves like the rest of iraq paid a heavy price under the increasingly tyrannical rule of saddam hussein he tracked the country into conflict after conflict that the eight year around war the incursion into quake and this in turn lead to
sanctions that impoverished iraqi people and our fellow citizens then in two thousand and three at this hour the us invaded iraq american and coalition forces or in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq to free it's people and to defend the world from grave danger
two thousand and three it wasn't final examination yet in college and their has gaming to cover been wracked at that point in time hulk was just getting ready to graduate from university and he remembers welcoming us forces and being hopeful that rebuild you're going to do this and that it would be the start of an even further modern
a nation of muscle and of iraq of i was like looking at japan and germany and it was like think to myself going to get some basis year and you're going to flourish
i mean as a country but actually what happened i thought
your your car bars
suicide attacks targeted assassinations five more americans were killed in action today
getting worse and worse and pretty soon it had devolved into a chaotic ground work and least eighteen people were killed and iraq after a car bomb exploded at a crowded theatre all that chaos was the perfect soil for a growing insurgency
the insurgents were at first fighting the american invaders the crusaders as they called them but very soon the also turned on fellow muslims they began targeting the shia sect saying that they were not true believers that they had rejected the true thing that this is like oh allow will grow exactly you noble noble
because keep in mind the leader of the insurgency was a man named i sub we he was the founder of the group that goes on to become isis and according to files that were just recently declassified by the cia he was in muscle as early as two thousand and three and there he began laying the groundwork recruiting followers
there's recruiting fighters and building cells inside the city

so year after year as the chaos in the nation
this little group that begins with just a few dozen fighters grows there are gaining ground they're gaining acolytes and follow worse
come on point
as poss
rush on a lot more her home mom
and when the us finally pulls out and the last soldiers leave iraq in the final weeks of twenty eleven afternoon nine years
america's war in law will be older
much more did
they hand over most mosul to the iraqi military and to corrupt officials entities underground cells that were in some ways lying in wait all along
they shouldn't have
anyhow
then comes
and by the summer of twenty four team isis had reached the outskirts of muzzle with what people say was just a few hundred fighters they sent word to their supporters inside so can you tell me just personally
what were you doing base and then they ambushed to city
massive gunshots everywhere
my room
then my friend called me and he said
my neighborhood is falling told them what they should always good forces are pulling out how to get a word phone call from a friend of hers and the friend of saying using the kind for i did i'm okay is going to be okay robberies are no no you don't notice that and hug advice has found that this is nothing security forces were everywhere
rich world like crawling security forces river a good marriage everything
there are thousands of iraqi troops in and around the city they have humvees they have sophisticated rifles these been fully equipped to buy american forces were saying it's bunch of tourist and they be average
the he like many of the people in mosul and probably like most of iraq had no sense absolutely no sense that the city good for her
to be the next morning
to my surprise
i woke up by the morning
my father said don't god was like what they're talking about
oh shit divorce her though
my father i want to see what's going on
joining walked out on my roof top
they saw by my own eyes
hobbies were burning
the compounds army of bonds were run
it's all been far
fireworks
everyone
another major piece of what america or more in iraq was lost today the fight proving too much for the us drained iraqi soldiers emotional today we saw sporadic gunfire and burning military be it'd be a surgeon
we stations right
and government built some and reportedly discarding the uniforms abandoning the military on vehicles and weapons it could take weeks or longer for iraqi troops to recapture the city of mosul





so in this timeline as takes over muzzle in june
the crater calif fade from there in july
and then what first there was this kind of what you know
very soon within i would see the first week of their arrival with days
backed or city terms progressing
they began positioning people in traffic circles and they were handing out a pamphlet or flyer to people through the windows of their cars was first large because of that it was on a flyers they were is
the pamphlet was something called the torture of the city to this is what we have abided by it laid out in a constitution like form both the new rules under which the population would now be governed and they were saying that we are coming here we want to be equal call the security
force to handle their weapons under to save repent is their promise to the people
their promise was you have lived under these infidel regimes you have seen what a disaster it's been male you going to see a huge difference but the islamic state corruption is not going to be allowed they are now going to live in a virtuous society and that they are going to see the fruits of that virtue as a result
their citizenship in this coffee
so what does
first or so before you and i came to so how can i had traveled to a bunch of different towns not just mosul to the town north of the city to didn't have a planes to the town of nimrod yeah
as other day he said
little and in all of these locations we spent a lot of our time speaking to people who had spent years living and thong
the money and time and again the thing that how can i kept hearing is that isis was actually addressing some of the longstanding grievances they had had with the previous rocky government says
despite all this bad boy
so for example the side wants
yes one day how can i were in the town north of mosul where we met a guy who sold tickets on the side of the street he told us about how one day a customer came to him he picked out a asked him to slaughter i did when he headed over the chicken the customer open his wallet and said i'm so sorry only have half the money from a non
the merchant accepted the money on the understanding that this guy would pay back and then week after week the guy refused to learn and the others so there's a good year
limit the amount of money that this guy was staffed was literally a couple of dollars and explained to me that under the iraqi government he wouldn't have bothered to put in a police report because the bride you would have had to pay would have been probably more than the amount of money he was trying to recuperate
but under isis he said that he went to the police station the isis policemen took down the complained he didn't take a bribe
he sent out one of his officers to investigate they found the guy who hadn't paid and within a couple of days they got the guy to happen
we went to a couple of small towns where people for as long as they remember they'd never been able to have board and four five maybe six hours of electricity a day and they said that isis came in and they sent a committee of electrical engineers to go study the problem and they fixed it now
you couldn't turn on all of your appliances at the same time you could use air conditioners or big things like that but people now said that twenty four seven around the clock they could at least turn on the lights how was garbage collection during that time
this was there in one of the near universal things
that people told how can i can compare before ice and then when isis came what the garbage collection how it changed is that the street cleaner
after good and this is the thing where to this day i don't think people understand us it was a functioning society it was a functioning state it was not recognized by anybody but in some ways day usurped and the better than the government that they replaced and that's that's pretty crazy
yeah
except if you're and isis this as a group that that has always known how to mine local grievances and use them to their advantage bear trying to grow this global calif fate and in twenty four team and early twentieth left him it was working they were growing
life is spreading wider and wider operative iraq and syria have moved into libya they've established training camp in libya they seized a one hundred mile stretch of coastline on the mediterranean facing europe they took over an entire city in the philippines
iran really good audio message in which it appears the pledge allegiance to be broke all the while much food they were taking and pledges of allegiance from over a dozen countries all over the world deprive them of chronic state and their ideological program of establishing and islamic calibrate in places where the existing governments were either nonexistent
or week or corrupt and their promise of a more organized a more stable a less corrupt leadership
it was able to find an audience at their peak this is a group that had territory that rival the size of great britain and the governed a population of over twelve million people so truly black flags devices are being lifted up on different continents yeah all over the were all over the world
you know one of the analyst for spoken to set to me that isis has capacity to cover and is more worrying than the capacity of their fighters
but of course i wanted to talk about the imposition of the dress code on women if you're living in the california
or in the street or painting
men even as you're seeing your streets getting cleaner guard your face from her head and those even as you're saying certain public services being provided better than they ever were before that women are not allowed to girl tell us they have avail you also feeling the heavy hand of isis
once the first time you saw the his or the religious please do remember they were wearing white uniforms
and a brown kind of what it called you invest like a vest and it's written that husband and pretty soon or drugs or alcohol or smoking of course in his the officers began pulling people decide if annuities are good good bit be lashed or he would be like that they were carrying out public punishments this is a
what was evident in syria and yeah the same thing happened all over iraq residents describe heavy handed depression and brutality under the role of these islamic extremists and the violence just escalated the group has released a video report is least showing the be heading of the kurdish man in the city of mosul cursed go beheading
their own citizens people that they're accusing of being spies of applicants they become was breaking news late ten day a brutal video surfaced showing then they start decapitated western journalists video appears to show the forty year old james foley on his knees and an orange prison jumpsuit with this executioner next to him only a knife in his left hand
gathering or something like that guy i don't adore the next to them by the want to hear they're going to share their actually i camped a chance years the look at adulterers are being stoned to death thieves are having their hands cut off they began to take suspected homosexuals to the top of tall buildings the stills dated march
two thousand and fifteen
show a man being thrown from a building where they were blindfolded their hands were tied behind our backs and they were thrown to their jobs his alleged crime being gay so it was depression to me and i imagine israel because they were kept in my house in the entire two and a half years i would say it's only like thirty times that you aren't yeah
there's of your of your home via and overtime the violence got more and more creative if if i can use that word and frankly weird
blake they took a captured soldier
they made him stand bound in front of a tank
and truth the tank
the tread crushing this poor man and they're just filming all the yeah they're creating slickly produced propaganda videos out as many of these
they took the members of a tribe that revolted against islamic state they were put inside of a cage the cage was lowered
inside the body of water and they have cameras on them and these people were chained inside the cage
in another they took people inside of a slaughterhouse
and they hung them from the ceilings
like animals and slit their throats and the bleed out
yeah we were so do i say subjugated by so anything they say would just like comply directed without any hesitation
why why this level of violence like why is this kind of grotesque blood lust
this is hard to talk about without i think upsetting people so on the one hand when you see these videos
so disgusting and so savage that the first thing you want to do is to say this is evil
these are sociopaths these are monsters
the thing that is that is lost in all of them
is that this is strategies
also
what is as the does that mean
it's a couple of things number one what they'll tell you is that this is god's law this is really important to them this is basically a fundamental underpinning of what they claim to be doing so even in their most horrific videos if you take the time to look at the transcripts will you'll see is that they spend an inch
normal amount of time providing a religious justification for what they're doing
so for example that horrific video that shows a man being crushed underneath the treads of a tank if you go and look at the transcript
you'll see them explain that the victim the person that has been count is himself a former tank operator for the syrian military era
other than site at the principle of sauce this is a principal in islamic jurisprudence it's an eye for an i basically you do this to me i do this to you
and so they don't justify it he killed people with tanks we are also going to kill him with a tech i see right but secondly they are also aware that they are now in control of a huge stretch of land were presumably a lot of people didn't want them to be there and so they used to finance
as a form of intimidation through out the cafe day set up open air theaters screens they were they were set up in one could places and traffic circles even in schools
and on a continuous loop they were showing the most horrific videos
and say you were wherever you turned in the hell of a you are constantly being reminded of what happens to you if you stand up to the islamic state
the third aim with all of this grotesque violence is i think there must ambitious
and that is that they believe that through these these spectacles of violence this theater of savagery they are going to terrorize the enemy
and they're going to terrorize the enemy into both letting them exist
as a state and eventually they're going to terrorize the enemy into accepting their way of life
but this is also where i think you see isis hubris i've long wondered if they had just stuck to a caliph that was only in iraq and syria without doing any attacks in the west i wonder if you and i would still be talking
about that calif eight now about that territory now but instead they put more and more emphasis on these attacks overseas and eventually it was this a strategy environments it was this constant drumbeat of attacks that in the end forces the west to we engage in a way it really didn't want to
boots on the ground by american british and french troops a coalition of countries that come together to try to route i sound

right ahead of us as a house destroyed an airstrike you can see that pancaked roth completely flat when you see that that means men the coldness
there was a nice fighting position
some sort of isis brother has concluded
really sad initially houses which opens for like this
if isis is defeated
today your city will be liberated doesn't make you happy
it's really complicated question
because no military liberation is about to be complete
we're going to talk about chivalry is are going to talk about infrastructure
so houses a total city that has destroyed and this is the is a victory
so i don't know whether i should be or
he is that the way i feel i can really feel happy



within hours
yeah our seeing forty eight hours seventy two hours that's what they mean
so we truly truth and true for all day and the whole time i was taking my phone i had a map of where the iraqi military was positioned in mosul and i was watching this little island the land that isis still held shrinking and shrinking a rabbit
okay
okay and then to complicate things we were told that there's a media blackout reporters were not being allowed in at all
and so at the end of the day not having been able to go inside which checked them with our sources to see where things start
it's not over yet
nothing
isis managed to get through the day

that evening
we were terrific to an abandoned house that was on the outskirts of western muscle
oh say about six miles from the first check points going into the hardest part of lot america yes it's a house that has been commandeered by the iraqi army and put some of their soldiers insight here but mainly they're using it to house local journalist
personally suffered from isis
because it was cooked oysters
so we spent the evening talking to them swapping stories almost all of us
we have dinner you just give me a rundown of the damn where you opens tomorrow united states and canada
a hurry up and wait day
throw up here
it was more than three hours to get your before
then we waited for the colonel who as pathetic as to the front
i think you will take us there tomorrow
but it's were cutting it off because if the city false tomorrow then basically one day on the ground
did you find any anything new out about
why they have this ban for not letting anyone in one theory is that it is too dangerous and just i think yesterday a group of a rocky journalists are somehow got separated from the soldiers they were with and gotten removed inside a building and were literally surrounded by
i think overnight
two of them were killed
and the others made it out today some it might be the danger and as it was getting raped
we started to get ready to back down but it was just so hot and really so loud in the house
that you and i are going out and hunk a couple of other members of our team
decided to go up onto the roof
we dragged a couple of foam mattress is that there we put down our sleeping bags
and i'm a purchase looking at the stars and thinking about the fact that this particular patch of sky has witnessed so much end tomorrow is going to be another notch in the lifeline of muscle a pretty important one
the day perhaps that isis is defeated
and it's going to be our job
to explain what that looks like the world
that was pretty humbling to think of that
as we as
honestly

and into can i go ahead and a look at it

the first time i went to visit toby at her house we went into this empty room
she called it looks room or yeah this is the way
you might have agreed and you guys
so the room is filled with all these photos knock and she tells me to bring up this one
it's blown up the poster size and it is really beautiful photo of seven teenage boys
and it is right in the middle of them

it was agree about filigree right
with them
on the far left is fat
me
he's the one of the dreads making if he signs
lisa then comes to raise or too easily next best friend and this one does raises where the niche
he has his arm kind of casually hung around my neck not smiling just be mean he looks like someone just cracked a joke and he's cracking up and then there's eddie on the rate in a red sweatshirt kim
jim

i mean it reminds me of
covering the war in iraq and having people die
you know right under your nose you're having an interview and writing a story about a family and you leave them on friday and come back on a tuesday and the father's dead
i mean that would happen all the time and that's what her life is like people are just evaporating and not you know all people who got cancer
but seventeen year old fifteen year olds
insane
they're like in a war or something what happened
hand in a war itself




zero tolerance policing we're supposed to make life better for next generation
that we supposed to stop the crime from the crack epidemic that had so tormented toby and that is generations
but obviously that's not how it played out
instead look in his friends their lives were shaped by two forces first by what the drugs and the job losses had done to their parents and the options they soft their lives as a result but then second by policing strategy that seem to assume their destiny from the very beginning
arrested or dead

here's there were
i never it
funny looking
he
long alleys
with around him
the road
what did you remind you
what do you look like
me
oh my god
everyday
about
now
very very
so it turns out that when nuke was younger he spent several years living with his great at marion it's younger sister she become really successful it's an accountant
and she moved out to baltimore county like so many upper middle class people in baltimore in this year's
it was a world away from toby in the city
when you could get a better life
at know be
or
whenever we want our could get better and why
you know
really an hour and a about having more



had piano lessons the time sign language they taught him how to read very early

autumn
water
and a rated highly literate
oh
the order
we were here
let me right here
law in order for the court you're right
when they are not all her with her all the all
no not no
i remark



but he didn't last
no longer life
right
what do you want
about
nick wanted to go back to the city back to his mom he was a strong willed kid so we moved back in with toby
she's working night as a bartender
he was often fending for himself this just and you are looking at of obviously a very disturbing live shot there that is the world trade center and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the world trade center
what the morning of september eleventh
because in this daycare preschool type thing some blocks away in west baltimore and nobody can route to be an phone the school has to shut down because the plane just hit the twin towers and everything's closing oh my goodness oh god there's another one and know who at the time is three makes his
way home himself
he crosses this big avenue lafayette avenue as a three year old and his own and that was kind of his world he had to figure it out for himself
and make his own way
reader he was like a leader he was he doesn't really everybody told to stop
no
you don't say while oh no
everywhere i love
nuke met milk in elementary school all the law to level
you don't mind me might be to mark russell would have been what he plan to be given a little creative tension some oxygen all getting it now
he also i see no no more shows will will still require yemen and and store he was like the pied piper of children in the neighborhood not obese in a plan with them
all our way we play point one key you don't rail his tank he is a beetle around a corner own own radical
oil and he planned all up he was the fun one
he like bikes are located right
as we all do
or more oh yeah why new bikes no eggs were device came from
always buy it
all your might not might be four bytes out and take years it might be for terrorism
much are lawyers and many bikes and stuff like that

yeah
the
could could do reading them
nick was in high school when he was killed
he was one of seven kids and it's high school killed and little over a year
different kids then once in the photo but was never really interested in school
it
hi
this is actually not right
three
he was never scared to say that i want the and police are back
he like both the world
and then it was he might be a rapper
i won't save it
be isn't that nothing illegal then
and was acquitted is be you really know
i mean for it
okay so it's easy you know that
when they told me i so embarrassing

and no idea
three

so his grandmother did get him a job in the library one summer
but he didn't take to it it was too slow
he was looking around his neighborhood and he seemed pretty much one path to getting had fast
and that was the streets we grew up so young
we are paying attention to it key
why and a half hours style asking a lot of sad times when we was all the steps you watch watch them awesome
new grew up watching the young men in this neighborhood
and watching their relationship with the police he's watch and okay saw the police came from this way
he got away and ran that way saying when you could you miles you get older you do you to to use will ago i know what you do with do because i was watch and so yeah
long before nick was actually doing anything illegal
he had some run ins with the police but then look did start selling drugs when he was about thirteen with his friends say

they to block where they worked and then to protect it
their turf they got guns

they not understand what that's how it is with us
san fran and people outside in whizzes some misguided their pride in an alternate universe now we found that attention on a black and at to black with
well we just china all that situation
early gave it to be a plus
the fact that they are lake say they're enforcing a law against the thing that you're doing were like it's that way they how do you understand that when i'm dawn

stan a he drives people like

that's life
i ride out hustle a he will a soldier they whoever by
stuff like it is not people they just cover bear situations
we just charming and better
what the police nerdy not want to understand it he said he just bought a house ireland in a cave laying on of money or we read me we need this summer so much money
nick spend some time in jail but when he got out he kept going and he was making money
he bought nice clothes keep our car even we didn't have a license instagram account was full of him holding money flipping through it counting it when smiling with a giant wads of cash in his best know hundred twenty two and on a tank which one is with the prize
already added the matches it
everyone wanted our legal money
legal money safe

a whole objective of illegal legal money is the enough a legal money so it's hard to meet women as objects
to if your close
pine clothes what
the the are keen personal a primary make enough to give me a house buy a house in my neighborhood rented out with somebody
cause thousand cars to bob luxury manage some
i'm a key possible keep on stand alone
we started reporting in baltimore because of nick's story
but actually nuke with the exception
he was shot by the police
but there's other young man in a photo most of them were killed by other young men in baltimore
the thing about murder in baltimore is that it's actually really tightly contained to the circle of people committing crimes
he were killed in baltimore last year the likelihood is he'd been arrested an average of eleven times
which means to days victim is often yesterday's perpetrator
and what's left is a very unusual situation in america where in these baltimore neighborhoods an eighteen year old has a one in seven chance of dying before he reaches his mid thirties
and nukes friends they notice that all you surprised the wine f
oh no never
the old is nice bullet come into was you or your ball
don't is it you know you all live illinois you won't that
his
is so overwhelming that moment
scary moment
what it come with it
soybean income again
every play
so is scary you know his head and one day
you know that's possible
you way that volume
you've already had a black damn i like that
be angry be his life
we'll be right back


which kind of eerie feeling when you go to the block or no been selling drugs
most days friends are still there
doing their thing
get the sense that nothing's really changed
there's just a different kid in spot

his block was the corner of calhoun pratt that in west baltimore
there's a bodega on the corner
ball guys holding back the potato chips and people milling around
when his lies
women are being
dave
they married
we get out of murder
it's cold and what of next friends is inside that the degas watching the streets you the glass door what if you want for himself
see this
a theater leaf
and when we say get away meaning like we fought mean
if
remember him talking about them

the studio
so all of a sudden this police car pulls up this
arrogance
but not just like slows down and put on the brake and pulls up but like screech is practically bumping up onto the curb i mean goes from seventy to zero in like three seconds
any cops get out
yeah
or standing there in the middle of the street and this kind of absurd situation in which they're kind of bantering and they're all kind of insulting each other and you can't really tell what's going on
made it badly on the way and i'm sorry
then i add and nukes friend is just shouting about nice of belongs against him
when i was just riding a bicycle and you accuse me of haven't stolen it
oh driving too fast
you put me in the back of your police car and took me in a rough ride this before
freddie grade before they start known as the shit that they do that for you
did this you did value
for me
then one right
go
oh yeah yeah
have the police have no idea who i am and are confused by my presence
if you refer them or a reporter
focus on
yeah
okay
to israel
you're probably got a private server
it's clear there's this long history between them
like this is some your cat and mouse routine that both sides understand
got a baby
beg me
no thanks
for a few minutes of this the cops get in the car and drive off the suit
but i didn't really leave
the car kept buzzing the block i mean really accelerating like it was like on a race track or something
going around and around backing up really quickly tearing through an alley

i asked the guys i said this is usually happens when is he doing and they were like oh yeah that's what he does every deck
people your name
and i mean obviously this is a place where drugs are being sold the police should be here
but it's just the way that it's happening
he pops up on to the curb interested to people you have not
so
it looks friends
pretty and faced we'll see what would you want
all
in the midst of all of this guy's in the corner makes a drug self
just they seem very effective
what
any kind of occurred to me
oh this is exactly what we've been hearing about policing in baltimore after free grave
the police been trying to get away from their cave here
but don't know what to replace it with what to do instead
so what's left is this kind of half thing
this winding up of the hammer
but him i never comes down
and so you have these teenagers openly breaking the law
the cops still unsure how to police them
nothing's really happening
drugs are still being sold on the corners
and the kids were selling them keep dying
the four boys in that photograph they were all killed after freddie grey
yeah
and then just like that it's over
cops drive off
a knicks fan keeps talking to me about knock no different from
whoever the
we we the fourth
so
he made different new way
one particularly baltimore city
gets the money
when
no choice but to do
or starve
ebay don't come from a
a by don't come from new home
some i no choice but way
dat no bad
so this me it is really neat
something you take it a new house in me on steam
do you think know of
when you were younger
so what are you see when i was here
he rarely eighty though
by the only in relief
we started off him and his mother
mm
silly kind of had a choice pretty kind of
candace sawyer



oh
or
or or
oh
what

next time he thinks he did have a choice
no probably right now be at cornell or something like there are some with i mean this is for the most part of family they kept rising like mary and the accountant
or is great i'm gina who built in very successful business
she got pregnant at sixteen
and worked three jobs so her son murray's could go to private school
ragu
regret
are you
an hour or whatever
right
you got a a
walk right out
oh no armor
our out about their army
got out army or you

some people love the street
something not to do some people have little choice but to be but some people can do better if did not given an opportunity some people it's eleven and can make that choice can go away it right or left and some people just love the street by you have some guys love doing business have
something you love what you do some people some people who love the street life some people love been in the mix some people feel more comfortable and the street
whether the whatever whatever reason they feed off the energy of the outside
the possibility of merited safe selling drugs do all the shiites the miss him
he got to be on a swivel somebody is trying to get some people pops that's the heartbeat of the life
the more i listened to everyone in his life talk the more i was thinking
false choice
wasn't really a choice for him
he was a little kid
he wanted to be with his mom
and his mom was in that world
and his mom loved him fiercely and he left her too and he would have been unreasonable to expect that he would have stayed living away from her forever
so knock as a little kid
chose his mom the street came with her
every near san hit again went to call the police
the
the economy's
a hard question is how question it
and as gate
that's a question that she would don't know if he because if their own shell hit again and eight
guess where where's it at home as the here
charlie now companies down on apple and a snapple areas and this might not right
atticus at night and that then there's by eddie by saying so selfish
you don't know who to trust everybody is a everybody wanted that and everybody can get a then as again
and when escape or one day they if they want to trade though
asked her if she thought no choice
didn't really answer but she did say this
was this guy he have a
baby this
lita eight the day if old a fatty
ladies on his way
is where are the on thing without any do it again oh is that it is gonna be right in a family it's down do it and she saying all of this i'm realizing she sounds proud of him for being a leader in this world and could he have stay for camp or just like can't work at the line
for example like with him off or something like that
didi it was there is now the angle they couldn't wait
that's not him
that way
no on that the spaceship a is points to the mall or they can get up and take a day in the house is going to be built at the end
angle me no other way and it became be that way and will be no
i kind of stopped me my tracks
here was someone who loved her son so much admired her son so much
but he lived in its upside down land and they were very very few ways to make it as they side
this was the fastest way and was good at it
he was important in that world a leader
and she didn't want to take that away from him
she wasn't gonna stand in his way and stuff
if glad this is to normalcy
every berlin employee malice he get a he
like so a death
this is asked and
they will make life
each generation tries to you
next generation better
my grandfather went to my mobile the me to her with these don't be better than meetings ever better than me so on the flip side of the spectrum on a street right now
ill be deeper in the streets to me as a nurse him and raise him just like i am now to be stopped them a nurse and raise them to be the streets like a mobster to marry his son to be a master them with the world's to maybe get made and go higher and become the ball to the fail weasel he didn't make that makes it so of street you can
the same they intentionally or unintentionally and you think that's what happened

use what else in the tunnel
the results of tuesday's primary boating in california
the single most important battleground for democrats trying to retake bows are still coming in but as of wednesday morning
early returns seem to show that democrats are in the top positions in the key districts where they are hoping to reclaim seats previously held by republicans california is unusual primary system allows the top two candidates to advanced to the general election were card list of party
which had raised fears that democrats could be locked out all together in the final round of voting democrats think that california could give the party a third of the seats they need to regain control of congress
and shove it up
have enough work with american people
that we should be here during the week on tuesday senate majority leader mitch mcconnell cancelled most of the senate's annual august recess in a move that could keep democratic lawmakers off the campaign trail ahead of this fall's elections
mcconnell said the decision would give the senate time to complete important legislative work but the times report it is as much a political maneuver that would force nearly a dozen democratic senators to choose between missing votes in washington
and defending their vulnerable seats back at all
oh good greater cooperation but everybody should anticipate that will will bigger


that's it for the daily i'm michael see
oh



from the new york times and the team that brought you the daily this is kathy
good
what we're up to me lie i slept
what appears to be an event and villa here
on the outskirts of western muscle as we were in bed
with the counterterrorism division of the iraqi security force
and we were supposed to take off at eight or now sitting in the armored car that they provided for us
car is not your armored cars about turning on though
having a gaggle of men that are
pouring over the hood trying to figure out how to get this car car started
there's a rumor that it may just be at a gas could that is a route they're just figured out against great great
is it just out of days
temporary the briefcase
eventually after several hours yeah we get a working car and to go so we suit up we put on flak jackets to put on
i've got several trash bags
with the elite and counterterrorism force of the iraqi army
their permission to go and collect documents wednesday
and we've told them that were specifically trying to get to one building years or so
just goes but it's unclear if it's going to be safe enough to go there but there's a sniper risking their winning an airstrip
in fact they've warned us that we're driving into an active worse


no inside muslim

there's huge chunks missing on the road
those air strikes
russia of certainty that

how could you describe what you see
shaking your head really
yeah
i'm speechless
as you can select
cars
that was to have to have to be known as cars and degree in
or
i can tell i'm i know as much it's i don't know what a
you don't even recognize it
stuff

we got into the city
we got a car yeah
what do you see
they were parked on a narrow street
in western muzzle the house is all around us have been destroyed the windows up and blasted about coils of reaper the gates and windows of the shops
are warped from whatever blast they experienced we just open the doors to the car and immediately you could smell the stench of dead bodies we can't see them but you can smell them


so next we went to night
that's kind of like a makeshift base basically the closest the military position to where we are trying to go inside there were all of these young military men they were actually from the city asked the counterterrorism server say and they're the people that were embedded with so they invited us and and you
talking with some time
right click for sure
the commanders all have the same sort of phone and sort of i pad that has a mouth
isis
that shows you incorrectly town friend
spot where the friendly forces are and where as so real so the building were aiming for was actually a church this is the place but i knew has been the headquarters of the has been that the religious police the same unit that that was a fun used to be a member of the has been building
he's right here it's at that point is running
hoc recognize the sly and you went on my cart were actually

have these buildings
all so the officer who was in charge of this remains say that he's gonna try to find something is going to try to find us an escort to go to the historical
he assigned a couple of iraqi soldiers to escort us as we were going to go into this these buildings to be productive speak of like meters to be like
it would have been a couple of minutes walking if there was ruined
they walking and naturalists that to be trained how to clamber over for all of this problem
climbing over it looks like he's to be a taxi are we were walking on top of the doorways poking through windows curving around the pillars of homes that had
the no climbing over pieces of wood want to believe
a cloak use it as
so on this walk that we took towards church
it became very apparent just how close you
somebody has to the front lines i mean in a way hearing the sounds reassuring
because it's a signal that we were where we needed to be good run out and get out some trash bags were about to go into the building
finally we got to the church and did you just quit before we walk in what sort of things you're hoping to find
we know that they have careful very detailed meticulous records of the people they arrested and the severe punishments but they needed out against them and obviously that would just be the gold mine of variables
the second we walked and even though it was destroyed this has on number i knew right away that have been an isis spaces the isis weekly newsletter they had graffiti the pillars and other walls with the word but what what does that mean the key word the that which means remaining an expanding and this is their slogan
this is think of it as isis forever
plenty of computers
hard drives yen town
we found this way on
a couple of did
the mulder we found two bodies that the iraqi military said would than isis fighters
gets to get first and we don't walk over their bodies
just seriously
yeah i mean i hate to sound clinical about this but to me it was my confirmation that were in place for is a place that isis fighters were in that the protected and they die for
so searching for documents what what's the first thing that you're looking for
so i'm looking for the areas that are related to papers i'm looking for furniture desks filing cabinets shouts closets
i'm looking on the floors
hey her
i wanted to ask
if it's possible to pick up that backpack that's what we saw a backpack
it's pink bad that has a kitten on it and it's filled with the for which is the explosive that they use in their homemade rockets
don't bring it
in that same area
there were shell casings remnants of weaponry
after the side there was a hole in the ground that look like it was the tunnel we know that isis uses tunnels as a way to go underneath the building and come out and another one so that they avoid the tax from the allergen at the bar
op has found an old sword and they found one of the it's that they used for executions to thank you
the people yes
actually able to pick it up and and hold it
now it's thought that was a certain feeling yeah you describe what you're doing
looking at a notebook here have the courage and then we started to find the remnants of the documentary series with yeah and you on the ground you picked up a toy and piece of paper it was from the letterhead of the has anything remaining meaning we found
several bikers that were labeled the one of his but which means for ministry of the religious police and this downturn a found says the same business this found their spine the binders had been bhutto of the his book so when the road with the binders were empty
what place pike
was the scene of a crime that had already been searched i don't know who searched before us that isis come through here and take away all of these records because we knew that they would reveal the accounting of the various war crimes they committed was that another security force that was here before the one that we are with but no matter what their records that i was looking for
they will on
still gunfire

and on a certain point in a hurry to get back people are starting to feel nervous about how much time we had spent in this area that we had expose ourselves for too long ago
kind of thing i could go
definitely one of those people who was feeling nervous
so he began to walk back and two of our colleagues have already walked off and you and i and hock are walking in a smaller group a little bit further behind
and suddenly her cause
because he recognized that often a sign of the church i hadn't even noticed that there was a cluster of buildings and he recognized them because he had worked as a translator format more sense
he was outed by a neighbour and he was hauled off to see one of the caddies the religious touch in this building who threw them in jail for basically i i think a night
there was a risk
question here and so we met us to make her way through the debris there and we entered the room that's what used to this this is the judges robe
ago and the cardio ropes were still hang the rule but he was wearing when he was charging people like hulk hulk remember sitting in that fairy tale
a the you
my name off we go through his desk we see that the drawers have already been pulled out and heart just took off and like ended up going into the next set of rooms and the next other rooms
many more buildings
government and suddenly he came walking out
this with a briefcase
he was putting it down to try to get the dust off of it
and he unzipped the main zipper and suddenly i saw i d's financial reports receipts and i recognized very quickly the islamic state uncle on those papers
just enough to realize that this was something really significant
ever wonder because it actually was so hot and we had been out in the sun for so on the cable and my microphone rank was melting a microphone was going in and out and that was fidgeting with it you guys were over there talking in it was in this moment that the new york times push came through your
i'm your attempts to iraq or government claims muzzles been taken saying that the iraqi government was claiming victory and most all right




just explain what you're doing as you to hell down because it's going to be a lot of crap that that isn't this in this trash bag of of stuff that we're bringing out really dirty okay so you and how can i get back to our hotel in a safe part of iraq
let's take off your shoes we grab one of the garbage bags with some of the stuff that we've gotten in mosul
the briefcase
can just walk me through like what are the steps that you take next sure
so we put on surgical gloves
and we empty out the contents of the garbage bag
oh
oh you just go this will cause district
it's like what you would smell if you were in an air strike and a building was falling around you
and we start making piles were going to make pile of important and unimportant okay what we're seeing right away is as a card that this person's prank grow
protect her there are books every received suitcase there are financial reporter so honest take the receipts motherfuckers there are memos modes
how exciting
there are letters on isis stationary between different ministries of i says and this like attorney general
having detailed discussions about aspects of the economy
this is very new evidence of a bunch of departments i didn't know existed as there are people's ideas
years is there a c d roms and eventually everything that we have is going to be translated and the best part is going to be sent to specialists who are going to help us mine every bit of the information we have
tell me how you feel really really excited over like getting you know
i will admit that i've never felt more like a detective finding clues
on isis that
you know when i'm holding these documents the thing that's never far from my mind is that if we hadn't retrieved fairly papers from the rubble be very likely would have been destroyed and would have been lost forever and started to slow you down but will you just described what the bag looks like so it's a black laptop glad that that i so when it comes
to the briefcase specifically yeah what made it so impersonal yeah he forfeited time
so the documents were pulling out of the briefcase he he's like some kind of accounting for something help confirm and flesh out the reporting i've already been doing up until this point after you just described how it looks looks for the organizer investors like actual actual
kind of watch it yeah sure
and that is that isis is a self sustaining organism when it comes to its own finances much like the united states makes money from a million different sources so to isis had a diversified portfolio they were making money from the fields that they taxed from the seeds that they sold to people from the
wow it went to mills and from the traders who were being taxed as they were moving flowers from one city to another and from the merchants who stalked those commodities who had to pay income taxes once a year
and why is that specifically important to know so what of the major ways that america and european governments try to combat terrorism since nine eleven was to try to store of these groups of cash in the early years all kind of the way they did this is they would look for their external donors and they would freeze
their bank accounts
but there are no major donors in the ecosystem that as isis because the group is self financed there's no bank account and saudi arabia that you can freeze that would have any meaningful impact on the letter of the islamic state there's not even a single source of weapons that you can cut off because according to one of the other documents we found in the briefcase
faculty of military manufacturing and development oh my god oh my god this is a razor they had a division and side of their military that was dedicated to the manufacturing of weaponry and kissing this is a river
the piece of paper the heart will only touch with gloves you're just kissed
to create a very important part of going to put that
so basically this is indicating that within the islamic state there's a unit that is dedicated to manufacturing and developing weaponry
assume that this is there because they're doing the dumb and such a uniform passion but this is it finally you know what is this a group that was hell bent on been independent her on being self sufficient on relying on know what
this guy who the owner of this band and indus briefcase some go and some head gotten some big big should we found transactions totaling nineteen million dollars we actually took the time to add up the receipts and invoices that we found inside and that's what we came up with ninety million right
we knew that whoever owned this briefcase
had to be important
hi up like a general or something like that not a general a bureaucrat

so unlike the united states which went into iraq in two thousand and three and immediately dissolved the bath us state of saddam hussein and essentially through all of these people these administrators into unemployment and created the conditions that eventually led to to the rise of terror groups in
iraq
isis did the exact opposite they came to muzzle and they built their state on the back of the one that are already existed
and so the civil servants who had worked in the ministry of agriculture and the department of sanitation and the electricity division they kept doing the same job that they had done before
true brother sorry this so we know that whoever it was who on his briefcase they worked as a bureaucrat that's right and beyond that what were able to figure out from looking at the papers it's all the same name is that the person's name is obliterate we're seeing paper paper signed with this name
actually help us identify who this human being is because i put her on is a code name of the cornea it's a nom de guerre and the whole purpose of having a kenya is to hide the identity of the person who's who's nice
but in the briefcase in one of the fault of the briefcase we pulled out a color xerox have an id belonging to a man named yasir arafat other you see his picture it's a man with a receding hairline with bulbous knows bushy eyebrows and kind of saddam hussein our style mustache
and then pulled out the marriage certificate of us are escorted this an important but finally the document that we pull out that seals the deal is yes there is tighter of allegiance to isis
i'm going to put that in important
we see that in twenty fourteen not long after our most all fell in mosul he pledged allegiance to the islamic state it has his full name and says that hairs kenya or his nom de guerre is about her so we now know yes or his or his avatar okay
and average aura is the administrator of the division so now you know his job title on now we know his jacket got married married
his real name within his own name you know his wife's may you know his wife's day you know when not it all hang on let's put that in the sky
what do you do next right so now that we have all this information
we're looking for somebody who might have interacted with him and in the briefcase we found a whole bunch of documents from local mills in northern iraq and especially from the area
nevertheless they hook up with them and so how can i ended up driving from mil to mil trying to find people who might remember a man named
you and the employees of the mills and the silos and the greenery
and the very people who had dealt with isis leadership
gave recognized as name
and they knew him specifically as one of isis is money
he was a person who was
deposited by isis to come and collect cash
yeah
they said he was very taciturn really kind of just business as always
and one of the people who interact with the most with he said
up
he always had a black laptop briefcase with him

so on his id there's a couple of clues that led us to be able to identify his address it lists the name of his parents his mother and his father and crucially it lists his tribal affiliation he's from the audi tribe which is an important tribe from central iraq
using those close we were able through our colleagues in the baghdad bureau to track down his family in a suburb of summer
so this was after i'd already feinberg states when you and hawk and your manager and remark
you guys actually went to the house of the honor of the briefcase right
yeah
so
we walk in and first of all it had all of the trappings of this aristocratic house
enormous high ceilings chandelier and every single rom beautiful tapestries in this enormous like banquet hall sort of space
this is the
who's there
is there has been as went on his older brother
it's the family of the owner of the briefcase it's has uncle it's his brothers it's several of his cousin
was that was basically a lot of maintenance
and they immediately begin playing on that they raise their voices they're angry at our suggestion that obama was a member of isis and they say to us how can this even be possible
this is the scion of an important family he had all of his needs taken care of he had no need for money why is that you can go to be pointing to their money in this way there's almost an accepted hypothesis i would call it a cliche or even a mean that members of isis have joined for material
that they did it for the money because his or her were poured they were kinda birds they were these kind of hapless people who had no other outlets and the big bad terrorist group comes along and basically buys them off
i have found that that hypothesis is mostly hollow and if you dig even slightly below the surface you'll find that people that tried did so because we have some ideological infinity pneumonia
yeah and he was employed by the director it off the hear someone of salmonella
up to this point they don't know that i have the records in my backpack showing exactly how good iraq join this group and as i mentioned that they begin to tell us a story that goes i think a long way to explaining why this young man would have joined the islamic state
the family described to us that soon after the us invasion in two thousand and three in the middle of the night
the door was beaten down by us soldiers who came in with their with their money boots and dragged the elderly patriarch of the family which your granddaughter out of his bedroom and took him away to be questioned because of an idea that had gone off on a nearby road you saying that they they blamed him they were lame
yeah i'm i'm going into they blame the grandfather for having planted a landmine that took the lives of of several us marines
as it turned out he must not have been guilty because the family told us that he was released the next day
this is a wealthy affluent family that is used to people telling to them that is used to people taking their shoes off when they come and that is used to getting getting flattered you know getting gifts getting talk to in a polite way and this was an incredibly humiliating incident
and one of the details that stuck with the family but they told me about his grandfather was actually an and you walk with crutches and when the soldiers came and they screamed at him to to follow them he didn't understand what was going on and as it was he couldn't walk and so they grabbed him by his arms and literally pulled him
down the stairs and then up the driveway the family remembers his feet bobbing and hitting the stairs that was as there was going down and then and then seeing him dragged through the dirt up there there inclined well as neighbors came out to gawk or more warm and
it was bad enough that the american commander in the area came and apologize to the family and we got that account not just from the family but also from the police station up the street
so
at a certain point we hear a woman's voice from the hallway
i see
no it's explained to me that this is the mother of arbitrary he's very curious about what's happening because you understand that we're talking about her son but because there's a conservative family she did not feel that it was appropriate for her to join us but she has her ear to the door and hear something that upsets her and suddenly she's yelling through the door
this isn't it
when they were so what we did is monique invited the mother
to come with me and with him
and hock to a table that was essentially at the other end of this cavernous partner
i'm all for what
but because i want
and we sat across from her at this beautiful teak table covered in lace i remember that there was a crystal ball in the middle and one by one we started pulling out the documents
and then
she started
he's hitting her own face with her palm
and then very soon after that she has started weeping that
oh well
whoa whoa
yeah
through a lot of you said oh did i
was asleep
graeme that
all of items like the
it also afraid own
she had concerns about the people he was hanging out with when isis took over
any extremists tennessee's and then the second thing he said is for them
they out of all of my sons or he is the one who took the humiliation of his grandfather the worst on there
human only own business but what what all
it's the
yeah a level
tell her cousins
i have how many letters i have spoken to could tell her it's not ok
yet
and here is where you see the catch twenty two of using military power to try to address terrorism
we know that the us invasion created a buddha ross created people like this young man who were humiliated who were angry and who turned that anger into affiliation with this terror group and it's because of that very phenomenon that that the obama administration put off the eventual into
mention that only reached muscle and the five twenty six team because they wanted local forces to lead the fight they didn't want to have us troops on the ground veering that this would just perpetuate the cycle but if you don't use monetary my what you have is the rise of muscle so both as
news in different ways can lead to the further spawning of the group right the world is divided into the interventionist camp and the past the first cap
and what i have seen from my reporting is the intervention leads to the withdraws the non intervention leaving the syrian civil war to drag on for years leaves topple hussein france

so where's a goon draw now
i don't know
i repeatedly asked the family where he is and i'll do they were very clear and saying that they knew that he's top five which led me to think that they must be talking to him
they were incredibly vague about his whereabouts now going so far as to say that they have no contact with him they're not sure where he's at etc
i mean for all i know he could have been upstairs the whole time that we're talking
i mean regardless of whether or not he really was upstairs
what we do now is that thousands of members thousands have managed to escape they shaved after beards they cut off their hair they changed her clothes they slipped into a refugee camps they managed to get back into europe and they're out there
but we also know is that some of them were captured

why are they telling us rest of your control
i think that's necessary

hi everyone it's michael there's been some questions about our decision not to run excerpts from a times interview with stephen miller the white house advisor as we had planned to do in this episode some further context my colleagues julie davis and michael sheer interviewed miller as part of their reporting for a prince
story on the white house is current practice of separating parents and children at the border
they had recorded it for fact checking purposes and it was only after the story was published with on the record quote from miller that the daily requested to air the audio as part of an interview with julie about her reporting the white house objected because the terms of the original interview had not included
it's use on the daily we recognize that the ground rules for the interview or not clear and so we made a decision not to use the audio there was much discussion about this decision and we took it very seriously
from the new york times on michael
this isn't it

today
president trump continues to blame democrats for his administration's practice of separating parents and children at the
so why is one of his top eight steven miller claiming credit

it's tuesday june ninth
i have put employees a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry on us out west or you the southwest or unlawfully then we will prosecute you said
children are being separated from the parents at the border at an accelerated rate because of a new a zero tolerance policy being implemented by the trump administration the associated press reports between april nineteenth and may thirty first nearly two thousand children were separated from their parents a white house says my goal is to deter a little bored
no crossings the democrats say family a separation is inhumane and want to
usually you talked recently with stephen miller present it trumps domestic policy advisor about this very controversial situation playing out at the border with parents and children being separated and we were going to hear that audio on the shoulder right
julie davis covers the white house and immigration for the times we were no i heard from the white house earlier today bad day were not at all comfortable with using that audio be when i went in the west wing to interview even know nowhere with night last year in high you're at the time
the purpose was we were doing a big deep dive story on my aberration brackets broken out all over the country and we didn't talk about any sort of alternative
the interview and when they found out that his voice was actually going to be on apart after disgusting have a were not happy about it after fun to use that
so instead of hearing that audio we're going to talk to you about the conversation you had with stephen miller and his thinking around this practice so how does to talk about how the immigration system used to work he eventually talked about it as an open borders approach where there was no i'm
essentially only immigration well as is obviously a law against crossing the border unlawfully but in the past it's often been charge as a civil infraction so you're taken into custody by immigration authorities if you claim later on that she were seeking asylum your health for a time
and given a court eight after which you have to show up and plead your case isn't a file and claimant others are put in immigration detention and if you're traveling with a child
you were treated differently
how so first of all there was a settlement decree and nineteen ninety seven known as as that essentially it's bad that if an unaccompanied child was apprehended at the border a could not be how of immigration detention indefinitely in fact they couldn't be held for very long period of time at all and the time
period that was decided upon was about twenty days
the immigration crisis is intensifying president obama today requesting emergency fund a mostly to keep on documented children from coming here to the united states and to help send them back despite his come from central america el salvador guatemala and hundred euro
where immigration officials are moving more than a thousand undocumented killed to this makeshift detention center this weekend more than two hundred and twenty immigrants have died crossing that us mexico border since october and more than fifty two thousand unaccompanied kids have been detained in that same time period at the height of the central america
and migration crisis under barack obama they were playing a huge amount of families arriving at the border
and they were holding them in immigration detention for quite a long period of time the obama administration is facing broad criticism for its handling of the serbs of undocumented immigrants crossing the border immigration lawyers are once again suing the obama administration over its practices immigrant family detention they were stewed and a fair
errol judge decided in two thousand and sixteen at this twenty day time limit should apply to you not just unaccompanied immigrant children but immigrant children who were accompanied by their parent in other words family so essentially if you are going to hold a family together you can't hold them for more than twenty days
an immigration detention
so essentially what you had is a flooded people arriving at the border believing that they could make an asylum claim it would be taken into custody temporarily and a would be given a time when they could appear back to leave their case and in the meantime they would be released into the interior of the country and this is what the president and even miller
referred to as catch and release and you're supposed to show up for your game before and immigration judge but in reality many people never do so
essentially a ban is the major objection here if you're asking that you have administration that effectively there was no penalty for crossing the border illegally because people never paid a price and a were allowed into the country

so are most of them
crossing the border to seek asylum or the trying to sneak undetected him the country and just been caught
some people of course they're trying to sneak across the border without being caught but the vast majority of people that were talking about are at least staying at a want to claim asylum they're saying they have a credible fear of returning to their country because of gang violence or be persecuted or for some other reason okay and an all those to do
relations whether they're seeking asylum or not under the obama administration these families would stay together
right so by the strict letter of the law crossing the border illegally is a criminal act on the books but in the past before present from it often wasn't prosecuted as a criminal act and the result of that was that by prosecuting it as a civil violation many people were released in
the u s and they effectively succeeded in crossing the border of the u s
that's right and the problem was compounded by the fact that there is a huge backlog a years long backlog of asylum claims and so essentially it would be years before they ever got around to eat even determining whether you deserved to be granted asylum
so from the perspective of stephen miller and the tramp point house for a whole variety of reasons unintended consequences of legislation and court rulings and some decisions made by past administrations it is now currently in the interest of someone crossing the border to
come with children right and that's to steve miller a problem if you're trying to crack down on on documented immigration
that's great and i mean i'll talk about how smugglers are bad people and they will do what they need to do to get people across and if that means having them cross with somebody that's posing as their child that's certainly not outside the realm of possibility and has happened before they also talk about the fact that you can't have a whole class of people for any
crime or any offense that it's just simply exempted from the laws by dint of the fact that there with a child at one point in our interview he said imagine if in the context of domestic law if you said that the speed limit doesn't apply to you if you have a child in the backseat you can you imagine what the consequences of that would be and one of the
things he says is a lot more child endangerment and that is in fact his argument that you're putting children in danger because you're essentially encouraging people to use them
as a means to get across the border which is a very dangerous trip it's a very dangerous crossing and then when they get into the country certainly it could be a pretty dangerous road ahead for them
so in his mind this is a humane policy i think you use the word humanitarian in his interview with you because it discourages people from taking a risk his trip with children across the border or using someone else has children
the masks to legally get to the country
right he says are as the humanitarian policy and i think that's actually for two reasons one is you're essentially trying to discourage people from putting children in a dangerous situation or using them as a means of breaking the law but then in another sense this is where even miller and the president make the sort of pivot to
the broader immigration system which they stay essentially is so lax and so insufficiently enforce that you're and essentially endangering american citizens to potential crimes by illegal border cross there's they talk about the fact that there's families separation when you take a child away from someone who is
i'm awfully cross the border but there's also a permanent am a separation when an illegal immigrant murderers and american citizen if you really care about families if you really don't want families to be broken apart you really need to fix the system and do all of the things the president has asked for including build a wall including make it more difficult to be eligible for asylum in this country
including cutting legal immigration and all of these other things that have really nothing to do with the current crisis so this is also an act of humanitarian ism according to stephen miller on behalf of the american people
indeed
so this does seem like a genuinely challenging problem for the federal government crossing the border is an illegal act but so many people crossing com with children and you can't kill children and you can't hold families for long periods of time and there's a true
mendez administrative backlog so it does feel like an impossible situation
well it is an impossible situation and that's why administrations have struggled with that for so long when george w bush first implemented and one hundred percent prosecution policy the there was quite a bit of discussion around what do you do with family is but ultimately it was decided that you know there was no way
you're going to take a child away from their parent you're going to keep them together and there going to be a different path but it was sounds like you're saying it was considered a policy of separating families and children
it's always been on the table there's no question that has always been on the table my colleague michael scherer talk to the domestic policy adviser under obama billion when us and she's dead you know he basically talked about it for about five minutes and thought we just can't do that that's not who we are but clearly presidents have understood that this is an option that you know it would make things a lot
it's simpler and more clear cut but no one was really willing to go there including by the way the trump administration john kelly then the homeland security secretary now the white house chief of staff said publicly in an interview early last year that he was considering doing this in order to deter people from making the dangerous journey from central america to the us
porter and there was a ton of controversy a bunch of senators confronted him about it on capitol hill and he ultimately that no no no we're not going to do that
but clearly debate inside the white house and the administration continued about it and people recognize that you know there was something effective about the idea of a black and white policy that we prosecute everybody and everybody gets treated the same way and to heck with the consequences

we'll be right back

usually what does that actually look like on the ground once it's deployed it's pretty grim i mean basically what's happening is you have people coming across and they're being arrested and taken in most cases to federal prisons and their children are being taken into immigration detention at first
have seen some of the pictures of these facility youth there in one case in a converted walmart
you know have cordoned off area is often times with and thing they have caught or mattresses the bond they have space blankets the many cases and it's sort of like a mini cross between a prison in a daycare center i guess
that
and they're held there and then you know ultimately the idea is that the government has to transfer them to the least restrictive setting as soon as possible and in many cases they're trying to place them with foster parents either family members were illegally in the united states they can go stay with or people who are willing to
to take them in until they can be reunited with their peers



so
hundreds of children in this country who might enter into foster care as a result of even though their parents are very much alive and very much here that's right and one of the issues here and then you know how people can find where their children have gone i mean we were told by the department of homeland security last week
in a six week period but about two thousand and children have been separated from families that we think of the scale of trying to find where each child has been spent and get them back to their parents their parents by the way or in deportation proceedings they may be deported
theoretically a weather department of homeland security has said is and the department of health and human services which is in charge of holding the children is that the child will be reunited with the parent as soon as their immigration case is finish that is theoretically what happens but in practice what we're hearing is that it's pretty difficult to make
that happened in people are having trouble finding their kids and and is not totally clear that they have a process in place to efficiently reunite the children with their parents at least not in a timely way
if the idea of this and according to miller this is the idea of it was to clean up our immigration system this does not sound simpler it's not simple or at all and not only is it not simpler for the immigration is that some but it's also much more complicated and some
the justice department which essentially now has thousands and thousands more criminal cases to prosecute every day because of the decision to treat all of these people crossing the border
as criminal charges
so they then have to process this people and they have to go before a judge and men there's the additional challenge of the fact that now because the border stations are so clogged the we've heard reports of people not being able to even claim asylum so theoretically what you're supposed to do if you want to claim asylum is show up at a port of entry
hey i fear for my life i have a credible fear for change my country
and that is something that under us law everyone is supposed to be able to do but people have not been able to do that in recent months and so you have people who are showing up in between ports of entry and being charged with a crime even though they're saying i'm fleeing persecution in my country even the people who are showing up at ports of entry or having
trouble claiming asylum and that just shows you what strain the system is underwrite i'm curious if the goal of this whole approach is to keep these families out of the country why not just deal with the administrative backlog that you mentioned earlier so that these families will be processed within twenty
days and not have to be released into the us when the be simpler than this very old a hybrid an emotionally tormented process that is now under way while it would and the administration talks wistfully about being able to do that but they also say that they need changes to the law and order to make that a reality
so as long as it's as easy they claim as it is to claim asylum
you will have a backlog because there will be so many people flooding the system and they want to change the laws that they are more people who are just inadmissible without even processing their claim that they don't have a chance that all you her jeff sessions
a couple of weeks ago argue that a master abuse is no longer going to be counted as a criteria and for asylum claims the asylum system is being abused to the detriment of the rule of law sound public policy public safety even drew the detriment of people with just climb
through a psalm they are trying to get at this problem and a bunch of different way as one of which is having more people processing the claims another of would just saying let's try to clamp down on the claims themselves by making them a lot harder to be eligible for asylum sewing a few simple words claiming a fear of return is now transforming
a straightforward arrest for illegal entry an immediate return and jury prong legal process where an alien may be released from custody faith and truly believe that it is way too easy for people to come here and just kind of put their hands up and say i have a credible fear i have to let me in and
so they're looking for different ways to limit people's ability to do that and so changing the criteria for whether you can get asylum is one of them
but this zero tolerance one hundred percent prosecution policy also connects to that because if you're apprehended on the border
halfway crafting and you say i want to seek asylum that goes second in line to prosecuting you for the crime of illegally crossing the border
so essentially whereas other administrations have treated all of those people as asylum seekers this administration is making that secondary to the crime of having a they across the border
so under previous presidents those people have been treated first as asylum seekers ride and now the trump of integration is treating them first as criminals that's right

outraged go the troll the administration's policy of taking migrant children away from their parents protesters rally in los angeles
okay to do think that the current administration predicted that they would read this outrage to practice of separating parents from children at the border i don't think that they anticipated this at all i think that they up through the message of they were standing and the
theoretical merits of a zero tolerance
and they didn't quite contemplate the level of outrage that it would spark when they started taking children away from parents
our
not suffered heart
got stale
as have a child
my god

do you think it's possible that didn't quite understand what the result of zero tolerance would actually be that enforcing immigration law sounds good but he didn't really know that the result would be separated parents from children but stephen miller did understand that i think that's
entirely past all that he said i one zero tolerance and it's a great will do zero tolerance and they didn't get into the nitty gritty of well that means zero tolerance for infants in their mothers zero tolerance for you know that our it is the case know about you it's and pretty clear now four weeks what
logical and resulted this has been contrary to what he says that he needs the democrats to change the laws than he could tomorrow instruct the department of homeland security just start making exceptions or parents traveling with minor children but i do you think that the president although he doesn't like to take credit publicly for it
tends toward the even miller school of thought that this is a tough love thing we need to get control of the system if this is what it takes to do it this is what it takes and would never want to predict whether he's going to pull back on this because i think that the level of outrage that we're seeing around the country is pretty extraordinary but i do think the he
he seized the utility of this and it's a debate the he relishes adding i mean he will turn this on its handheld turn it upside down he will blame and on democrats he will say it's an honor of his opponents flunking open borders and to endanger the american people and it's a contest between someone who wants to keep you safe
him and people who don't want to keep you safe either democrats it's about finding the terms of the debate in a way that advantageous to him so yeah if you want to have a debate with him about is it morally a good age
separate parents from their children at the border
he's not going to engage not but if he can turn it into is tough but necessary to do so in order to protect the american people from brutal gangs and criminals
i think that's ground he is pretty comfortable on
thank you very much england

on monday the united nations top human rights zayed rod all hussein called for an immediate end to the practice of separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents the thought that any student would seek to the term parents burn and flip to such
abuse of children
unconscionable



here's what else you need to another
if i might i just wanted to they can boost a moon
immigration and what's up happening on monday at a meeting of the national space council president trough opened like doubling down on his claim that democrats are responsible for separating children from their parents at the border before making an unrelated announced my administration has reclaiming america
his heritage as the world's greatest space faring nation
the essence of the american charge of these to explore new horizons and to tame new frontier the president called for the creation of a six branch of the us armed forces devoted to outer space we are going to have the air force and we're going to have the space
face force separate but equal
that is going to be something the pentagon including trumps own secretary of defense james matters previously opposed the idea of a new military branch focused on space calling it costly and unnecessary when it comes to defending america it is not enough to merely have been
american presence in space we must have american dominance in space so important
that's it for the day i'm michael obama special thanks to republika for letting us use the audio from inside a detention center
see you tomorrow

from the new york times on michael barbara
this is the today
today
the two thousand and eighteen world cup is now underway in russia
the story of how it came to be there is more relevant than you might think
it's friday june twenty second
the fight for the right dose football world cup so did his final stage with candidate countries making their last presentations now are big names i've been arriving here in zurich and the media had their stake out in front of hotels we the important people are say it was a cold snowy morning in zurich switzerland where there
headquarters of fifa party that overseas world soccer's based the first tree from representatives arrived in zurich the ultimate decision makers for which country host the world cup a fleet of sleek black mercedes sedans drove into the bowels of course of fifa were twenty two men who control world soccer or march your
room make a decision where the twenty eight world cup would be out

can bend single rude about this story for the times there was a clear favorite everyone knew that england which was desperate to hold the world cup was the clear favorite england favorite to host the world cup and twenty eight team david beckham has been at the forefront of lobbying for the votes of the twenty two fifa committee members and everything
in their favor and stadiums and infrastructure at airports and hotels the world's greatest soccer tradition this was the country that invented the sport after all it was clear ingram it's going to win one of the ways i think the sell it to the world is the world watches english football the world comes and plays football in england and so bringing the world cup to england such
natural step so england is your favorite is there anybody else in contention yeah there are several other contenders there's a day between portugal and spain
one between holland and belgium
and there's another one which no one thinks as any chance at all russia
and why does no one think that russia has
fifa itself rated rushes to bed the worst of all the bits for twenty eight in with the worst infrastructure and the most problems
russia didn't have could occur at the time
so no one took them at that point time seriously as ah condition

but how seriously it was a russia taking its
at first it seemed like they weren't taking it at all they were barely making guidelines for filing different paperwork and he turned in by started to become a parent as time march toward that december boat russia might be taking it heck of a lot more seriously than people thought

so good is popular
is very popular all over the world
especially in russia
and he stood in to prove it i was born in length and girth
and as you know during world war two lane and get went through nine hundred base of blockade no electricity no running water
no food and know he'd in a rush russian the winter
but football matches were held even that tragic time football brings spock
into the lives of people young and old by the time of the vote in fifa battery uprooting had apply himself full time to the bed even appearing at a video making a final plea to fifa to choose russia so why do we think the couldn't suddenly cares about the world cup now
so remember this is two thousand and ten
this is a time when russia is trying really hard to change its relationship with arrest the world this is the time of the famous reset there is no event in the world that draws more eyeballs and woke up fish no opportunity for a liter sitting in a presidential box at the opening game to get more attention
then to be in the rocket
warm welcome to your life from our headquarters here in central moscow this is our team with me and nice and now it's two pm here in the russian capital twelve noon and zurich were in four hours time football's governing body will make arguably the biggest decision and sport will soon as the host for the two thousand twenty eighteen and twenty twenty two world cups waits for the
winners will spark a decade of multi billion dollar investment so going into this food in zurich england is the obvious choice russia is a longshot what do we know about what happens in this underground bunker when it's time to vote thing about this underground bunkers and no one's personal what happens down there it's one of the most secret places it's the beating heart of fifa
it's multiple stories underground
it's protected and such a way that no cellphone signals can penetrate this room
the walls are made of polish metal material that gives it doll sheen or the entire room overhead is a judge to layer above it a big squared able that looks like something out of dr strangelove like the order
joining this is prayer room mate out of glowing it internally lit alabaster nice twenty two members filed into this room that day the door was closed
and now to people's heard from them about what was happening
ooh
who
this is the public notary off the city of zurich it gives me the envelope
ladies and gentlemen after the vote everyone repairs to a different place where the press corps and many other people are waiting to get a result president of fifa at the time stands in front of the party and pose opened the envelope as his big reveal twenty eighteen
fifa both twenty eighteen fifa world cup later and gentlemen and will be organized
russia

so england is no no in fact when the dust settles in then found out it only got to vote out of the whole thing and they were the first country limited
so turns out they million a chance never had a chance
thermal gossiping i sorry you got it
i thought adjusting
much better than most
then russia the stadiums and sign of facilities we have we don't have a long way to go set it up is they should have got a hell of a long way to go cry
yeah i did i say
so what's actually going on here
how many is that russia managed to be that england and everyone else
at first seemed like a mystery no one can understand it but there was at least one person and you had a pretty good idea of what had happened
man was a retired british by living in london by the name of christopher steal the christopher still guess decrease for still the christopher still who wrote the dossier making a series of allegations against on trump involving his behavior and russia
that's correct the same one
christopher steel who was a spy for england for many years he had contacts to address and new perhaps as much as anybody about what was happening behind closed doors inside russia

and how exactly does this christopher steel get involved in looking into fifa or cup and russia when the twenty to game and crisper steel stopped being a spy for britain he opened a corporate intelligence for called orbis one of his first clients that orbis was the ink
wish bed to win the two thousand and eighteen world cup they hired and because of his expertise on russia to provide them intelligence and what the russian invade was up to two essentially investigate rivals to england try to better understand their pictures and their pets think of it as an insurance policy for their bid they are trying to find out as much information as they ended
everybody else because they think it will help their chances of winning
and what does christopher seal find out as is researching he's other bids and what's happened because for still finds out in the spring of twenty ten well before the vote funny things are starting to happen with a bit in his sources in russia and elsewhere in the world are telling him that their noticed anything untoward behavior on the behalf of russia
liquid his allegations that fifa voters are being bribed with paintings that potentially could have been taken from the hermitage museum quality paintings allegedly yes including one allegation which he never been proved that it because so many been given power of the fifa voters
yeah and what else there was a rumor of vote swapping deal involving qatar and gas pipeline that they wanted to construct were top allies of lot of your prudent were meeting with qatar people just about making gonna steal it seem to be a mask for maybe a vote trade and then there was the involvement of oligarchy very close to
gotta be approved by the name of romano but i'm a bitch
who is famous in soccer circles because he owns chelsea
very famous hundred in london
program which was a figure who in general stay out of the public i didn't get involved in anything and he had suddenly became very active in supporting the russian dead
and

so essentially steals research suggests that russia has been
more or less systematically trying to bribe and manipulate the fifa officials were going to vote on who he get walk up to oh that's right

we'll be right back

okay so customers feel compiles all these allegations all these bits of information about how russia seems to be bribing fifa officials and what do you do with it
he has two things first house is quiet english big that you're up against so much fiercer foe when they might have anticipated but then he does something else something a bit unexpected
he calls a new friend be as their lives in new york who happens to be an ancient the federal bureau of investigation
invites this asian who is a specialist in russian organized crime
to come to london and meet with him because he's got important tip farm and that's when he tells this ban
thief is worth looking into russia appears to be up to no good
why would this be of interest to the federal bureau of investigation and united states this is seemingly has nothing to do with the f b i
it's a good question
f b i had that time was very interested in what he called trans national crime it was interested in different kinds of crime the cross borders this is initiative under the director at the time
robert mother
mother wanted agents to look for cases that involve money laundering and movements if money across borders and this seemed like an opportunity to do that since christmas steel knew that the f b i was looking for those kind of case isn't particularly that agent when he got this information about fifa he thought it might fall into their we lost

so steel has given us information to his employer the british government and gives it to this f b i agent what happens after that
something you wouldn't expect necessarily english who you would think be the most interested in finding out that russia was up to no good apparently do nothing mainly it seems because they're so scared of offending people in fifa we're going to vote the they don't wanna say a word for fear of ruffling feathers
agent who had a background bus in italian mafia in brooklyn doesn't really know anything about fifa is not interested in soccer but he knows it could case when he smiles on it
so he finds a prosecutor in a federal court in brooklyn
and convince him to open a case and roughly around late summer of two thousand eight and is when the colonel case against fifa secretly be end
it turns out it's really hard to make a case against international soccer bandits
the us investigation of soccer corruption labour it on for over a year without significant break he wasn't until late two thousand and eleven when they finally were able to make a major step forward by flipping one of the twenty two men who was in that room in the bunker that's right and has of them
this was the only american in the room
by the name of chuck blazer who coincidence or not lived in the trump tower
chuck glazer and scheme to millions of dollars for the game over the years and had huge income but he had a nervous tic have never filing tax returns are paying taxes and when the internal revenue service which had joined to case him aware of this they saw gold opportunity and in late november twenty eleven
guy and era approach champ glazer and told him he had a choice either go to jail or cooperate with us investigation in place or immediately signed on

when blazer flips and becomes a cooperate or they put in newark then they can wear a wire and then make phone calls to make him traveled to different places
and he also provides them a tremendous amount of information about how he operates he told them that woke up votes in that bunker were very frequently marred by bribery he admitted himself to taking bribes from allocation of the two thousand and ten world cup which was held in south africa he made it clear to them that bribery was the of the day with in fifa and so on with this information from place
the wiretaps it's confessions what this investigation go
this investigation was conducted in total secrecy and no one knew anything about it but the o j with iris in the f b i was secretly rolling up one informant after another building but turned out to be enormously aggressive and ambitious case that case finally bus into a world view on may twenty seventh two thousand and fifteen it has been
dramatic day and switzerland and after the arrest of high ranking officials from the headquarters of rural football's the fall out of spreading across the world the fastest growing sport in america got a swift kick today several top officials have soccer's world governing body were arrested and a massive bribery scandal top officials arrested
by police and a dawn raid in zurich they face extradition to the united states whether wanted for questioning about kickbacks involving one hundred million dollars and what are they arrested for their already said for wire fraud for money laundering and particularly for racketeering including an official alleged should have taken more than ten
ten million dollars in bribes prosecutors say briefcases full of cash decided media and marketing rights even the site of the world cup they were being charged by the department of justice being members of criminal conspiracy to the department of justice was describing fifa as essentially a mafia organization
man for today's announcement
i'm honored to be joined today by director james colony of the f b i buy within hours gym me the f b i director and the red a the attorney general held a press conference in brooklyn where they mouse to the world event undertaken this massive investigation focused at the very heart
it's an honor to join the attorney general in the us attorney to announce important case soccer football is an egalitarian sport it is the beautiful game because that is flat it is available to anyone and everyone no matter where you come from richer for boy or girl you can enjoy the beautiful game of the game according to
the allegations in this indictment was hijacked that feel that is so famously flat was made tilted in favor of those who were looking to gain at the expense of countries and kids were enjoying the game soccer this is not the way things should be and the work will continue until all
the corruption has uncovered and messages sent around the world that this fund will not be tolerated i wonder if it had to be the united states that did this that investigated this case and made these arrests because our country's relationship to soccer is so different from the rest of the world and so much thinner
did did take an outsider to treat fifa as criminals i think you've put your finger on it
every other country the world cares too much about soccer to ever do anything in the history of investigations donor countries of sci fi of soccer corruption is incredibly minimal
in the end he s could do it because there is no political pressure on agents who want to build a case against soccer they could operate with a lot of freedom in a way that i think could have been impossible in almost any of the country that unwind reminds me of the fact that england lost its bid in part because of this and did nothing that's right you did nothing and in fact they even tried to prevent
journalists from publishing reports that would show fifa corruption in the days leading up to the vote december twenty two so a lot of these countries are just accepting the corruption and fifa that's right they considered it a cost of doing business with the most popular sport in the world and i guess from their perspective fifa officials are
odds
there's a higher order being who are to be treated the highest level of respect and white glove service and whatever they want their post again
who
good evening ladies and gentlemen
just the will i would like to see
thank you
from bottom of my heart
thank you
ladies and gentlemen
each bid is very special and significant
he is a challenge
and we are born to been in the stuff and fan find
so all these high level fifa officials are ensnared in this corruption investigation they are arrested they're paying a cost but i don't think i heard you mention any consequences for russia far as we know there's been no consequences from russia
the us correction is never mentioned russia
the ministry went up in their fifa for its part open an investigation of russia but when it went to russia and asked them for their computers have a good review them they were told that the computers had been destroyed and there was no evidence whatsoever just happened to the district that happened to have been destroyed there was no records any more of their bid
but he to move according to a football a little true football is boredom me a blanket
the would not she had been that meta fifa
welcome the russian now we're in the middle of the world cup in russia and the opening match vladimir prudent sat right next to the new president of fifa and they watched the game together
like a switches to russia for the twenty first edition of the fifa world cup match between the host nation and saudi arabia so not only is was a unscathed
it it keeps the games it keeps the games and prudent gets the world wide party it wanted all along
but hitting gone
this is highest
she could for
so what happens to christopher steal that explains why we hear about him a couple of years later in a very different but seemingly related context
sir christopher steel after establishing relationship with this f b i agent
watch his investigation from afar and keeps in touch with this person and he he's met in the f b i
and in twenty six crisper steals hired to do research on russia once again but this time to look into whether there's connections between the kremlin and donald trump
once again what he finds disturbs
it picks up the phone and he calls that same as it once again
he has a new storage our invites said f b i agent to meet him money ends over a new investigation and this one is thirty five page document detailing what he considers to be collusion between russia and traub to undermine american democracy

the can thank you very much thank you michael for having me

here's what else you need to know these are hard issues
these issues will ultimately get solved in this country to live because they have to get solved in this country
it's broken
our immigration system is broken we have a lot of problems that are broken one day after president trump ended the separation of children and their parents at the board and congress to act on the issue
how speaker paul ryan postponed a vote on a bill that would do just that after failing to win enough republican votes we need to tango
we have fifty one votes
we need sixty unfortunately because we have the ridiculous filibuster rule so he did sixty president trump had personally lobbied for the house bill which would have also provided a path to citizenship for dreamers but cent lawmakers mixed messages on thursday morning by declaring that the senate would like
reject the house bill which in turn discouraged house republicans from taking a risky vote and i think we'll get six senators maybe we'll get seven said is that still doesn't get sixty so there's nothing to get as the president was speaking thank you so much for having the the first lady maloney a trump made an unknown
bounced visit to a texas detention center that houses children separated from their parents under her husband's zero tolerance policy and i also like
ask you how i have to these two and
famines

this is that it
today
women are being sidelined passed over for promotions and raises and fired when they complain
a times investigation finds that pregnancy discrimination is rampant inside america's biggest companies
it's tuesday june twenty six
so about six months ago there was this explosion of me to coverage and my colleague discuss over greenberg and i were at the same time hearing stories of pregnancy discrimination on our be and we thought it was something we had to look into
natalie control f covers the economy for the times and that's around the time that we came across this woman ot show all great

i was born in fort meyers florida
in my mum loop me a member of the subjects them bill and i was younger she grew up in the eighties and florida
mom worked hard work two jobs
the care of me and my brother you know there was no renault's government assistance or anything like that she wasn't wealthy but she said she had everything she needed i mean i had a pretty decent life growing up as a child
can't complain
she started working early as a teenager that a job at k have seen then as a server at a diner and then from the diner i transferred to a car wash the selling place and after that job she gets pregnant and has the baby that was my first child and then she has two more kids
and no teachers a single mom at this point and she's looking for something a little more stable a job that pays better that comes with benefits a place where she feels like she can move up the ladder
and one day she's shopping at walmart
and i was walking around
my friend and i was like hey i do in and like
they work in it is thing she played briefly and be hurt me get a job here and as she hears more about walmart it seems like this perfect opportunity everything she was looking for it's a big company and she thinks she can grow there so she applies to the job and she gets it he
gets the job
when i started working hour away

i was happy
i was really happy because i was gonna be getting paid more money than what i usually get paid
i was just the big picture i just thought a big picture to big picture
so she starts this new job she's working in the deli in the bakery at walmart and the bakery you know requires us to go on the freezer take on the frozen bread box is our lift the boxes move stuff around the what we're looking for lid on the daily side you
take out your rotisserie chickens was a storm inside like a cooler like and they come inside this bugs the box place between thirty five fifty pounds though they're pretty heavy it's pretty hard work but ot she says she likes it and she finally feels like she's on the path to a stable career that's when i was able
the movements the my apartment my first apartment by myself just me and my children
so yes i was happy but then one day things started to change
that was in the freezer taken out the bread to get ready to start my cycle over again to get him ready for the next day so dark and clear
the get unproved than ready for it and more next morning
and that's when the sharp plane hit i hour to the bathroom and scene and i was cleaning
i had nothing
but when i went to the hospital when they told me i was praying that
and they want me to start doing heavy lifting
avoid miscarriage and believe it was like
weighs more than twenty pounds
and the doctor tells you that specifically don't wish boxes because if you lift boxes you might miss carry you you might lose the baby yes

i left the emergency room where home went to sleep woke up with the were waiting for the manager to come in to her about what was going on
and then they explained to her about what the doctor said showed her the paperwork
i told her and told me no heavy lifting on over more than twenty pounds
but my job consistent needs to do heavy lifting
and what did she say
oh goodness
she said a lot of things
my sheets are me demi moore summer somersaults on the stage and non was pregnant running you that
i took up a little gymnasts to me more the actress yes the after i'm not anymore
do you like to see
a more general
you manger said patricia
look i'm sorry your your doctor said you can't let boxes but i once saw me more on television very pregnant
doing acrobatics on a stage and enough and a lot of a lotta nothing she just compare me to be more and so on
demi moore did that on the stage
and if the market do it should be no problem with me work to me more
gospel put it in years
our can do the job then i can go and walk out the door
so i really didn't have a choice though
nearly like is
his place
sweet
i'm pregnant
be careful
i'm just go ahead on the job and do and also do and just take it just had no choice but just
weather the storm

so she just kept going to work she kept lifting those heavy boxes of bread and check in and things were fine for a little while
i was picking that one of those heavy boxes
of chicken rotisserie chicken as the most
and when i lived
this start shooting pain
on my back onto the left and right side and it shut down and it went from way up from my shoulder blade auto down my leg
almost dropped the whole box our feet but i caught myself
and i was heart and soul that i have a muscle spasms
like a seizure in my body
i was taken to the emergency room
they gave me medication and he told me i need for a while
a baby
the doctor was like you shouldn't be doing all this heavy lift and know that from the first visit
but on t shirt kept showing up for work and she's getting bigger and bigger and closer and closer to her due date and she's starting to wonder what she's gonna do when this baby is born
so she goes to her manager
i said
they know when the information in far is leave of absence she gave me a number to call and i apply and
when i got back to work the next day they called me to the office
and there was like well one it's a brain zero attention that we did receive your request
they told me then i was a temporary associate and warm i no longer need not normally my services
it basically let you go yeah

i was so devastated
i was thinking
what am i gonna do
because i was you know a single parent
i had three kids at his baby along the way by nobody gonna hire and seven months pregnant woman
cause of on do there
and everything they ever asked me and do
and when may let me go i was so sad and i was so
i was so how anyone tell when nato in their lending me my services
i was point think was the point i mean the year


the way back
anyone hearing a teacher story would be sympathetic she struggled hard to get a job at walmart it represented a big leap in her career
but i imagine that there are some people who will hear her story and viewed from walmart perspective which is here's a person harder to a job who can no longer do that job and so why should this company continue to employ air
the question of what companies have to do with pregnant workers is for sure and intense debate and one that dates back to the seventies or do you really women including seven promos general electric require fail
i'll do in nineteen seventy six the supreme court ruled that general electric was not discriminating when it didn't offer pregnant women paid leave when they took time off to have children despite offering paid leave to other workers who took time off for other reasons
supreme court ruled an employer does not after a two women and all use or out from work or having babies because it said many women aren't pregnant so how can a policy be discriminatory towards women when many of them are not pregnant and i went out and i have women and men today day
legislation to contract pain
court ruling last week there was a big public outcry and basically people were saying wait a minute this is insane a policy says pregnant women don't get the same accommodations as disabled people
is discriminating against women and so congress passed the pregnancy discrimination act in nineteen seventy eight
oh okay
a
that act said employers if they are accommodating people who are similarly situated to pregnant people they have to accommodate pregnant people
the it
a
so after the supreme court ruled the companies don't have to accommodate pregnant people the way that they do disabled people congress then passes a law saying that they do that's right and it seemed like a win for pregnant women but it didn't settle everything
employers in court said that pregnant women were more like people who got injured off the job employers had an injured anybody off the job and they hadn't made anyone get pregnant either so why should they have to accommodate people like that and so when women took their companies to court the
nice one
but then along comes peggy
actually drove a mini van and carried my packages small letters and a seat next to me and my van pegging young is an early morning driver for u p s
she gets pregnant and she gets the note from her doctor that says my doctor recommended me not left anything over twenty pounds she probably shouldn't lift really heavy boxes and she takes that note to you
yes explained to me that they do not provide light duty for pregnancy
says tough luck
if you can't lift heavy boxes you can't work here basically they said i'll go home tell you no longer magnet the thing is that u yes
didn't respond that way to other people who asked for light duty they accommodated a lot of different kinds of workers who were asking for light duty including people who lost their driver's license because of drunk driving so peggy sues and she loses and loses and loser
and takes her case all the way to the supreme court
finish this running kids twelve twenty six young bruce united parcel service in oral arguments justice ruth bader ginsburg challenges the u layer to provide a single instance in which someone is denied an accommodation
who is not a pregnant person is there an
dispensation in the
condition that was them
to live to any single employee
who was so i know as well
me was
there's not in name providing them that because one was not elicited by the petition it is burn it was in a prima facie case a lawyer draws a blank suggesting that anytime a man had asked for an accommodation they had received it but suddenly when it came to pregnant women
it was treated differently
exactly and offense the kills in fat low new thirteen well i would like to address and that seems to be part of the reason why in two thousand and fifteen the court road six to three in favor of tacky
and what exactly did the supreme court ruling say that yes should have done in this case it said that u p s should have given peggy young light duty they should have found a job for her sitting down they should have found a way
way to accommodate her request because they were accommodating so many other kinds of workers at the time
i'm struck the the gps case sounds very similar to the case of ot show and walmart even done with the fact that they were both asking their employers to not have them lifting heavy boxes while they were pregnant
yeah it's true you know legally they are very similar but the way this played out for a t shirt was that she didn't know the law she didn't have a lawyer at that point she didn't know about peggy young's case and frankly her manager probably didn't either and that's kind of
the reality of working in america today it's not as if you know laws don't exist protecting people it's dead on a day to day basis when in this case you're pregnant you need a job you need the healthcare the paycheck is the best when that you've gotten in a long time and someone tells you know
you can't stop lifting these chickens you're not going to challenge that person i mean it makes absolutely no sense for you at that point you're vulnerable you're pregnant you're expecting another kid and so on a practical level you're at the whim of the people that you're looking at every day and those people might not be lawyers they may not have any
sense of what their obligations are or what your rights are and another thing that makes this complicated is that it's not as if oh teaches managers came right out and said we're firing you because you're pregnant and you're no longer useful are able to do your job they said walmart will no longer been meeting or services and walmart does
disputes that she ever asked for accommodations so the point is this can get squishy this isn't always black and white and when someone loses their job like you know teachers case it's not always one hundred percent clear bed pregnant
see is what did the men

oh sure what happened when you when you left warmer
i was unemployed for a year
i went to struggle
dad and dead
take i'm still in the boat is okay
i'll flip the heavy heavy heavy diversion
i was really really in the dark place i'm couldn't put it see that one teach
but now
i had a new morning then my newborn was diagnosed with blood disorder
it was so much stuff going on in and out of the house
and then i end up getting and jonathan next in january
pain way less than what i was given to own
warmer
grilling
i was to do you have almost the now is that walmart in the job that i started it was like eight dollars

who leticia thank you very much for your time we really appreciate it
thank you
who
on tomorrow's daily her to of the times investigation finds a different more subtle form of discrimination

here's what else you need hundred on monday the customs and border protection agency said it had temporarily stopped handing over migrant families for criminal prosecution
effectively suspending president trumps zero tolerance policy
the agency said it would no longer refer families to the justice department until it was a shirt that parents can be prosecuted without being separated from their children
the times reports that cause detention centers are filled to capacity the immediate impact of the decision will be the release of many migrant families into the us with a promise to return for a future court date of practice known as catch and release that the president
has strongly criticize
and thousands of illegal aliens are removed every month our immigration judge as a result of procedures in current law including voluntary or new law and an expedited removal just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you aren't receiving due process at the white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders to
offended the president's tweet that undocumented immigrants should be returned to their home countries without due process or and appearance before a judge
like as the president
you flight out what we've put out
things that we want to see in in immigration package
months ago for still waiting on congress to give us the ability to do that but under questioning by reporters sander seem to acknowledge that the president tweet was on like to translate into a meaningful policy changes nothing
when faced with that
anything right now
walking around making up walls know because we're at the obama administration were actually trying to enforce the laws that are on the books

that's it
i'm michael barbara

from the new york times on my cobra this is that it
today
justice anthony kennedy announces his retirement
what it means for the court to lose it's only swing vote
it's thursday
june twenty eighth
june twenty seven twenty eight eighteen my dear mr president
this letter is respectful informal notification of my decision
the effect of july thirty one of this year to in my regular active service is an associate justice of the supreme court
for a member of the legal profession it is the highest honors to serve on this court least permit me by this letter to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know interpret and defend the constitution
the laws there must always conform to its mandates in promises respectfully and sincerely anthony kennedy
animal what do you think when you read that letter from justice kennedy telling the world that he would step down from the card
i thought there goes my summer
but he had meeting
this is this is an earthquake
adam live coverage the supreme court for the ice this is the biggest story in a big news environment in a long time and in which will be an epic fight this is not an ordinary supreme court retirement or confirmation process justice kennedy has for decades held the
key to the most divisive and important decisions in american life
and in giving president dropped the opportunity to replace him
the supreme court will be transformative


can you tell me a little bit about how justice kennedy was first nominee it he was president reagan's third choice
great pleasure and deep respect for his extraordinary abilities that i today announced my intention to nominate the united states court of appeals judge robert bork to be an associate justice of the supreme court the first choice robert bork i'm very conservative
mr met somebody was voted down by the senate
mr by no second choice i am announcing today that in accordance with my duty under the constitution
i intend to nominate and ash the senate to confirm judge douglas ginsburg of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for the position of associate justice of the supreme court
douglas ginsburg never really got started because there was a scandal about marijuana smoking and so finally we turned to justice kennedy i am today announcing my intention to nominate united states circuit judge anthony kennedy
to be an associate justice for the supreme court who is not the hard core conservatives that the reaganite it's probably wanted but by then they'd been forced into going a little more moderate now i believe that judge kennedy as if you wish to share
thank you mr president
by announcing your intention to nominate me to the supreme court of the united states
you can for a singular honor
the highest honor to which any person devoted to the law might aspire and who did reagan and the concert is around president reagan
i think that they were getting when kennedy was nominated well they hope they were getting a reliable conservative judge kennedy is what in many in recent weeks have referred to as a true conservative one who believes that our constitutional system is one of enumerated powers that it is we the people who have granted certain rights to the gulf
not the other way around and was he that a somewhat reliable hoped for conservative once he was confirmed to the court
in a lot of ways and a lot of the time yes he cast the decisive road in some very big cases wrote the opinion in citizens united which amplified the role of money in politics joined conservative five for majorities in bush v gore which handed the president see the president george w bush join the majority and a five four decision in this
british columbia against heller which established a constitutional second amendment right to keep and bear arms in the home so in many cases in most cases he was what he seemed to be a republican a you voted conservatively so what reagan expected him to be and how you would be right
but
wow
a few cases in some of them very big cases he leaned lift he joined other justices to save the right to abortion in planned parenthood against a sea which reaffirm the core of roe v wade publishing a constitutional right to abortion
he voted to cut back on the death penalty
he voted in favor of affirmative action justice anthony kennedy writing for the majority argued for american education is need to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity so he disappointed conservatives and presumably disappointed president reagan in a whole array
case
but nothing compares to the two thousand and fifteen decision in which justice kennedy writing for the court in a five four decision joined by the courts liberals established a constitutional right to same sex marriage thing was required by the equal dignity protected by the constitution

just moments go the supreme court and this landmark rural and court making same sex marriage
country across every state in this nation
there were tears in the court room
jubilation outside the courthouse
i was trying to find my story in so many people were on their phones that i couldn't get cell service it's the only time it's ever had
writing for the court jester anthony kennedy had a couple not to denigrate marriage but rather to live their life joined by
that was easily one of the most important cases in the supreme court history
he was the greatest judicial champion in american history of direct
jack kennedy
by boy harming gay right better the hot or that britain major your opinion of it
twenty years
reddit dot wedding game and be on equal ground


why do you understand the kind of kennedy level of unpredictability sometimes citing very deeply conservative sometimes citing very deeply with liberals is there something discernible all guiding him
a great deal of self confidence and actually no particularly discernible judicial philosophy kind of mystical judicial supremacy in which he thinks that judges can be trusted to divine the right answers from the somewhat cryptic language of the constitution and
very gracious not to use the term swing vote i hate
it has this visual image of the spatial generation
the cases swing i don't
thank you for not using one thing to bear in mind as people think that hamlet that he's the sweet justice that he's picking between one side of the other but that's not the right way to think about how personally we think about it when he's with his with you one hundred and ten percent so more conservative cases he was very conservative and the more liberal case he was
very liberal but he had an idiosyncratic jurisprudence that allowed him to have a foot and both worlds
adam how his kennedy's amorphous legal approach translated to how he dealt with his fellow justice what was his dynamic with them on the bench and off my sets the he was well liked but much more important because he had the deciding vote everyone deferred game and arguments when he started
to talk everyone stop talking and after he stopped talking everyone said well as justice kennedy wisely pointed out i understand the alternative approach which justice kennedy was referring to houston other way you think about the excellent point justice kennedy just made much and as justice kennedy question pointed up its and only includes everyone was angling for his vote because he was the key vote
asians that point it out by time justice counties question because if it can be deferred to him because they needed his vote to decide which way each case was going to go i'm sure they liked him a lot as a guy also very much cared about getting is bogus
given how unique kennedy has given his swing vote power in this court and how much his colleagues to to him
you think he decided to retire
he's eighty one years old i think in some sense he was running out of steam
and why now given that the president that will be pointing his replacement is not as ideologically nuanced as he is were partly because the next president will be either there's not a president who will be able to replace justice kennedy with a justice kennedy one way to think about it is
justice is like to try to retire under presidents who will appoint someone who will carry on their judicial legacy
justice kennedy would have been incapable of doing that under any president president obama would not have appointed someone who would vote like him in prison and trump all appoint someone who works like him because while most of the justices are fairly closely identified ideologically with the president who appointed him or her justice kennedy was in this
weird and therefore very powerful center spot
get into ever have a justice like anthony kennedy again somebody capable of any logical flexibility like this these days ideology is so closely vetted by presidents and the people they put on the court your robert selena
sotomayor kagan gore suture such reliable proxies for the president's were pointed them that we would have to have a very very different america
you produce another justice kennedy

i don't thank you very much

oh be right back
they're born or very pleased deficit
of the many powers and responsibilities that the constitution best in the presidency
fewer more consequential then appointing a supreme court justice
particularly want to succeed justice scalia more of the most influential jurors of our time sure where does this story start for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell
repertoire
what do you
our a while
oh sheryl stover covers congress for the times
armored
earlier
obama
are are or what could really are
and today
after completing this exhaustive process i've made my decision
i've selected nominee who was widely recognized not only has one of america's sharpest legal minds
but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency
modesty integrity
even handedness and excellence
are we are any kind of a moderate amount
obama
i'm a republican
it is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of are divided politics
the squabbling that's gone on in the news every day
but to go down that path would be wrong
i simply asked republicans in the senate to give him a fair hearing
and then and up or down vote
not that way if you don't then it will not only be an abdication of the senate's constitutional duty
it will indicate a process for nominating them confirming judges that is beyond repair
no mean everything
is subject to the most partisan politics everything

it has a presence constitutional right to nominate a supreme court justice
as the sun it's called social right
check on a president
and with whole is concerned
oh what a brilliant
who are
an underground
oh
oder where i would
i'm american people may well elect a president who decide for nominate judge garlic
presented consideration
an expression may also nominate somebody very different
either way
our view is
if the people a voice and filling
we are away
wait
i get an opportunity
let's let the american people
santa will appropriately revisit the matter what it considers the qualifications of the nominee
the next president
nominate whoever
that my be
our area
what the majority leader did to merit garland
by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster a
a court eight from obama
wrong when mcconnell deprived president obama have a vote on garland it was a nuclear option
the rest is fall out
why but had one
i'm kind to everybody
webber
a lot of
my own
somebody would be more are are democrats are furious with mcconnell but they're not really afraid that this is going to change much
right right
will you appoint are you looking to a point of justice who wants to overturn roe v wade isn't going to happen
i'm all in deployed for life the judges will be pro do you want to see the court overturned
put another two or perhaps three justices or and that's really what's going to be has that's will happen and dental have been automatically in my opinion because i am putting pro life he justices on the court so when do we see this mcconnell maneuver start to pay off not just be of stay
tell me but become a victory for him while our
a point now where we're going to a wider than any other m that are welcome your ram
or
promoting
millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them
when they voted for me for president
i am a man of my way i will do as i say something that the american people
have been asking for from washington for a very very long time
we we are
and dominate corporate and i would like to ask a judge course which and is wonderful wife louise to please step forward
please louise judge
they are they

immediate return
or or it
it was clear that right
our on record right because if another seat opens on the court with a republican president and power no matter why it's good for republicans if it's a seat already held by a conservative things stay the same if it's a democrat they get a pretty rock solid six
the majority and if it's kennedy then they can replace him with a conservative who will vote in lock step which solidifies a five to four majority broccoli right
mcconnell
really are
iran while
there were no
nobody
from work going to be what he faced an atheist honest after just what do you learning
on some new years just coming across right now from the supreme court after the final day of the term and a few hours after some of those final decisions we have just learned that justice anthony kennedy will be retiring you are going to see twenty states
laws banning abortion outright just banning abortion because they know that there are now going to be five votes on the supreme court to overturn roe v wade and abortion will be illegal in a significant part of the united states
in in eighteen months there is just no doubt about that and that's why these seats matter so much roe v wade is do it is gone because donald trump won the election to your on the hill to infect worth talking you from the senate gallery what we said like there when the news came that justice
he was retiring
yeah and a particular yeah oh my god
i can react and one democrat party
and what do we know about what the democrats are going to try to do what the next nominee what mcconnell did to grow up
democratic return it or and cried
the republican way
i wouldn't have nominee or republican colleagues in the senate should follow the rule they sit in two thousand and sixteen
not to consider a supreme court justice in an election year
millions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president's nominee and their voices deserve to be heard now as leader mcconnell thought they should deserve to be heard then
anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy
burn up by a macabre game but i'm gonna have already you don't know a power play them a game
are not in control the senate
stand ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent
on cars and trucks nominated film this country and not were very quick primer we will vote to confirm justice kurdish successor this fall after that i would vote on a new supreme court nominee or the midterm term before the just bored of it
yeah and what's the strategy behind getting it done before the midterms well one in control
right now who knows what will happen after the camera
and grow up agreement
we are very different nominate from an echo
he would be unlikely to get an urban our money through a democratic government
and the other thing it become a campaign
you know any a cream court eye on apple will only write out a party
i'm that ended up
oh be very motivated over there
or motivated her from on it
game so if all signs point to this getting done before the midterms and republicans have control of congress is there a scenario in which this new justice nominated by president trump somehow is not confirmed before the mid terms as mcconnell wants and plants
a couple and could happen
parliament nominate buddy who
oh at a republican rather are you i'm nominating people who really haven't been adequately better
unlikely scenario about republican
and i'm going over with democrat
who walk and nominee and everybody know cupcake i am
what are wrote a wave by
a really high and quiet
what a republican there and now about roe v wade who want to abandon their party
over the other democrat
and you know whoever rendered
holland of main marco
so to republican senators who happened to be women who democrats believe my choose the issue of abortion over fidelity to their party and a moment as big as a supreme court nomination
right
i already had a a puppy
him or when he was bring her really impact and the armor or what
or at work out an hour he could have a but we'll hearing and have had been wanting to figure out how you were gonna bring them over by an era going to be a lot of pressure on a cure them and the great
it's interesting like justice kennedy in the supreme court
here again huge questions about the future of the united states
may lie in the hands of this tiny fraction of congress
still makes decisions that can still swing either way that has some degree of independence that's separate from the expectations of their party yeah and the women oh and out a are really rare rare bird and why
my wife
they are willing to break with their own party when they are higher calling

gerald thank you very much thank my

use those you need to know on this
guys are one hundred twenty one
three hundred one
bill was passed on wednesday
the house voted down and immigration will called for by president that would end the separation of families at the border
fun the president's voter walt and offer a path to citizenship for dreamers h are sixty one thirty six were presented to the president his advisors would recommend that he signed it into law house republicans had postponed a vote on the bill last week hoping to gather more support
but still fell far short despite a last minute please from president but you don't have to listen to his advisors you can listen to the present himself because he treated this morning
house republicans should pass the strong but fair immigration bill in their afternoon vote today even though the dams won't let it pass in the senate passes it will show that we want strong borders and security while the games want open borders which equals crime
when the bills failure least the long term feet of dreamers and families separated at the border in limbo

on a day when aaron ross would go hunting he would wake up early may be with the sun and maybe before
get up get in his orange overalls and orange pants and a matching had grabbed his bow and he would head out the door of his little apartment in his small town of hitting minnesota to go out looking for dear

oh my name and i though
when we're anywhere and
better every ah yeah right
a year or in your back your anger or or ordinary murder
i know
right
a where your underwear
right
or very hard on her part of who i did anybody you are her
and they arrest can for the murder of an interest


all the way back

so can and aaron overdose together
how his kin in charged with murder
a lot of it has to do with a famous basketball player in the eighties
mainland by
len bias was of vietnam at the university of maryland

and had captured the parts of people around the country
he was one of the top and be a draft pick
the celtics so little boys

many people
larry
and two days later
a local success story took up tragic terrible this morning len bias the maryland universe of a basketball star on his way to becoming a world champion boston sell len bias this partying with some friends he's using cocaine and three year old one buys stop or the university of maryland basketball team is now bit and he has a hard
attack and dice
whatever your jog have one by google time we go go go go go it's hard to avoid it was the cover the new york times was the cover the washington post the smiling face it's huge news isn't good tom college basketball and an athlete of god mr mysteriously and there are a lot of the boards a drugs might have been and ball
and it becomes emblematic of what's increasingly at that time considered the drug epidemic
that was
today there's a new epidemic
smoke of cocaine otherwise known as quick crack crack a drug show to him so strong it might just may be called track of do the dishes a war len bias becomes this symbol of the jug epidemic and it's destruction and the villain in that big
his friend brian brian trouble and called nine one one
provided the cocaine and was using it with him
and trivial is charged with providing the cocaine he was acquitted
but this inspires a blurry of bills and laws that refrain the person who provided drugs and and an overdose deaths
as the killer
so even if someone didn't intend to harm this other person or even if they were doing the drugs together
they can be held criminally accountable for the other person's death
absolutely if they intended to cause the death it's just regular murder
for people who do not intend to cause of death but they are being held responsible for the death of someone who voluntarily use drugs and overdosed
yeah sure sure
so these laws were born in a moment of crisis spot politicians were calling crack epidemic in the late eighties but the reason i started doing this reporting now is because we're in what they're calling the obesity epidemic and i started to notice from local news reports research
surgeons of this particular tactic more and more of these kinds of homicide charges being filed and i decided to try and start actually counting and tracking and seeing how big that resurgence was
i only knew german
your search
great yeah i mean i'm particularly focusing interested in len bias kind of was the third degree that you guys have so i spent the last year looking at this i'm trying to collect data on how much the prosecution's actually we're increasing right
and i'll be a brother or your work and go to trial trial
you're going to america
and talk to fifteen nearly twenty district attorney's prosecutors across the country who are doing these cases record from a regular liberated paid
have been had a lot about oh
and fifteen states where i was able to get official data day doubled between two thousand and fifteen and twenty seventeen
what wonder you doing i'm i want to be able to talk about be a pro
in all
agreed not usually i
there is not evidence there is no numerical evidence of any kind that it's having that kind of them are we
oh i am in a mall
a mobile aren't year
oh you're from sri lanka
i think this
sophie's wisconsin border
there's been a while homicide judges author i don't want to the glue that using know i wasn't a good possibility we certainly have sued or a dutch why
keeping an eye on oh my
i really do you know i know that a number
then i heard that repeatedly i think it's working so there is i think a desk junked often between the hopes of people in leadership and people make policy and the reality on the ground
but
i don't know is socially prosecuted and drug dealers for children to teach to start to lose to will do you see an impact on the street
flo
but i don't give a shit
and went to see this prosecutor name pete or pit in minnesota and not far from where kim is in prison
he was really interesting because he doesn't think that this approach will keep dealers from dealing or users from using vote goal isn't to go prosecutor
use drugs to him over and kills them there won't be your problem anymore though
we were not really
he did it out of assertive sense of justice and and wanting to do something about this crisis of overdose deaths
to save the world
fortunately you you you the truth about public bullshit
i literally just very very holds you have you all these are the tooth
that too
what were people around you saying about this charge when were you hearing from from your family and from errands family
what really wrap your mind around heard about even getting
every worker know
making her mother
i'm ariel
are we at all
krista pal i fully understand did not give her pain catch in any attempt to do harm
means i get drunk and get behind the wheel and i crash into someone in kill them
that wasn't my intention but that person's death is still on the so chris it grew up with the aaron and she was very close to him and feels an incredible loss and i am to enhance here's the part in a couple dogs like to dress up t shirt on dog
popcorn watch movies dog
krill animal lover
krista what do you think it was growing up that brought you so close to and
we grew up in the domestic violence in my pants turned to addictions and there's not a whole lot of people in your circle of friends and understand when it's like could be the child of an attic yeah
high school and my dad's in jail
there's know anybody in your science class really get that but and
and where were you when you first found out that the police for treating aaron staff has a murder i was actually in my kitchen
investing here called me just that he wanted until i knew before i found out from the news that he was being arrested for homicide
and what did you think when you heard that they had town
really serious mean i googled it and went home
okay yeah exactly what she did
i won't lie i was glad he were glad she's being charged yes
and why
because
my brother last forty years of his life and the actions of one person cause that
krista what do you say to people who say that this is just what users do they share drugs
and if very easily could have been aaron who provided the drugs and rolls could have been reversed right i mean that i just i know in this case there with her prescription and she admitted giving a tan
yeah you're right and the roles were reversed
these the
my knee jerk reaction should be the same exact thing
right
but he my brother
i can't say that i would expect to wanted to go away what do you mean we would you want your brother charged i will point yes i went i
i feel that if that was the point where he was with his addiction that
maybe there would be the wake up call he needed to be charged with murder rate
the in my whole point here
his to advocate for another family not dealing with the grief that my family has and is dealing with
i don't know what else we as a society can do
clinton turret
but the data doesn't necessarily shell that these charges are deterring people from using our borrowing drugs
so if the charge doesn't have a deterrent effect
would you still want to see people like can getting charged with a crime like murder

the fact remains or someone
last the life
and
i mean if we just didn't charge can because and was an addict
and that meant that his death was of no importance you know big deal thirty six year old healthy man died and
my brother's life meant something
these are a lot of pressure on audience to do these kinds of know there's no from the public or know what doesn't kill her
it reminds me of a word perched already shown but tough shit she lives a risky lifestyle or even what do you think you'll get their sad
what do for a junkie
that's why we don't do drugs
yeah but that's a lot of victim blaming the whole lot of thrown her morals values on have one
get away from her job
currently moral us
i think that the families of people do is drugs
i anticipate for their loved one's death
to be meaningless or even made fun of they're expecting their community and the rest of the world not to see it as important to see it as expected to even say good riddance because that person use drugs and so when the police send a judge
and courts and and everyone is suddenly cares
that means a lot of elements of the generating

chris there may be people who hear it
and think to themselves
there's so much suffering here
and that charging someone with murder who herself is suffering with addiction just perpetuates that suffering
and that true accountability when it comes to addiction lies with a whole group of people who are web high and an industry that create these drugs and distribute them and makes it possible for people to abuse them
why do you think about that
one argue arguments the fact that a lot of prescription drug issues have been created by
over prescribing and if you find a way to restructure
industries we aren't lending drugs kitten hands of the wrong people to be distributed to even more for on eco i will jump on board
town and i this is
the only way i know how to try and save and on their family and the pain and grief and my family deals
so can feels like the most accessible person to hold accountable here
that's only twenty eight

and
rosie when we hope people like him accountable in the stats
who aren't me holding and canada
who are we not by me
no i'm not blaming the healthcare system the insurance industry that is not adequately treating people when are dealing with how people are self medicating with painkillers and the industry that has profited off that and and were not able to grapple with the kind of deeper
why of substance use and all that kind of social and economic and personal factors
that are really causing the crisis we can't deal with that and with what some people called depths of despair
instead we're looking to the person closest by who put the pills the powder the patch into someone else his hands that we get our mind around
the
do you think that you hurt aaron
i don't know
robert
what were we were born
there were already have an array i care
robert aircraft
don't require a warm here
ergo are here at all
oregon

yeah yeah
i know
our war or or were very
oh
a writer and or where i own a car or
i am a who brought up know
our

kimberly elkins was charged with third degree murder in the death of aaron ross
but pled guilty to manslaughter and is serving a four year prison sentence in minnesota


here's what else you need to know other
very very closely for president trump says he spoke with four candidates to replace justice anthony kennedy on the supreme court
as the white house races to meet comp stat lot of announcing a pic by next month they are outstanding people
really incredible people so many different ways academically and every other word the white house to climb to say with whom the president net for the short list of candidates is believed to include six federal appeals court judges i think they pursue that is chosen will be out there that day
you very much everybody
and president trumps long time lawyer michael cohen who is under investigation for secret payments to women who said they had affairs with the president is signaling a new willingness to cooperate with federal prosecutors even if it undermines trough
in an off camera interview with a b c's george stephanopoulos cohen was asked what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between his family and trump who in the past cohen has said he would take of both
i put family and country first call and replied to be crystal clear my wife my daughter and my son and this country have my first point
that's it for the
i'm michael see you on thursday after the holiday

some the new york times on michael barbara this is that

today
president trump is scheduled to announce his pick for the supreme court at nine pm
a look at the final candidates

it's monday
july nine
will make a decision on the united states supreme court
no justice better be made over the next few days and will be a cigarette on monday and i look forward to that i think the person that is chosen will be outstanding thank you very much everywhere

i'll be announcing that on monday
my
adam lived with hours until the announcement of the next supreme court nominee how many serious candidates do believe that president is considering at this point
it looks like we're down to for all of them are federal appeals court judges one of them but cable or sits here in washington judge amy coney barrett suits on the seventh circuit boost in chicago
thomas hardiman sits on the third circuit based in philadelphia
re carefully sits on the sixth circuit boost in cincinnati so these are all federal judges who sit on the court of appeals correct president trump wasting absolutely no time with this one just five days after anthony kennedy announced his retirement from the supreme court the president interviewed
for candidates brat cabin are roman catholic church amy coney beret and thomas hard men as to travel schedule to announce his decision on monday
okay to take us through these candidates the fourth them one by one and let's start on the least conservative end of the spectrum according to conservatives who would be happy to hear conservatives tell that they have the biggest doubts i'm not sure they're justified but the biggest about judge brett or
gentlemen it's two o'clock judiciary committee will proceed with the nomination
kavanagh to be a judge for the court of appeals for the gesture to columbia shorter who surely has the most glittering credentials and the most interesting resume items he has been is illegal i figure whose appeared in every major legal fight in the past couple decades i work for judge star in the independent counsel saw
office he served with can store in the investigation
bill clinton impeachment in that capacity i had the opportunity to argued cases before the supreme court or the united states and the dc circuit court of appeals when the vote for being recounting in florida in the cases that led the bush v gore
was there when alien gonzalez the cuban boy was being deported back to cuba to be with his father he was there in july of two thousand and three i became staff secretary to president bush he served for years in the bush white house and under the circuit which is the second most important court know and i think i've earned the trust of the president of run to the
trust to the senior staff that unfair and even handed
a paper trail and the very rich resume experience and the association with the bush white house which not long ago would been taught to be a good thing among republican has been caused for some of them to doubt his spotify and why what is it about working for president george w bush that would unsettle conservatives about just
conservative cabinet as you will bear in mind that we're sort of the point in the oscar season where there's a month left and everyone is pissing on everyone else is moving so some of this criticism is a bit of a stretch but there are people who say sure he voted in the right direction in cases on abortion
the affordable care act but he didn't go quite as far as he could these are the kinds of distinctions people in the right growing so it sounds like when we're putting these potential nominees on a conservative spectrum if cavanaugh is furnace to left the band on the spectrum is pretty narrow
yes if there is a band at all if we have enough information to make this judgment at and really the key question is not how conservative they are relative to each other it's how conservative they are relative to the middle of the court that they will sit on the middle of the court will be john roberts they will be do the right of john roberts and it will be roberts who will hold the control
vote on the court so it almost doesn't matter whether you're between gore seat channel leno or your between a lido in thomas in terms of conservative news so long as you're to the right of robert's you will have done the job that republicans want dome which is to make sure that there are five votes in any major decision which
is to create a reliably conservative juggernaut five justices all of them committed conservatives as opposed to the world we've lived in for thirty years which is for liberal justices for conservative justices and justice kennedy so all of this infighting is sort of like the
republican primary but once you get to the general everyone is going to love who the candidate is and whoever the candid it is will accomplish the goal republicans want to accomplish if confirmed that person will create the most conservative court we've seen in our lifetime
so and i'm is the biggest thing working against cabin are actually his experience
yes i think so
i mean one thing we haven't touched on is that you can read his experience with the independent counsel investigation of president clinton in various ways i think this goes to a key point center which is impeachment and then conviction take into account more than just the facts because after the fact he is
had some doubts about how wise then investigation was wasn't just a simple question of whether there was a violation of law committed but our broader considerations country and that's where it really gets i think improper for someone in me in an counsel's office to say whether they think the president should have going to eat particularly after working closely with
president bush he's come to the conclusion that we should be very wary of imposing on the time of the prison in the united states who knows he says the hardest job in the world and he says maybe we should defer civil suits criminal investigations criminal prosecutions until he left office and that
kind of talk in the wake of the clinton investigation long before president trump was on the horizon may nonetheless worrisome democrats that should he have an opportunity to vote on some kind of easter rising out of the murder investigation that you would be too sympathetic to presidential power and that my presumably
appeal to president trump a nominee who we can put on the supreme court who might side with him if the mother investigation somehow reaches the supreme court where it certainly has perfect logic to it
that's cavanaugh who is next
gentlemen
two o'clock and we nominate a day is thomas michael hardman tom hardiman of the third circuit mr argument comes to this show
a position with an outstanding record who would be an unconventional choice graduate of notre dame and nineteen eighty seven he didn't go to an ivy league school and you didn't click on the supreme court or in fact for any judge would probably appeals to prison trump is his appealing personality
is hard scrabble routine finance and his education by driving a cab
i feel that i've found my home and the judiciary will all candor understand and he's a different kind of figure that what we're used to seeing and the supreme court and just got to point out that when you mention his education credentials it's not that you animal attack are a snob it's the president trump cares about ideally credentials
it's been reported the prison in trouble and someone from harvard or yale i'm going to submit a list of justices potential justices of the united states supreme court judge that i will appoint from the list while he was a candidate's prison and publish to list of potential supreme court nominees
church
i'm going to have a list of ten were working on it already heritage foundation and others are working on it already and one characterize those lists was almost nobody from washington almost nobody from the ivy league a lot of people from state supreme courts as opposed to federal circuit courts a lot of people from the
the american heartland and it presented a vision of the american judiciary that was sort of at odds with what you see on supreme court today more egalitarian here
and finally i have kept my promise to appoint a justice after he's like that he publishes the supplemental it on my list of twenty judges who will defend our constitution
and was on that list so you sense a kind of tug in two directions of what vision of the supreme court does he want to press and hardiman was also notably the runner up last time around the guy who didn't get the rose that when to kneel course edge instead
and again you put him on the court you put any one of the four people on the court there's not going to be a lot of difference in the voting array so it's really partly what story this prison in trunk wanted till okay so who's next
jokes are his room and catholic church
as careful as young man has been eight years and legal practice to michigan beginning as associate who has spent most of his life in michigan
clerk for justice kennedy also while i was working for judge guy and justice kennedy
i did become i hope reasonably well versed in the criminal actions themselves
so that i would be able to draw on that legal experience
beloved of his clerks an avid outdoorsman a big promoting a second amendment rights he has a concealed carry permit himself and he's written things very much in favor of say religious freedom so there was a case where the question was people at a church run restaurant
who are arguably coerced to work there when threatened that they would be out of favor with god if they didn't work for free whether they were entitled to back wages and the department of labor issues over back wages and george carefully says the government has nothing to say in this realm these are decisions to be made within a church those are really just decisions
and the government should stick to its business
a decision that protects religious liberty
yeah and catholic has written a book it's about the power of solitude is a self described introvert who likes to go off and his cabinet and right places where he's got no internet access but i'm not sure that your typical introvert makes the best fit with donald trump
this is a dynamic process but the latest thinking is that we're down to three and the judge catholic is not going to be the nominee in this time around okay so that leaves one final candidate we haven't talked about and who is that that same county barrett who became a favorite of social conservatives based partly on our economic writings currently
on her about religious commitments to catholicism
partly because her life stories quite inspirational she has seven children to them adopted from eighty one with special needs saturday will consider the nominations of to circuit court nominees professor amy county barrett to the seventh circuit court and but the moment that really propelled judge barrett into the forefront was that her confirmation
hearing when she was questioned about her writings and stances by sen dianne feinstein when you read your speeches
that conclusion one draws who said to her that dogma lives loudly with you
and
that's of concern the dog my lives loudly within you and that's a concern
and this notion these mean this phrase this headline the slogan the dog were lives loudly within you has been embraced on the right and you see on t shirts and coffee mugs and that his brighton judge barents prospects what may have justified the exchange little more than usual is the judge buried herself as
academic reflected on the role the catholic faith should play in death penalty decisions me is catholic teaching of course is against the death penalty and she wrote that there might be circumstances were catholic church should have to use him or herself from a decision involving the death penalty so that did open the door for that exchange that's it
top but the judge yourself as written to the
and what evidence if any is there that judge barrett is guided judicially or otherwise by her religious faith
i don't know that there's any evidence of that and enter hearing she said let me start by saying that she would apply the law if they freely and without reference to her personal views or her religious views can extend whether they derive from anywhere else on the lot
but she has written a little bit about rove that may be telling she wrote an article a precedent and she classified various kinds of precedent and she listed row is one of those that may be is not as well established as others because it has been the subject of constant criticism since the day was
shoot and she said that like a popular support is some evidence that is a less firmly established precedent
for her to even noodle that question gives you some idea that you might not be
particularly reliable vote to reaffirm bro
that
i want to stay on this subject of roe vs wade because no matter who the president text today conservatives are going to get their reliable fifth vote in a supreme court it seems from everything you've told us it's kind of a dream scenario for conservator
train
so as to what extent is this list
bow roe v wade i don't think it's at the very top of everyone's agenda
i think it's true that once trump places a second just to suddenly supreme court and we have five conservatives they will have the power to overrule row i don't think that's going to happen right away i think there are plenty of ways in which the cord can cut back on abortion rights sustain laws as in red states to make it more
much much harder to get abortions
but the headlines supreme court overrules roe v wade is not something chief justice roberts is really looking to do when you can get a lot of what you want to accomplish accomplished without that i don't mean to minimize this i think we could fairly shortly be living in a world where poor women in red states are going to find it very hard to get abortions well rich women
all over the country will travel to places they can get abortions because abortions not going away in california and new york but it might be going away in mississippi
so i don't what you're raising the prospect of our state laws that may become more permissible to this supreme court
right so think back a couple terms ago we had a case from texas texas imposed restrictions on abortion clinics that would have dropped the number of clinics in the state from forty to ten and made it very hard for a lot of women to get abortions because the nearest clinic would be hundreds of miles away
and the supreme court by a five to three vote ended up striking down those restrictions i think the next supreme court the one with to trump just is on it might well sustain many restrictions like that
and if that's the likely outcome here rather than the overturning roe v wade do you think all four of these nominees they were talking about would support those sorts of rulings that allow states to do that
that's my distinct sense
we spoke adam to send her susan collins last week and she's one of a handful of moderate sanders who are expected to make or break the president's nominee if a nominee had demonstrated hostility toward roe v wade in any fish
capacity
badly cause me great concern with figures like collins in the next why can't we just expect that a couple of these nominees like amy buried for example are too conservative to make it to the senate and therefore
in a sense kind of rule them out as possibilities
i think for sure buried will be the biggest fight the artists lift for the trump administration
there are conservatives to think it's a fight with having he why it would have political benefits to the midterm election it would energize the republican base and he's going to get someone on the court sooner or later even if he loses the first fight the so conservatives might support taking the most polarizing candidate
knowing that it would provoke a big political battle and seeing an upside to that even if they don't actually get that candidate confirmed onto the court or even i'm not saying she wouldn't be confirmed i think she might well be but it would be that feinstein moment read large it would be a culture war battle were
the right is picking a fight
and it will either win or it will feel good about itself and energize it's base in losing and as we have said it's not like the spectrum of choices here is all that meaningful
it's a little humorous to see the right is fighting over these folks because these are matters of the principal really this is who's who's down who's my guy who's your guy and the moment prison and drop names the nominee all conservatives will fall behind them

so adam were just hours from president trump announcing his choice do you have an expectation of who it's going to be and are you willing to share
absolutely realized michael
as a process that has shifted by the hour
and the information we of the weight has gone and all different directions
and i will within a matter of hours more likely not be proven wrong but i still think the best candidate from the point of view of conservatives the one who would make the most lasting impact on the cord and therefore the one the prison and true
in his own best interest this prick ever
adam will talk to him
good
we'll be right back
here's what else you need to know that the times reports that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has told president trump that judges thomas hardy and women catholic would be the safest choices for senate confirmation
the process that may have to take place without any democratic support mcconnell has worn trump that george brett cavanaugh is extensive paper trail and judge amy berets opposition from abortion rights groups
might allow democrats to slow the process and prevent a justice from being seeded by the start of the next supreme court session in october
and
i look like to comment on sunday sixteen days after a youth soccer team became trapped inside a cave in northern thailand
four of its twelve members were rescued in risky underwater operation involving diverse from multiple countries
the team became stranded after rising rain forest flooded the caves chambers
leaving the boys who cannot swim
with little food or oxygen
divers will try to rescue the remaining eight players and their coach on monday morning

that's it for the day
i'm michael bar
see seymour more

from the new york times ah michael this is day

in a combative opening day of the nato summit in brussels
president trouble when after germany calling it a captive of russia and calling other member countries delinquent where his frustration is coming from
it's thursday july troll
michael those story of nato really stores with three countries the united states the soviet union and nazi germany david sanger is a national security correspondent for the times now the us in the soviet of course we're allies of convenience against germany
an all came very ugly and as soon as victory in europe was declared in april nineteen forty five
and at that moment the big concern moved away from a nazi germany they could threaten europe
true or soviet union they could do so
so right after the war was over
there was a great fear that vulnerable countries that had been initially taken over by the nazis
denmark belgium could all for under the informed the communist
so over time the us came around the idea that the soviet union had to be contained
a generation which will
hey
oh man
and harry truman want to congress in nineteen forty seven and laid that out
he said i believe it must be the powers in the united states
we are resisting an subjugated by minorities by outside pressures and that was really the beginning of vulnerable international order the idea that the united states was going to be a guarantor of freedom around the world
so how did the us actually put that into practice
or almost as soon as crewman ordered those words a series of crises came up the election which last almost two full days is held under the watchful eyes or three hundred the soviets were meddling in the hi am a white friends in nineteen forty eight the united states also metal
those are all western powers and russia a jerk
strong pressure czechoslovakia in nineteen forty is an established democracy the soviets overthrew a democratically elected government in trickles kevorkian on february informed that the alternative is civil war and the web unmistakable threat of invasion former soviet union if he does now
capitulate president banish accepts a communist cabinet
and then of course june nineteen forty two and one half million people cut off isolated from the outside world the soviets cut off all access to west berlin
i'm on our home run back or no longer be brought from overland and the united states ended up mounting what became call the berlin airlift the people in the western sector
learn to live with the sight and sound of these giant for engine aircraft
but the past year this has been there only hope with flu in supplies to keep the people of west berlin alive
many ways to keep this one little haven
democracy alive as well and david how does the us respond to this aggression from the silly
all story in nineteen forty eight the truman administration realize that they were going to actually need the put together some kind of military alliance
if anything day
if if anything ever to appear to the way
paper of around our freedom and are paid by april nine nineteen forty nine harry truman had gathered together ministers from around europe and they stood in the state department auditorium and signed this alliance about how the signing of the north atlantic
pretty and that created nader trading shall enter into as between the gate which have ratified looting or ratification and where exactly is nato well it's basically just a military alliance to defend europe against what was the soviet union
i'm an automatic treaty was signed by norway denmark the netherlands belgium maximum aren't in italy portugal
united kingdom on camera managed but the key piece of nato is something called article five and its founding document and that basically says
shorn to stand together against aggression against one one day an attack against all our attack on one country is an attack on oh and the idea was to create some sense of deterrence so that the soviets knew that if they tried to pick off even the weakest member
nato in europe they were going to be fighting everyone including the united states
this is a military alliance based in europe created by the us designed to rebuff a single enemy the soviet union guess that was the goal i say without hesitation
that i am absolutely convinced that nato provides the best
it's not the of peace you know michael there was this cheeky line early in nato's history from general hastings is may who was the first secretary general of nato he said the purpose of nader was to keep the soviet union out the americans in and the germans down
leaders of the communist meet in warsaw to sign the treaty which is too late
and the so is respond by creating their own sort of nader was called the warsaw pact and communist nations that were under soviet influence the poland bulgaria czechoslovakia hungry of course east germany
and they were a military alliance of the room so you saw these two groups of military allies facing off against each other
most at all times maintain its strength as long as the possibility of a great challenges
else can we say that piece for which the peoples of the world
and how does this new organization nato operate day to day has it funded has it function
there isn't a completely separate nato military force of any kind they don't have their own on instead they pull together the military forces of each of the member countries and over time they weren't haven't trained together and put their dark room together but the whole for is that they just get org
just under one european supreme commander appointed by the united states and of course it's the us has always been at the core of nato because it had the biggest forces it had the most money and it had the most sophisticated intelligence and of course
britain the united states and letter france had nuclear weapons and the whole idea was that if you pull these together you create a pretty fearsome deterrent and in fact that's pretty well worth what do you mean that it worked the think about all the wars that didn't happen we never saw
nuclear war broke out in europe though it was threatened frequently in the fifties and sixties and of course the soviets knew that the united states was keeping missiles in turkey nuclear weapons in belgium that in other words forces were forward deployed
and under some nato control or could be moved to nato control fairly quickly and that made them think twice
so the original idea of nato which is the symbolism of all of these countries kind of locking arms militarily and assuring each other that they will go to war to protect one another this has its desired goal of keeping the soviet union at bay
absolutely it plain old worked and it was in retrospect a pretty genius invention it's probably truman's greatest single legacy so nato is working and the soviet union falls in the nineteen eighties so it seems like that would be
the a highly logical time for need a which was created to protect europe against the soviet union to dissolve absolutely i mean that question came up very quickly after nine hundred and eighty nine and really dominated debate in george h w bush administration as the soviet union
who's breaking apart and the question was just a very basic one which is do when the baby anymore
we want we don't have this huge hoping soviet union with the power to expand across europe in anything russia which inherited the soviet union's nuclear weapons and all of its problems appear to be franking blue the rationale for nader
is falling apart and there were a lot of people saying it should simply despair that there was just no political reason any more and no military reason to hold onto it
but that's not what happened
who the back

david what happens to nato after the soviet union false
or rather than this band michael it actually expanded many of the former soviet republics who were suddenly finding themselves independent poland and hungary the czech republic all the countries that made up what many the countries that made up the old warsaw pact or is suddenly thinking
themselves they didn't want to be alone they wanted to be part of a west and so they applied for membership the nato and the big question was should nato let them and even if their wrist making refer paranoid and how does nato and the us it's lead sponsor respond to the risk
sire to join they were debates about individual countries than there were some debate with basically said if the russians came and knocked off this tiny little country like estonia latvia lithuania
we really go to war would we really invoke article five to come to their defense
but in the end people decided that the symbolism of having old members of the warsaw pact change teams and come over to nato was worth it even if their military contribution who's pretty tiny and what does russia do in response to this expansion of nato
a group that existed originally to rebuff the old soviet union will initially not much into what a mere prudent became president
and he viewed it as a humiliation he viewed it as an effort to go steal from russia have a core of the old soviet union and he was looking for an opportunity we get even
couldn't realized that article five was something that will get involved if he did a full military attack but he have the money or we we were forces to sustain such an attack so here they come up with a really targeted kind of disruption some way
of harassing these countries some way of undercutting their institutions some way of making people no longer calf
governments without actually bringing about an invocation of article five first he started rebuilding his nuclear forces and then he started in with the cyber attacks
very day one against estonia estonia faced a major crisis in two thousand and seven when it became the first country to experience a massive cyber attack which took down as during his email bank and newspaper servers another very big one against georgia in two thousand and eight paving the way for military action russia attack george's
computer infrastructure crippling the country to country is that of course have been all part of the soviet union he did a series of attacks on ukraine not a nato member but he realized that the fact that they weren't made a member meant that nato was not going to be tempted to come to their defense and he used it
as for his petri dish the place where is the could test out a number of ways of disrupting a society the russians are fully aware that microsoft products like all software can be used as weapons in cyber warfare he brought down the electric power grid in ukraine twice
and of course he metal the bid in there a white as well
look at what russia has done so far there are accused of having interfered or having try to interfere in german french british and us elections there is some evidence that he tried to metal and the breadth of in britain he attempted and failed to meddle in the last french collection he's been trying
in germany and of course vital he made his strongest effort to meddle in elections here in the united states in two thousand and sixteen using many of the technique that he had perfected against nato and other eastern european countries them former soviet state
president trump is slamming some of america's allies staging during a high stakes nato summit in brussels okay so here we are now in two thousand and eighteen and leaders from the nato countries have just gathered for a summit in brussels and president
trump is continuing to go after the military alliance what exactly is president trumps objection to it or president from has had several objections to nato over the years his first one is that it's really expensive and many countries are not paying what they should
frankly many countries
was a tremendous amount of money for many years back
are delinquent
and his second one is he doesn't believe that the united states gets very much out of these this were protecting germany were protecting french were protecting everybody
we're paying a lot of money to protect this has been going on for decades he's simply believes it costs a lot of the benefits to us are hard to measure and probably negative and is there any merit to his argument that the us is giving more than it gets when it comes to nato oh my phone
certainly a merit to the argument that the united states gives the word nato and the european countries don't sacrifice as much in their own defense
and that's not an argument that is new to down trough our freedom isn't free
we've got to be willing to pay for the assets the personnel the training
that's required to make sure that we have a credible
nato force barack obama used to make that argument and that's why nato countries got pressed to contribute more to their military forces during obama has time so there is nothing new and there's certainly nothing wrong in down trumps fundamental complaint
what is different is that president from is the first american president to say if this doesn't change on my terms i mean i've come to your defense when that moment cause i may nor article five wow and trump is actually said that president trump said to me and maggie haldeman during the present
central campaign when i asked him why he come to the defense of a small former soviet states estonia or something if they were attacked by russia he said the first thing i would do is check and see whether they fully paid up in what he calls me though
dues put what the rest of the world moses just they're standing on defense but he was essentially saying that if they call the fire department before the truck was sent out someone was them i woke up and see whether or not they pay their taxes no one's ever heard and american president talk like that or for that in a time of a
urgency he might think about not committing american defenses
a nato ally did from everything you said a lot of these original nato countries and later nato countries rush to the organization seeking defense from first to soviet union and now russia and still live under the protective umbrella of nato so if they're not willing to
to pay the amount of money that the us expects of them isn't that a legitimate grievance on the part of president trump given that they still benefit from nato he's certainly got a very legitimate point as previous presidents have that they need to go carry their own way
now their response to this is hey we've not only carried our own way
we've come in and vote article five to help you in fact the only time article five was ever in vote in nato's history was right after nine eleven
and then nato countries when in with the united states some in large numbers and some and pretty small numbers into both iraq and afghanistan
now their publics came to later on conclude that the united states had used the nine eleven attacks as a way to justify a truly unwise war in iraq
and the power going into iraq that been pretty poisonous to their future contributions to their defense budgets and it is made them think twice about the wisdom of simply letting the united states drag them around as nato decide what conflicts
enter and which ones not too as nato leaders arrived for that two day summit in brussels president rocks the alliance with the accusation that germany is called totally controlled by russia
say when germany makes a massive oil and gas with russia
they are supposed to be guarding against russia and here it goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to fresh air so we started by talking about these three countries the us russia and germany as being the three countries that explain the beginnings of nato and i'm struck that the news out
of the nato summit today was the trump was going after germany saying that it was under the control of russia germany is totally controlled by russia because they're getting from sixty to seventy percent of their energy from russia and a new pipeline live in what was that about that seems like the autumn
mid insult to deliver at a nato summit
it was the ultimate and home may have had more to do with his differences with angela merkel the transfer germany then he did with any true belief but the core of the argument was germany gets an overwhelming amount of natural gas the fuel with keeps it warm in the winter
from russia and it's about building a new pipeline that will bring them him directly from russia and his basic argument is how can you argue that you're standing up against russia
when you are funding russia russia is overly dependent on its energy exports and when you're vulnerable to the russians who can simply turn off the vow and what was the reaction from germany
it led many to question whether or not president trump fundamentally believes in the nato mission
and that's a big question
i was a conference of europeans last weekend where i had never before heard people question whether or not they should go forward thinking with the united states would be the core of a few tornado
and for the first time i heard them debating could we continue with the nato that didn't have the us at the center and one in which the united states wasn't the garment and voice in defence policy potent and trump are to meet in helsinki finland on july sixteen just days after the president
the nato summit with america's closest allies the president predicted meeting don't quote maybe the easier
of others that dance he has scattered than strep david i want to ask you about what's happening right after this nato meeting and which seems particularly curious given the history that you just alamein for us right after this meeting ends in brussels president trump is going to meet with prudent what do you make
of this timing
the problem isn't the meeting michael the problem in their mind is donald trump's message if he was leaving nato to stand up to him and say we're not going to tolerate the meddling and elections and we're not going to tolerate the continuing occupation of crimea the harassment of ukraine
that was his message i think they'd be fine with the meeting happening right entered nato their problem is they don't actually believe that donald trump is going to stand up to put him and they're somewhat horrified at the imagery of him beating are publicly on television against his allies
and then embracing an autocrat who put dissidents reporters to death than is increasingly cracking down on his own country
so it seems like we find ourselves in a really interesting place where the country that nato was formed to protect against his and it's most aggressive in decades and the country that created nato is seemingly the least committed it's ever been
it's pretty rare try running their at the moment that we weren't that the cold war may not be over with it may just be entering a different kind of games that the united states
is questioning the very premise on which it created nato
and that the russians have been successful in sewing more and more discord throughout europe and hoping exaggerate each of these schisms but no one's exaggerated those isms more than president from himself
not by questioning whether the nato nations are contributing a mouse that's a perfectly legitimate question to raise been questioning whether or not he would even stick with the alliance and that's the central issue
and
david thank you very much thank you mike


here's what else you can each hundred just
a little one percent worse united states actual numbers a four point two percent a much larger gdp so i think that's
the times reports that behind closed doors on wednesday to president trump suggested that nato allies increase their military budgets not to the two percent of their economies that they've previously pledged to one but to four percent a figure that nieto secretary general sought to downplay
well our focus on what do you have agreed that we read read to be committed to the pledge reason defense political person
let's start with that
so where our way to go but the president did sign on to a nato declaration emphasizing strength and burden sharing within the alliance and harshly criticizing russia for annex inclined
that's it
i'm like obama


from the new york times on michael bubble this piece the daily
today
during their historic summit president trump standing next to president poop challenge the conclusion of his own government that russia interfered in the us elections
they think it's russia trump said i don't see any reason why it would be


it's tuesday july seventeen
judy davis what's the main question what's your main question going into this summit on monday while the main question is really you know what is going to try to get out of this and is he in this opportunity we have that sit down with coach and gonna actually bring up
some of the big issues in the relationship primarily the fact that russia interfered in the presidential election but also russia is illegal annexation of crimea the poisonings have written that russia has been accused of carrying out his the president and actually pressed him on these things are going to be all
about friendliness and reaching out which is how the president basically seem to be approaching this in the days leading up to that meeting where in all this is coming just three days after these latest indictments from the special counsel robber mother's investigation indictments of russian government officials which left to essentially under nine
mobile that russia medals in the twenty six election and that it was orchestrated by prudent and this government right i mean this there's always going to be a topic of conversation at this meeting he said that he was going to ask about it even before we knew that these indictments are going to happen but certainly once they came down on friday
it completely changed the cast of the cement and was this going to change a president's tack on this is approach to put non the issue or was he going to do what he's done in the past are essentially to ask the question but when push him and has denied a know he's basically moved on from and
and the fact that the indictments came down on friday mean let's just move on just really impossible
so what happens as this day begins in helsinki that gives us some idea of what the answer will be just on so for his part the president started the day with a series of fire he tweets president champ as he is want to do start treating unquote our relationship with
russia has never been worse thanks to many years of us homelessness and stupidity and now the rig which which of course his way of referring to the mother investigation
so right off the bat he's essentially parenting or hijacking a pollutant narrative the russian air at him which is but it's the united states that is responsible for the difficulties in the relationship it's the united states that's been at fault that we haven't pursued a better and warmer relationship with russia annexed time
to change that and that was the going in pastor and very quickly within an hour i think the russian foreign ministry retreated the president of united states and said we agree we agree with the president united states sentiment that the problem here even though we have my old in the us election the problem here is the united states
right
and that tweet and the russian agreement with it that now kind of feels like a harbinger for the rest of the day absolutely
and good morning to you a bit of drama this morning as this summit is already an hour behind schedule so for a while after president trump has treated and he is not the finish president he's waiting for couldn't to arrive he was scheduled to arrive just about an hour
our ago but as president potent likes to do he likes to keep other world leaders are waiting and repeat in likes to arrive late meetings like this one and of a power play the pros united states now walking in to meet

there you see that handshake and warm words between president trump and president potent as part of them you know the reporters filed out and it was time for them to me alone with just their translators and that's what they didn't present and trump is now meaning behind closed doors with russian president vladimir poodle and finland's presidential palace and then they were supposed to spend ninety minutes together
they spent more than two hours together just the two of them and their interpreters the no advisers president now president who brags about his ability to make a deal is sitting down with one of the most experienced players on the world stage which was a prospect that had really alarm and a lot of people going in during couldn't time in power he's met with every year
us president since bill clinton because it's kind of a big deal when the president of the united states and russia talk together and for there to be no historical record at all of that is pretty extraordinary server to president reached burned to come out every moment we're watching her door there was a longish way and there was a lot of anticipation because nobody
really knew what we were going to hear when they going to come out with some big announcement were they going to make nice were they going to be very have to do with each other
some terms of what happened
it was just kind of black box
so that's where we were that she president walken
so the two of them come out of the through a side door and the it their place that their lectern
personal issue
just so much president spoke first distinguished mr president
what it isn't gym he essentially started out by saying you know less than what we've had this tension and there's no reason for it the war is a thing of past situation and the world changed dramatically you know he really i think was trying to strike the tone of were world leaders and we should be on an equal plane to those ghosts
asians referred to go or joint wish i were drink with jewish with present from to redress this negative situation and volatile relationship and of course this is part of pollutants objective here is to be seen as not a pariah not as someone who invade countries and murders people but as someone who's the big player on the world stage and word
the summit with the american president and once again prison trump motion the issue of a so called interference of russia
american elections he did mention what he called the so called interference of russia russians food has never interfered and is not going to interfere in to internal american affairs including your approaches and he kind of the ended it on a positive note he said in general we are globe with the outcome of
first full kill meeting had a good conversation with person trump and i hope we started to understand that other better and i'm grateful to donald forward forward and it was pretty clear he was happy with the way things went but he wasn't gloating he was just being very matter of fact and laying out what he thought that they had gotten out of the top
and then
have just completed a meeting with version important when a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries we are direct open deeply productive dialogue
when very will it was trumps turn a productive dialogue is done only good for the united states and good for russian what it is good for the world and he kind of portrayed it as a political risk for him i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace
the to risk peace in pursuit of politics as president i will always what is best for america
what is best for the american people that you know he was willing to take this a grass and because you know there's that it's dark opportunity here and i like repair the relationship with russia and he made this comment what our relationship has never been worse
that it is now
however
changed
as of about four hours ago
meaning like he donald trump by having this meaning had essentially you just kind of change the relationship and that this was the dawn of something much better during today's reading i addressed directly with president potent the issue of russian interference in our elections and during his opening scene
the president said that he had addressed directly with in the issue of russian interference in the us election and he said i felt this was a message burst delivered in person our ears perked up and we thought oh maybe this is condemning this spent a great deal of time talking about
president bush
may very well want to address it
and very strongly because she feels very strongly about the news an interesting idea and then that was it
this is the moment that you've been waiting for instance all of us have been waiting for not just since these indictments on friday but maybe even since the meddling occurred that standing together in front of the public the president would speak candidly
occasionally about this interference this historic interference in our election and he does that instead yeah it was striking because the way he phrased that it was a message best deliver it in person
you could imagine him going on to say you know in the message is you've attacked our democracy you better not do it again years the price you're going to pay for her but there was none of bad and you know him he is on the stage with couldn't standing right next to him and whether or not he had brought it up privately this would have been the moment
on the world stage to say to people i'm taking this guy task i am holding him to cap and he just was not going to go there
this was a very constructive day this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together
it's a the interests of both of our countries
to continue our conversation and we have agreed to do so
i'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future often and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today show again version and boot thank you very much
so then they finish their statements and it was time to take questions and the press mr president you treated this morning that it's us foolishness stupidity and the muller pro that is responsible for the decline in us relations with russia president champ as asked by athletes reporter for writers do you hold russia at all
all accountable for anything in particular and if so what would you what would you consider them that they are responsible for yes i do i older both countries responsible and the president essentially
no i think that the united states has being foolish i think we've all been foolish we should add this dialogue a long time ago
long term frankly before i got office
they were all to blame he doesn't take the opportunity again to take him to task for any things i think that the the probe is a disaster for our country any kind of pivots from the general thing and starts talking about mother proud i think it's kept a support it
kept the separated there was no collusion at all
everybody knows it
people are being brought out to the four so far that i know virtually none of it related to the campaign and they gonna have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign there was a clean campaign
i beat hillary clinton easily and frankly we beat her and i'm not even saying from the standpoint we won that race
it's a shame that they could even be a little bit of the cloud over it
people know that people understand it but the main thing and we discussed is also zero collusion and it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world we have ninety percent of nuclear power between the two countries it's
ridiculous it's ridiculous what's going on with the bro you know that was a pretty striking
well man where you know he's for weeks and months his advisors have been saying we are holding russia accountable for friends malign activities and here is a direct question about the your old russia accountable for anything and the president doesn't mention anything and he is instead blaming the are prob for president
i could follow up as well
and then put in his ass by the same report or the american reporter fighters why should americans and why should president trump believe your statement that russia did not intervene and the two thousand and sixteen election given the evidence that us intelligence agencies have provided and will you consider extraditing the twelve russian officials there were indicted last week by us grand jury will
a little at the president answer the second part of their coercion and trump jumps in before curtain has a champs but as you know the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before but it came out as a reason why the democrats lost an election
which frankly they should have been able to win because the electoral college is much more advantageous for democrats as you know than it is to republicans we won the electoral college by a lot three o six to two twenty three i believe and that was a well for
that was a well fought battle we did a great job
essentially it's very clear that he thinks it's class question about twelve russian officers you are again accused of attacking the american electoral system
at the whole issue is meant to undercut him he is completely focused on the fact that these people are not failure but has campaigned and has nothing to do with him just to say it one time again and i say it all the time
there was no collusion i didn't know the president
there was nobody to collude with so he views the through the prism of his own campaign and his election not the democratic system and the electoral process it was undermined right we win a brilliant campaign and that's why i am president
so then you know it's couldn't turn to answer and at this point he basically doesn't have any any more trump has already made his case as to who has to be believed who's not to be believed
you can trust no one if you if you do this what did you give this idea that president term trusts me or i trust him
he defends the interest of the united states of america and i do defend the interests of the russian federation any essentially says you know there's no proof we should be guided by effects could you name a single fact of what definitively prove the collusion
this is an utter nonsense
just like the present recently mentioned i just wasn't your own president he denied that so you now don't take my word for it yeah take your own president's work for it that was really striking because you know
a lot of these encounters are about message and what's that in public and what is seen in public
and the spectacle of the two of them a pair of offending russia
and essentially rolling their eyes and calling ridiculous the basis of a federal investigation that's been minimized by the entire intelligence community of the united states was something right
the final question for the united states will go to jonathan home air from the ip the second american question the final american question was printing press reporter and he basically just heard it said president chump very directly who do you believe just out as of important denied having anything to do with the election interference in two thousand and sixteen every us intelligence agency is going to
russia did what who my first question for you sir is who do you believe my second question is would you now with the whole world watching tell president what you did doubts what happened and twenty sixteen which warn him to never do it again this is kind of the final chance for trump to say so
something judgment at all about the russian interference in the us auction in front of the man who director that's right so let me just say that we have two thoughts you have group said are wondering why the f b i never took the server and he pivots to its idea of where hillary clinton's emails what
happened to the servers of the pakistani gentleman that worked on the day and were of those servers they're missing where are they what happened to hillary clinton's emails thirty three thousand emails gone just gone i think in russia they wouldn't be gun show easily and why didn't the f b i
in accept that their servers at the dance scene that were hacked into why was the f b i told to leave the office of the democratic national committee i've been wondering that i've been asking them for months and months and i've been putting it out and calling it out on social media
where is the server and where he essentially says i i don't know which to believe and he kind of indicates the he leans toward project i have a president important he'd you said it's not russia i will say this i don't see any reason why it would be that i really do want to see the server
what i have i have confidence in both parties anything i have confidence in both parties both parties us
latimer couldn't and his intelligence official so i have great confidence in my intelligence people but i will tell you the president who's extremely strong and powerful in his denial today i mean it's essentially as if he's making excuses for food and who's sitting
they're smart gang and looks like feeling very good about itself julie what is the reaction in the room at this moment i mean what is it like to be in that room as the president of united states rejects his own countries version of events
in favor of russians this country that we are accusing of having done this i think that it took everyone's breath away i mean start of these things are things that we have heard the president say snippets of of for but it's a very different thing for him to be on foreign soil with the president of russia
and undercutting his whole administration has or government so i think you know there was a lot of looking around at each other like is this
really happening
and what does this actually mean and at a certain point
after that last question was asked and he did not take the side of the united states it was almost like the oxygen
it was just very hashed

do the whole time i'm watching this honestly i'm just wondering why genuinely why would the president that's what is to be gained for him
and for the united states in seeming to side with russia over his own country and his own government at such a sensitive moment when russia's role in attacking our free elections is becoming more and more undeniable who gains from god i think it's really hard to say i don't believe that this
well thought out well planned now reaction that he had to these questions
what we saw was the president being defensive about something that he considers to be an affront it has legitimacy
and he could not see past that and it was not i don't think him at that moment about national security or the standing of the united states in the world it was about him and feeling like he was being undermined and undercut and that he could never be as powerful as he wanted to be he could never have this kind of relationship that he wants to have a threat
russia as long as this was hanging over him
and i think he feels on some level that any acknowledgement of what has happened
that it somehow means that he is not a legitimate president and he's not willing to do it
do think that many of us are sort of misunderstanding this moment because i think most of us saw these twelve and vitamins coming three days before the summit as basically requiring trump to finally condemn rushes meddling in the election put his boots
actually happening the timing of these indictments is causing trump to be more inclined to defend and less willing to criticize because of the questions that it raises about his election and twenty sixteen and about his legitimacy i think that's possible i mean i think that part
of the message from the indictment on friday part of the expectation was almost all this gives the president a much stronger hand going into these meetings to basically you know throw the document down in front of couldn't and say look we know that's happened what are we gonna do about it
and then it when some way he is the conversation for him to stay were holding you accountable
what we've got how are we gonna make sure this doesn't happen again but i think instead of say it almost feels to him like device is getting tighter and the narrative that he doesn't like that russia helped him to win the election is gaining ground because these indictment there so clear
and detailed about how it happened
instead of kind of strengthening his hand which it will have done for any other american president in this position i think he felt that it under kind of even further and so he's even less willing to acknowledge that there's anything to hold russia accountable for a question for president for president thank you so the how does this
finally and julie well cells president wouldn't have asked do you just the military government have any compromise material on president or his family and he pauses what the translation goes through and laugh
kind of roll his eyes and he said yeah i've heard those rumors old distinguished color good material you bruce when prison transit it school board when i didn't even know that he was in law school it's nothing it's difficult to imagine a nuances of a bigger scale
please just disregard the shoes and don't think voters anymore you so at that point jump jump back in and the last thing he says is if couldn't have anything on me it would have without longer go and if anybody watch peter struck testifying over the last couple of days and i was in brussels watch figured it was it
disgrace to the of the it was a disgrace to our country and you would say that was a total witch hunt thank you very much everybody thank you
and then he turned on a feel and he walked out

so president trumps final words on this historic day at the end of this summer is that the muller investigation which just indicted twelve of pollutants officials for hacking the united states election was a total withdrawn
guess

joy thank you very much thank you my

we'll be right back



thirty years what else you need to an attorney
as we mentioned there is considerable consternation on capitol hill about the person's comments to very many lawmakers from both parties were stoned and even angered by what they heard the helsinki started with some suggesting president trap was outfoxed in the hours after the summit on monday booth democratic and republican mommy

imploring his republican colleagues to join for the president of the united states to side with president proven against american law enforcement
american defense officials american intelligence agencies is godless it's dangerous it's week
president was putting himself
overall country
vote republican leaders refrain from criticizing the president directly instead they said they trusted the us government over potent senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters that combed the russians are not our friends and i have complete confidence in our intelligence

twenty six team campaign
the f b i alleges that at the behest of a senior russian official the woman mario patina
made connections through groups like the national rifle association
try to steer the republican party toward more poor impulse
that's it for the day
michael bubble
see them

from the new york times on of of this is the day

republicans have found themselves unexpectedly scramble to hold onto a house in tuesday's special election know i have it's turned out to be a symbol of what's ahead for the party in the mid

it's tuesday august so
experts tell us about this election in ohio today this is sort of and accidentally important election were only having this road in ohio today because the previous congressmen a very long serving republican quit in the middle of his term to go take a lucrative job and the private sector
this wasn't supposed to be a competitive race it's a solidly conservative district to the north and east of columbus ohio he voted for president trump by eleven percentage points and voted for other republicans by a great deal more than that but the rate has gotten shock competitive and in a way that is pretty revealing for the larger
landscape of the midterm election
and you have this battle wage between two candidates who are themselves very conventional politicians you don't have a rock star on either side of the race here the republicans a state senator name troy boulder son former car dealer the democrats to thirty one year old county official danny o'connor
they are basically generic republican a generic democrat
and so in spite of the fact that they are both basically boring canada
and despite the fact that the district is basically a conventional a republican district it's a very very close election and this is all about the enthusiasm on the democratic side the divisions within the republican party sense of basically being demoralized that you hear and see from so many conventional republican voters

so don't think we've got an interesting race here because it's a republican district that could flip to democratic control with to kind of plain vanilla candidates that stand in for their parties more broadly that's right plain vanilla is a much nicer thing to say about them and boring and in some ways it's more accurate you don't have a large
i figure in this race and you don't really have a larger than life issue in this race you get to see really a snapshot of what the republican message is going to be and what the democratic message was going to be and who that massive resonates were so it's very much a race about the two parties and their strategy is just a few months before the general election kind of feels
it's a perfect petri dish version of what november's maternal it's pretty close to an ideal test if you wanted to test the mood and the messages in this campaign nationally you would want to do it in a district that was a little more moderate a little more diverse than this one is an overwhelmingly white and solidly conservative but
til this is as close to a good test were going to get before the final stretch in the next three months is the fact that this district is very wide and pretty conservative mean it's even more in port to republicans given their constituencies yes it means that this race approximates the republican party better than iraq
makes the country and it will tell us more about the state of the republican coalition in the mid term elections and the effectiveness of the republican message men and tell us about the mood of the country as a whole so how are we seeing the republicans approach this special election how are they campaigning well at the very beginning republicans thought that
if they nominated a mainstream conservative if you want something called troy borders
conservative champion truly water and bold leadership eliminate ohio staggering deficit and land on a message about taxes and the tax cut bill that made its way through congress that would just be enough in a district like this one states and toy voters and voted to cut taxes by five billion dollars the result in other words
look what we've done done a good job you've got a good candidate keep us and our exactly and they thought the bat message would resonate with the kind of moderately conservative suburban voter that sent pat deberry back to congress over and over and over again the national republican party work to actively to get troy boulders and through the primary he beat back a candidate who is
much further to the right because they banked on mainstream conservative message this shouldn't be complicated true boulders and an iron man athlete
he is grit conservative grid
so
to eliminate ohio's budget deficit without raising taxes they ran some ads about the tax bill the ransom ads about pro bowlers and being no good neighbor good family man he knows about hard
aldridge in the family farm and ran the family business and written those about you
and thin christian but it just didn't get the job done
meanwhile the same old politics in washington just aren't work any o'connor the democrat as run a very hard charging campaign we need new leadership and both parties about shaking up washington about brain new leadership to the capital about protecting healthcare benefits and about protecting medicare and social security let's fight back against drug and insurance
anthony greed let's protect every dime of the social security and medicare benefits seniors have and i'm danny o'connor in i approve this message and so the race heightened and heightened and heightened and pretty quickly dishonest danny o'connor wants to take away your guns
this is danny supports open borders and sanctuary cities
you saw national republicans switched from a positive message about the economy to just the most relentlessly negative campaign you will find all and sanctuary cities to stop illegals from taking our jobs fight alongside trump to implement his engine
and use conservative grip to build the gone i'm a christian conservative he's been endorsed by right to life five times have an a rating from and or ad for nancy pelosi in her gang of liberals like me i'm a republican troy dollars and a conservative with grit and i approve this message
and why is this strategy chef that you're describing notable from your perspective of someone who covers politics is the kind of strategy that you normally see at the very end of the midterm election when an embattled political party feels like it has no option but to go all negative on the other side and what you have right now
his three months before the general election the end of the national campaign republican party leaders pointing at this race and this strategy and saying this is how we're going to keep the house
in other words the party isn't waiting until the last few weeks of the upcoming that terms as far to go this negative as they are doing in this district in ohio their viewing it as the strategy for the rest of the mentors that's right this is not the last resort this is their best hope and what does that tell us as the republicans are
a lot of trouble and then
so you went to ohio to check out what's happening race i did
oh
i don't i don't remember
education

so what's the situation there for the republican campaign dollars a week out from the election when you were there when i was there they're big concern and i think it's still there are concerned today was just about getting voters on their side engage to and energized that their concern is that
in polling frankly for both political parties the voters who are paying the most attention to this race who know the date of the election who are planning to show up tend to lean towards the democrats there are many more republicans in this district and and are democrats but by and large just not that focused on this race and that's a problem
for especially bothersome it's a huge problem for boulders and democrats wake up every morning looking for opportunities to send a message to the president and to do something about the state of things in washington republicans in this district maybe some of them will show up to send a message to washington by and large you're asking or group of people who were well
to complacent to turn out on the first today in august is that enthusiasm gap you're describing typical and they turn election it it's you'd normally in a presidential race you see partisans on both sides really show up in the national elections a choice between the two parties midterms are often just referendum on the president and the party it is angry or at the present
it tends to show up more we saw it for bill clinton and george bush barack obama we're seeing it for president trump but the republican party's challenge on that front is compounded by barry very serious divisions on the centre right the republican coalition in a district like this one is just unstable because those folk
in the suburbs who will love your more moderate republicans like a path tiberi like a junkie basic aren't so hot on president trump and folks in the more rural part of the district they love the president but whether either group shows up is an open question she didn't mention the rural trump voter in ohio
steals like that kind of republican is more or less a guaranteed voter in today's election that they would be happy with how things are going is that what you found there are definitely a much more likely voter then your suburban soft republican but even for your more hardcore trump republican
this is an off season election it's the only thing on the ballon many of these folks have already voted in primary elections which ohio held earlier this year many of them may be planning to vote in november but asking people to vote three times in a year is a pretty big ask so what's the approach with this kind of voter with this negative
strategy that you're describing is it to go after what the democrats would take away from them or would change for the worse the same way that president trumped up so immigration guns a kind of cultural war stuff that really is the approach that you're saying with your hard core trump conservative voters in the more rural
parts of the district
resistance is demanding when they want to eliminate the law enforcement agency that enforces immigration most americans doors to climb
what daniel can't help they usually a lot of adds a lot of political mail pieces about immigration about guns about nancy pelosi nancy pelosi in washington liberals are dangerous they can't be trusted to uphold oh your values liberals in washington want to repeal the middle class tax cut implement socialize
medicine and high taxes on working families danny o'connor is just as dangerous he was trying to hammer home too conservative voters that there's an important election on the ballot and the democrats are coming dangerous daniel corner
i'm troy or sin and i approved this message when i saw vice president perhaps they are with pro bowler some he was all the other side talks about this thing bush become
what they want to bring what the blue way
you carter join nancy pelosi
in a democrat majority on capitol hill you're going to have fewer jobs fewer opportunities more government and more attached daniel carter is gonna raise your taxes we need to build the war we made hair strand try sex change in america stream trying
hi maria
your out
somebody and talking to folks in the crowd you heard people essentially welcoming that message that yeah we need to go we need to elect a republican we need to protect president trumped was verbatim one of them
i love
what comes rally on saturday night it was really just total war on day o'connor you see this i mean usually pelosi who by the way again controls danny oh god gonna whoever that matters
any it sounded a lot like his twenty sixteen rallies and he was like a low level person that did nothing
any of drawn
beauty is another this though we're fighting they will take away your taxes they will destroy so many things that we've given i do talk about draw borders son but he went after danny o'connor as i you know nancy pelosi liberal was a guy who's vote in congress is going to create more crime and more illegal immigration
danny boy and the democrats vote to let criminals and drug for into our country and thirteen run wild in our communities and you know what they do once
we're going to protect our law enforcement not just ice all of our law
for the voter in ohio in this district it's just kind of two thousand and sixteen all over again right for the republicans the challenge and turning out trumps base is giving and the same sense of urgency that they felt in the presidential election and what about the voters in this district who aren't trump supporters the more moderate republicans well
this is what makes it so complicated for republicans because all those more moderate republicans you're sort of john case of republicans they are probably the most important group of decision makers in a special election and i found them sounding pretty indecisive and pretty ambivalent about their options in the race i spoke to one woman outside of barnes and noble in dublin ask you just barely
i think that brother
and he needs now
but be so
juvenile and petty but i like doing said he would do more republican voted for president
she wishes he would knock off a lot of his antics but he's delivered what he said he was going to deliver and she asked me by the way what are the names of the candidates and their special like a good sign for a it's not a great site and that woman is probably not going to show up for troy borders and if she doesn't know his name before the election bad is what makes republicans so nervous about this group of voters
i got really bad guy
go to another woman at her door i was going door to door canvassing with the congressional leadership on big republican super pac spoke to one woman had her door who said she's a republican she votes republican her main concern is taxes everything good brother
i
i'm sure i can i knew that before he was elected sale and she thinks the president's allows you to offer for him i didn't know now and vote for him in two thousand and sixteen and she's pay no attention to this election so in some ways even more emphatic than the woman in the parking lot that she is just not paying attention
and she almost seen resentful of the implication that she should resentful of the implication that just because she's a republican she should care about the special election and vote for the republican and people have heard a lot from these campaign so maybe it's just exhaustion but there were also seems like a sense that know you you can't demand my vote right now
sounds like republicans in this different have an apathy problem on the one hand with kind of loyal trump republican voters and kind of a deeper problem with moderate republicans in this district who are not happy with the president and don't seeming teach and erase at all that's exactly right
and republicans are trying to solve both problems or ones with some remedies that could undermine each other you bring in president trump to fire up his base your risk disillusioning anti tramp republicans even further
and the bottom line is that in both cases with the trump supporting voters and non this strategy in this race is scare republican voters to the polls with a very dark vision of life hundred democrats it is exactly to scare them to the polls and to disqualify democrats as an alternative to make sure that voters who
who like the president see his political legitimacy at stake and it's to make sure the voters who don't like the president don't see the democrats as a viable option

so the strategy that we're talking about relentlessly negative tactic
why is that necessarily a bad place for republicans to be because that was a pretty effective strategy for donald trump in twenty sixteen it's way too early to say if this strategy is going to work nationally will get clues today to see whether it works in ohio but the fact that they need to spend so much money to defend district
like this one republican outside groups have spent nearly four million dollars trying to bail out troy borders and that is greater than what the democrats have spent by a factor of five or six they can't have that kind of spending advantage in every race around the country and november one in a money there's not enough money in the house campaign in total to put
bad into all the competitive races a district that the president carried by eleven points should be a district that's responsive to a message about keep the progress keep up the momentum in washington reward us from the things we've done so far that message didn't connect so what would you call this strategy being practiced at
in ohio
think you have to see it as kind of an apocalypse now strategy right that this is every piece of ordinance that republicans had logged with incredible funding behind it at this basically unremarkable the opera
and what's the significance of what happens today in ohio look i think most people involved in the race think that ball son is more likely than not to win by a little which would give republicans maybe a little bit of confidence that this is a strategy that can work in much of the country if the strap
dougie fails then you are really in a break glass and case of emergency situation for the geo they used everything they have to try to yet there are people out if it doesn't work there's no fallback plan right now meaning if the apocalyptic now strategy fails then it's just the apocalypse
that's certainly how it would feel to the republican party have ninety days left until the election with no strategy that can keep even a district that the president one by eleven points in their right to can save the district that the president one by double digits
then you're in trouble that would be most alarming for republicans also alarming for republicans if they hang onto the still by one point two points three points there are dozens and dozens and dozens of districts that are much more closely divided than this one and if the slash and burn strategy can only save this destroyed by a point two two
there are certainly enough district for democrats to take the house that are well to the center of this one
so a win for republicans today in this special election in ohio because still feel like a loss there are going to be very very few republicans in washington reassured by a one point when this district
oh
so how is it accurate to say that that after a republican presidential candidate donald trump one on a relentlessly negative and polarizing strategy in two thousand and sixteen and then government pretty much the same way his republican house majority now requires a relentlessly negative and puller
rising mid term campaign to defend its power and what does that tell us i think that's exactly accurate
it makes a lotta republicans extremely uncomfortable are no rules that this is not the campaign they envisioned a year and a half ago but thought they'd be able to run in the mid term elections on an upbeat for looking message about economic prosperity about having kept their promises on issues like health care and immigration and taxes and national security and
instead they have this relatively demoralizing slog ahead of them have essentially having to tear down their opponents all over again and by the way this time they don't have hillary clinton to help them
guess what i'm wondering is once you go that negative are you stuck campaigning that way as long as you've got that same president and power is that become the message of the republican party there is no separating the republican party from president in the eyes of orders at this point we have seen that so consistently
in the elections since he took office and we're seeing it in this one too that's part of why republicans have decided to take the risk of bringing in the president brain and the vice president into a district where they are polarizing because they are making the bet that the polarization will work for them
thank you thank you
we'll do right back
what else you need to
at twelve or one this morning the trump administration reimposed twenty year old economic sanctions on iran
that had been lifted by president obama as part of the iran nuclear president trump said the sanctions would encourage iran to renegotiate the two thousand and fifty nuclear which he pulled out of inane but the most immediate consequences has been to infuriate america's allies in europe
including britain germany and france who fear the sanctions could severely punished domestic companies that do business with iran
on monday the three countries announced a plan to block the us from punishing those businesses as the sanctions require and just like the battle says it's basically an inter galactic invasion into this phase two people i'm telling you that the age of shed and

that's it for the day
i'm michael cobra seen one

from the new york times on michael barbara
is that
today
new that is challenging the popular portrait of the trump voted and revealing why it's the trump voter we don't talk about who may determine the outcome of the mit
it's friday august him
can tell us about this poll and why you're interested it's a pretty novel survey so most polls you'd call thousand people you're done with them in you instead has recruited several thousand people to take their pills every month and so what they did was they asked people on november two thousand and sixteen did you vote for the president
how do you feel
step further they went match that our panelists to official voter records indicate whether someone voted arena
now flash forward to two thousand and team they went back those same people and asked how do you feel about the president today
so you'd have a great picture you both have a really good account of how people felt and twenty six and we can ask the same people how they feel about the present today so most polls just go pick up a group of people like a thousand people asking the question and discard them and then the next poor as a different group of people and so on and so on this poor has been kind of more faithful to the same group of
and that's nice because you know that changes you see in the poor because of people changing their minds not changes and who you're ask i think it's the best account we have of who voted for the president and how they feel about the president today
all the pulls out of all the pulls out there are going this is the best we and it may be the best we are
so before you tell us who the trunk voter actually is according to this pew report give us a picture of who we tend to think the junk food or is interact with the white house white male voters traditionally those in rural areas the bacon the democratic party are and why hillary clinton had
not yet been able to get them but that changing american white working class makes up the core of down from support but what's driving their decision to support him over hillary clinton
i think the stereotype is of a white male doubt a college degree
who is so loyal to the president that he would back him no matter what he said or did let me turn it around mass you will definitely is my perception yeah so what proportion of trumps voters do you think are white men without a college degree
i would i would estimate fifty percent the data says it is thirty three percent so i mean that two thirds of trumps supporters defy that stereotype and at least one respect their either a woman at a college degree or their non white so just thirty three percent of the people voted for trump in two thousand and sixteen are white men with that
that's right
so i'm wrong i mean i'm pretty generous greater by think fifties far enough that your own okay so how do you think that compares to past presidents them or past republican nominee is be more specific so it could be mitt romney can be george w bush john mccain recent republican nominee so how many white nail non college educated voters
backed all of those were forgotten what share of their voters were white men without a degree
okay i'm going to guess and a give you a little explanation for each one
george w bush had a pretty significant appeal to a spanish voters so i'm gonna guess he has a slightly lower percents mean that so many guess twenty
six for george w bush and i'm going to guess
thirty four
workmen rocking romney i'm gonna go and twenty five the all around thirty to thirty five percent and the reason is that the country is getting better and better educated overtime and more diverse so even though bush did better among us and voters there were fewer hispanic voters back in two thousand and four
there's this weird across cutting pattern where the country is getting better educated but the republicans are losing ground among them so the trump voter is within just a few percentage points pretty much the same as your standard republican voter is really what you're saying right
so where did we get this idea me that trumps voters are mostly non college educated white men
or largely not college educated white men who will stick with the president no matter what it must have derived from somewhere i think it comes from a very understandable focus on how trump won the election
and the data shows what we've recognized for a long time which that trump one over the top because he excelled among white voters started agree particularly in these midwestern battleground states where the electoral college was one and lost and so when you try to figure out how trump one it makes sense to go and visit a steel town and go to the bar and talk to a white working class voters you
data for instance says that trump one white working class men by fifty point margin seventy to twenty three in the huge improvement for the republicans over mitt romney performance in two thousand and twelve but those voters aren't necessarily representative of all trump voters they may have been the voters that got him over the top but trying to understand the trump phenomenon more broadly more sociological or at least nationally you wouldn't have felt
so overwhelmingly on that one group so it's absolutely correct that president from did unusually well with white men without college degrees
it's just that that's not the whole story it's not how he did it's not so it seems like we've completed this voter who put trample over the edge and these battleground states in twenty sixteen the non college educated white man
with just the voter more broadly right and that's important because as you mentioned an important facet of this pupils and it's also tracking oil t and how people support for the present has changed over time and the people finds that yeah these white working class men actually are pretty likely to remain loyal to the president you ask people to measure their support from the president on a
ill from zero to one hundred and one one hundred means i love the guy and zero means you hate him and eighty nine percent of white men without a degree still raided him as a seventy five or higher as of this year was order for the president to be ninety percent of their basically guaranteed supporter i think that's fair to say but there are other elements of the trunk coalition that are not as oil the weakest link seems
to be women with a college degree so in this all fourteen percent of the white college educated women who said they voted for the present november two thousand and sixteen say they have a very cold impression of him today less than twenty five in november two thousand and sixteen when you first test the pool only one percent of college educated woman said that so
have a group of people who we know voted for the president who clearly have soured on him sense them so that's fascinating this group of voters that you're describing white college educated women we tend not to even think of them as trump voters and what you're saying is actually they were but they're starting to turn on the president yeah so fourteen percent of the president
supporters were women with a college degree according to the data son a huge number but for comparison new ten percent of voters nationally are hispanic and plenty of time is very understandable he spent trying to understand that voting bloc so fourteen percent out of a whole national coalition is a big number so we started off as conversation with you telling us that we don't really understand the trumpet
whilst we think they do that are sense that it's just way men without college degrees is not quite right at all and in fact it's a broader coalition that includes groups like white college educated women and now you're saying that it was that group that we tend to over think about on white on called you to hit men never mind the most loyal
and it's the group of voters we tend to think about it all who are the most vulnerable and are trying i'm right and that could be a big problem for the republicans in the mid terms
the
will do it back
we won with everything we won with women and i love the women
we won with
i'd graduated with limited
you know for those numbers came house that possible
i've ever heard i was going to win the women i said i think the women like the my wife the first lady a lot he said the women really like you
i like that
what i said i did we win the women
what do we need to know about this group of voters who tended not to think about it all when we thought about how trump point and twenty sixty and white women with college degrees as we head into the meters in general the pew data suggests that this group of white college educated women voted for trump with more reservations than any of the other groups that support of it so only
eighty three percent gave him a very warm or warm rating in november two thousand and sixteen
i think it's reasonable to assume that there was a race not the president have largely been confirmed maybe these were a republican voters who knew they weren't going to vote for hillary clinton because of all of her flaws and they gave the president chance but it it's fair to say that whatever concerned them are made them less likely to support the president two years ago has only been rent for
worst in the intervening two years you identify as a feminist you feminist no i wouldn't say i'm the feminist and a myth i think that would be may be going too far for women for men for everyone i think i think people have to go out they have to go out and really do it and they have to win and that's what and women are doing great
now for the first time since roe v wade
has a vice president a live vice president
my house of representatives twenty five for life
public state capitals that is pretty good
donald trump is also thinking critically their over remark you made the usa today about the actual harassment claim against roger ale to step down last month of had a pox new in that interview with columnist kirsten powers trump reiterated his criticism the women who came forward to complain about
he'd earlier said it was very fab that women were accusing ale the powers then ask trump what he would do if his daughter a vodka was treated the same way as alleged victims were treated trump replied i would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case so something has happened
i was going on this is tons there's revisions into destroyed and the good that may vote against am or the party into a couple months
and how could make a difference in the mid term elections and they need to make a big difference in the maternal term she's not like a presidential election presidential election comes down to the closest states and for a bunch of reasons it turns out that the closest states
were disproportionately white working class and twenty six think that's the presents biggest strength so the president's big strength could really pay off in the states where account with like michigan wisconsin pennsylvania ohio you know high concentrations of white men in all those dancers white without a degree where a majority of the electorate
thousand and eighteen it's going to come down to close districts but those districts in our country are mainly in the suburbs
and they're pretty well educated and many of them didn't vote for the president those are going to be districts where the president's weaknesses are much more important and the president's strengths don't go as far so the voters that this poll shows were most loyal to the president in twenty sixteen and made the difference frame in that election are not all that important and president in
mid term districts right there less numerous in the battle round districts and they were in the battleground states
and then there's also a little additional twist which is that historically white working class voters are less likely to vote in mid midterm elections the why in general just less educated voters are less likely to turn out in lower information elections which is to say yes yeah
and the voters that we the least loyal to president from college educated women for example are very important in his mid term districts right and they also appear particularly energized in politics that call as tight as a tick take a look at these results last night in ohio's twelve this is a special election it's also heavily suburban very high
highly educated highest educated district in the entire state of ohio in the special election we had no high earlier this week
you know i know the democrat felt a little short but the turn out in the well educated suburbs of columbus was huge and dwarf the turn out in rural white working class from various that's why the race in a district so conservative close
so that's interesting this recent we focused on so much the ohio a special election is kind of a test case for what happens when the trumpet do we think about the most is not that president doesn't show up and the trumpeter we don't think about that much is very present and does show up yeah now suddenly you have a district that republicans have always won comfortably still too close
to call two or three days after the election

i wonder if this kind of perception issue we've been talking about the disproportionate focus on the non college educated male voter if that's also a mistake that the president and the republican party has made and if they have governed and politics in a way that
centers on this same perception that you've kind of just burst and in doing so
they have alienated this voter that you're now saying is going to be so essential in the midterms i think that's quite possible i think that you can easily imagine a slightly different version of this presidency that isn't one hundred percent focused on reinforcing the base that tries to assuage some of the concerns of the voters the periphery of his coalition that
would be much better position to heading into the maternal i mean the economy right now is not that bad president should have higher approval ratings
and so to me that indicates that the strategy that the president and other republicans have pursued over the last two years has been a subject on by the way this is like to pretty common problem recently i think in american politics mean take obama in two thousand and twelve you know when he won there was so much focus on
he obama coalition young voters non white voters hispanic voters what did obama do on that basis the first big push they did was immigration or form you might remember where i can guarantee is that we will have in the first year and immigration bill that i strongly support from that i'm more than then i want to move forward as quickly as possible you might even when that sean hannity briefly said he supported a
form because the republicans did so poorly among hispanic voters and both a republican establishment decision to focus on those voters
and the democratic party's decision to focus on those voters it opened up the door to the campaign and a lot of ways the because a big chunk of voters supported president obama in two thousand and twelve white working class voters who want part of that narrative with the republican establishment wasn't trying to do the democrats didn't think they needed to win and now suddenly there's a big opening for someone to movement and appeal to him
in other words the trump phenomenon is built around both parties focusing too much on the group of voters who pushed someone over the edge and then they tend to keep focusing on them and a way that leaves a whole other group of voters feeling left out who can then turn on that candidate yeah i think a lot of people took for
granted the idea that democrats were just going to win white working class voters in wisconsin at michigan and ohio in ireland wherever because they had for a long time and had for in some cases the whole last century anything less than is the mine large the trumpeter is the same as the bush voter and the same as the romany voter and the mccain
voter and historically a republican party weakness has been college educated women it actually seems kind of obvious in retrospect that to alienate that group even further as it seems president trump has done would be a meaningful problem for the party
this is a diverse country white voters that agree today are forty six percent of eligible voters so if you want to build a winning coalition on that group you're going to fall a little short and by the way the present one forty six on the popular apps be a acquaintance not like as we've established all of us voters were whites without a degree but it is to say that if you want to have a sustainable coalition american politics and asked you broaden only
be focused on please in one group

neat thank you very much thanks for

i'm like a see one


from the new times i'm michael but this is
today
the dust is back in the news why the trump administration says new reporting that the clinton campaign helped fund is evidence that the entire russia investigation is all just politics
and oh were on the record conversation with the president's lawyer about the investigation
it's monday october thirtieth
ken vogel has been reporting on the origins of the dossier for the times can i want to talk about why the dossier is back in the news first of all remind us what does he even was the dossier is a series of memo written at the behest washington d c
based opposition research firm called fusion gps they hired a former british spy guy by the name of course for steel to look into donald trump's finances his campaign team and most importantly both of their ties to russia the bombshell burst tuesday evening classified documents on russian
interference with the two thousand and sixteen us election presented last week president obama and the president elect trump included allegations that russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about mr trump it should never have been released but i read what was released and i think it's a disgrace i think
it's an absolute disgrace the website buzz feed then published a thirty five page cache of memos from the alleged dossier
including a claim of sexual activity caught on a moscow hotel room surveillance camera it's all fake news it's phony stuff it didn't happen
and it was gotten by opponents of ours so investigators for both the special counsel robber mahler and the house and said an intelligence committees have actually been exploring the claims made in a dark and have made efforts to interview christopher steel he has rebuffed the congressional committees efforts interview him but
did reportedly sit for an interview with investigators from mr muller team over the summer so we do know that even as many of the most salacious allegations and many of the other allegations in the dossier remain unconfirmed it is something that investigators are acutely interested in okay
so why after all these months of the darcy his existence been revealed and everyone from the central council to congress investigating it is it now back in news is back in the news and large part because republicans won it back in the news and they have found an angle to bring it
bag into the news which is the financing of the dossier that is who funded the research that led to the dossier they believe that if they could show that this was democrats that it would undermine the entire credibility of a dossier so we had the chairman their public and chairman of the house intelligence committee actually send us
pina to attempt to extract the financial records of the opposition research firm that funded the dossier to show them to do research that subpoena would have actually had a deadline of monday morning and in the days before that we saw two people who funded or groups that
funded fusion gps as research into trump come forward voluntarily and say hey we did this and one of them the first one to come forward was in fact the law firm that represented both hillary clinton's presidential campaign and the democratic national committee republican seized on that like a gift from
the heavens that they could use to undermine not just the dossier but the entire russian investigation only a few days later another fonder came forward and it was a conservative website funded by a major republic and donor who was opposed the donald trump during the primary that kind of complicated the issue a great
deal because you had funders on both sides of the aisle behind the research that at least partly led to this dossier got it the president has been on a toy store and fired up over when he calls a lack of investigations into hillary clinton specifically citing several examples he mention the
now infamous dossier that was produced by fusion gps which was hired by the clinton campaign to find opposition research into them candidates from he also mentions this or russian uranium deal and which she accuses hillary clinton of taking bribes from russians for a favorable uranium mining company deal
made during her tenure as secretary of state studios trump on sunday in his tweets seems to be saying if clinton money is responsible in any anyway for the dossier and if a dossier is fueling the russia investigation then the whole thing is deeply suspect but that would mean that
the russia investigation being conducted by her mother is highly reliant on the dossier so do we know if that's the case we don't know how central the dossier his mother mother's investigation and in fact early indications are that they're really going down their own round and maybe this could sort of inform some of the other day
do but it's not like they would bring charges based on something in this unverified dogs they're doing their homework there there's some of the top litigators investigators and prosecutors in the country and they're not going to bring forms he charges just because a piece of opposition research made them finally can i want to ask you about another aspect of the mother and se
patient that's in the news right now cnn has reported that indictments are pending for a couple of former members of the trunk campaign team based on information turned up by motors team it is a landmark moment in the investigation into russian meddling in the two thousand and sixteen election sources briefed on the matter say a federal grand jury and washing
approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel robert mother a spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment the indictments are sealed with planes are underway for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as monday how does that connect to all of this that would seem to suggest that there is
some real validity to the overall investigation after all
he will certainly some of the folks who find themselves most in muller's cross hairs paul manner for the former campaign chairman michael flynn the former national security advisor but for the administration and for the campaign they are characters in the dossier but they have both attempted to pour cold water on the claims made about
them in the dossier that said we do understand that muller is closing in on them and so it would stand to reason that if he is going to bring charges against them in the near future that we would learn a lot more about the degree to which the dossier and the charges in the dossier are actually central to this
this investigation and we'd learn the extent to which anything they're caught up in connects to the president and other members of the team presumably yeah that's really the key question here and there is a lot of thinking that the areas in which they had the most exposure being there compliance or lack thereof
with the foreign agents registration act with money laundering rolls with potential tax evasion that those things were not really directly related to the president but rather were being used to try to get them to give up information that would be more directly related to potential wrong doing or collusion between the russia
guns and the the trump team if you see an indictment of either of those two it does suggest to some extent that the focus is on them and it doesn't it doesn't for close the possibility that they might then also give up something that could be used to implicate trump or trumps team but it does suggest that they are target
under them independent of the ability to bring it closer to truck
can hook or thank you very much yeah i was a pleasure
after the break how the president's were is talking about the investigation
we'll be right back late last week the day after the times reported on the clinton campaign's involvement in the dossier my colleague matter puzo went to meet with the president's top lawyer in dealing with the mother investigation ty cobb if you've heard cards name is probably from a few weeks back when can google was
last on the show after he overheard cobb talking about the investigation while eating lunch at a dc steakhouse
over my shoulders for can vote on a on the other hand they are politics and particularly politics and legal investigations their contact sports
if you can't take a couple of punches now and still show up here in the wrong game on thursday comp spoke to a puzo about how that investigation looks these days from inside the white house has the process going mean how would you characterize it is going quite well apologize didn't mean to interrupt your question and say it's gone
you know quite well now i think they're in a position where they've got the documents that they need to an abuser and way hand i think they're trying to do so as expeditiously as possible
why was ty cobb brought in for this role in the first place by president from what area of legal expertise and how is it helpful peer so ties inexperienced white collar where you work for one of the biggest firms in the country hogan and levels and he represented major
does he represent a people who got wrapped up in corruption investigations really complicated white collar investigations and in the end that's what this is this is a really complicated like our investigation of having a lot of documents and a lot of potential witnesses i'm sensitive topics
he he's done this is a guy in dc is known as being able to do this
you've seen now if not all certainly most of the documents that have gone from the white house the special counsel if tomorrow those all those documents were made public or they were reported in the new york times
and people could see what you've seen about what do i asked given bomber what story with that tell what would they see think it would be a much smaller story than i room in her time just to there
clinton campaign and didn't see you know i think what else he is what i think senator feinstein characterized there's no no evidence of collusion and i believe that the story will be the the president was mistreated and that the
excuse of russia undoing mrs clinton and millions that it cost the taxpayer in terms of a special counsel were sacramento and american ezra he's not behaving as a lawyer would behave if he had deep concerns that the
white house was sitting on some explosive document that would unravel the presidency
there's a certain level of confidence this is not an inexperienced lawyer so he he clearly feels like when this all shakes out the presence going to be fine that is both a thing you say as a lawyer but you also have to read a lawyers body language
and also read what his actions are showing you end he has staked their posture that i said this will all be fine map was cards reaction to the prospect that these former members of the president's campaign team paul manner for and my kaufman may be indicted in the coming days and how does that fit into the camp
since you're describing i asked i said hey if if bob charges these guys that puts pressure on them to give information against the president to cooperate get a better deal so i think the president has been
clear on solo it's i think it's sort of under reported that i think he would be sad for them as a friend and former colleague from
process results in punishment or indictments to the extent that that happens that beyond his control and obviously he's not trying to influence in any way but the president has no concerns in terms of any impact as to what happened to them on on his
campaign or on the us basically they don't have anything to give they
that implicates suppressor anything wrong it's wholly independent the process that the white house has engaged and and this
an interesting question but how can ty cobb know that doesn't that's not an ignorant question is a very question
so his job is to find out both in emails and contemporaneous documents and then obviously in conversations with people who are around the present time
any conversations with present travels private lawyers and their campaigns lawyers and the people who are in the campaign to try his job is to try to understand the universe of what what was going on both in the campaign in the white house
so if he ends up getting surprised then something has gone wrong i mean it has a good lawyer
you want to try to minimize your surprises
now we've been talking about the documents that ty cobb has to find and hand over to a special prosecutor when rubber mother asks for them what are these documents exactly
we're talking about emails text messages if they exist
notes
memos things that were created at key moments in the trunk presidency
the decision to fire gym komi be a gym commie director kept contemporaneous notes that say the president told him to drop the investigation into michael flynn right
mahler wants to see why we're records do you have on that why did you fire and good you fire and because he wouldn't shut down the rush investigation
because the remind me of the obstruction of justice is ty cobb confident that there will be no charges whatsoever against the president yeah i i asked that question what about the peripheral stuff
the question of obstruction of justice to can the president can the present united states
can he have strict trust us as a legal matter so
after for him
professor dershowitz are now is written extensively to say now
there's a legal theory going around that the president actually can't be charged with obstruction of justice like even if he did it the president can abstract just as because he has a right to fire the f b i director and he has ultimate pardon power he give him for any reason he wants and i asked them later
what do you make of that
i am actually explored there because the facts don't require because it's just you're just think firing of comedy or whatever conversations he's had it doesn't even reached the bar the medieval worry about it
yeah that's exactly right and he he expressed like real confidence and the underlying fact not just the legal argument that the president can't be charged with obstruction he seemed really confident in than the fact that the president didn't have struck justice he wasn't going to try desperately glares jared kushner and gun junior have talked pub
luckily about this idea that what looks or maybe came off is suspicious or unusual during the transition or the campaign was actually just a function of well intentioned politically naive or politically inexperienced people in a new situation or they didn't
hey being in if you are a sort of anti trump democrat that sounds like a convenient excuse
your take on
well i think if you're anti anybody whatever they say about something that didn't go well sounds like your excuse
i think that's actually one of the problems today
nobody can go i get that was no that wasn't for upon our intentional conspiracy it doesn't take his argument and it may not be formalized or have articulated is that the president may have hired some not create people who exercise and knock raid judgment but there's no hi love or
multifaceted conspiracy here to work with russia
yeah that that is absolutely their case and so ty cobb comes in and he asked this strategy
i know obama i i've done cases like this before
if we have nothing to hide we we turn over the documents we make everybody veil what and that's how we get out from under us now what do you think that the top lawyer for the president in this investigation whatever talk on the record to the new york times it sounds like you've known him for a really long time which may be one reason why i agree to do it but to read on
why now he's one to do this
oh my i'm a persuasive and charming person know but but nobody does that nobody goes on the record her pod cast in the middle of the investigation simply because of my wiles luck ty cobb obviously his posture here is
cooperation nothing to hide and they feel good about how this goes for the president in the end end i think this is part of showing the public that we don't have and hide
thank you very much
the is great
on monday morning home and for was indicted by the special counsel along with his long time business associate with kids
man was charged with a really funny
of dollars overseas shell companies and surrendered to federal

here's one else you need know
more than a month after hurricane maria struck puerto rico and ravaged it's electrical grid most of the island still remains without power and a small montana based company that was awarded a contract to rebuild the islands electrical infrastructure has come under intense rooney on friday fema ex
pressed cause significant concerns about how the company whitefish energy one the three hundred million dollar contract white fish is based in the home town of interior secretary lions thinking and had just two full time employees when the storm hit and on sunday the governor to porto rico
called on the islands power to cancel its contract with white leader in the day the power authority said it had done
that's it for the i'm michael moore
seymour

so the times i'm michael moore is that
today
the driver in tuesday's attack came to the us seven years ago through a lottery program intended to diversify the country sound bites the president's it is not it is not good
it's thursday november second
michael shorts give us the profile of this attacker that you're starting to put together say follow say above what do we know about him and when did he come to the us we know that he arrived in the united states
jfk in two thousand and ten he had one with green card lottery which gave them automatic permanent residents in the united states before that he had worked at a hotel in his hometown of tashkent choose the capital who's pakistan he had finished a financial college their grew up in that town and
far as we know from the uzbek government he lived a fairly quiet life stayed out of trouble didn't have a criminal record never raced any suspicions and what do we know about his life when he first arrived we know that he started setting out to get a job he made his way to ohio to a town called snow where
he set himself up as a truck driver and got linked up with the local population is a large population and stowe he went to mosque or on fridays was a member of the community he got married there you know somebody described him as an average guy he didn't stand out in many ways other than the
fact that he seems to have had quite a quick temper which everybody described he was very argumentative at gatherings at the mosque people describe the mosque environmental place where people debate politics all the time but it was always civil now with him he would get frustrated and get angry and people knew and of not cross his temper
michael you mentioned a large population of these facts in this part of ohio what do we need to know about that community in the us
i don't know a whole lot about the community in the united states uzbekistan is a pretty repressive former soviet country it is also incredibly poor probably one of the most oppressive and was closed former soviet countries and like many other countries that are oppressive where they're limited jobs
i believe and look for greener pastures and that's the same i think with the uzbek community and the united states they come here look for jobs they're very many who drive trucks that seems to be of profession then has become popular among this population
and his business and a muslim majority country
yes yes it is a muslim majority country the the government is very very attentive to how people are practicing their religion they are very very attentive to any signs of possible extremism in the country and they move very quickly and aggressively to stamp out this has led also led people who would chafe hundred that kind of him
environment to to leave the country but most people actually pointed out most people described tape of as perhaps moderately islamic the use give their government seemed to suggest that any radicalization that might have happened with him would have happened in the united states interesting but even his friends and our i'll from when you first arrive
here described him is not even a very attentive muslim he would show up late for friday prayers he expressed kind of a rudimentary understanding of the koran and so very few people least early on in his time in the united states suspected that he was following the more extremists path well maybe you met a man
ask leader who encountered say path in ohio who did worry that he was starting to change train yes that seems that disables character began to change and i spoke to an individual who would be named only is of door because he didn't want to attract attention from from other extremists
who had net say both in ohio they had mutual friends have door was president sables wedding and eventually save have moved down to florida and the to work together down there also in the trucking business but this man was also a preacher at the local mosque where say both attended prayers and at some point
abdul began to notice a change and tape of and told me that he worried that he was following this pact or extremism and tried to warn him off from that he says he tried to tell them to read more books to stop expressing his opinion so loudly and to study the religion before passing judgment on others he didn't know that
both seem to be overly obsessed with the trappings of islam the beard the ankle high pants and not as much with the substance
was he doing trucking up until tuesday do doing know he was involved in trucking but he had also started working as an uber driver
and whoever says that he passed all the background checks that they make their drivers go through there was some evidence that perhaps his trucking business was not going as well as he had hoped he'd also someone had told me then talking about moving back to pakistan and this was in the last few months he would tell people that he was born
hard living here he was tired he could make any money here and was planning to move back but obviously that didn't come to pass the have you heard anything in your reporting that suggests anything at all about what might have taken someone who arrived in the united states eager to leave her repressive country and who bore no
evidence of radicalization how he gets to a point where he wants to leave the u s and then of course does what he does on tuesday and lower manhattan that's one of the big mysteries and i think it's still an unanswered question how does somebody get radicalized how did he get radicalize so far we've been digging in haven't
found a clear break in his life where things were going in one direction and then moved radically in another direction
there's there's a clue
something that abdulla of the preacher the mosque in tampa told me he complained about his young inherent spending more time studying islam on the internet then in mosque learning from their religious elders you know we do know now that say keep of was influenced by the islamic state he
he left to know basically expressing an allegiance to the islamic state and he shared a lot of akbar god is grades in the midst of the attack and the attack itself seemed to echo instructions that have been made available by isis in its publications calling on people to carry out these kinds of technically easy and feasible
attacks than a lone wolf attacker can carry out by themselves without any instruction and he seems to have latched onto that and when and how that happened i think we're still trying to figure out michael we've talked a lot on a show about the profile of a second generation american who grew disillusioned percent
reason and radicalize is and carried out and attack that's not it seems what we're talking about here though in this is somebody who you know when i asked people who know him
what he came to the united states for why he applied to the green card lottery what do you hope to get out of it them and everybody said money you know the one in a job
this isn't somebody who was looking for some kind of religious freedom it wasn't somebody who was escaping some kind of political oppression and in many ways it was well off at home and why he would then come here for for purely it seems anyway at this point of material gains and
you know so change his modus operandi is very rude mysterious
michael jordan thank you very much appreciated
thank you

we'll be right back

peter baker we've learned that say have the driver in the lower manhattan terror attack came to the united states to a lottery system for green cards what is that system was called the diversity lottery program it was installed as part of the legislation passed and nine hundred ninety by bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress and signed a law by
president george bush time honored in pleased to sign into law the immigration act of nineteen ninety and set up fifty thousand visas set aside for countries are underrepresented it sounds genuinely like winning a lot you apply and your odds seem incredibly low given that number fifty thousand but if your chosen you suddenly
have a life in the united states that's right fact about forty million people i think apply last year so think about afridi thousand and forty million now and only about five percent of the people who get green cars every year come into this program but we have about a million people come into the country legally on green cards each year so is only a small part of it but
this has been a subject of controversy for some time because you know it seems to be random as opposed to target it seems to be about whoever happens to be picked out of the drawer and he ran out of a dry had or something like that is not quite like that but that's sort of the impression that people get and because of that you have people like the present
i want to merit based system and our our system has a variety of immigration program some of them are based on job skills education things you might bring a value to the country some of them are based on family connections the question for the debate is what ballast do you want to have if any between these two ideals the ideal of know welcoming people who will support
the economic and cultural system that we have here and those who are welcome because they fit this were a statue of liberty model of you're tired you're poor you're right i'm started this program started before we were thinking about terrorism the way we think about it now at the time perhaps the idea of randomness seemed appealing and
important and maybe kind of beautiful whereas now it could seem menacing well at the time the motive is i understand it was really to make sure we weren't just taking people from ireland
senator ted kennedy and legislation nine nineteen ninety managed to put in a quota specifically just for irish immigrants and it seemed like audio wait a second how come they're the only ones were going to get and we better do something else make sure we get others it's wrong that countries like poland or nigeria can't get almost any immigrants into this country and the diversity
interests that the incorporated already very beneficial that's why they call it a diversity these program so that was diverse not just the irish and it was bipartisan bipartisan cooperation i don't think anybody thought we were going to get a bill that was reasonable sensible and and as good as which one it wasn't something that was
big controversy and in the light of day to day obviously it might look different
and we start a fox news or on the deadly terror attack in lower man and a diversity lottery program allowed this back to enter the united states diversity lottery
or how is president from talked about this program and was he talking about it that way prior to today
yeah me he has mentioned it before but it's it's in the context of a larger piece of legislation that's been proposed and that he has embraced called the rays act broadly his message is merit based system not who you happen to be related to not lock and so from his point of view but the very word lottery is what seems anathema to him
q ask congress to me
initiate work to get rid of this program he also point out you know he was asked reaction when you ask you to sort of volunteer
the i wish the title diversity sounds good he has it not that good it hasn't been good
and against it
you know you're trying to make the point that political correctness and his view has overtaken rationalize basis for who that in the country so he would get rid of both the lottery system which is very small fraction of the whole brought to us but also the more significant immigration system here which prioritize his family over there and yes he called the chain migration in the
he is i get in and i bring my brother any brings and his family and they bring their cousins and so for and so on and he said that his man that came in the fella arrested in new york yesterday had brought in two thousand three people are these try to bring in twenty three people since he guy here that's not acceptable so we want to get rid of chain migration
we don't know to be the case because in fact under this diversity lottery you would not normally be entitled to bring in anybody other than your spouse and kids so that seems unlikely that he was actually able to do that
broadly though there are immigrants who have naturalized become us citizens and do have the ability because their citizens at that point to reach out and sponsor others to come here through the immigration system that's the part of the system he would largely get rid of her at least reduce okay
so he makes sense of the president saying do away with this lottery system in relation to the travel ban and maybe even the wall and mexico is present from trying to plug all the various whores in our immigration system that bring people into this country that he sees as unwanted and a threat yeah that's right you had to put this all together
all that there's a law and the mexican border that air travel ban on certain select countries m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic tears
out of the united states of america we don't want him here there is cutting the number of refugees that come into this country down to forty five thousand it's the third try and the travel ban this calls for definitely banning travel for most people from iran libya syria yemen somalia chat and north korea rockies will also face
increased security there is this raise raise act are a i see that would cut legal immigration in half the rays that will reduce poverty increase wages and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars
it will do this by changing the way the united states issues green cards to nationals from other countries and there is this talk today about this diversity lottery program being eliminated i am today starting the process of terminating the diversity lottery
program in all these ways he's trying to basically raised the walls figuratively and literally to this country was legal and illegal and that's both on the base of national security so as he put it today but also on economic basis the idea that people coming into this country are taking jobs now opponents his critics who say is
the opposite that in fact immigrants are good for the economy that they take jobs otherwise wouldn't be filled and without immigration it's going to be hard to grow the economy as fast as a present wants to peter
thank you very much thank you
hughes what else you need to meditate on wednesday the f b i filed federal charges against safer save of in the criminal complaint officials say so he passed begin planning the attack a year ago to inspiration from isis videos and choose halloween for the attack
because he believed it would be more people on the street say path was interviewed by investigators in a manhattan hospital after being shot by a police officer following the attack and a way more
a horrifying terrorist attack
new york city just walks away from the site
the world during a cabinet meeting at the white house on wednesday president trump offer his condolences to the families of the people killed in the attack all of is praying and grieving for the families
lost their precious loved ones are black and denounced the current us system for punishing such as a quick justice
strong just as much much stronger
then we have right now
what we have right now is a joke
it's a laughing stock
and no one so much stuff
takes place trump was asked if he would consider transferring say you have from the civilian courts into the military system at guantanamo bay in cuba set up after the september eleventh attacks i went sure
i would certainly consider no one arrested on american soil has ever been sent to guantanamo bay and it's not at all clear that the president is taking the idea seriously given that the comment was not part of his prepare for marks

that's if the game
i'm michael barbara
see him on

few times i'm michael barbara
he's getting
today
domestic assault conviction should have stopped dead and kelly from purchasing the rifle he used in the texas church why it did and the president versus the courts
it's tuesday november seven
yesterday we learned that the shooter at the church in sutherland springs texas devon kelly was a member of the airforce what are we learning about the circumstances under which he left the air force so he wasn't in the air force for very long he joined in two thousand and nine diff
philips covers the military for the times and by two thousand and twelve he was in deep trouble
a been court martialed for assaulting his wife and stepson is in front steps stepson and actually broke the baby scope
what more do you know about the a song we know that he pled guilty said that he did it intentionally he served twelve months or at least was sentenced to twelve months of detention and then afterwards he was kicked out with what's called a bad conduct discharge which is next to the worst
you can get it one above dishonorable
so just to be clear after this alleged conduct towards his wife and stepson he is sense to twelve months within the military system and he is discharged with bad
add conduct did he have a different kind of criminal record
because this played out inside the military then it would have if it had been a civilian system
i think so i think to a large extent the civilian world doesn't really understand and communicate well with the military court system so in this case he was charged with one in the civilian world we would have called felony level solved and so the fact that this guy had a court martial conviction doesn't always true
translating so that people understand he's a convicted felon
that conviction also didn't get into the federal database that would have kept him from owning a firearm and so in that way it is hugely significant the fact that he pled guilty to intensely harming his wife and stepchild any type of domestic violence charge should have made him ineligible
give what do we learned about what happened to kelly after he left the military with this bad conduct discharge so he gets kicked out and it's finally finalized in two thousand and fourteen that is out of the military
during that time he bounced around a little bit he's very briefly taught at a little bible school damn near corpus christi just volunteering he got divorced and he got remarried in two thousand and fourteen
and we don't have a good track on what he was doing exactly but we know that one of the few places that he showed up anywhere in the public record
was that he registered to vote in two thousand and fourteen in colorado springs and he gave his address as this little ar fi part where he had lived in slot number sixty
this trailer parks only a few miles from where i live so i very quickly got in the car and went out there it's kind of shabby little trailer park right on the edge of the mountains just a gravel lot really with a couple pretty tired looking on trees around the edges
and at this point since it's getting on winter there's not a whole lot of trailers there but about a third of the trailers are kind of to decrepit to move and so i started asking around you know a juicy in this guy had using that guy the funny thing is when a reporter shows up at a place like one of those are the person we basically look like tops than are treated as such
so no one really wanted to talk about it if they remembered and it's a pretty trendy and place so maybe they didn't but then on my way back i happen to stop in the laundromat of the army park and found this one woman she gave her name is susan
she happened to live right next to spot number sixty where mr kelly lived with his then new wife his second wife in the summer of two thousand and fourteen
and i asked her what do you remember about this guy and she said you know not much he wasn't particularly friendly nor was he unfriendly there's just one thing that she said really stuck out in their mind and that's the dog that he kept
so this dog there was a puppy and he kept tied outside on a robe
and this v park does not have much shade at all and so susan with look out of her trailer and it is dark just sitting in the sun in august without water or with his robe tangled up around the bottom of the trailer there and she felt bad about it and went out and we'll give it water and untangle untangling and then one day neighbors
called the police because they saw mr kelly punching the dog repeatedly the police came and there was a stand off where he was locked in his trailer he wouldn't come out the police waited for over an hour eventually he came out and they sided him for animal abuse and
he pled guilty to that
a few weeks later he was gone from the trailer park and the next thing we know he's he's back in texas does the animal cruelty case that you're describing sounds like was adjudicated and the court system does that end up registering with the police or the courts in a way that
it would make it harder for kelly to own a gun know something interesting happens so this is a misdemeanor case he never gets the dog back but what happens is he's given what's called a deferred sentence if he stays out of trouble for twelve months
any record of the offense is erased
and so by two thousand and fifteen when he completed this deferred sends it was gone it's like it never existed
what do we know about the past few months leading up to sunday well we know that over about the past year so like everybody else he's got a ton of friends on facebook that are his old high school friends people who knew him back when they described him as as a nice kid may be a little awkward
but but kind good sense of humor
they all start unfriendly him because this guy who had been raised going to church who had worked as a volunteer at a at a bible school he suddenly started publishing all these anti christian or atheist streets in france and kind of picking fights with people on facebook to the point where
one after another a lot of his friends simply unfriendly them because they were offended yeah i haven't seen any of these posts is pages been taken down but over and over people say they were inappropriate or just boorish the types of things that were just meant to insult or insight the suit kelly developed anti christian use
why do we think he targeted this particular church in this particular town yeah this is about an hour from his house so it's a good question how we ended up their law enforcement is saying that their best guess is that this is because his current wife the one that he married after he got divorced but he is now a strange
to a woman named daniel levy shields it's her family's church she attended sometimes that so does your mother so did her grandmother the police are calling it a domestic situation but they haven't given us any more detail other than they are investigating threatening texts that he sent to his mother in law do we knew
if the shooters in laws were in the church when he went there and killed twenty six people what we know now we don't have a full list of who was in the church but it is being reported that his wife's grandmother was in the church and was killed
based on everything that you've told us about kelly's convictions from two thousand and fourteen and in addition this local animal cruelty case in colorado springs
how did he actually by the guns he was carrying and used in sunday's attack in the church
yeah we always talk about loop holes there are these ways that you can fly under the radar and buy a gun
that sidestep federal safeguards you can buy a gun out of the back of someone's car you can buy a gun at a gun show and it will never go through the federal database
but what looks like happens here is there was no loophole he went to the local gun store and he bought a gun and they checked his name and it was clear he shouldn't have been able to buy a gun with his conviction it should have flagged him and they would have said hey thank you very much
but we're not selling you anything today but he fell through the cracks maybe it's because the air force didn't communicate it's conviction into the national database maybe it's because for one reason or another the national database misunderstood what the military conviction meant but for whatever reason he got a
gun
in fact he got several guns
deep thank you russia
sure no problem
on monday evening the air force he admitted then fail to enter kelly's domestic violence conviction into the federal database
it was presented kelly from buying the rifle used in the attack in a statement the air force said it will conduct a complete review of devon kelly's case and of their entire data nice to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly


we'll be right back


start with breaking news reports from new york say that several people have been injured in an incident in new york city a people are dead and eleven others injured after a man drives our rent and truck onto a crowd and bike path
details are still emerging was a deliberate and or their lives to terrorism
terror attack
six nine eleven
last tuesday about an hour and a half after say fool so you have drove a truck into manhattan bike lane president trump responded to the attack while president responded to the terror attack on twitter saying quote my thoughts condolences and prayers to the victims and families are the new york city terrorist attack god
in your country so it starts with condolences as you'd expect adam with tax spoke to our colleague sabrina to have uneasy about a pattern that is emerging with the president and then it takes a turn trump is calling for the execution of the suspect to authorities say you started
the justice system doesn't more treating shortly before midnight he killed eight people badly injured twelve should get death
just want to software here for a second because this is just so important
again we need to always if he's calling for the death penalty were someone who is not yet been convicted it it was cloaked in the presumption of innocence he has the potential to really prejudiced the jury for and make it much harder actually for his side to pick jurors who might be sympathetic to president drums point of view
a juror would be este have you seen anything about this case is there anything that would influence you about this case did you see person in trumps tweets did you vote for president from well i might think you're not qualified to be on the jury because you may have prejudge the case and adam how is that bad for the prosecution versus
the defense it's the trump voter in the trunk twitter followers who is more likely to be proved prosecution
it's those people who may be thought to be infected and bridges by the president's comments and those people who might be kept on the jury guy it so what we've been seeing in several legal cases is president trump making statements about pending legal proceedings that may will undermine his ability to accomplish what he wants
to achieve by letting people use his statements in opposition to his policies and in their own defense in cases before their tried asserting their constitutional rights had been violated by the president statements on friday burned avoided a prison sentence of fourteen years for desertion
and mistake here before the enemy sergeant and what about both berg bergdorf what did the president say about that case initially so as a candidate he says quite extreme things were tired of sergeant fact
who's a traitor
he's a freighter a good trader
who should have been executed
but he's only a candid he becomes president and he alludes to his earlier comments they're setting up sentencing show i'm not going to comment on it but i think people have heard my comments in the past the military judge handling the case indicated that the comments were problematic and that he was going to take account of them in
figuring out the rate sentence he was in the legal terminology going to consider the president's comments is mitigating evidence and he may well have done that sergeant bobo don't meet in court today in civilian clothes free but dish honorably discharged it's friday we learned that burger is not going to be punished beyond dishonorable discharge and some
reduction in pay and so on but he's not going to serve additional time so just to pause on that you're saying this is a case where he where it's had real legal power bearing on that sentencing the judge said as much and bear in mind that each of these cases it's slightly different in the case of sight of he is trying to
influence an independent branch of the government and that's a separation of powers problem and people may have issues with that in the burg case he is the commander in chief the military justice system reports the him and he may be trying to influence that system in a much more direct way which is problematic for its own reasons adam
i want to read you what bo bo dallas defense attorney said after the sentencing on friday he said quote president trumps unprincipled effort to stoke a lynch mob atmosphere while seeking our nation's highest office has cast a dark cloud over the case
every american should be offended by his assault on the fair administration of justice and his disdain for basic constitutional rights so that's a defense lawyer making the point a defense lawyer whose client may will have benefited from prison interim statements that statement is not keeping with have a lot of defense lawyers
reacting to the prison and statements even when they might get some benefit from them they nonetheless are very uncomfortable with the idea that the president of the united states is trying to intercede in particular legal cases so this reminds me of other incidents you've talked about adam like the travel ban
jake shop is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states where our during the campaign trump called for a complete shutdown of muslims entering the country
countries represented
can figure out what the hell is going on they softened those work is president but if the original wording that's been used in a legal case against the ban is that right well president from statements and tweets about the so called muslim been have had a great effect in the travel ban litigation the administration
just trying to get a hold on the ban lifted the judges repeatedly brought up the president's comments about a muslim and during last year's campaign and courts said routinely look to what he said on the campaign trail and as president to interpret those travel bans which on their face may be neutral may be acceptable but these courts have found
i did in fact they were animated by religious discrimination why because president trumps it so would this be potentially and opportunity to anybody in the legal system well i mean in one sense yes i mean that people challenge in the travel ban have been aided by the president's comments goldberg though may
well have been aided by the president's governments for all we know side of will be aided by the jury he gets so perhaps even make the argument that they should take to the only off the table because you can't find an unbiased jurors so in that sense people have been aided the other sense in which the president's comments probably help him with his base there are people
who think that the justice system is riddled with technicalities did let people who shouldn't get off and those people may welcome these kinds of comments adam is an unusual for president to do this in what are the historical precedent for this where i can think of too
and we are you guilty have any burger are you guilty of having any murder
right now so president nixon during a terrorist realm of charles manson opined that he was guilty on his way back in washington
today because of a local stopped a number of meeting a wrong or the those government were in charge of show rose on trial for life in los angeles
nope it directly or indirectly a runner and that prompted man since lawyers immediately to move from his trial because of the prison the united states was influencing the course of the trial and president nixon himself a lawyer recognized his error and walk the comment back
later his press secretary call back and said retracting the price of a of because he had failed and referring to
earlier the a word around the trial and los angeles
velcro

right one and then you can look to the oklahoma city bombing now where president clinton in a dream journal reno
said that they would seek the death penalty for those convicted of the crime
the bombing in oklahoma city
was an attack on innocent children
and defenseless citizens
it was an act of cowardice
and it was evil
if death occurs the death penalty is available and we will seek it
that's sort of sounds like it's the same zone of is what we've been talking about but not really because they presumed that the system should work and then they said if it does work and someone is convicted the crime was heinous enough that they would seek the death penalty what the trump tweets say kind of leapfrog
first port and says this guy deserves the death penalty now and it's a pity we have to go through the regular role of an actual trial so insane in treating these things is the president putting the justice system through like a kind of stress test and mean that the justice system really is the institution at the heart of the democratic process and he's he's
think it in a way that's one way to think about it sabrina i think the justice he's attacked the legitimacy and credibility of news organizations he seems to be going after independent judiciary and causing people to think that it can't be trusted to get things right he is changing the climate
changing the tone these are important enough instances in themselves but they also may represent the beginning of a very big shift in the way we think about the judicial system
you know the saddest thing is that because of the president of the united states i am not supposed to be involved with the justice department i'm not supposed to be involved with the f b i i'm not supposed to be doing the kind of things that i would love to be doing and i'm very frustrated by i look at what's happening with the justice
thank you so much adam attack
great to be here sabrina

here's what else you need to know saudi arabia is accusing iran of committing an act of war increasing tensions between two of the middle east most powerful enemies and raising the possibility of armed conflict saudi or
maybe a blames iran for supplying a neighboring country yemen with a missile that was fired at the saudi capital riyadh over the weekend and intercepted by saudi anti missile technology
iranian leaders deny any role in the missile attack and accuse saudi arabia of called wars of aggression regional bullying destabilizing behavior and risky provocations and over the weekend it was reported that senator rand paul of kentucky was attack
packed outside of his home as he stepped off his riding lawnmower meeting him with five broken ribs and bruises to his long the times is now reporting that the altercation was with a next door neighbor renee boucher over a landscaping dispute involving their yards
aides to pour say that because of his injuries it is unclear when he will be able to return to work
that's it for the day i'm michael bob
more

for the new york times i'm michael moore wow this is eddie
today
steve ben has declared war on the republican party he may be out of the white house but that he says
only makes him strong
his battle plan for the soul of america
it's friday
november tenth

you are behind enemy lines headquarters of the opposition
i don't regard
jarvis and or
and the job search
sure
if it wouldn't
jerry peters why is steve tanner and so significant at this moment this is the man who led the trunk campaign to victory now he's waging his own war on the republican party to defeat and this place as many sitting republican senators as he can he views as too cozy with the political or
that was from now the outcome of that by whether or not it ben and right wing if you want to call in the party emerges i think answers the question of whether or not the american to party political system as we know it is blown apart
so love him or hate him there are few people as central to american politics right now as steep that
i was very up front when i left the white house that was i thought the republican establishment was starting the president's agenda
in fact are very for i said it's almost like nullification they're trying to nullify the two thousand and sixteen election so why does have to be a war they just like return over power go in and say hey we have a better idea we have better ways we want to run things are just start going i gotta give it to you know if you seen what much macau of i have been going after each other his henchmen
i've been going after me and said some very unpleasant things about mitch mcconnell not personal things but professional things war of words a war of ideas them excessive force is definitely other me i think i've already discovered a few different ways
awards or revolution
could be a civil war within the republican it is a i think a revolutionary movement reform movement or civil war a war some of the rudder gets a little heated because i think also it helps to have a sense of drama of this that these are big historical moments and a very big historical moment in your seen the exact same thing on the left and because the law
does not have a bright but there's not really have a news organization
that one of its principal focuses is turning the spotlight on the corruption and incompetence of the democratic establishment i think that's more the reasons that the revolt by the democratic left and the progressive left against the wall street ownership of the democratic party and the corruption that they have been many years and coming
i get you can see it coming it's going to be just as vitriolic because the stakes are very high it's gonna be just as vitriolic as as the one on the right so just in a couple of sentences
paul brevity is know exactly how old the history books describe this war is a populist as a populist nationals revolt against the global elite that ran the republican party and really part of the global elite that runs the country this would be looked at as a revolt of working class people of both
both parties
okay at a time that really rejected the permanent local class that is inextricably linked both republican and democrat in washington dc and try to take back their government and had it have more responsive themselves face or one is trumps selection his face to the conservative populace takeover of congress yes absolutely it's the now
start to take over these institutions now why mitch mcconnell because the institution of the majority leader has so much power and he is used that power trip quite frankly fourth president trumps agenda
right in one of the ways they've done it with paul ryan and them because they have three committees on the hill they're investigating collusion so you see from a condo it's been no supports been it's been allowing these committees ago failing miserably to get obama care of to her place where yet to see with their
to do on taxes but this is not fundamental tax reform i mean it's gonna be a tax cut with a tax reform but it's certainly not what people invasion at first and i hold that to mitch mcconnell feel that his greatest defense is not supporting the president or our greatest offense is not supporting the president enough as of now
mcconnell has to go do you think mitch mcconnell will be majority leader at this time next year i actually do not think will be majority is that your personal mission to make that happen
it's not my personal mission but i have a objective that mitch car will not be majority leader and are believed to be done before this time next year


so i know you watched the speech and i wonder what you thought when you listen to him denounced the president and say our children are watching what what we tell them if we don't speak up now i think some people saw that as a man speaking truth to power of that something i think you understand
know that the gimme a break one is what his children looking at is a country that flake was while the guys that looked the other way in allowed this country to start to lose its sovereignty by unlimited illegal immigration in particular in the state of hers are what they're looking at his lack of job opportunities because we have shipped all of the manufacturing jobs virtually in this
china that's what jeff microphone so when he gets own these guys get all high and mighty and i see with donald trump said and will how he represents working class people and how he's trying to make their lives better jeff like is a total incomplete phony okay everything he says everything he does i have absolutely zero respect from a be such a picture
tell him to step down and run against kelly ward in a primary let's see what the people of arizona have to say let's see what his constituencies have to say about him go back to arizona a convinced the says arizona that you stand for something trump doesn't always agree on everything doesn't agree on everything with you so now trump isn't this having on
a
trump isn't this interesting position he was the ultimate outsider you have captured the press yes now he's on the inside is he an agent of yours in this war or is he an enemy or is he now he's a he look he's the leader of this movement he's he's is embodied because we you go back and look at him over the last twenty five or thirty years i mean he is pretty
this day in a day or so he embodies it he's also a charismatic leader some ways galvanized people remember think in the washington post that said about a month ago i'm the only person in the inner circle of trump that truly believes he's a global revolutionary figure and he is i believe in his greatness
wow trump his greatness with any if he just sticks to his plan if he just sticks to what he promised the american people if he sticks to that he's going to have to walk through fire right going can't be a lot of bad days and they'll be more bad days and there are good days but at the end of it at the end of it he's going to win reelection or four hundred electoral votes and he'll be he'll be considered the
pantheon of reagan in lincoln and others as great presidents about you have to stick with the program where you know better than anyone you work with them you have to corral him you had to keep and disciplined and our message this is not an easy thing to do how does he stick to the program
look of i didn't have to crow and he he's he's actually a very self discipline the media does the him credit to run their can a campaign we ran
gonna say something else he understands mass communications to the populace much more sophisticated than i do and i think i'm pretty good i'm a junior varsity compare to him that he did things are the campaign he'll do that
the twitter of the way you phrased things away wants to see things so this is hard to master planets and i just impetuous i think that you know certainly as he has different voices around him and i think why the the things for the struggles we've had in the ministrations and one of the struggles he will he will have going forward is that there's one school of thought
that says yes the program you laid out the american people is a program of disruption
it is to go after certain central institutions in american life to change them so that they work better for the working man or went to this country working class a middle class and eventually work better for the country itself
it's that that we're gonna be isolationists is not that we're going to be detached from the world is not that you're going to be some no nationalist country is the exact opposite but you're gonna have to take on the establishment everyday and they're not going to have their power easily okay but don't know but that that path is very torture
it's very tough you have to fight every day you have to take on the swap right is want some shooting we've got four but this industry link power structure of the permit political class which is not going to of their power easily because the great business model they have if you do that you're going to have some bumpy roads but there's suddenly
it uplands on the other side of that you have the bit now there's others say you have to moderate you have to bring try to bring people together right and the people in the administration that you had some very strong differences
that you will be online later to you will be light you will be light right my thing is do what popularity now or do you want to be loved it you want to be beloved in history by your country because you did the right time trump viscerally connects with a large part of the american population just like president obama did can
with a large part of american vote for the longevity of your movement for the survival of it
you can't replicate try and so would were not what do you do without him when he have to either have to build institutions or were trying to get think tanks build the the one of the first thing is though is almost institutionalization of this of this coalition of all these various grassroots groups to actually get now engage in vetting candidates right to vet can
as for the senate to look at how they put together grassroots army maybe they were collectively the institutions of this have to be built and you're absolutely correct donald trump or sometimes leave the battlefield i think you'll leave it at the end of his second term he may stay on as head this movement after that but there is some point in time that down from you know is that the
person by the way the democrats had the same problem after obama guy barack obama guys i doubt probably come along once in a generation


you're aware of this caricature that exists of you in the media
i wonder if you want to meet inherited her
i'm thinking the grim reaper mask on saturday night live and let's go back to the person because i don't really address like i know i was always think the liberal media see what you see i think it's it's interesting because i was basically virtually unknown as of relatively small part of the conservative movement and now people are dressing up as you for halloween
have you gone from from being totally anonymous to behave a halloween costume remember what is that how you process i don't even think about you
have i changed in the time you've know me
no only thing i do is i don't wear shorts much as i used to when i think i new you for a year and i never wore long pants time
so so i don't care what they say at the i really don't care it doesn't matter people to say anything raising they can do is you know the desert trade your very self aware you are seen by a lot of people on the left as the white nationalist as the native this does that bother you
our program is so different than i think is actually a power as we power through and here's why i'm anti semite talk to master the way that the israeli says the most pro israel guy in the way how steep a second ana i set up by poachers long so the
so ridiculous that the facts come out and actually make

oh for sure
what the however they didn't like the know so so if you prefer that it's just like the white nationalists have nothing further have condemned the some charlie rose the patient part ethnic nationalism is ridiculous right
it's absurd the guys there are quite frankly creatures of the mainstream media the left media there's a handful of them nobody takes them seriously
because they can't be taken seriously they're not serious people the economic nationalism and particularly as these ideas get around people understand it is the thing that binds us together what i mean by that it doesn't matter what your races what your ethnicity is what your color is what your religion is what your gender is
or what your sexual preference is what matters is that your citizens united states of america right you should get a priority right you shouldn't be the last guy in line and you should be paying for everything else that you know trade and illegal immigration are just two sides of the same coin
the unfair trade deals are just having unfair competition by foreign labor against american working men and women and illegal immigration is just letting the foreign workers in the country but the people have been most affected negatively by globalization in this country are the working class hispanics and blacks as country which really have taken up
his way that is why trumps economic nationals program of trying to stop illegal immigration with more importantly tell country to signal the countries overseas there's going to be tariffs and this going to be quotas right unless you start to major stuff here and you're saying business investment what up ten percent and you start to see
foreign business investment because people want to get here in the united states but if there's a certain segment of the population and amount and and significant one that sees that agenda as white nationalist that sees the president picking fights with black nfl players and saying don't turn on these confederate monumental a cow is that not detriment actions actions speak
louder than words you just have to be you gonna have to you can't wish that away because the opposition parties not gonna let you wish away it is a way to smear somebody is a fear tactic the only way you know the fear tactic is you have results
if you start bringing jobs back to the midwest if you stop illegal immigration and the black working class as back working class i said this from day one and our movement when we get to twenty five thirty percent of the black working class and stag working class and the black middle class and spec milk has voting for us we will have a realignment like nineteen thirty two and there's nothing to stop us from doing efforts have getting in power
supporting how do you get there though so many of those people minorities hispanics blacks or we have to be you as a white national when you have to have to just want you have to convey a when elections you have to continue to to implement your policy and he gave away our thinking sit there and talk your way through this you just have to show people everyday the actions we have
to change the system we have to go and get these trade deals to start to take care of the american worker not just the american company the american worker and that's when things were going to have to do about the way i know they'll do whatever time so there's no doubt though that that message of president trumps has appeal with white nationalists and
is that
reality and no consequence i think it's i think it's nonsense of the instances that he said he apologized them at all i think these guys grab on to anything and know the message is one of the guys at least races guy i've ever met in nothing in the campaign in nothing aged under date
oh that's all left point sms see nonsense and by the way you can't help but a couple of these guys are marginally a to marginally right so they'll grab on anything and by the way we can they say trumps name him after embassies get a camera in the new york times has an article on it right because you're obsessed with solution rather the day a fabric years after one hundred percent
the me semi fabrication and by the way because i realize that they think the only way they can run by scaring you to be a native us massage and this racist
homophobia just can't hear his name they're saying how trump
can't you can't help what they're doing that because they know the mainstream media
they sit around do whatever they do nobody covers all right because nobody cares because they don't have any meaning or purpose okay they're so tiny and irrelevant as soon as they try to start bringing the president also and the cameras are they are seen as they are the new york times there's a front page story they play the mainstream media to build up and it's still it's irrelevant nonsense something
got me work through this all bubbled over as you know
most i think detrimental way for the president and charles
did he handle that right
in the present handler perfectly the thing i talk to him on sunday he is the first want to say says where does this all and right which is always is taking our live the washington monument is going to end and taking down the mount vernon yeah but then he has an different was talking about they're very five you're both sides is that the people that were there for their legitimate first amendment rights
to say hey i support the stature of are really stonewall jackson and hey i think it's races and it should come down by the way those people you know if you worked at at at at the city council and the county commission in then your governor's race etc that's the normal process country it was the thugs on both sides of the worst element switch gears
the russian restitution
it's i'm really lucky so now gone into fake news
it sounded earlier like you said that you don't take mitch mcconnell should be allowed in these investigations to proceed do you agree with president is the russia thing just to look i think the collusion thing is i've said from day one was a joke we can we conclude we had a tough time colluding between the trump campaign in pennsylvania and they aren't say
right i mean all of our stuff is the ground gifts i think it's a look
have some marginal guys and they were definitely some marginal people early on in the campaign because this thing was a shaggy dog all the way through the campaign early on had some larger guys in you've seen them on tv these guys are potter
this man has his marginal though
man i met a man affords stuff is financial relationships he had with you know what i don't know about his money laundering and his tax they always been accused of by the way with mama i've never said more should be fired
and the guess a commission our i do believe that bob mahler's investigation should have some parameters on it if got to do collusion that's fine i also think that i have a duration on it to go outside the lanes into to start to look at people's all these financial transactions from years and years ago now i do not believe as the purview of
what the special counsel special prosecutor set up and i've been very vocal that these people that that is incumbent upon paul ryan and mitch mcconnell to one just put an end date on the states they have to get the work done by certain day and if it's going to on collusion issued star collusion it was worth of that it from your perspective what did happen between russia and the campaign
the and it's not relevant
zero that's not a local crimes are committed by members of the campaign
if anybody anything wrong
i'm alone or to get they did something wrong they should they should be prosecuted for my points different they're saying the election was turned by the russian involvement it's b s and i want any democrat to sit there and tell me she can give a coherent case a day while she should be president of the united states she cannot they tried to play this thing to know
fyi
president trumps election to nullify they try to come of this this hoax there was this huge russian involvement in russian collusion yes i think it's nonsense that he has been nonsense from the beginning but your time in the white house look at me you are somebody who articulate a very clear vision for where this country should be going and the policies we need to implement to get us there
if you could have would you have stayed for all four years of president's no time more than one i never had that never tend to stay never tell us why are you were you able to be more effective on the outside because again and get my hands on my weapons i may come on i just a much more effective i can meet with all the grassroots groups i can do everything i remember in the white house you are federal one
lloyd your version of what you do by the way you should be restrictions i'm not arguing that you shouldn't be it's just very your federal government employee is only a certain amount of stuff you can do and by the way in the white house it's all about in it's all about can you influence the present do this can be influenced his policy etc so it's important but on the outside i can have more freedom to
to kind of these things together and i think it's just for me is so much for i mean i left the white house at at noon on friday and i was cheering the body part editorial call it at six so it's just been everyday everyday is a say in the navy every day's a holiday in every meal is a banquet so i just i enjoyed so much
i'm sure what i'm doing i've dedicated my life to build this populace nationalist movement
and by way you can have good days and bad days but i absolutely am convinced that were on the right track and were making a big difference in the country a big difference for the back but remember the back but the key to this movement
if you go back in history as the american people the american people
have always made the right decision was in the revolution was in the civil war was in world war two of the great depression and when they have full information they ultimately to a decision so how long does this problem does this more last the wars for the republican party until we tend to the country i think you're describing a war for the soul of the country more yeah i think you would either way i think accuracy bernice
as those guys of the populace left off for i think it's great for turning of american history just like the other three the revolution the civil war v look from for these things start to when they finish i tell people it could be ten fifteen twenty years and if you're not committed to work as hard as you possibly work every day as a volunteer and a grassroots organization not just
new star trek shall be will november eighth muggy day
i have two thousand he just another day it's a day that we should celebrate a day we should remember and remember how we got there but you're gonna have to do it everyday we've got a two thousand and eighteen elections and if you're not working today you know you're going to be very negatively surprise if you want to have political control in this country you've got to get on an everyday steep thank you very much for doing this

today
in a marathon session before congress jeff sessions denies lying about ties to russia and sidesteps questions about pressure from president truck to investigate hillary clinton and uranium one and what is iranian one
it's wednesday november fifteenth
today we welcome attorney general jeff sessions
the judiciary committee's annual department of justice oversight here and madame tussaud's wait a week for jeff sessions to go before congress
what was he doing now
the regular oversight hearing the house judiciary committee conducts with the attorney general and has a chance for lawmakers to say how's the department running and ask questions about petty issues whether it's immigration are violent crime drugs civil rights but of course your first year leaving
apartment of justice has not been without difficulty everything is overshadowed by three things there is jeff sessions and is misstatements about russian connections with the campaign there's a campaign going on for jeff sessions his former senate seat and jeff sessions made a little news ahead of the earring and
hinted that maybe the us was going to get a special prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton and the clinton foundation and the obama administration do you solemnly swear that the testimony of your about should be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
and that the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative let's start with russia sessions as attorney general has recuse himself from the russia investigation that his department overseas because of his own role in the trunk campaign last year so what did the committee want to know that russia from jeff sessions
well to understand today he can go back to his confirmation hearing he testified that he did not have communications with the russians had the correct that and say actually no i did meet with the russian ambassador and so he had to go back up to the hill
round off the edges on that and just last month he was back up before the senate was asked you said under oath in front of the senate judiciary committee quote continue a change of information between trumps surrogates an intermediaries for the russian government did not happen at least not to my knowledge and not with me
in particular the special counsel files paperwork in federal court showing that jeff sessions shared campaign round table in which a campaign a church papadopoulos made his pitch that he had russian connections
and suggested that he could arrange a meeting for donald trump and russia yes or no did mr papadopoulos mention his outreach to the russian government during that meeting he made some comment to that effect
remember having
piper and so now he's back up on the hill and he's eyeing the answer once again did you lie to congress
i had no recollection of this meeting until i saw the news reports either now or that the march two thousand and sixteen meeting at the drop hotel
the awkward op was attended but i have no clear recollection of the details of what he said at that made him so he's saying it will not lie because it in remember it but i remember it now soda i don't exactly remember what was said but i definitely remember that i said that he would not authorized
to represent the campaign where the russian government or any other foreign government for that matter not to get to clinical but that's the kind of complicated positions for the attorney general to take he's claiming that he didn't remember meeting that involved a campaign he talking about communications with officials
from russia who represented and interests but he does specifically remember telling someone in a meeting not to set up a meeting with the president of russia doesn't that feel a little inconsistent right so let me look is is not a good day read this is not a good place for the attorney general to be in
i want to be as fair and accurate as possible to the attorney general position because we all forget things but certainly the attorney general united states was not expected to be in a position where he's making a third trip to congress to explain the nuances of russian interactions and that's the
whether anything ever came of this the problem politically is largely self made it's just not a good position for the change for the term campaign to be in right now mr and you're not go improper occurred at all why was it for all can we answer the crime once and for all and
the credit cards from i don't understand why you want take my answer or we were on the third edition mr attorney general so frankly if you're at the white house that's why this hearing is so frustrating as why your your patient with jeff sessions is is really low this is supposed to be hearing where you go up and maybe take some shots from democrats of course but you go out and
you are laying out your vision for the just permanent and your vision for the donald trump law and order presidency and once again because of jeff sessions were talking about russia and taught talking on the trunk campaign again and that drives people at the lighthouse crazy
so let's talk about what came up with the controversy around boy more the republican candidate for the alabama senate seat that sessions vacated when he became attorney general
republicans in congress came out and denounced more on monday as all these allegations of sexual advances and even sexual assault have come out but the trump administration as of tuesday hasn't really said anything about more and sessions in this fascinating position because alabama is his steed and
his old seed but he's also now representing the administration so what happens with that before the judiciary committee will he was asked do you believe judge more should be seated in the senate if he wins and would you introduce investigations by the d o j regarding his actions
silly question because the just armin doesn't investigate stay crimes for the most part but it was away and that's the that's the way in to say what do you think about ray moore and jeff sessions bet do you believe these young women
i am
no reason to doubt these young women and that kind of echoed mitch mcconnell a majority leader's comments earlier when he said i believe the women in so like jeff sessions is a long time alabama politician and this is him weighing in on a pretty controversial
full senate race for his old see in his home state
so that now the big one
the night before sessions comes to capitol hill the times reports that his justice department is looking into the possibility of appointing a special counsel to investigate president's former rival hillary clinton
was the timing of that a coincidence
given this hearing now definitely not as you're aware i and a majority of members of this community have on multiple occasions requested a special the hassle to investigate former secretary hillary this is a hearing with republicans who have been clamoring for the just aren't meant to do more
or to investigate hillary clinton and to investigate the obama administration
and the night before
sessions is due to testify this letter drops in which the just parliament says hey you know what actually we might do that thing that the president and you republicans on the committee have been as community do we actually my do that
it gave the republican something to talk about if been as much evidence in my judgment
against the president as we have against the obama administration mrs clinton i i'm afraid mr trump would have been burned mistake by know there's a clear and equity allowed kind of a counter narrative to the trump administration in russia that the democrats are really pushing and yet under questioning by those republicans
sessions didn't exactly sound like a person who is a either to appoint a special counsel to investigate clinton and all the issues surrounding her reign
ray i mean sessions is trying to slice thin here because i'm the one hand there have been lots of calls for somebody to investigate hillary clinton including from his boss donald trump one of the republican congressman jim jordan
said what's he going to take to actually get a special counsel what's the holdup that looks like there's already enough evidence to open a special counsel association and the attorney general shot that was a well trained you sorry i'm our mascot for a time and gentlemen our it works like is not enough basis to apart a special counts
and so he didn't totally jump into the pool with the republicans but on the other hand he's taking serious criticism from democrats that he's just a puppet for shop and down from says i want a special counsel knew that he clinton hill and do that their sessions who do you work for the work for the american
the worked for the present a united states well i'm a member of the executive branch and i work for the american people and a certain amount of that comes with the territory every attorney general gets accused of that at some point in their tenure but he is the significance president trump has inserted himself in
to the justice department and the criminal justice process in ways i have not seen my career and nobody i've talked to has seen before he openly calls for investigations into his political rivals like he opined on on
going investigations and if they're just farm and does a completely fair and impartial review and decides to open investigation it's going to look too many people like jeff sessions did it because the president told him to do it and because you don't want to get fired from his job so how does sessions in this hearing on tuesday
explain this perception and this conflict he says
that speaks his mind
bowden direct about what he says
don't want him back to them but are we do our duty every day
and that's kind of all he can say because he's already on thin ice with the president as of this we will not be infected by politics are boss
away though on make only decisions we believe are right and just and
we're not going to use that apartment to unlawfully advance so political agenda on tuesday both the democrats and republicans agreed that the just apartment needed to be entirely politically independent
but they just come down and totally different sides and the democrats say you need to be totally independent how could you open an investigation or even toy with opening investigation into hillary clinton just because donald trump says so in the republicans say you need to be totally independent in politics aside and right
the wrongs of the obama administration that was so political and let hillary clinton get away with everything for eight years and so they both agree that experiment should be entirely political and do what i want
thank you that you're always welcome
the
he will be right back
mike schmidt what is the thing that this special counsel would be investigating if a special counsel is appointed by sessions the republicans would want a special counsel to look at a wide range of issues related to the clintons emails the foundation and what's known as the uranium
one deal during two thousand and ten when hillary clinton was the secretary of state the state department approved the sale of a company called uranium one they had also donated a lot of money to the clinton foundation and which had rights to mine uranium in the states to are rushing
nuclear agency got it it's really hard to unwrap for the average person but it's also easy for folks to exploit because it's so confusing the can take the uranium one issue throw it out there in it's really hard for the other side to refute it
unfortunately their hand like a guide
like so many things right now it feels like your understanding of what happened here in this case can vary so dramatically based on where you get your news if you're watching or listening to conservative news what their version of the uranium one story this is beyond insanity inexcusable
the rain uranium one he's just the latest example of clinton and corruption how on the to corruption they go back and dream one
related to the clean where there's smoke there's fire and when it comes to the cleanse king you're coughing from all of us now coming where he time donors to their foundation get state department approval when hillary clinton and secretary of state cheap personally signed off and giving up to twenty percent of america
occasionally raining out and how you know this stuff we used for nuclear energy and bombs and it's the united states giving away his precious material
this foreign power on russia let's talk about russia let's talk about the sale a quarter percent of our uranium to wash it and they already clinton signing off on a daily encompasses all the parts of clinton conspiracy theories in allegations of the past twenty five years i mean what isn't going to take to put
woman in jail
and what at the rest of the media t extent that they've been covering the uranium one saga how have they been covering it in the liberal press uranium one is something donald trump uses to distract from his own problems now we're seeing the uranium one hoax from the bulk resurface in white house
press briefings and in conservative media this week and what's sure does look like a coordinated effort to re brand the phrases russia scandal and collusion a waif novels amp and onto republicans favorite target hillary clinton he has in russia investigation that is intensifying in front of him three of his campaign officials had been
charged and he's trying to divert attention and see look look at what the democrats did it's far worse than anything you allege against me he now trump is being accused of colliding with the russians so therefore let's turn the tables and say no actually hillary has not even quite so to i'm already agenda
are you asking about that so some people are calling this a conspiracy theory and fake news other people think hillary clinton should go to jail for this what is reality what do we knew to be fact in the case of uranium one and the clintons yes it's true that uranium one was sold
a russian nuclear agency yes it's also true that folks associated with uranium one donated money to the clinton foundation
and it's also true that hillary clinton was the secretary of state at the time but the story is far more nuanced than that there were many government officials who were part of approving the deal and there's no evidence of a quid pro quo in which the donation was me to the foundation in exchange for the
approval of the deal the justice department has known it down his since his for bankers two thousand and fifteen the f b i he has looked into it and did not think there was enough to bring a case suggesting that there's not a lot here so why is it that we're talking about this now nine
months into the tram presidency why would jeff sessions be looking into the possibility of appointing a special counsel to investigate this our colleague maggie haberman reported dead jeanine pirro fox news hello and welcome to a very special to our edition of justice are jeanine pirro had been in the
the oval office recently to meet with president trump and push the idea that he should appoint a special counsel to investigate uranium more what do you do yeah i wanted to that i'm going to do about it why is jeff say what look when i'm i'm in eleven days ago before donald trump was leaving for he's trip to asia he spoke to the
grass and expressed his deep frustration with the justice department and attorney general jeff sessions for not looking into really not involved with the proper that like the let it run itself but honestly they said they look at it the democrat
but i've been wondering about something here critics say sessions is looking into this because he's feeling the pressure from those conservatives and for president trump but if his investigators don't find the evidence to support the appointment of a special counsel it seems like that could end up popping the bubble of this
more than if he'd never looked at it in the first place and maybe make the president even more disappointed
so there's a risk here there's a risk year for the president because the justice department prosecutors could come back to the attorney general and say hey there's no reason for a special counsel there's nothing really here and that would really pop the president's balloon on this issue and take away something that he has repeatedly return to when he his face
faced intense criticism himself
russia as twenty percent of very rare for whatever reason and a lot of people understand what those reasons maybe i think that your rusher story that your real rush mr
not a story where they talk about collision and it was not
post
michael thank you
thanks for and

here's what else you need to another day
the senate republicans say they will combine their plan to overhaul the tax code with their fight to undo the affordable care act were we're optimistic
and certainly individual mandate
would would be awful
obviously of view that been committed were both into the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says the republican tax plan will include over appeal of the obama care requirement that most people have health insurance a long standing goal of republicans and a move that
save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade freeing up money to expand middle class tax cuts or help pay for the overall cost of the tax bill
but projections from the congressional budget office say it would result in thirteen million fewer people having health insurance
and could drive up insurance premiums for many americans by about ten percent
that's it for the day i'm like michael rubber suitable

they also present very differently in how they've chosen as they've got bolder to look now that my hair shorter you know like a liar like when he also cut her hair to the learnt that she wanted it it it changed a lot of things for her
that combined with her
crawford's of clothing
mostly terms of the boys rugs

tee shirts
my favorite color is blue and green so i were that kind of color staff

they both would seem to enjoy the least at first i said can all at the time and i was little i only wanted to join because they clearly crying and my friends were there
that's one of the reason they did it but then they just that kind of me
yeah and every meeting all they do when you do late princess coloring pages and they make friendship bracelets
yeah we mostly just made they step out of be it
colored in color in pages
called girlish crafts i don't like that terms where do you think that use ideas
come from of want
coalition boyish mean i didn't come from like a long time ago

girls were assigned to be sharing things more like stayed home things and boys were to where are they going to whine
in the old is he like the were told they were supposed to wear dresses show people have started to quit the dresses and girls together and boys in strong together
i'm always use on t v and it's always frustrates me on the baby be in a hammock
add where it says a girls play with barbies by pink accessories
ne
now glasses
and then maybe another time is an ad for nerve guns in the only actors are boys anything like boys grab you and afghans and go and why are there no girls and because this
the first strike disrupt her in retail that each saucer
it sounds like you've given a lot of photos
yeah
i wasn't actually
as concerned about it into third grade and then i started to think about like how
i was not being the way people expected me to be highly classmates and school say a right wing boy clothes or why do you have boy here that means your boy
i think the turning point for also was that we sent two summers ago some girls two girls go can dig him
and
also had a really hard time it was the same summer that she cut her hair
some kids as to why are you going girls
the all was boy boy mormons you know why there was boy
going with them the girls name
coming up arguments were girls no with the leadership
usually on how
that was the end of her girls didn't
so i just thought well and i don't run girl scout why can't a girl be in boy scouts
i had heard that there are more activities i like like arteries little and horseback riding but they don't actually do horseback ride let enough so things that were more adventurous yeah
in the us last year
and said i want to be a boy scout and our first response was to say no that's not possible when i asked my dad in fan or they probably won't let you in your ground and then i can sneak in and pretend i'm unemployed
because of my hair
still up until just a few weeks ago the rule in the boy scouts was the girls weren't allowed
what is it turns out we know the guy who runs the truth and will probably let me and that mean that that and
traveling what the scout leaders in our local troop told us was that while they couldn't register also with the national organization
they could sign her up they would get her uniform
she could earn all the badges that all the other boys
for all intents and purposes she would be a boy scout and that's the way it's been
what's this kind of can you say
i cannot currently my can i get and and i am standing up kind of get that really quickly short okay i'll be right back please please hold a lady
we'll be right back
you know how sometimes it seems like your kid actually now more than you get ready for more and that because banks to the google and since tent google how many is great for doubting but it's also great for the rest of the family watch this hey google play space trivia what's at the middle of the milky way
galaxy
a black hole yep definitely didn't know that just add your kids google account howard by family link and ask it to do even more staff from choose your own adventure stories to musical chairs

more of the scout oath is on my honor i will do my best to do my duty to god in my country and to obey the scout law to help other people at all times to keep myself physically strong mentally awake and more and you're straight

i remember the first day
pretty nervous are and i was gonna let alone are on of my head down a little
even i knew people would then is a boy and first i so kind of shy about messy and misunderstand the other ways and job of leg
they loved me a little bit a little strange leaders i gave you
if someone is whole weird had kind of lead the way you look at them like oh okay they definitely knew that i was they are so
no i all i have to introduce myself and i'm gonna be brave about it and i can do it
kind of what i thought


the name is dawn bates
i'm ten years hundred and i'm from marriage must plan name is hair goes in ten years old and i'm from massachusetts harry and are in also true
to me not me but she nearly as the bastards
something that she's pretty she's really good i is like one week there was they said
go to this camp
those this one day where we will make these fought with sticks and also basically she was like a director for everything because there was this one are will take moss a on the bottom of the for would act like a question
earlier
do you remember a moment
also where you felt like the boys in the troop except you
well i was this is actually something very recent just the last part meaning hours actually elected patrol you there
kind of my drill leader of the troop for the rest of the year and it was really happy when they decided mean that's a big deal yeah hello this is dylan if anyone is just secretly telling her like where you a blaze gap just why
why would you do that because you know what
also i can do lots of things end it takes lots of bravery to step up and
cause of people do want to be a leader
it takes to braver
to be a whale
sweet
dylan and harry thank you both for your time i really appreciate you welcome
so also how important do you think it is for someone like you to have the choice between a boy scouts and the girl scouts
i think it's important for me i have a choice because i know if i didn't have a choice
i would be stuck with something i didn't enjoy and if know i had ever had a choice
than
we wouldn't be where we are today
i'll probably wouldn't be the way i am now
i am dry unaware national i think it's very important than i have that choice

they'll hear is my sash pretty nice
i got a again lad is shown cookies
now which is it what what what she's where the girl scout though his new york is one of my favorite things about girl scouts crew on your sister or join the boy scouts you chose to stay in the car scouts what do you like about it
well i don't like hate boys but i do like to get away with just girls for a little bit because boys do for around a lot and sand dams it's a little annoying and some parallel distracting sell our so i like doing stuff with just girls in just
just my friends that are girls
but i really like to use them more cool stuff because
the boy scouts get to do like would clean an obstacle courses in the girl scouts doesn't really do much of that boy scouts goes out and as lake really like cool like crafts like they rock they launch like many rockets and stuff like that
a
when they're on
clear you seem a little envious of what the boy scouts to my him oh yeah i am a little envious
because they get to do slightly more exciting stuff as and they get to have like a pocket knife
do you want to hug him my yeah i'd say sell that would be cool
do you think it would be better to bring in the activities there boys do into girl scouts and set of girls
feeling like they have to leave girl scouts in order to do those active i do think that because i do you using girls can can concentrate more around regular girls but they would like the stuff that boy scouts does so i think it would help of that stuff was brought into the girl scout troops
do you feel you can be more yourself or the you learn more on one it's true across well i think i can be more myself because i feel like not embarrassed around girl sort of like they're more comfortable to top well
and staff sand and girls just need to concentrate and they should be able to just be themselves
when they're with their own gender

who had his summit dollars there are a hold on those planes
we have two very different girls than they are completely their own kids but to leave so they represent other girls i think the the leadership in different ways
sure that they grow only species has been helpful to cluj some degree i can see times when she gets a little over overshadowed by boys then i think having a time and it doesn't happen very often she's in a cold school so the the little bit of time once a week or whatever it wants to hang out with girls
and be doing it seems a little girls
i think it's probably been good for and she seems happy with it
for also she wanted to be in the boy scouts and she has her own reasons for the
it really comes down to what feels and power to them

cleo and and else can you hear me
yeah ok
boy scouts won't start accepting girls until next year but you to have been able to think about what this
decision might mean earlier than most people you're kind of a a glimpse into the future of what a lot of other girls across the country
are going to get to think about sooner if you could give advice to girls who are deciding whether to stay in girl scouts
or join the boy scouts
what would you say to them
okay clear here if i were trying to persuade someone to stain glass cats i would probably say all like a of really really nice girls in the girl scouts and it's just like i've always felt comfortable at east girls especially since then my friends and it
just like the activities i know easy as cool as no one's in boy scouts but we do do some pretty fun activities in the good times together so that's fun
okay elsa responding to the question
i snuck and top
ways away like a girl could join the boy scouts
yeah ok
is because she wanted to be time she can
you can so it's perfectly fine if you want to

i want to tell you both that i think you are really cool
your your great you're smart you're sensitive and caring and i'm really glad to have male
yeah thank you
okie pokey
yeah

from new york times on michael barbara this study

today republicans in the house and senate have reached a deal on the taxpayer why it keeps moving fast but remains so unpopular
the f c c is expected to appeal president obama as net neutrality most what would the internet of two thousand and seventeen look like without regulation
it's thursday december fourteen
as a candidate i promise we would pass a massive tax good for the everyday working american families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country wednesday afternoon president from fresh off what had been a brutal election defeat
alabama the night before
he stood out in the white house and delivered what the white house had called a closing argument for the tax for bill gym tankers reports on taxes and the economy he was surrounded by family is leon and maria
i would love you to discuss your middle class tax cut a little bit with the millions of people watching right now on television he let them talk about how great this bill will be not just for them but for their communities thank you mr president god bless you will continue to keep praying for you and your team as you move forward and forge ahead
with this new future in america god bless you
he can be my minister anytime
a lot of middle class families don't think this will benefit them emotionally two thirds of the country thinks they will ever get a tax increase or no tax cut it all so the president here i think was trying to give you something related will you american taxpayer to say hey hero people who believe they're going to do well from this cut and who buy
the way said very nice things about the president and he was very happy here those things many of your predecessors promised that this reformers coming but you did it
while the present is at the white house with these middle class families getting this final sale speech about the republican tax plan what is happening with this tax plan over in congress which as i recall pass this bill a couple of weeks ago probably giving both of them
selves and the president their biggest legislative victory so far as your right so the bill has passed the house and has passed the senate but it hasn't passed both of them in the same form so the houses that have have convened the conference committee to work out the differences and wednesday morning hours before the president takes the podium the last few months or so cause the news wires and eight
he had now indicates that republicans in the house and republicans in the senate have at least agreed in principle on a solid reconcile version of the tax reform bill that will move forward there was an announcement that kind of leak out off of capitol hill that there was an agreement in place on a bill that will be calm they believe the bill they sent to the president next week it's
flashes the top tax rate for the wealthiest individuals to thirty seven percent and reduces the corporate tax rate to twenty one percent president trumps says businesses and americans would also see cuts early next year this bill passed both the house and senate with basically no democratic support so what are democrats now saying about the final appearance
of the democrats are furious the american people are witnessing a master class in how one political party relying on secrecy distortion and brute force can muffle an unpopular deaf a third exploding corporate giveaway to passage they also are already starting to
warn that if deficits increase republicans will turn to cutting social safety net programs such as medicare and social security in order to make up the difference and reduce the national debt going forward and they are warning that that would be essentially another transfer of wealth from poor people who are helped by those programs to the more wealthy people who are benefiting from nice
tax cuts a final bill will come with tarnishing price tag and it's found that do a terrible job getting help the don't need it and they're furious because they just won an election in alabama and they think that their new democratic senator from alabama should be allowed to take his seat for this bill goes for in light of laughs
eight election german i do not believe that we should be old introduced me to in fact i think it's imperative that we respect the will of the people of alabama and delay any further action on this too experimental senator electrons can be sued the democratic argument is essentially recent history that in two thousand and ten why that nine twenty four power
public can say that our panelists state of massachusetts after senator ted kennedy died there was a special election in massachusetts a republican one it and when that happened democrat stopped the process of passing the affordable care act until he was seated following the election we are strong words from sen mitch mcconnell
leader of a republican party in which he quote stated in radically i think the message of the moment is that the american people all across the country are asking girls even are the most liberal state massachusetts the stop this health care bill
what the democrats do we waited to respect the will of the people of massachusetts quite simply even what it was hard and against our own politics democrats did the right there you're allowed senator brown to cast a vote on final passage of the year
i hope we could do the same today in the republican response is that senate election in two thousand and ten was entirely about health care and the roi more don't jones race was hardly at all about taxes and there is no reason to stop the process now it's almost over
lame duck senators wrote all the time they are not seriously considering stopping the bill on those grounds
as this victory toward draws closer i mean we are so close right now so close fact almost i don't want to talk about it maybe we should talk about it
in september
illustration and congressional leaders released sort of an outline of their taxes when by november start of november they had an actual bill on the house by the middle of november they had a bill in the senate by the end of november of the very start of december and the bill had passed both thousand the senate that is very very fast quite possibly the fastest you we've seen for
a major piece of non emergency legislation in a really long time and that speed has done is produced the bill that is likely to get in under the wire of things like this alabama special election changing the calculus in washington and politics but is also yielded a bill that a majority of
the public does not like and then a majority the public thinks will not help them and so there has been a success on the speed not as much success on the sale and now we get to see which ones more important for about it
thank you jane
thank you
this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning the dawn of a brilliant american future shining with patriotism prosperity and pride
with your help we will bring back or germs we will bring back our wealth as a country
and for every citizen across this beautiful and we will bring back our great american dreams thank you and god bless you all thank you very much

will be like back
yeah
it spans the globe like a super highway it is called internet
the net began back in nineteen sixty nine and was it tore the pentagon nowadays just about any computer and a modem join given what was the internet it's beginning what was the philosophy of oil was
started as this sort of defense department project to connect computers can lose right about the internet for the times and it evolved through the decades into what we now know as the world wide web
going on in recruits offices and classrooms around the world a revolution and which fifteen million people are taking part when i became president there were just fifty websites on the world wide web
now there are seventeen million and almost fifty million households online in the united states alone there sharing scientific data arguing philosophy or passing on cooking to have some gossip
open source decentralized royalty free new system where anyone can put up anything everyone has access to the same tools and all days created equally and treated equally you need a computer and phone and suddenly you're part of a new measure of people programs archives
ideas so no one is in control of the arena in infinite star any condition that way
yeah i think the early advocates for the internet envisioned it has a place where people could be free you is this stateless thing that was outside corporate control that would allow everyone equal footing i mean who is the ceo of the internet and there is no there is no one with the sort of red button that they can push to stop the internet it is
by nature decentralized than open thing
and when did that start to change i think it started to change in the early two thousand and one moment that seems particularly crucial is this case in two thousand and five that involved a small internet service provider in north carolina called madison river communication
they provided high speed internet as well as phones and other types of connection into their customers and one of the decisions that they made that was very faithful was to block and what's called voice over internet protocol services which are like internet phone services because
they made their own phone services right they wanted their customers to use madison river phone lines and he has snuff out the services other competitor yes that's so they were trying to do and vomit edge on edge
they had these crazy commercials with though
agree on every station
broadband ago
so van ives was this early voice over internet protocol company that made an internet calling service that would bypass your traditional phone line and they had about they said two hundred customers on madison or communications internet service who were being blocked
from using advantage and they thought were being shut out of these people's business just because they're internet service provider has a conflict and be on their own phone service to and essentially you had to ideological camps that open up about how the internet should function and one as the sort of dumb pipe
theory which is that the internet and the way it's delivered to you should be a lot like the running water in your house you open your tap water comes out you turn on your computer and internet connection comes out and the pipes that carry that internet to you shouldn't be able to prioritize certain types of data over others they shouldn't be able to say
this type of video will run at this speed but this other type of video or run much slower and you can't access these five sites because we don't like those five sites are we on our own five sites that compete with those five states that's the dumb paid theory and advantage is on that side they say we are an internet based service provide
writer customers should be able to use us regardless of whether their internet service provider has a competing serbs
the other side his medicine or communication side which is i guess you could call the smart paved theory which is that hey we built these pipes we built the infrastructure that delivers high speed internet to our customers we have the right to treat data within our system however we want to treat it and if that means shutting off on
a german there are things that compete with their own products then that's her prerogative and if customers don't like it they can go out and find someone else to give them internet and in a larger ecosystem of the internet who sides with the dump height theory and who sides with the smart pipe theory
so essentially divides into two kinds of businesses internet service provider so horizon it's e n t comcast these companies naturally want to have control over the services that they will because they don't pipes and their argument is we spent all this money developing his systems we should
be able to decide how we administer them and then you have the companies that create stuff for the internet and your net flicks is your goals days books all of the companies that rely on the internet to access their service they used the bikes they use the pipes and so they don't want any data to be priority
guys over other data because net flicks doesn't want a t and t to develop its own rival video service and block net flex from eighteen to customers
so in the case advantage vs madison river what happens so vantage files or complaint with the f c c use the regulator who handles communications issues and he agrees with them they say this is unfair to honor just customers they settle with madison
communication which agrees to pay fifteen thousand dollars as a fine and promise not to do this again and this is the first victory for the movement that would become known as net neutrality the big debate in the united states news over net neutrality neutrality a policy that forces internet
provided you treat all web traffic lethal damage control through the government have a web traffic and internet commerce and profits
ruling sets a precedent in the world of internet providers that they shouldn't block or slowdown in any way any content on the internet from getting to a customer is that is that the essence of net neutrality yes that's what net neutrality advocates want and that's what they've been trying to
hold in the twelve years since that happened
hi everybody
ever since the internet was created it's been organized around basic principles of openness fairness and freedom
no gatekeepers deciding which sites you get access there are no toll roads on the information superhighway
the set of principles the idea of net neutrality
has unleashed the power of the internet and given innovators the chance to thrive
abandoning these principles with trend and the internet as we know it in two thousand and fifteen the f c c under the obama administration essentially votes to codified net neutrality
just the net neutrality ruled by a vote of three to through that has was expected here but we have
it was the end of a long hard fought battle over the future of the internet with this strict open internet order that says you can't block sites or perhaps you can have paid fast lanes were certain types of data get to move faster than other who's it's really the first comprehensive update to the rules
that govern the internet
they're essentially saying this is not a toy anymore and this is a utility this is like the phone system like the highways like electricity this is a crucial piece of how we operate as a society so let's revisit the data alliance that we started to describe in two thousand and five
have they changed since then in terms of who supports regulating the internet and who opposes said sort of mean you still have the basic dynamic of the companies that create content for the internet wanting the internet to be a neutral platform
and then you still have the internet service providers who want to be able to control how their services are used but then you also have all these weird amalgamation nations and hybrids so for example google which is a search engine and contact company now also has an internet service provider google fiber that people can use to get internet
in some cities on the other side you have companies like comcast which has an internet service provider but also owns n b c so they're in the content business as well so the whole debate has just gotten a lot more cloudy and the battle lines aren't really is clear now
resident later on today said it will move to a vote to advance the nomination of a jeep
to become chairman of the federal communications commission so in january newly inaugurated president donald trump installs object high as the head of the c is working to establish the light touch regulatory framework it allowed the internet to becoming a marvel of the modern age and
hi is a guy who was on the f c c and twenty fifteen and disagreed with their decision to codified net neutrality and i'm opposed to a president obama is planned for internet regulation precisely because it is going to make for slower broadband for americans will increase the internet bills and ultimately will reduce competition
in innovation in the broadband market so in november he unveils this plan to repeal net neutrality
and what is adjourned highs argument for rolling back what started off as a kind of informal understanding but when that was well honored and then has become codified officially by the f c c net neutrality what's his problem
with it an argument for robbing a bag so his argument is essentially that in the years when the internet was being built into the missing and a wonderful thing it is today that we didn't have these rules that it was a much more lightly regulated sector and under that light regulation it flourished and thrived and grew into what it is
is
so there there there's a camp that says the as freire when it is more regulated and then there are people like occupy you say actually know the his fear when it is free air right and occupy would say the twenty fifteen decision was an example of government overreach
and micromanaging this sort of free and open space and i think the net neutrality advocates would say well the thing that has kept the internet free and open is this understanding that net neutrality was an important thing to preserve and uphold near tonight
across the country are demanding neutrality are fighting against i proposed by the the theme but seriously change the internet as well yeah i feel like know charlie
more than just how we express ourselves
theory and play some of the biggest tech companies like facebook and google are participating what they call a day of action it is a protest and the f c c plan to roll back obama era net neutrality war
what's the fear among proponents of net neutrality about what this proposal from present trumps f c c will do or how exactly do they think the decision made change the internet for the worse i think the darkest vision of this future internet that people are scared of is that it will be
i'm essentially a pay to play scheme that your get up one morning and try to go watch a movie on your favorite website and it'll say in order to do this you have to upgrade your package because that website actually isn't included with our basic internet percentage or that your
all be slowed down when trying to visit certain types of websites because the internet service provider has a business relationship with competing website
and the larger worry is that the companies that we all know and love today facebook googled net flicks they all came of age because of net neutrality they were able to grow and flourish because these principles were in place so the worry is that the next generation of cool company is that no one's heard of yet they
have a fair playing field to compete against the giants because net neutrality won't exist to protect them
can letting and neutrality is rolled back as occupiers up administration won is it possible that the internet will change and away or a can't go back to this idealistic democratic place where it started dead and even if you we impose net neutrality down the line with the next president after trump that something
essential about the internet will have been lost
yeah i think that's totally possible but i think there's something that a lot of people are missing here which is that the internet has already lost that open democratic quality we now have these giant silicon valley tech companies these platforms that control much if not most of what people
experience as the internet and they are not under the thumb of net neutrality they are not guided by these regulatory changes and so in a way the internet has already lost some of the initial quality is that its founders envisioned the internet is not
free in level playing field for everyone and this could make it worse or it could just continue the trend
thank you thank you add me
today the federal communications commission is scheduled to vote on a measure to undo the regulations put in place under president obama of the five commissioners on the f c c three are republican and the rollback is expected to pass by a three he did
margin along party lines
