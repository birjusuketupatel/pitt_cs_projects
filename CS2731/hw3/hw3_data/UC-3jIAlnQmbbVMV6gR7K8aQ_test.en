Majority Report is an excellent resource for nuanced and bright analysis for trending events and topics. In constructing a set of policy preferences, Seder and Brooks can serve as reasonable guides. The two offer insight from a left perspective that is consistently appropriate and sensible given whatever information is currently available. Informed and prudent analysis is an atypical occurrence in the field of media and should be cherished. Jamie makes simplified and reactionary appeals. She evaluates trending events and topics through the use of a singular frame—namely an immature interpretation of anarcho-communism. The utility of this concept in pursuing the common good is less of my concern than her blunt appropriation of anarcho-communism or any other mode of analysis. Her retorts often require correction from Seder or Brooks, which they dutifully provide. Her input, however, does obscure the necessary critical evaluations that this show is capable of projecting. Anarcho-communism could potentially serve as a useful tool for the evaluation of current affairs, but I believe its messenger on this program is woefully incapable of extracting any value from this ideology or any form of critical theory.I had no idea infamous caller Doug had his own youtube channel. Does anyone know what it is? I need to hear more of his unhinged rants.Jamie is nice, good, smart and cool. Go Jamie. Anyone else find it weird that Michael is now like trying to be a down ass irony bro after trying to be a woke ass for so many years?  Like Felix gave him the safety to be an irony bro, and now he is trynna act like he always been about it?Disclaimer: I have a clear bias. Despite being a huge fan of stand up and a comedian myself, I rarely laugh at Judy. I just don’t dig her vibe or the jokes themselves on the show. 

I’ve seen a few instances where she defends allegedly transphobic jokes with some variation of “we don’t change for you, you change for us” and “you want a safe space, life isn’t a safe space.” 

A few things:
Am I misrepresenting that?
Is her material transphobic?
If so, does she have the same opinion about homophonic or sexist jokes?
Does any of it matter?

I genuinely don’t know how to feel because I already don’t dig her to begin with. Would I be as angry or disappointed with a Maria Bamford or Paul F Tompkins, comedians who I love? Probably not. I hope so, but I’m sure I would try to downplay it in the context or weight if their other work. Tryna get on today[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlngudLYXBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlngudLYXBE&amp;t=7s)[Jordan Peterson Dangerous People Are Teaching Your Kids](https://youtu.be/LquIQisaZFU)

1. They don’t want to undermine western civilization, they want to emphasize it. Just as the enlightenment moved us away from patriarchy, oppression, religion etc. they are just continuing the movement. The only ones trying to destroy western civilization are the ones trying to destroy and attack our colleges at any angle possible (people like you) which will lead China to leading the world.
2. You aren’t funding it. Public Colleges pay for themselves by increasing salaries of those who attend. It’s a $7:$1 investment.
3. No one argues those absolutes. You are strawmanning their argument because their argument is factual and correct. Some sex differences are social constructs, for example crying is not feminine by nature. Men can be nurses, etc. No one said western imperialism is the sole source of all third world problems, it’s simply a source and you can’t refute that so you strawman the argument.
4. Colleges do not teach mobs to shut down speakers in any way or fashion. Protesting is an embracement of free speech. Not wanting to pay for someone else’s speech is not violating their free speech. I do not have a right to speak at Harvard. Violence is condemned by colleges. It’s a crime done by individuals, but you now conveniently see collective groups when it fits your narrative.
5. There is no language police. There is not a single law mandating a single gender pronoun. This is a lie. If you’re referring to anti-bullying policies that have expanded from not being able to say the n-word to now not being able to call someone a fa**ot then you don’t understand that the Supreme Court has ruled that schools can have rules on speech if it interrupts the process of the school. This is universal. I couldn’t say god damn in elementary or high school or fuck. In fact, the origins of the speech codes are from the religious right who got the FCC to ban curse words on television during daytime hours.
6. If you’re referring to diversity policies, they are proven to increase the quality of the education experience. African Americans who get placed in higher colleges by affirmative action have been proven to perform equal to white students who don’t have their scores changed, indicating that on average African Americans test scores when entering colleges are deflated due to various socioeconomic and cultural disadvantages.
7. The radical left did not become the professors of today. This is a conspiracy theory.
8. Students learn to think critically, write clearly, and speak properly in college and do so today more than ever. Studies prove that college has this effect if you don’t believe it. College educated citizens are the most knowledgeable, have the most critical thinking capacity etc. and this is compared to other people who are equal other than not attending a college.
9. Completing an English degree and not encountering Shakespeare is an anecdote. Almost everyone does learn about him. I have no idea if your anecdote is true. If it is, I have no idea if it is because a specific English degree specializes where knowledge of Shakespeare is not needed. Possibly due to Republican budget cuts to public universities because they listen to you.
10. Yes, diversity is not by opinion. Opinions are not protected classes of individuals. You must not understand the basics of civil rights.
11. Equality of opportunity requires equality of outcome in certain aspects, such as free education, healthcare, access to nutrition and clean water etc. No college teaches the type of equality of outcome that you are referring to, where all incomes are the same.
12. Inclusion is proven to account for deflated test scores that specific protected classes have. Martin Luther King believed in quotas and affirmative action.
13. There is no attack on free speech. You have no right to get paid to speak at a college. Students have a right to protest. Colleges teach and embrace free speech.
14. Colleges do admit that capitalism has raised millions out of poverty. But there has never been a free market. In America, the founders gave free land and free college, as well as providing free mail, police, courts, currency and property rights protections. Colleges still teach to embrace regulated markets because they are proven to be more efficient. America has had seven depressions and the Great Recession. Additionally, the middle class is a creation of the government. Real wages tripled under FDR. Alternatively, real wages dropped under Ronald Reagan.
15. China’s public sector is roughly 70% of its GDP. Venezuela is 40% for reference. China has lifted people out of poverty faster than any country in the history of the world. Do you advocate adopting their system?
16. In Venezuela, median incomes more than doubled when adjusted for inflation, poverty and deep poverty dropped in more than half under Hugo Chavez. It’s a complicated picture and their main economic problems are due to monetary policies of their government (not tying the value of their dollar to the market) Venezuela is a case against corruption, incompetence, printing of currency, and authoritarianism. It is also a case that proves that social programs enhance the lives of the people. 
17. Post-modernists do believe in individuals. You are an individual that is part of a collective. That’s how a military works. Group sacrifice.
18. There are victims and oppressors. Especially without unions, employers have more leverage than employees. This is proven by the fact that wages do not match productivity. That is stolen wages by the employer class.
19. Class struggle did not originate with Karl Marx. It originated back in ancient times even with the Bible and in modern times with the enlightenment and the American and French Revolutions which were class and collectivist struggles.
20. Communism did not fail. Not everywhere Marx’s ideas were implemented were authoritarian. Revolutionary Catalonia or the Paris Communes were decentralized, democratic communist countries. The Soviet Union’s median income went from less than 500 USD per year in 1919 to over 10,000 USD per year by the time they collapsed. This put them ahead of Mexico and officially as a high-income country by the World Bank. That is not a complete failure by any metric even if you are very critical of their horrific regime which I am. China’s economy grew at 5% annually in real GDP under Mao and their economy is roughly 70% public sector/centrally planned and they are the most successful economy in the history of the world.
21. Marxism has nothing to do with identity politics. Marxism saw the economy as the root of all problems including social issues. Identity politics rejects core Marxist beliefs. Identity politics simply uses identity to address issues that specific groups face alone. For example, if a Republican politician talks about losing your job as a coal miner and the attack on traditional values, he is using identity politics and speaking to white people. If a Democratic politician speaks about environmental racism where pollutants are released specifically in minority communities for racist intent, which Obama addressed through the EPA and Trump is ending, that is also identity politics.
22. Post-modernists are not neo-Marxists. That is a smear, an ad hominem attack, and a conspiracy theory.
23. It has enhanced our universities. Our universities now produce the most productive and educated workers in the world. We have the best public universities in the world in America and they are one of the highlights that America still has.Well, I'm just about finished with humanity.  Shapiro has the new #1 show on Itunes now, Joe was on one of the shows just recently, and I see so much terrible shit in this world.  Has anyone seen that show?  I bet Sam and the gang would love to pick that apart.I have nothing against her as a person, but as someone on a radio show she comes across as a little basic with a voice that doesn't work for this format. She always sounds nervous with a slight quiver. 

She also has a tendency to add on something to the conversation that isn't necessarily a good point or even thoughtful. It's a lot of preaching to the choir stuff. I'm not saying at times that Sam or Michael doesn't do the same things but Jamie seems to only do this. I sometimes feel like that's all she's comfortable doing and isn't self assured enough to make a quick quip or add a point that isn't dripping in pure socialism 101. It takes down the entertaining/interesting factor a tad. 
Sam had a racist troll caller citing the Bell Curve as pretty much the foundation of his beliefs. And since Matt Taibbi was the show's guest, it got me fondly recalling an old article I read taking down Murray for the crank he is.

[https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/project-s-h-a-m-e-the-recovered-history-of-charles-murray.html](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/project-s-h-a-m-e-the-recovered-history-of-charles-murray.html)[https://www.mediaite.com/online/hhs-official-called-john-podesta-a-pedophile-and-claimed-liberals-abuse-children-in-satanic-rituals/](https://www.mediaite.com/online/hhs-official-called-john-podesta-a-pedophile-and-claimed-liberals-abuse-children-in-satanic-rituals/)

Only the BEST people, and for the love of all that's holy, do NOT read the comments with that article. Apparently, the woman has now deleted her twitter account entirely. Shouldn't be surprised she's a pizzagater though, the Flynns were (Dad!) and I know at least Don jr. tweeted about  it.

Is it time yet we mention the allegations that were forgotten before the election of the child trafficking done by the Trump Modeling Agency? I'm usually not that conspiratorial a person, but the guy has allegations from  both there and the Jeff Epstein matter. Given HHS's seeming already "baked-in mismanagement" , it makes you wonder.“Almost immediately, it became clear that the idealized grand bargain, in which every welfare recipient would get a subsidized job if needed, along with child care and transportation assistance and everything else they might need to thrive in the workforce, wasn't going to fly. The costs were too much for Congress to stomach, even more so after Republicans regained power in 1995.

"By just mailing checks, the government spent an average of about $5,000 per family each year," DeParle notes. "A work slot (with child care for just one child) would cost about $11,700. The bill for 2 million of them would raise welfare's annual costs by more than $13 billion, nearly 50 percent. Nothing like that seemed remotely possible."”

[The legacy of the 1996 welfare reform](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform#clintonsigning)Do you have a personal idea or feeling about what governmental action would just be "too much" for you, the one thing that would drive you to break with your routine and go out into the streets to agitate?

Should we have a collective breaking point, like the organization that has plans for protest if Mueller gets fired?

I don't know the answer for myself. I've thought about getting in my car and heading to one of the children detention centers, but I'd be walking away from my kid and home and 4 jobs to do that. 

Also, on that note, his point about Millennials just "surviving" whereas the Boomers had a good chance at a more comfortable middle class life: I think there are a fair number of GenXers who have also spent their adult lives "surviving."

i can imagine one of the main reasons, at least regarding the driver's license thing, is that a license is a privilege that the poor classes do not have, but i'm curious about other reasons. thanks[Trump Supreme Court Will Lower Your Income](https://www.epi.org/blog/so-called-right-to-work-laws-will-lower-wages-for-union-and-nonunion-workers-in-missouri/)Can someone send me in the direction of an apk of the majority report app?

He keeps calling out the Dore and challenging him to debate (same thing he’s done to Rogan, Rubin, etc). Rubin and Jimmy never mention Sam Seder. I think Rogan mentioned him one time. Michael Brooks has been reduced to begging Jimmy to just mention his name on his YouTube channel. Sam wants to get on Jimmys show or provoke Jimmy into mentioning him because he wants access to Jimmys audience. Same with Rubin and Rogan. It’s actually sad. 



Take a look at the two channels and compare the view counts for the videos in the past week. All of Sam’s videos get less than a tenth of Jimmys views, except for one : the one where the mighty Dore is mentioned in the title, the video linked in this post. Aren't they both on the left? Personally I listen to Sam and Jimmy frequently. I vaguely know there was some sort of beef between them.It gets old. I unsubscribed out of boredom. They hardly ever got to the meat of the issues. It could be the reason Secular Talk, The David Pakman show, and even Jimmy Dore have so many more subscribers than TMR.

Also, fully implemented socialism wouldn’t work in this country. I recall both Sam and Michael describing themselves as socialists. They’re picking a losing side. Go with regulated capitalism and choose the pieces of socialism that make sense (single-payer, universal education, etc.). We won’t be going towards anything like a UBI for decades upon decades to come.

Specifically the ones that play during breaks and such, often using samples taken from the podcast itself or other relevant source audio. Can’t seem to find anything with a quick google/reddit search.Hey Majority Report fans, shameless plug here but I just wanted to let all of you know that there's a new subreddit dedicated to Dennis Miller and just how unfunny he is. Feel free to indulge with the community on how this man sucks at a comedian. Post videos mocking Dennis, post funny pictures making fun of Miller, or just post any jokes that are 100% funnier then anything he could ever write.

r/DennisMillerSucksLet’s be clear on what lead to Alex Jones being removed from YouTube. YouTube would have wanted his viewers and kept him if it wasn’t for these actions and events.
1. Advertisers around the 2016 elections found out that they were running ads on North Korea communist channels, neo-Nazi and white supremacist channels, conspiracy theorist channels, xenophobic channels, fake news channels, and channels promoting or inciting violence and hate towards groups of people.
2. Due to public backlash, some advertisers threatened to leave YouTube if they could not be disassociated with these groups, because of the free market actions known as boycotts towards them (the advertisers) and the effects that news of their ads running on these channels had on their business (lowering their stock values and resulting in consumer boycotts, or the fear of these actions happening to them).
3. YouTube increased the rules of broadcasting in the terms of service for YouTube to stop advertisers from fleeing.
4. Alex Jones agreed to the terms of service on YouTube.
5. His videos continued to violate the terms of service and he got three strikes. The rules of YouTube were followed and his channel was terminated.
6. If you do not want Alex Jones to be removed from YouTube, you have to reduce the burden of the rules needed to be followed in the terms of service, so that Alex Jone’s content does not violate the terms of service. This will result in advertisers leaving YouTube and lowering everyone’s pay. There is no way to keep advertisers and to keep Alex Jones broadcasting the content he has been doing, including incitements to violence.
Here are some the public/non-free market policies we have in healthcare:
1) Public funding of colleges to create doctors in the first place, which decreases wait times by over 300%.
2) State, local and federal subsidies for hospitals and healthcare facilities since they have high startup costs. We pay 3/4 the cost for every new hospital through taxes. Hospitals would not exist in rural communities without the government, it is not financially viable.
3) Medical licenses to increase quality of healthcare and increase standards of care. 
4) Free emergency rooms and ambulances for all uninsured
people. Free dialysis for all Americans, created by President Nixon.
5) Tax deductions to allow private companies to buy their employees health insurance using the government’s money.
6) Medicare, government health insurance for the sickest and oldest group of Americans
7) Medicaid, health insurance for the poor
8) Children’s Health Insurance Program- Universal healthcare for children created by President Clinton.
9) Medical malpractice to sue doctor’s who injury patients or perform unethical procedures. This prevents doctors from doing harm in many cases.
10) The National Institutes of Health, which accounts for 80% of all medical innovations, new medicine and procedures, all from tax payer dollars.
11) Tax deductions for medical research, which lets the government pay for all private medical research.
12) Tax deductions for charity to subsidize private charities that provide healthcare to children or other individuals.
13) The Affordable Care Act
14) Patents/intellectual property rights for people’s medical inventions.
15) If you want a true free market, you have to eliminate government currency, courts, and property rights as well.I know it's probably just me, but the show is about 100 times better on days when Michael is not on it. No long winded, overly wordy mediocre jokes that take way to long to set up, no high pitched cackling at his own long winded overly wordy mediocre jokes that take way too long to set up, no cutting off other show members with overly wordy mediocre jokes that take way too long to set up, and no terribly unfunny tired impressions that all follow the same formula that's long-winded overly wordy mediocre jokes that take way too long to set up. It's the high pitched cackling at his own jokes that I find most infuriating. But I think it's just me. I figured he was in his 30s. i’m a transgender woman, and particularly when he’s mocking peterson he always says “trannies”, it really turns me off of him, and i have to prepare to hear him say that word every time i hear him start that impression. i also tried to get another trans freind of mine into the show today and as soon as he said that word she turned it off, and i don’t blame her. when people call us that it’s usually alongside a death threat, and i don’t think he should throw it around so loosely, just my opinion.  what do y’all think about this?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3YcGRCGEuY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3YcGRCGEuY)

not sure I can sit through it by myself He has a point. It is a slippery slope for him. He is a conspiracy nutjob that says that Syrian chemical attacks were false flags, Clinton Foundation which the Clintons receive $0 from is a bribery scheme (it’s actually most likely the best charity in the entire world, better than the Carter Center), etc. He SHOULD be next to get the ban hammer, right after Jimmy Dore gets banned from YouTube!What most people don't know about insider trading and Congress is, when a Congressman does it, its legal.   
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Actions that send regular people to prison are legal, day-to-day work in Congress.  
  
[Chris Collins](https://www.wonkette.com/chris-collins) was arrested (I assume) for using his Board of Innate Immunotherapeutics (private corporation) information, not Congressional (public) business.   
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
How is this?  
  
Congress people are privy to huge amounts of insider data just from their normal budget and committee work.   
   
Such a dilemma, they could make a lot of profit, what do lawmakers do about the moral hazard? They make it legal, of course, just for themselves.  
  
People forget that almost every Congress in history, maybe even back to the 1st Congress, quietly enabled laws to exempt its Members from insider trading penalties. 
  
Congress personnel spend so much time trading some Republican offices are said to resemble market trader floors, including [Bloomberg terminals](https://qz.com/84961/this-is-how-much-a-bloomberg-terminal-costs/) *.   
&amp;nbsp;  
  

A few times over their 200 years, like in 2012, scandals made Congress "reform" the rules, but they always quietly fixed them back, usually within the same session, [like in 2013](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/16/177496734/how-congress-quietly-overhauled-its-insider-trading-law) . 
   

The daily wielding of insider privilege makes them so blase they often forget it doesn't apply outside Congress: Example, now-imprisoned Speaker Hastert was warned his payoff transactions would trigger legal reporting by his bank, his reply was, I wrote that law, its only for terrorists, it doesn't apply to me. He continued using the bank and was caught due to his own legislation!

I'm out of the loopIf you’re for outlawing libel, slander, death threats, incitements to violence and yelling fire in a theater, then you are NOT a free speech absolutist. And if you read the first amendment with a literal interpretation, all of that is legal and constitutional. How does extending that to hate speech make it a “slippery slope” when hate speech is proven to lower lifespans, increase blood pressure, decrease productivity and test scores, etc. Almost every developed country other than America outlaws hate speech. What is wrong with that? It doesn’t lead to a slippery slope. And who gets to decide what speech to outlaw in that case? The people, it’s called a democracy. 
I’m not for outlawing hate speech by the way.KKK are Republicans today. They endorsed Nixon, Goldwater, Ronald Reagan who refused to condemn the KKK and they endorsed Donald Trump. By the time the 1980s came, every single democrat voted in favor of civil rights and only Republicans voted against civil rights. Look no further than the civil rights restoration act, which only republicans voted against. It was then vetoed by the racist president Ronald Reagan, who opposed every single civil rights law/legislation. Only Republicans opposed the Community Reinvestment Act which outlawed redlining, a major civil rights legislation. Only Republicans including Ronald Reagan opposed creating Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Only Republicans opposed the Fair Housing Amendments of 1988 which were watered down in senate committee exclusively by Republicans for civil rights to only cover 80% of housing rentals in America. Only Republicans have voted against civil rights since the Community Reinvestment Act, including the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, MLK Jr. Day, South Africa apartheid bill, The Civil Rights Act of 1991, The CFPB, Lily Ledbetter, etc. KKK has endorsed Republicans since 1960 when they supported Nixon due to his stance to not use government to force businesses to desegregate (known as civil rights). Reagan supported (and fought for while in office) interracial marriage opposition groups such as Bob Jones racist church in South Carolina. Reagan fought to protect their racist bans on interracial marriage. Reagan lost at the Supreme Court, which ruled 8-1 against him. Republicans oppose the voting rights act today and refuse to reinstate it. They oppose the 1965 immigration act today and have fought to limit this immigration that does not have racial quotas. The Republican Party today is the party of slavery, with it's advocacy for the private prison slavery industrial complex, both for citizens and as a half-way house for illegal immigrants.
Additionally, all civil rights court decisions have been decided by liberal justices and racial integration was ended after Nixon turned the Supreme Court conservative in 1971. They also blocked democrats from ending property tax based education funding which was a segregationist policy and replacing it with state-level education funding. Today, once Trump gets his next conservative on the court, they will have five conservative votes to end disparate impact, the centerpiece of modern day civil rights. Black and minority liberals (as well as white Republican liberals known as Rockefeller Republicans) became Democrats and conservative whites became Republicans. This is why 70% of white people are not democrats today and why 90% of black people are. Because they switched parties.I believe sam responds “you’re really handing it to these people”[Syria was a major success and saved lives](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11363288/libya-intervention-success)The way he treated the guy talking about the space force was rude.

I actually listened to his podcast for a long time. He interviewed some interesting people like Neil Degrasse Tyson. In that interview he asked some odd questions and made some odd statements. 

At the time I just ascribed them to something else because he didn't overtly say what he was thinking. Looking back now it is clear to me that these questions and the accompanying statements he made were signs of some of the underlying racist ideas that he holds. Namely that he believes black people are genetically less intelligent than white people - a claim that the overwhelming majority of peer-reviewed scientists do not consider as having a well constructed hypothesis or as having sufficient evidence to support it.

I'm not sure if Neil sensed this to some degree. I think not. It was pretty vague at that point.

Listen to the interaction here:

It was the Charles Murray interview when he finally showed his hand:

And it was his debate/conversation with Ezra Klein when he was popularly confronted and exposed as a racist: [https://art19.com/shows/the-ezra-klein-show/episodes/4e7020f1-9036-4c17-89a2-dc1c667b9bb8/embed](https://art19.com/shows/the-ezra-klein-show/episodes/4e7020f1-9036-4c17-89a2-dc1c667b9bb8/embed)We should outlaw third parties to make it more democratic. It literally makes people think we have a three party system/options and that they actually have a choice to elect Jill Stein or whatever other unqualified idiot they like. It’s really a form of fraud that third parties commit by insinuating that you can actually “vote for them for president”. Not to mention that it’s a form of escapism from getting involved and using organized movements such as interest groups and voting to enact change in a democracy. Not voting for an idiot and de facto not voting at all.Palestinians refused Israeli citizenship in 1948 and have been fighting for secession ever since. They share most beliefs on social issues with confederates and are to the right of Israel.

I do not support a two-state solution. I believe in a one-state solution with a very limited federal government. The two provinces of Israel and Palestine should govern themselves on almost all issues. But they should not have two states and they should share a military, to protect each other from each other and the Palestinians from other actors that could decimate them if Palestinians were on their own.Was there some caller or interview that instigated it?Like something on par with the KKK history interview, that was fascinating Next Friday the MR crew will be replaying the original Walter Block interview in all of it's insane glory. If you've never heard it before, you owe it to yourself to give it a listen to appreciate the lunacy, but don't get outraged. Realize that to some extent at least, Block is doing performance art like a good pro wrestling heel (villain).The Nazis:

-Privatized the state (ended collectivist democracy)

-Privatized all 13 state run industries

-Banned workers unions (the centerpiece of socialism)

-Banned worker’s strikes

-Subsidized big corporations &amp; agribusiness

-Cut corporate taxes in half

-Eliminated all labor laws

-Relaxed gun laws, and rose to power on the failure of the Weimar Republic to confiscate their guns

-Were anti-immigrant

-Killed jews

-Killed homosexuals

-Opposed feminism

-Banned truth (burned books and killed progressive college professors)

-Banned all Marxist, anarchist and socialist organizations and killed their members

-Believed in strict individualism and social Darwinism (survival of the financially fittest)

Feel free to copy/paste this, it’s a good starting point.We haven’t had a Keynesian stimulus like the last budget since the stimulus. It’s unbelievable that this isn’t mentioned in news reports about the economy. If Trump cut spending, like Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush did, it would directly harm the economy as opposed to how Nixon, Reagan, and W. Bush used Keynesian spending bills to stimulate the economy using deficits and debt.We outlaw incest and we cite the genetic health of the offspring (studies show it increases risk of extreme abnormalities around 4% for a first-cousin marriage but each generation of incest compounds it). This is undeniably a form of eugenics.

We also stop prisoners from procreating and from what I have read this was first put into place from the understanding of eugenics, that “undesirable” male criminals should not procreate with “undesirable” female criminals. This is undeniably a form of eugenics as well.

I like to think that I don’t believe in eugenics, but I am opposed to incest, although I do not want it to be a felony. 

We also allow people to sterilize themselves (get a vasectomy), to take birth control and to get abortions, based upon the idea that they own their own body and that no one, including another person including a fetus, has a right to someone else’s body. This is technically a form of eugenics. 

Most of us think of eugenics as forced sterilization and/or extermination. But it does not just cover that. It covers all methods of controlling reproduction to ensure a better genetic pool is in the next generation. 

For reference, it was the conservative Supreme Court in 1927 that fully legalized eugenics, including forced sterilization and it was partially reversed by the new deal Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has never fully rebutted eugenics in terms of it’s legality. The last legal forced sterilization was in 1981 from what I read. Although sterilization of prisoners occurred under Governor Schwarzenegger from 2006 to 2010, which was just a rogue prison, not a policy of the governor.[John McCain says the Iraq War was a mistake](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/25/17394466/john-mccain-memoir-iraq-war-mistake)

This was disappointing for me, since I support the war. But nevertheless, either these people are ignorant or they can’t accept that he changed his mind. Similar to Hillary changing her mind in 2013, long after the public turned against the war. She didn’t change with public opinion, she genuinely changed her mind. Similar to Bobby Kennedy changing his mind on his initial support for the war in Vietnam. But many on the left who opposed Hillary couldn’t be honest about her change of position and had to use a lie of deception to argue that Hillary was “for the war” 1. JFK never cut taxes, it was Lyndon Johnson who cut taxes, and closed loopholes simultaneously where the top effective tax rate went up (from 37% to 38% in one year and once all provisions went into effect in 1966, the rate went up to 43%). The result was that revenue went up. The growth rate and rate of revenue growth also went up with this tax hike.

Source: https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-rich-1950-not-high/

2. Reagan cut taxes, and revenue went down and then continued to rise at a lower rate than previous years to Reagan. GDP growth and the rate of revenue growth both went down. There was more economic growth in the 1970s than in the 1980s and in the 1970s we had a declining debt to GDP ratio on top of it.

3. George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton both raised taxes and Bill Clinton closed loopholes as well. The top effective tax rate under Bill Clinton was at 1970s levels. Revenue went up and the GDP growth rate and the rate of revenue growth both went up.

4. W. Bush cut taxes and revenue went down, then went up at a lower rate than in previous years. The GDP growth rate and the rate of revenue growth both went down.

5. Trump cut taxes and revenues have gone down so far....was beautiful. Fuck Jimmy Dore, fuck the "Rational National", and fuck anyone who considers themselves left wing but somehow thought Trump was preferable to Hillary Clinton. Glad to see him finally take the gloves off and just shit all over Dore like he deserves. In the last few months there was an author or writer featured on the show who had some some very in-depth look into the history and story of Prez Cheeseballs. Some line about 'none of this is hidden information necessarily but no one has gone through all of it and connected the dots in this way'. 

Does anybody remember this? It's been on my mind and I wanted to read it. Way better than the CUCKjority Report show we usually get! #MAGAhttp://dissidentpeasant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/RayGun-Interview.mp3
In this episode, I talk to Stephen Robbins (@YakimaAbogado), an immigration attorney from Washington State, Host of Redirect: Immigration Law and Perspectives about political propaganda today, our evolution as former people of faith, the latest in immigration law, and a more than half-decent Lefty Al Gore impression.

Share and enjoy.When the show opened today they briefly addressed the accusations against Al Franken. Jeanine looked identical to Hannity on the segment. She deflected, said she doesn't believe the accuser, changed the subject, and ultimately tried very hard to talk about anything else. They then just moved on. And they moved on to talk about Roy Moore and didn't see the irony for even a moment.

Frankly, my blood is boiling. I know women who have been sexually assaulted and the mix of anger, hurt, and violation they express is identical to Franken's accuser. Is this really how it's going to be? It's fine as long as you are on the right political team? 

They rushed to Franken's defense and they *really* shouldn't have because guys like Franken or Moore don't do it just once. There will be more stories about Franken coming out. 

I lost a fucking ton of respect for Sam, Jeanine, and the MR crew today. I hope they address this in a less shitty way because I don't know if I can continue to support the show.

Edit: I fully expect the terrible behavior toward victims from people on the right. But it's so incredibly disheartening when the exact same stuff comes from people on the left. It was the same with Bill Clinton. It's really disheartening to see that people care a lot about lip service but don't really mean what they say.As a Star Trek fan, Voyager did an episode called Tuvix.  It was a pretty interesting episode, but the resolution at the end saw Captain Janeway do something incredibly morally questionable which activated the fan base to an incredible extent. Everyone from fans to the actors who worked on the show to the writers who wrote the script eventually weighed in, choosing a side. To this day, like decades later, after a run that included hundreds of shows, all with unique plots and discussion points, the fans still erupt into a frenzy any time someone mentions season 2 episode 24.  I wasn't around in the 1990's to watch that erupt in the community. Today, I think I now know what it was like to watch Tuvix. I think the MR community just had that yesterday.  But I think, we, like the Star Trek community did, eventually unite despite our disagreements over the most controversial moment in our show' history.Anyone else think this?

It seems like all they have to express is outrage. There's no discussion; it's just outrage over the latest "thing."  No finer points, no in-depth examination, just THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!!

Ok, yeah: it's terrible. And?

 Marty said something funny on the [show today](https://youtu.be/jSi6qtb6JlI?t=7733).  Marty said:

&gt;[Sam] should talk to [Haidt] before Jordan Peterson and Harris or Dave Rubin get to him and kind of paint him in a weird light.

Marty, if you're reading, do your damned research. Rubin, Harris and Jordan Peterson do not need to get to Haidt. They don't need to paint him in any sort of light. Why would they? He is one of them. For more than two years now Haidt, via his Heterodox Academy, has been on a campaign to convince people that leftist have taken over academia. [Here's](https://heterodoxacademy.org/problems/) a link to what he calls "The Problem" on his website.  He's part of the Rubin-Harris-Peterson clique - the "*political-correctness-is-destroying-everything*" crowd. He, Peterson, Rubin, Saad, et all - they're birds of feather and they flock together. In fact, Rubin is part of his Heterodox Academy.

Moreover, this is a guy who says ["Conservatives have broader moral sense than liberals"](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/26/righteous-mind-author-haidt-conservatives-have-bro/). This is the guy Marty's mind was blown by. He calls himself a centrist, but if you listen to his most recent interview with Harris, you'll quickly notice that he is somewhat antipathetic towards the left and sympathetic to the right. That's the guy who blew Marty's mind. Michael Brooks has a segment on his show about throwing people into the Pyramid. I have no idea why but it's fucking hilarious. Anyone know the story behind the concept?That is all. She is the archetypal SJW. I didn't think that caricature of an SJW, third-wave feminist one usually sees portrayed by the likes of Crowder, Sargon, Rubin, Shapiro et al was real. Jesus, was I wrong! She is that caricature! She is just the worst.

Oh, and her voice grates.

Edit: I have read most of your comments. They haven't changed my mind. I stand by my post. Jamie Peck is just the worst! 

Now, I know this makes many of you, likely like-minded folks - like-minded with Jamie, mad. Good!Trump didnt have sex. Knockout game (cumtown). Blah chelsea was tortured expect weirdness.

  Is the Michael Brooks show available as a podcast anywhere? I can only watch youtube shows for so long before I lose attention.So, she released this 6-minute video in which she says "Goodbye to the left". Among the reasons she gave, this one stood out to me:

&gt;*So, Faith Goldy to my understanding is not either of those things. She is far-right or alt right but she's not a white supremacist and she's not a Neo-Nazi but the the left again they try to hijack this conversation and they try to confuse people they try to they want to remove the nuance. They even want it to make it unacceptable to acknowledge that there's a nuance. So, when I was doing radio people would ask me how I feel about Faith Goldy's views and I'd have to...I found myself explaining the difference between white nationalism and white supremacism because journalism and white because there's a huge difference and the left wants to make it so that even if you acknowledge that difference there must be like something really dangerous or something really scary about you and so even when I was explaining that difference I felt like very self-conscious about it, right?*

So, this is Lindsay Shepherd's reason for saying "goodbye to the left"; because the left refuses to acknowledge the nuances between White supremacy and White nationalism and that made her feel really uncomfortable. I think that feeling she felt was probably cognitive dissonance, because deep down, the better part of her knows she was trying to make a bad ideology seem less bad than it is. That was why she felt self-conscious. But what do I know? I'm no psychologist.

**Why Doesn't Socioeconomic News get Covered by Radio and Television?**

I mean outside of News for the Wealthy with a Wall Street slant. Channels like Bloomberg cover economic news, but they'll be just outright giddy over the prospect of thousands of people losing their homes because to them that's an economic opportunity. The plight of people losing their homes means nothing to them.

Why don't we have a Working Class equivalent of Bloomberg that covers what economic developments mean for the rest of us? We used to, once upon a time waaaay back when there was a labor press, we should have a modern version of that but as far as I can tell we don't.

Sure sometimes there are economics related stories that get covered for like 30 seconds, scandals of employers mistreating employees or something like that, but they're barely even a snowcone's shaving off the tip of a mountain sized iceberg.

It shouldn't take some hermit communist going through towns and writing about them for us to hear about what's going on in places like Camden or cities like Crossett, but we never hear about that stuff unless someone basically publishes a book about it first.

No one in the media ever wants to talk about what happened to the factory towns across the Rust Belt for example, or what's still happening in them. Our failure talk about it is a large part of why Republicans have been able to take hold of them and monopolize voters in them, turning once purple states deep red.

We should be having a public discussion about how and why that happened, about what happened to these communities economically and how we need to address these sorts of things moving foward. This should be a conversation in the 'Progressive Youtube Media' at least, but no one seems interested in having this discussion.[Here’s the Link](https://www.statesman.com/news/local/woman-asks-ted-cruz-for-dna-test-prove-that-you-human-austin-campaign-stop/8r07bidCIFIabQRPNFBu0L/) to the article and video mentioned in the post title.

I actually was hoping that a BIG youtuber like Hbomberguy would make a debunking video on this but I want to bring this Information out, just in case. Ben Shapiro needs a good take down and rebutal on his claims about transgender people and data. Also his question 'why arent you 60'  is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid. The more accurate comparison would be maturity of someone, you know like foe example 10 year olds which brains are mature faster than others, and have a brain of a 40 year old or the other way around, adults who still have the brain of usually a 5 year old. As is said, I hope that Hbomberguy will make a debunking on this.FYI Sam Seder + team "glyphosate" sounds just like the syllables gly + pho + sate: 
 
Gly rhymes with an insect which may seek out your delicious pho, a Vietnamese dish but here pronounced foe, and sate is like sated, how you feel after overeating. 
  
Emphasis is not so certain, individual scientists and reporters on [Science Friday](http://www.ScienceFriday.org) and other shows emphasize different syllables.

Cancer potential, bad as that is, may be less heinous than its other dangers: we are eating much more pesticide in our "food" as farmers must pump up the chemicals due to decreasing effectiveness (this is the reason it was chemical sellers like Monsanto who invented the GMO business); a GM organism is not any kind of species humans evolved to eat, so is it even nourishment?; traditional crops are being eliminated from the farm economy with impacts on biodiversity, already suffering from monoculture, chemical pollution, extinction of small farms, etc. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
We just don't know enough to say GMO is safe; the epidemiology needed to prove that takes decades. A wider problem is we have abandoned the Precautionary Principle in law (first do no harm) and lurched into an insane corporate version of Caveat Emptor, (sell it first, it'll be years before we know the true costs) imposed by monopoly power ( If they eliminated all alternatives from the food market, so what? You bought it, that was your choice. ).  
 We all know the "What if Obama did..." is rhetorical at this point. But could you imagine how apeshit crazy Sean Hannity would go if the third client of the President's raided lawyer wasn't even Rachel Maddow, but just MSNBC contributor Sam Seder?He's now a contributor at Breitbart News. I won't link because, well, Breitbart. From the abstract:

** NOTE FROM SENIOR MANAGEMENT:**

Nobody had more respect and admiration for Dennis Miller than Andrew Breitbart.  One of Andrew’s great joys was filling in as a guest host on the Dennis Miller radio show on Westwood One. They were connected by humor, insight, and the shared belief that conservative ideas can be advanced through culture. We are excited that things have come full circle and we welcome Dennis to Breitbart News.

The column is generically crap.  1917-2018

It's been over two weeks since I first publicly made the prediction that Flake would be a 'no' for Kavanaugh. I could (then and now) even picture him submitting his 'no' via thumb, in tribute to his late fellow statesman, John McCain. Everywhere I've posted my prediction I've been met with almost 100% doubt, if not ridicule, had my persuasions called 'fan fiction' and 'fantasy.' While I'll admit the 'thumbs-down' image does cross into fantasy territory, I won't apologize for having it, and I will now try to assert why the basic expectation of a non-confirmation from Flake is absolutely realistic, thumbs or no. It is the expectation I stand by, not based on Polyanna wishful thinking or belief in inherent goodness, but on a year of closely watching this man.

Flake has no conceivable reason to want Kavanaugh appointed, and ample reason to deny him the seat. What you have to weigh is his not running for reelection, his despising Trump, and his support of the Mueller probe. You also have to understand that you're watching the beginning of a 2-year campaign of Flake as the Anti-Trump Conservative candidate for 2020. To better illustrate how/why these concepts matter, let's look at the reasons people typically give for why they think Flake will vote 'yes' on Kavanaugh.

ANYONE ON THE LEFT WHO PUTS THEIR TRUST IN FLAKE IS NAIVE. HE IS A DIEHARD CONSERVATIVE. JUST LOOK AT HIS VOTING RECORD. --I have no delusions about this. Flake IS a conservative, and yes his record does align almost lockstep with his fellow Republicans. He's anti-choice, has an 'A' rating from the NRA, he voted for the tax cuts, and voted 'yes' for all three of Trump's Obamacare repeal proposals (yes, including the one McCain gave the infamous thumbs-down for). In fact, check it out, he's not only conservative, he's more conservative than 96% of all GOP senators: https://voteview.com/person/20100/jeff-flake.

So why would he risk pissing off his fellow Senators and conservative voters? --He's only got a few more months in Senate, and isn't asking for another term after that. What he WILL ask for (votes for President), he has two years to make his case for, and voting 'no' on Kavanaugh will be his first more-than-words exhibit for that case.

WHY WOULDN'T HE CONFIRM A CONSERVATIVE NOMINEE BASED PURELY ON CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES? --He will. Just not this one. The list of potential nominees submitted to Trump by the Federalist Society is nothing but extremely conservative-leaning judges. What makes Kavanaugh unique is what makes Trump want him SO bad; the things he has said showing a willingness to help Trump escape justice to whatever extent possible. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know how realistic that hope is for Trump, but it's the closest thing to hope Trump can see in that list of names. I mean, what other human being has expressed sympathy for frikkin NIXON? And even if Flake doesn't believe Kavanaugh (and 4 other Justices) will save Trump if it becomes a Supreme Court case, he knows Trump believes it. And he HATES Trump. He has repeatedly called out Trump's words and behaviors (such as calling the Helskinki summit "an Orwellian moment"), and recognized the overall crassness of Trump as destructive to our culture and democracy. Lest we forget, he first made this case one year ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flSbXhD0cCk

HE DOESN'T SINCERELY CARE ABOUT VICTIMS OF ASSAULT --Maybe he does and maybe he doesn't. But you can't argue with this: Him being the initial voice demanding to hear Blasey-Ford's testimony, and then demanding an FBI investigation may not prove that he DOES sincerely care, but it certainly disputes the claim that he doesn't. I have yet to see any such nay-sayers offer any reason whatsoever WHY he would delay the Committee vote on behalf of alleged victims' claims, TWICE, mind you.

Now, I'll still say 'maybe he doesn't sincerely care' because maybe he's just using the accusations as an excuse to delay (maybe stop) Kavanaugh's confirmation, as the Democrats are accused of (with some measure of justification). I myself will go so far as to say Kavanaugh must be stopped and so I am both proud of AND GRATEFUL to the women who've come forward with their stories. --It's a shame that neither Kavanaugh's other terrible qualities, nor the Judiciary Committee's other shameful proceedings weren't enough to put the brakes on this vote, but I guess if the bar is so low only a rapist can't become a Justice, so be it. Thanks again, courageous women.

And what about the women at the elevator? --Well if you think I don't have enough healthy cynicism about Flake, how about this? --I don't think they changed his mind. I think when he announced just minutes before that he intended to vote 'yes' on moving Kavanaugh from Committee to the floor, he already intended to give that vote with the caveat of an FBI investigation (which is exactly what he did). I think he planned it BECAUSE it would be dramatic, a shock after his previous statement, a mini version of the McCain tribute we still could see, in the full Senate vote. I've seen at least one accusation by a far-right commenter that the elevator scene was purposely staged by Flake, in cahoots with CNN and two women actors. Now that's just silly, but you can't help but wonder if Flake could have taken a 'safer' route to the chamber, one without protesters and cameras and elevators and feet that can jam elevators. Is it just me or does the anguish on his face belie the hint of a smile here and there? He definitely gave brief little grins while he literally thanked the women, repeatedly, and then he said, "I need to go to the hearing. I issued a statement. I'll be saying more as well." --By 'more' he meant the FBI investigation caveat; he just couldn't reveal it yet. https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/28/jeff-flake-kavanaugh-confronted-by-protesters-elevator-nr-vpx.cnn

HE'S JUST PLAYING POLITICS --Well YES, he IS. But what politics? The politics of toying with America, only to confirm a Justice the People have come to disapprove of more than ever, BECAUSE OF the microscope he twice demanded we use? That makes no sense!

I won't deny that Flake's tactics are part of a con, but it's a long con. He wants Trump 1. enraged, 2. disgraced, 3. (if possible) impeached, and if not possible, at least greatly devalued as a 2020 Presidential candidate. It’s hard to guess whether he will run as an Independent, or actually try to primary an incumbent President (which has never succeeded). Whatever the case, the Mueller probe must hobble Trump’s electability to the extent possible, which could be counter-hobbled by an obstacle like Kavanaugh. Flake will eliminate that obstacle if he can (even if Kavanaugh gets 50 votes, Flake will be applauded for not being one of them). And from there, he will use the same powerful tool as Trump: the media. But he will wield it with its' cooperation as opposed to its' captive disgust, as Trump does.
Look at him already schmoozing to the Press, defending them against Trump, all the way back in January of this year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La9JtENXVqI

HE WILL USE THE SKIMPY FBI REPORT AS JUSTIFICATION FOR CONFIRMING KAVANAUGH --Well, first I would reiterate the question as to why he would call for the investigation in the first place, when he could have just voted a plain 'yes' last Friday, or even further back if he hadn’t called for the testimony hearing. But I'll go further and say that he knew when he asked for the investigation it would be a farce, likely predicted the chokehold Trump would put on it, likely predicted that whatever new witnesses the FBI was directed to ignore would reach the media instead (and make the chokehold all the more outrageous), likely knew there’d be no FBI interview of Blasey-Ford, Kavanaugh, Swetnick, or any of the many potential corroborators. And in fact HE WILL CITE ALL THIS when he casts his 'no.'
In fact he has already cited it: “How did we arrive at a moment of such peril – wherein a president of the United States …… seems to think that the office confers on him the ability to decide who and what gets investigated, and who and what does not?” He asked that back in May of 2018, before a Harvard graduating class, in what might be his most scathing critique of Trump, to date. (Seriously, listen to at least the first few minutes, not only to the criticisms he makes of Trump, but the eloquently PRESIDENTIAL ways he makes them—he stumbles on words here and there, but that’s what practice is for!). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8hZ76QSxc

YOU SOUND LIKE PEOPLE DID ON NOVEMBER 7, 2016. –Baseless and flippant as it sounds, this is actually the argument that rings truest to me, and fills me with anticipatory mild PTSD. I HAD no reason to believe that Trump would win, just as I HAVE no reason to believe that Flake will vote to confirm Kavanaugh. If he does, go ahead and shower me with ridicule because I’ll be too filled with so much disgust, bewilderment, grief, and fear, to leave room for a drop of embarrassment.

But while we still have these last few days of suspense, I say why NOT have hope? Seriously, why? Right now only Jeff Flake knows whether he’ll vote to reject Kavanaugh, and probably knows whether Collins and Murkowski will do the same (I sure hope so), but I believe he would be willing to be the solitary GOP 'no' if he has to. Hell, anyone with eyes can see that Kavanaugh's confirmation would not stop the evidence coming out. What about when the Montgomery police locate the report filed by Swetnick and her mother? What about when we actually see the texts Kavanaugh's 'guys' made to rally denial of the Ramirez story before Kavanaugh supposedly knew about it? How about when Blasey-Ford gives a tearful one-on-one interview (with Oprah) about how she came forward and endured the exact nightmare she feared….for nothing? Every Senator who votes 'yes' can see all this coming; all they can do is hope for the least amount of damaging information yet to go public, and weigh how harshly their constituents will judge them for it.

Flake need not make such calculations. Like McCain, who knew he was dying, Flake can afford to be a maverick. I would assert that he can’t afford NOT to. Considering how repugnant Trump's words about McCain have been, why WOULDN'T his fellow Arizonan honor him by sticking his thumb in Trump's eye? Can you even imagine the reaction every pundit on every news outlet would have to an actual 'thumbs down' from Flake? Especially now that McCain has passed. Especially after all this tension has built up around Kavanaugh. Especially after the whole thing has become a battle of the sexes AND the parties. I can imagine it. And surely Flake can imagine it. Quite possibly he has since the day Trump announced Kavanaugh as his nominee.The STOP Act, is a bipartisan bill that will allow the U.S. Postal service to scan foreign merchandise for fentanyl, as well as other contraband. I never had a problem with the Patriot Act in theory and only would want it to be looked at to make sure it is being used optimally for fighting all domestic terrorism. The idea of the left hating it because it is “big government” is just silly, we of all people know that the government is the people and the people are the government. This bill is most likely a direct violation of the 4th amendment which outlaws warrantless searches from the government. I really don’t care as this is going to save tens of thousands of lives. The role of we the people, the government, is to provide for the general welfare. That is my honest opinion. Agree or disagree.

Crowder isn't going to be at Politicon at all according to their website.

Guess Crowder didn't want his mind changed...I cant find anything about it on there about part of youtube or there website. They should probably do better about that other than just plugging it once or twice.The youtube algorithm suggested me this old 2005 clip about the "War on Christmas" and I think it is Sam at his best. Super witty, making incisive points, and just demolishing his opponent. If you haven't seen it, it's worth your time in my opinion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvWpaneqvsQ

Sam doesn't get to show off his master debater skills super often on the show, but hopefully he gets some good zingers and fucks up Chuck Kirk at Politicon.

If you know of any other good short clips of debates from the show, post them here?Really went balls to the wall with the production values this weekDon't really have anything else to say, except that, as Sam articulated in today's show, I was under the impression that she would be able to follow through on some of the issues she had pretended to have with him.

During the show a podcast was mentioned which people seemd very aware of and Michael seemed very positive about. I think it may have be Real something or at least began with an R?

This explains why your Crazy Auntie Freedom™ is now getting dick pill emails along with  Crazy Uncle Liberty's usual amount.

\&gt;Sam agrees to the debate.

\&gt;Politicon staff: "Great! Steven is interested in a debate".

\&gt;Sam: "Wait, what's going on with the debate with Crowder? What date is that going to be on?".

\&gt;Politicon staff: "Umm.. Can we have a phone call?".

Sam talks about this on his show today at 1:04:10 below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccOF4hJLkyk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccOF4hJLkyk)Unless Crowder a: is so embarrassed by the initial debate with Sam that he won't ever come back or b: knows that while he might have enough knowledge of politics and economics etc. that he can at least attempt to debate with Sam, he knows so little about science that he has to stay as far away from Potholer54 as he can, or c: avoids both debates because anyone who's not an inexperienced college freshman is too hard for him to debate.I'm just now listening to today's MR and I heard the IM saying Crowder had a live stream at 7:30 and MR fans should flood the chat. I went over to see what was happening and surprise surprise, the live chat is disabled. Now to be fair, he might always do that. His streams aren't archived so I can't tell.

However, you CAN comment on his latest "community" post about the stream. Maybe some of you are Crowder viewers and you want to stop by and tell him how big of a fan you are. *Just make sure you are respectful.* **Definitely** don't use any profanity or insults.

Someone did see it in it's glory (although he may have gone back and changed the individual pictures),  and took a picture last November.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;My 14yo son just got a huge box of stuff from Turning Point USA. Him and his friends ordered it as a goof. I think they call this their "activism kit" for youths who want to start TPUSA chapters at their school. It's full of buttons, stickers, pamphlets, booklets, and a massive stack of posters. This thing weighed like 30 pounds and TPUSA is sending them out for free. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting here b/c of Sam's debate with Charlie Kirk and the recent uptick in attention received by TPUSA, partially caused by Kirk's performance at Politicon. I find that the kit consists of some broad, unremarkable messages like, "Freedom Good!" but a greater portion seems focused on promoting capitalism/tearing down socialism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also interesting are the specific issues they take on with their messaging. There's climate denial, anti-BLM, anti-Leftist College Profs, but the weirdest one had to be the pro-Israel stuff. Like, the other ones make sense as talking points that high school and college age mostly white, mostly male kids would be drawn in by, right? The pro-Israel, or particularly, anti-BDS, messaging that they have seems like advanced or intermediate level stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something I thought was going to be there was some kind of guide to winning over people. Like a conversation tree with common liberal/leftist arguments and a counter to each. The booklets are probably the closest thing to that, but they're for everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like most of the time when she chimes in it's just her saying "it's because of capitalism" without much further insight or explanation.

Also she sometimes does this thing where the others will be talking about some current day policy issue and then she chimes in by saying that we need to get rid of profits or abolish the state or something. It's like ok Jamie that's not exactly a relevant policy prescription at this juncture.

I haven't listened to Jamie's other podcast and people say she's better there, but generally I don't find her perspective that interesting because it seems like she just repeats the same couple of Marxist talking points over and over. 

I was watching a video that the Majority Report uploaded on Sunday, which was this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSQbgE_iA5I&amp;feature=youtu.be), and I was surprised to find out that Los Angeles is putting on the ballot to allow the city to start its own public bank. That is, a bank owned by the city of Los Angeles. I was surprised to discover that such a thing even existed since I never heard of it. I assumed a public bank was just like the central bank of any country which is owned by the government but this is not true. What got me even more interested in this was finding out that there is only one public bank in the whole country, [Bank of North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_North_Dakota) which is owned by the state of North Dakota. The next day, Chapo Trap House also uploaded another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra4sgDlalgA&amp;t=1s) talking about the same thing. I watched some videos on this and it turns out that there used to be a whole bunch of public banks in the past but have since become privatized except for one which is the Bank of North Dakota. I'm surprised that will all the surge of interest in socialism and social welfare, that no one has brought up the idea of more cities, states, or even the country creating their own public banks as a form to fight the private, for-profit banks. I would really like to see the Majority Report or Chapo Trap House talk with more experts on this to see how realistic and viable public banks would be. From the short videos I've see about the Bank of North Dakota, it seems like a much better alternative for some then having to rely on some of these bigger, more corrupt private banks. They even seem to be better options than credit unions which are already great. I'll link some videos below in case anyone else is interested in this because I'd really would like to see something like this take off in the country.

It happens (at least) once an episode. It's kind of hilarious but mostly just awkward.

Some people don't respond well to social cues.I think progressives aren't talking enough about nationalization. Is it a good idea to get behind? I personally think some of the currently privately-owned companies &amp; industries suck and could be improved under state ownership. Here are some examples:

**Start by nationalizing the following:**

Water utilities companies

Electric utilities companies (similar to the Électricité de France state-owned utility in France)

Natural gas companies

Private prison companies

Freddie Mac &amp; Fannie Mae (from 1938 to 1968 they were wholly owned by the government, but they were *partially* privatized. The GOP wants to fully privatize them.)

I think there are good arguments for this. Individuals and private businesses would have reduced prices because the state-owned companies would be working more in public interest rather than for private stakeholders. No market required. I also think it is a good idea to have a public entity on the mortgage market competing with private firms and promoting homeownership (safely) This was what was envisioned by FDR when Fannie was started in 1938.

Are there other things that should be nationalized?

Bolsonaro picked Paulo Guedes as his finance minister (super minister) What is alarming is that Paulo is essentially a very zealous conservative/libertarian economist. He got his credentials from the **University of Chicago** and he helped found a Brazilian ''classical liberal'' think-tank called **Instituto Millenium.** Among the top funders of this think-tank are corporations and wealthy individuals who seek to implement a market liberalization ''free market'' agenda.

Paulo wants to privatize all current state-owned companies (such as the oil company Petrobras), slash pensions, cut government spending into the ground, cut taxes (particularly corporate and payroll) and deregulate the economy.

''**Guedes told Bloomberg in an** [**interview**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/chicago-boy-helps-calm-bankers-fears-about-brazil-wild-card) **published in April, adding, “we should’ve done what the Chicago Boys instructed”, following a recipe of deregulation, privatization and free-market principles.''**

International business interests &amp; investors are fawning over the prospect of putting a libertarian economist in charge of Bolsonaro's economic policy. All you gotta do is look at how the exchanges react to news about this damn guy. One of the things on their wish-list is the weakening of licensing laws and land-use restrictions, so of course, perfect timing for the local oligarchy.

Ben Shapiro needs a good take down and rebutal on his claims about transgenders. 
Its important to know that hormone therapy, SRS, FFS (and so on) are mainly to reduce gender dysphoria, not suicidality or at least not mainly suicidality. Ben strawmans the entire topic into that transgender medicine is about to reduce suicidality and suicide attempt rates. Its like you would say that anti depression medicine is to reduce suicidality, which is not. Its to reduce depression. It CAN help (if you are even suicidal), but mainly its to reduce depression. The same for gender dysphoria - its mainly to reduce gender dyhsproia. 

REDUCING GENDER DYSPHORIA &lt;

That is the entire main purpose behind hormone therapy, SRS, FFS and so on.

Also his question 'why arent you 60' is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid. The more accurate comparison would be maturity of someone, you know like foe example 10 year olds which brains are mature faster than others, and have a brain of a 40 year old or the other way around, adults who still have the brain of usually a 5 year old. 

PLEASE UPVOTE and please go on Hbomberguy's curious cat and ask him if he would do a debunking video on this, please &lt;333Hey yall 

During yesterday's show a woman who got into an exchange with Dave Rubin at UNH called in and talked about it extensively. They later clipped it out.

 Towards the end of that call, Sam brought up a study done by a libertarian think tank regarding college campuses and professor firings. I wanted to check that out for myself and I can't seem to find it. Do any of yall know what study he was referring to? I tried looking at the description box on the clipped page but I couldn't find it. 
Raygun talking with Sam somehow reminded me of this interview on Law and Disorder Monday: 
Attorney Cathleen Caron of www.justiceInMotion.org, National Lawyers Guild member, helped create a network of paralegal resources for migrants who need legal help with, torts, stolen wages, harassment etc, cases difficult for US lawyers because migrants do not live year round in the US.

The actual wealth inequality of the richest families is even bigger than the CEO's, incredibly they are so rich they are not even counted in economic statistics like the census. Under US protection a few have been permitted wealth that's literally off the charts; this Michael Parenti article on the L-curve site https://www.lcurve.org/SuperRich.htm shows not only do they escape fair taxation, there are no official stats on how much they are making from America.

  Overthrowing dictators, fighting terrorists, building coalitions for democratic governments in the Middle East, countering Iran which we are destined to eventually have to deal with (in their constitution they declare the mission to spread Islam through violence and they are a theocratic dictatorship), countering Saudi influences (overthrow of fascist Saddam Hussein, fighting al queda, fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan etc)
I don’t know how anyone that has any knowledge of the brutality of Saddam Hussein can say that Iraq is not better off today. Iraqi Kurdistan is a complete success and the rest of Iraq is heading in that direction. Saddam Hussein was alongside Mussolini and Hitler in ideology and human rights abuses. He ran Iraq as a fascistic police state and concentration camp, with all basic freedoms taken away from the people. He jailed, tortured, raped and murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people. He went to extremes of lowering children and women into vats of acid and putting hot rods into their orifices. He killed minimum 600,000 Iraqis compared to 200,000 deaths from the entire Iraq War which were largely from his forces who resisted us.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/21/supreme-court-backs-employers-over-workers/355923002/

   They will shadowban posts that "detract from the conversation." Twitter's statement just confirms what we already knew, that users are regularly shadowbanned, meaning they dont even know that no one can see what they post. Users carry on thinking that people just won't interact with them but in reality Twitter has rendered them invisible. 

This also confirms reporting from James O'Keefe in January where we saw a twitter engineer talk about removing a certain "way of talking" from the platform. But most alarming is the statement from an engineer that this will mostly affect conservatives.

Her policies literally are cheaper then the status quo when you dig into the dam data. So I put together a video trying to analyze the actual data on the issue in response to these claims, because I’ve heard way to god dam many of them . And it’s blatantly ignorant of economic policy .

Joe Walsh interview regarding the prank on CNN: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9LjwRRO9fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9LjwRRO9fk)

\----

So, the Sacha Baron Cohen prank on ex-congressperson Joe Walsh reveals something interesting about the dynamic between the rank-and-file-bought-and-paid-for congressperson and their financiers and taskmasters. All it took for them to trick Joe Walsh into saying some on-the-record ridiculous bullshit was to fluff him with an award, probably a fancy meal or two, some verbal praise, and a plausible cover story.

In a CNN interview with Joe, his defense, to me, basically sounds like this:

"They tricked me with a scenario that is familiar to me: somebody gives me money, gifts, or praise in public and then I read stuff off a teleprompter that I haven't really thought about before hand."

The only way this prank would have worked is if Joe was never previously in the habit of vetting anything  to begin with. As long as the catch phrases and ideological content seems to match up, then you are good to go, right?

In a world of constantly shifting front organizations with changing names and faces, what would vetting the organization even do? As long as it fits the profile, chances are good that they are on the same team.

Especially in the era of dark money where the only legal landmine to avoid is that you don't get caught red-handed coordinating with your donors...I would imagine not getting caught relies on a good deal of wink-and-nod, "we're on the same team" , deniable, non-signal/signalling.

Just a thought. Will be interesting to see how far he gets with Bernie Sanders and in what direction.So, I just got done watching some more Jordan Peterson and I've decided I'm going to work on creating some ready-to-go responses for the times when he brings up this postmodernism strawman. I'm fairly ignorant about academic post-modernist but it seems like he just throws it out as a boogie-man stand-in for "nothing is real" or "total moral relativism". I read a book called *Digimodernism* that was arguing that a new paradigm was replacing postmodernism due to technological changes like the internet and ubiquitous SMS, etc... The author's description of what postmodernism was, in terms of cultural products like books, movies, etc...was fairly straightforward and concrete and bore no resemblance to its right wing characterization. Of course, it is possible that the one book I picked to read completely mis-represented postmodernism...but, in the case that it was accurate, it would be nice to have in my back pocket for the next time that the term postmodernist is used like a slur.

This is a topic I’m ignorant on (it’s never really caught my interest). I’d appreciate it if someone here could break it down for me. Venezuela only has 40.9% public sector GDP. It is primarily a capitalist economy. France, for reference, is at 56.6% public sector GDP. The average public sector GDP of the OECD countries is tied for the U.K. and Iceland at 42.5%. So Venezuela has a below average public sector GDP ratio compared to OECD countries.

2. Venezuela’s public sector GDP ratio https://www.statista.com/statistics/371925/ratio-of-government-expenditure-to-gross-domestic-product-gdp-in-venezuela/
3. Even Fox News back during Chavez ran an article pointing out that there really is no socialism in Venezuela, that they are an economy run primarily on private enterprise. Additionally, current nationalized industries were previously nationalized during the early 20th century as well. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/07/18/socialism-private-sector-dominates-venezuelan-economy-despite-chavez-crusade.htmlPrice controls do not cause scarcity, they distribute scarcity. If you let the market raise prices when there is a shortage instead of having a price control, the goods are distributed unevenly to the top earners and the bottom earners cannot consume the good or service at all. Price controls avoid this and make the market solve scarcity not by cutting off the lower sects of the economy, but by rationing the good to everyone. Let’s say we have exactly how much water we need for everyone to live, but no more. Without price controls, the rich and upper middle class will demand more than they need, raising the price of water, resulting in the lower class not being able to survive or consume the amount of water needed. A price control would stop this and distribute the scarce resource evenly.Now would be a good time to release the documentaryhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T0KKc6GbeNoOn TMR live today, they showed off Sacha Cohen's latest episode tease for "Who is America?". It featured a Georgia state congressman who yelled the N word and dropped his pants and showed some skin. The N word and the bare butt weren't censored in this video. This could result in TMR getting a strike on YouTube. If anyone who's a TMR member can quickly relay them this message, please do so!!I listen to the show while I'm at work most days. This may sound like a stupid question, but does someone know the theme song that's mashed up with the Johnny Rotten "Ever get the feeling you've been cheated" quote? I don't know enough about rock music to know who it is, but I really like the song.For all of the cries of racism, bigotry, and screaming how everyone is a hateful person to the high heavens, why have Democrats or even left leaning folks in inner cities done nothing to solve the segregation problem that persists there?  Whether you're talking about NYC, Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, Philly, Cleveland, Milwaukee, LA, and the like, the conditions Black folks are forced to live in by Democrats who don't fix their neighborhoods are atrocious.  There are tons of videos on YouTube of people driving through Detroit and show how bad that these majority Black areas have to live in.

So I'm just curious as to why the arbiters of proper racial behavior have yet to actually do something to positive Black communities?  I never get a straight answer on this, so I am just curious as to how leftists respond to that point.Does anyone know the titles of the songs used on the show (intro and at the end)?  I couldn't find anywhere.  Thank you in advance.[Peter Schiff Rant Filled With Logical Fallacies and Contradictions](https://youtu.be/bow9LO_8YGs)

It is objectively false. We lost our filibuster proof senate majority 74 days into Obama’s presidency when Ted Kennedy died. We did not have a supermajority and we relied on centrists to pass Obamacare, which was proposed originally by Nixon, who was left of center of economics. Specifically, Joe Lieberman alone killed the public option. Having one more Democratic Senator in office, such as Ted Kennedy, would have caused the public option to be passed. We have never passed liberal legislation with 100% Democratic support as well, but we had 100% Democratic support for the public option in the Senate for the first time in history. That is a fact.

The other talking point is that “every other modern country has a single payer system of one kind of another” which is absolutely 100% false. Only a few countries have single payer systems, Scandinavian countries and Canada for the most part. The U.K. has direct socialized medicine, as they go further than single payer. Single payer is a government/public monopoly on insurance that pays for private healthcare. France, and most other modern nations have a multi-payer system with public insurance being the primary payer, competing with private insurance that is regulated similar to Obamacare or that is entirely non-profit like Switzerland (which has an individual mandate to buy non-profit insurance as their healthcare system).

The reason we don’t have universal healthcare is because we have subsidized, employer sponsored healthcare. This was a trend rapidly expanding before WWII price and wage controls, look up insured rate over time and what percentage is from employers. Unions were already securing employer sponsored healthcare, and once it was subsidized by FDR and greatly expanded and solidified as a subsidy under Eisenhower, most Americans had health insurance. This directly decreases support for public/government insurance. Most countries went from low insured rate to universal. We are going from a high insured rate to universal, which has less appeal.

It should also be noted that no Democratic President has ever been able to pass universal healthcare, so saying that Obama is unique in that is completely false. The most comprehensive single-payer proposal was lead by Hillary Clinton in the 90s under Bill Clinton and the public opposed it, and their opposition only grew larger over time. Obamacare did not have public support due to being perceived as too liberal. Single-payer also did not have majority support under Obama. Even with single payer support at over 60%, some of those voters will still vote Republican for other issues they prioritize (abortion for example, or foreign policy) so it is misleading to say that the centrist voter supports single payer because it has 60% support. The centrist voter does support single payer now to be clear. To really see where single payer stands you should look at how much support it has minus Republican support, to see how much outreach it has to centrists. This applies to other policies as well.Not that anything with the deficit is inherently wrong, but for political gain. Republicans can respond to Democrats railing against the deficit by increasing taxes (which they tend to do focus on the wealthy, and even if they do, that is a plus) or by cutting spending. 

Cutting spending is not only extremely unpopular, especially when a specific program is named, but it hurts the economy directly by reducing aggregate demand and therefore economic growth. Bush Sr. raised taxes (although he added additional loopholes for the wealthy, in net it was about a 1% income tax hike, far below the net tax increases Reagan had on the wealthy post-1982) and he cut spending and people were very angry about the Republican austerity and turned to Bill Clinton to end it. And he did. Gerald Ford’s economy was also hurt by spending cuts.

As long as Republicans get away with ramping up spending across the board and cutting taxes as much as they want, Democrats are at a disadvantage comparatively when evaluating economic performances under each President. Republicans don’t actually cut popular programs for the most part, so they get the angry racist who hates welfare as a voter and sees welfare as race (and claims simultaneously that we are a colorblind society) and the welfare recipients who claim they will never actually cut benefits. 

Not only that, everyone else in the short-term in the country benefits from the increased spending, as aggregate demand increases across the economy, giving the illusion of an improvement to the economy that the Republicans will attribute to their tax policies that have roughly a $0.04 force multiplier for every dollar cut in taxes. Additionally, if we get the Republicans to reduce the deficit that they created, they can’t force us to cut our own programs as they try to get us to do when we are in office.I don’t get the hatred of Cory Booker by the Bernie wing of the party. Cory Booker has a very liberal voting record and would be our most liberal president since Kennedy and Johnson. People criticize his charter school support, but his is very different than the Republicans plans. He wants the entire cost of charter schools to be covered by the government and not to be shared on the backs of poor parents, he wants charter schools to be run like traditional public schools, and he doesn’t want to destroy public schools (he wants to fully fund public schools and improve them as an option). 

I still support state-level funding of education at the minimum, which the conservatives on the Supreme Court have been blocking since Nixon in the 70s and would be the law if the Republicans had not stolen a Supreme Court sear and an election. Ultimately, I support federally funded education for all, to equalize educational opportunities. I think Cory Booker and I have the same goals for education.[Kyle Kulinski very upset that others will get fake news and de facto oppose enforcement of human rights.](https://youtu.be/JJoaGaFww_A) 

First off, the conspiracy theory that Assad did not bomb his civilians, that it was a false flag operation done to invite the U.S. to intervene (and all for an oil pipeline deal that was killed off years before the Syrian Civil War broke out) is the most disgusting conspiracy theory I have heard about any concern of the past 20 years. Sandy Hook conspiracy theory pales in comparison to spreading this lie about the people who were victims of Assad’s chemical warfare, many of whom were children by the way.

Assad is fighting for a fascist police state and he has been confirmed twice by U.N. investigations to have used chemical weapons. Assad also had underground torture and execution sites. His opponents/rebels in Syria include anarchist socialists and Kurds who all value human rights and have established democracy in the areas they occupy in Syria. Assad is a criminal, guilty of crimes against humanity and the most brutal dictator in the entire world. Syria is not a choice between war and peace, it is only the struggle for human rights. It is the choice between endless bloodshed and prosecution of the world’s worst criminal of the past decade.

The Syrian Civil War will not end until the rebels and Assad-opponents are exterminated. They will never, ever surrender to Assad. Either we let Assad win the war by slowing exterminating entire populations of his country, or we take out his regime and end the war that way. Those are the options for ending bloodshed in Syria. In my opinion, Assad should have been removed from office through regime change in 2013 and put on trial for crimes against humanity. Kulinski’s idea? Stay out and let them slaughter each other and let Assad commit crimes against humanity. 

Kyle Kulinski also says that “Assad is fighting terrorism (Al-Qaeda and ISIS)” without mentioning that he is also a sponsor of other terrorist groups and a fundamentalist Islamist himself. Kulinski also is either ignorant, stupid, or disingenuous when he doesn’t mention that Assad is also fighting all secular liberals in Syria, social democrats, socialists and anarchists in northern Syria. He also doesn’t mention that Assad is an enemy of the Kurds and will eventually turn to slaughtering them as well.

[United Nations investigation finds Assad responsible for chemical attacks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/syrian-government-forces-used-chemical-weapons-more-than-two-dozen-times-u-n-idUSKCN1BH18W)The Iraq War killed 200,000 civilians total through today, most of whom were killed by our opposition in Iraq, compared to minimum over 1,100,000 Iraqis executed/sent to their death directly by Saddam. Civilian deaths have gone down compared to under Saddam. The Iraqi Government itself and the Iranian Government put the death tolls around the same 200,000-300,000 range. 83% of Iraqis supported the U.S. lead removal and trial of Saddam Hussein according to Gallup polls conducted during the regime change war (which was 3 weeks). 

Iraqi Kurdistan is a universal success and the rest of Iraq is heading in the same direction. The are now a functioning democracy. Compared to Saddam Hussein who ran a fascist police state. He had mass torture sites, executions and prisons that destroyed the lives of the people and children living in Iraq. He slowly submerged children into vats of acid and inserted scolding hot rods into their orifices for crimes such as owning a satellite, passing a note, or belonging to an ethnic group he didn’t like. Saddam Hussein was also determined to exterminate both the Shiite and Kurdish populations.

Monotheism and Jihad, which lead the Iraqi insurgency (the bloodiest part of the Iraq War) with other Islamist groups, was already in Iraq with those plans as early as 1999. The sectarian violence would have been worse with a government in full support of exterminating at a minimum two Muslim minority populations. Iraq was a failed state and failed states always turn rogue before their collapse. An Iraqi Government collapsing on it’s own would lead to a full scale war by all of Iraq’s surrounding countries. 

The Ba’ath Party starting with the 1993 Faith campaigns became increasingly a fundamentalist, Islamist group. The Ba’ath Party has always wanted an empire as well. They are the main military arm and strategic mastermind of ISIS today.

Iraq’s oil is now socialized and owned by the Iraqi people under the oil of ministry. The Iraq people are now paid for their oil by any business that wants to use it. Previously, the Hussein crime family privately owned all of Iraq’s oil and personally reaped all of the profits personally.

Iraq lost its sovereignty through international law and we had every right to intervene. International law and human rights must be enforced.

Reasons for removing Saddam Hussein/reasons that Iraq lost sovereignty by international law:

1. Violation of the genocide convention

Bombing of the marshes resulting in minimum 180,000 deaths and the Kurds also resulting in minimum 180,000 deaths, resulting in a U.S. no-fly zone during Bill Clinton's administration.

2. Non-proliferation treaty

Iraq had used WMDs against Iran and its own people.
In 2003, Saddam Hussein was actively in the process of acquiring WMDs from Pakistan and uranium from Niger, which he stated that he planned on using to annex countries around him and build an empire on the threat of nuclear war if we interfered.

3. Giving aid and comfort to international terrorists

Turned Iraq into an Islamist State starting with the 1993 Faith Campaigns, supported by Saudi Arabia. Funded terrorists groups such as Monotheism and Jihad and abetted the 1993 WTC bombers as well as countless international terrorists. 

Monotheism and Jihad were his way of getting around the no-fly zones, replacing his aircraft’s extermination attempts with terrorists aimed at exterminating minority Muslim groups, specifically the Shiite and the Kurds.

4. Occupying and invading the territory of other nations

Invasion of Kuwait, Saddam said that he wished he had acquired nuclear weapons beforehand so he could make an empire.

Death toll of Saddam Hussein:

Saddam Forced his people to serve in the military during the Iran-Iraq war, so those casualties are absolutely valid.

Here are the casualties.

180,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from bombing the marshes

180,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from chemical bombing of the Kurds
The bombings were so bad that we could see them from space due to the ecological damage.

200,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from torture chambers and gulags/mass graves

500,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from Forced service in the Iran-Iraq war

50,000 minimum (conservative) Kurds in the Al-Anfal campaign

25,000 minimum (conservative) killed in the repression of the 1991 uprisings.

So 1.135 million is the lowest, most conservative estimate.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saddam_Hussein%27s_Iraq

The upper estimates

800,000 from Iran-Iraq War

400,000 from bombing the marshes

350,000 from bombing the Kurds

250,000 from torture chambers and gulags/mass graves

100,000 Kurds in the Al-Anfal campaign

100,000 killed in the 1991 uprisings

So the upper estimate is around 2 million. Under the most conservative estimates, even if you don’t include the Iran-Iraq War, Saddam’s death toll is around 635,000 (plus more from lack of economic development, privatizing the oil for his own personal profit, etc. compared to now where it is socialized under the Ministry of Oil).
If you want to use liberal estimates of both, Saddam still has a higher death toll.
... are simply the best argument ever made for Puerto Rican statehood. Trump would never say that shit about a state with electoral votes, even states that aren't Real America™. I like listening TMBS but I’m not a patron, is he rude to callers there too? &amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vzgibncy0fm11.pngHe has extraordinary voice. 

People have already made videos where his voice is edited to a voice over of Doom video game.


By the way, I wonder if this episode of a tv series made him:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost_(Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine)

Maybe his current state can be traced back to seeing that? (It may be in netflix.)Someone finish this since they are all sexual predators... I've been thinking about going this year.  Is it worth going to? I'd be interested to hear your experiences at PoliticonI just stumbled across this reddit by accident, and the first thing I see is that there's more threads about Jimmy Dore and the Jimmy Dore Show here than there are on Sam Seder and the actual Majority Report. What's up with that?   


I get that Jimmy's personality can be...chaffing, sometimes. but if you don't like the guy, shouldn't you guys just ignore him? Even then, while I'm sure that Jimmy Dore sees things differently from most of you on this reddit, I firmly believe that both he and majority of people here on the Majority Report are fighting for the same things.

&amp;#x200B;

We all want universal healthcare, free college and tuition, and other progressive ideals, no? So what if we if differ on how to get there? Shouldn't we be saving our energy to fight the people in power who don't want us to have those things, rather than fighting amongst ourselves? Yesterday, I discovered the Ring of Fire podcast. I didn't know Sam had another show. The free parts are about 40 min - hour. I listened to one, which had the same phone interview with Digby he'd done on MR earlier, and then a phone interview with someone else I'd not heard before. 

The paid version is three hours. I've just paid for MR and TMBS, don't have the $ or time for another podcast right now, but for anyone who gets the long version of Ring of Fire, how much of it is taken from MR? How different is the rest of it?I’m a Patreon but I’d like to be able to IM them. Any members want to explain the difference to me?This has frustrated me to no end. Not just the question of, "How are we going to pay for it?", but also the response of the average progressive to this question. When it comes to the average progressive on something like Medicare for all (M4A), you usually hear: "It will save us money". "Our administrative costs would be far more efficient". "It doesn't matter how we pay for it". "We print our own money, so we can afford it". While some of those are valid points, a lot of citizens in the U.S are fiscally conservative when it comes to economics. We need to appeal to these people using some actual numbers. In a recent Reuters poll, M4A had the support of 70% of the American people. Knowing how we're going to pay for these programs does actually matter for the health and well being of our country. People need to know how we'd pay for these proposals so they know how it will affect their daily lives. When you have media outlets like Fox News saying, "We'd need to double all taxes to pay for M4A" that can really scare and push people away who aren't informed about the facts and revenue streams.

Here's how we can pay for all of Bernie Sanders’s popular proposals.

**\*\*\*Permanent spending proposals\*\*\***

**Medicare for all:**

In 2016, public spending (federal spending) on healthcare was 65% of the $3.3 trillion we spent on healthcare ($2.145 trillion). If you factor in the annual Medicare for All number without accounting for the annual percentage increase, you get a cost of $3.2 trillion annually; so factoring in the 2016 payment of $2.145 trillion for M4A, we'd already be paying around $21.45 trillion of the $32 trillion for the program. The cost would be around **$10.55 trillion** in new taxes over the next 10 years or **$1.055 trillion** every year. Here's how we could generate that revenue.

• A 7.5 percent income-based health care premium paid by employers would raise **$390 billion** annually. An employer’s first $2 million in payroll would be exempt from this premium protecting small businesses throughout the country.

• A 4 percent income-based premium paid by households making above $29,000 would raise **$350 billion** annually.

• Returning to FY2014 discretionary military spending would raise **$196.5 billion** annually.

.• Establishing a 1% wealth tax on the top 0.1% of households which would target incomes above $21.5 million would raise **$130 billion** annually.

Total revenue raised: **$1.0665 trillion**

Revenue left over: **$11.5 billion**

&amp;#x200B;

**Paid family/medical/maternal leave:**

Cost: $319 billion over 10 years.

Revenue: 0.2% payroll tax would raise **$31.9 billion** every year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expand Social Security:**

Cost: $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

Revenue. Raise the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax cap from $128,400 to $250,000. This would generate **$120 billion** every year, give seniors an average of $1,300 more a year in their Social Security checks, and this would make Social Security solvent until 2078.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tuition-free public colleges:**

Cost: $750-800 billion over 10 years.

Revenue: A tax on Wall Street speculation (0.5% tax on stock market trades, 0.1% fee on bonds, and a 0.005% fee on derivate trades) would raise **$55 billion** annually. The remaining annual **$20-$25 billion** cost would be left to the states to fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*Temporary spending proposals\*\*\***

**Eliminating $1.5 trillion of student loan debt:**

Cost: $1.5 trillion.

Revenue: Reverse the **$1.9 trillion** dollar Trump tax cuts. After student loan debt has been nearly eliminated, this revenue could go towards other programs, tax cuts, or deficit reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

**$1 trillion investment in infrastructure:**

Cost: $1 trillion over 5 years.

Revenue: Paid for by closing the loopholes that allow profitable corporations to avoid paying taxes by shifting these corporate profits back to the U.S from the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens. This would generate at least **$200** **billion** annually. The revenue could later be used for other programs, tax cuts, or deficit reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*Closing\*\*\***

The next time you get asked the, "How are we going to pay for it?" question, feel free to use these numbers and revenue streams as a source of funding to answer that question. A quick reminder on M4A's $32 trillion price tag since it's the elephant in the room. If we had applied a M4A system in 2016, current revenue streams for public healthcare spending would already cover 65% or $21.45 trillion of the $32 trillion cost over 10 years. So we'd only need to come up $1.055 trillion in new taxes to fund the program. In 2016, that new additional public spending of $10.55 trillion over 10 years would have replaced $12.2 trillion+ in private spending; amounting to savings of trillions of dollars when you factor in annual national healthcare expenditure increases.

70% of the U.S Supports A Medicare for All System:

[http://pnhp.org/blog/2018/08/23/reutersipsos-poll-70-percent-support-medicare-for-all/](http://pnhp.org/blog/2018/08/23/reutersipsos-poll-70-percent-support-medicare-for-all/)Neoliberalism refers to European liberalism which is conservatism. It refers to post-depression European liberals (conservatives) who embraced the middle ground made (regulating banks instead of nationalizing which FDR also did) and then reversing course and going back to their beliefs in laissez-faire economics. Neoliberalism is essentially closest to libertarianism, although there are nuanced differences. No Democrat is a neoliberal. All democrats are under the ideology of social democracy, including Bernie. That’s the tent of social democracy, very large.

All democrats, even Manchin, support some expansion of the public/government sector and keeping what we currently have. Republicans differ in that they not only oppose all new bold, liberal proposals which many democrats do (they are moderates by definition, supporting moderate changes, or conservative as in joe Manchin where he is skeptical of new initiatives but does support a very slow increase in programs) but republicans share that they all want to reverse current government programs including (for most republicans) nearly all of the great society programs.

It’s used by people on the liberal wing of social democracy to describe people on the conservative to moderate wing of social democracy. It is used in response to moderate and conservative social democrat’s resistance to fast change, which if they accepted would by definition make them a liberal/radical. It’s a smear and there is no truth behind it. A neoliberal would share the opposition to new liberal proposals, but they would also want to abolish nearly all government programs and current government functions. 

An accurate description of these types of Democrats would be to call them conservative. Conservative in the fashion that Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower were conservative. They shared the same goals as liberals but only supported slow to moderate changes. Nixon, who originally proposed Obamacare, was to the left of center on economics for the American spectrum by the way, a social democrat. Ideological scoring puts Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama to the left of Nixon on economics, Barack Obama being the most conservative post-world War II Democratic president on economics and Bill Clinton being the most moderate of the three mentioned presidents.Explain yourselves.Explain yourselves, mods.The Majority Report has put out [another clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vJ2C43oIDk) complaining about the so-called Dum Dum Left, in particular Jimmy Dore.  I think it’s very unfortunate that there is this big fight between two progressive camps.  I think it’s especially sad that Sam Seder and Michael Brooks are so condescending and insulting about it.  But regardless of who is more at fault, I think it would be better for everyone if we let bygones be bygones and focus on our common ground.  To that end I have a suggestion for refocusing the conversation.

I think people like Dore get very focused on electoral politics to the exclusion of political action that can happen outside of the political parties and the electoral process.  Seder and Brooks might be more savvy when it comes to electoral politics than Dore, but they make a mistake when they solely try to focus on arguing against Dore’s political tactics [1].  Even assuming that Seder and Brooks are completely right and Dore is completely wrong about electoral politics, Dore is too stuck in the electoral politics mind-game to relent on his points.  Which isn’t strange considering his passion; he genuinely wants the country to change radically and thinks that it needs to be done solely through voting in progressive candidates.  So when someone claims that his tactics are counter-productive, he thinks that implies that he has to settle for the centrist incrementalism which Establishment Democrats love.  But if Seder and Brooks (and other anti-Dore pundits) could try to point out other ways to do politics, they might be able to take some of his edge off.  Dore isn’t an opportunist; you can’t fake that kind of passion.  He wants things to change.  But he’s stuck in the mindset where voting strategy is the most important political strategy.  If other people who were advocates for Lesser Evil voting last election could point out political strategies that has nothing to do with the electoral system—activism, protests, building popular institutions, building alternatives to capitalist structures, etc.—then people who were against Lesser Evil voting last election would have other venues to pour their passion into.

Noam Chomsky was a Lesser Evil advocate last election and he thinks that the decision of who to vote for is a [“decision that’s kind of tenth order”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vJ2C43oIDk) (EDIT: although when it came to the last election he probably thought that it was more important than that).  People like Chomsky aren’t famous activists for having come up with great voting strategies, or for providing great analyses about what demographics will vote for which candidates (which is what a lot of political scientists seem very preoccupied with…).  He’s an acclaimed activist for his intellectual contributions.  And he’s only the tip of the iceberg, as there are countless activists who do work that won’t put them in the spotlight.  

Benjamin Dixon claims in the aforelinked MR clip that Jimmy Dore makes people apathetic.  I would be very surprised if that is the case.  As Chomsky has explained, one of the purposes of the propaganda system and our consumerist culture is to make people atomized and politically apathetic.  People who watch Jimmy Dore are most probably much less politically apathetic than most people (although they might be more pessimistic).  People are engaged and tuned in, they want things to change.  Now are you going to berate them for being “stupid”, or are you going to point them towards where they can make a difference?

EDIT: Here’s [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0n_nWidU24&amp;t=9m3s) video of Chomsky explaining why elections shouldn’t be an activists primary focus.

[1] They also love to bring up the whopping two videos that Dore made about Seth Rich, complain that he’s a conspiracy theorist and make accusations that he is making content “for the clicks” like a cynical money grubber.  I consider all of those bad faith talking points and accusations so I won’t spend any time on them.

I posted the same topic to /r/jimmydore [two days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/jimmydore/comments/9i8ix3/how_the_feud_between_the_jimmy_dore_crowd_and_the/).  I didn’t get as much productive feedback as I had hoped, so I might be shooting my efforts in its foot by linking to that thread.  But I planned to link to this next thread to begin with, so I’ll do it anyway in the name of full disclosure or something.M4A would add $32.6 trillion in additional spending over the next 10 years. I think I’ll pass on supporting the doubling of all corporate and income taxes to pay for a crappy healthcare system. Bernie Sanders doesn’t understand basic economics..All the existing science seems to be old and based on extremely rough guesses and conjecture. If there are arguments for keeping it that way, then give them, those arguments should be known.

Many different scenarios could be considered. Also, it probably matters greatly on what time of year it happens. Nuclear war in november is different than in june...

There are 2 different considerations here: Should it be known and if so, what are the answers? First is more political and philosophical question and the second is more about physics and climate science / meteorology.

If your answer is that it is not worth knowing because world would end anyway, that is based on one scenario with one set of scientific assumptions that are extremely inaccurate. Also, it does not have to be actually possible to happen, for the answers to be worth knowing. 

For the science part, link to this discussion:

Do some Jimmy Dore idiots really believe that there is no difference between Democrats and Republicans being in office? Shouldn’t they move to Alabama, since it is no different than being in a state run by democrats, like New York. They are emotionally invested in cognitive dissonance of reality.Like, do they acknowledge that no Democrat would've appointed him or anyone like him?  Do they find a way to blame the Dems for him somehow?  Or do they just ignore the issue and publish an expose on Hillary's Parkinson's Disease?Racism is the belief that one race is biologically superior to the other. Diversity policies and affirmative action are based upon the belief that there is no race biologically superior to another and that there is no biological basis for race in the first place, which is a scientific fact. The majority-subset of those who oppose diversity policies and affirmative action do so because they believe that one race is prone to working harder, being smarter, more athletic, etc. are racist by definition. 

This needs to be pushed back against whenever it is said. It is the people who oppose diversity policies that are racists, from David Duke to Ronald Reagan to Paul Ryan to Charles Murray. Those who embrace the idea that there are no biological races and that there is no superior race, like MLK or Kennedy or Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, are champions of civil rights and equality. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.rogan is an idiot but you're overstating his influence. pretty much all of those people basically end up telling young white guys they're the best and deserve everything they've had which is obviously appealing and they're to dumb and inexperienced with the world to realize it's not true, no rogan needed even if he hasn't helped. He hasn't had them on in years.  Rogan's shift to the right has been gradual.  He's much worse now than he is when the TYT crowd were regulars.Rogan helped build all those guys' platforms.I don't agree. I'm not a huge fan of his podcast, I prefer his stand up, but he has a wide variety of guests on. Shane Smyth from Vice has been on many times, as has been Abby Martin. It's not a right wing echo chamber. I think they talked about how many downloads he gets, it's something like 10 million for some episodes? 

But I think that because he hosts a lot of those types of guests, he mostly draws in the young libertarian crowd already aligned with those views, not so much that  the majority of his listeners are converted after discovering his show. Hard to know for sure, though. 

Whenever he has someone like Milo on, I just skip the episode. But I still listen for comedians like Segura, etc. The vast majority guests that he talks to about politics are right wing.It'll always be easier for the right to infect media spaces because they have more money and funding than the left to create these type of figures. I would generally agree with you, but I would say he's not the sole reason, the left has been really weak for the past 8 years but I think we're seeing improvements that could help create figures that'll help shift these media spaces back to the left.I never said he is the sole reason.  But he's a big reason.Dave Rubin is a classic liberal. Just because he doesn’t believe in identity politics and big government doesn’t make him right wing. You’re mischaracterising him. Classical liberals are indistinguishable from libertarians. As of Sunday reports are still saying many containers are still on the docks, including much thats not aid but regular pre hurricane cargo, while more is arriving by sea. "Whats not happening is convoys of trucks moving aid" inland (BBC ). 
TV reports say there are truckers waiting for fuel and expecting a shipment "tomorrow" (Monday or Sunday?).  
  
  
Other reports say  the federal government is claiming a sizeable percentage of roads have already been cleared and some gas stations are operating.  
  
Far as I can tell, no communities are saying aid has reached any large number of people, not even in San Juan, close to the port. Afaik, theres been no reports of airdrops of aid, or deliveries by helicopter to the interior.  
  
The Sunday TV shows have been used largely to cast blame on local personnel for not "cooperating" with Washington: these local governments have been devastated by 2 hurricanes and over 10 days with no resources or even telephone communication.  
  

  He also called Cenk and the Young Turks liars when Ben Shapiro was on. 

I agree he is turning a lot far right. They think they are being open and intellectual when it's all pseudo-intellectual bullshit. I had a friend who is mostly liberal, but completely buys into the right-wing media machine and takes a lot of conservative positions. He would be open minded when he was shown things were basically Fox BS. He recently started watching Rogan on YouTube and is far right now. He has been sending me links to videos about how Jews run the world, and Hillary was in a cabal with them. He's gone, and it's largely from Rogan. Another friend who also got into Rogan was showing me similar links, but I don't know his stances as well.  Dave Rubin is a far right-winger, and saying you don't believe in identity politics is just a way to say you are accepting of racism. I don't think they showed his face, unless I missed it. Right Wing Mandela, Jimmy Durrr, and DNC Operative Seder, all great Majority Report Twitter accounts, should have been there as well.

This was better than I thought it would be.  Identity politics is racist. It judges people not on their own unique character and skills, but on the colour of their skin. It encourages racial segregation and division. It's pretty fucked up.  When I first started listening when I was in high school Rogan was supporting the Occupy Wall St. movement that was going on. If he talked about politics, and it wasn't too often it would be about actual issues.  Now it's just white male aggrievement about SJWs and college campuses.

That stuff is cancer.  It radicalizes ("red pills") young men. I wouldn't characterize Rogan's audience as being a bunch of Charlottesville Nazi rally goers, but he is the biggest sanitizer of alt right ideology online.You just called into MR I'm assumingI got you. Stream and/or DL can be found here:

[Danarchy's Fun Half Remix](https://hearthis.at/danarchy/funhalf/)	If the only identity you look at is race, and ignore all historical precedent, then yes. If you don't do that your statement is moronic. That actually wasn't me.  I was pretty happy to hear it though because I'm assuming it was someone who read this.  I hope Sam is able to get on the show through Maron.I was really happy to hear this call after posting about my concerns about Rogan a few days ago.  I really hope Sam gets on the show one day.  Idk if he'd be able to get through to Joe.  One of the last Rogan podcasts I listened to, he said Jordan Peterson was his favorite guest... of all time.So you think people should be treated differently because off the colour of their skin? Because to me, that makes you a racist. With such a big audience Joe could influence a lot of young voters... I would live to see Sam destroy him but I fear Joe wouldn't want to be challenged even though he likes to come across reasonableNo, that's not the definition of racism. You are a simplistic moron. Mar-a-lardoNice.  
  
You know you could always delete this and edit the title here and repost it. Copy in u/Martine_V s reply (and try copying its [permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/73zio8/200000_good_guys_with_guns/dnv2ky2/), idk if that gets deleted).  
  One, at least.  
  
A shockingly poor piece that fails on its own "logic". Its just some vehement, angry opinion "backed up" by several pieces of evidence, each of which actually points to the opposite of what the author wants to spin.   
About the only item where Stein with hindsight seems on less solid ground is her saying the Russia stuff is not proven, and guess what, back then that was true. It is still true technically: nothing has been proven in court, and back in July or whenever even less was "known" about the investigation. As that is confidential, whatever we "know" now is, strictly speaking, speculation.      
   
Did some people vote for Stein in close count areas? Yes. Would I have wanted them to vote Hillary? Yes. If Stein wasnt there would they have been Dem or Rep or any kind of voters? Dont know.  
  
And that author sure doesnt know, either. 
  
Rush, Breitbart, Rove or Jones would be proud of this standard of work.  
  

Guess how it went from illegal to legal?  It was misrepresented as an aid for the disabled. It was engineered from the get-go just to exploit a loophole in the law.  https://mic.com/articles/184982/bump-stocks-were-supposedly-made-for-disabled-people-thats-not-how-theyre-actually-being-used#.2Ul67w1zy    
  
  
  
  
Why is all this hype about this device just another fraud? Because its just another decoy to flood TV time instead of fixing the real problem, guns.  
  
  
Its pretty simple to test; which action would save more lives,   
  
  
1/ controlling bump stocks and ignoring guns? Or   
  
  
2/ keeping all bump stocks and destroying all guns and ammo?  
   
  
Its pretty obvious why 1/ not 2/ is the talking point of the NRA, voice of the gun producers.

_^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/livven/wiki/gifv-bot) ^// ^[code](https://github.com/Livven/GifvBot)_"The National" is the name of a major current affairs show in Canada.  So "The Rational National" I presume implies some kind of critic or pundit.  
  
  I agree with the title, haven't watched the vid yet.   
  
  
The economic disaster has forced so much of the population to leave the island that it reportedly altered the electoral balance of  parts of Florida from Rep to Dem in just the past 5 or 6 years.  
  
PR is essentially bankrupt due to decades of colonial policies imposed by the US. These policies have barred PR from the same bankruptcy protection a State could get.   
  
  
Like Flint, Michigan, PR is now ruled by an unelected Republican dominated board [PROMESA 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROMESA), whose prime purpose is to extract loan payments for the major hedge funds who vulture-style bought up otherwise near-worthless bonds. This has crippled PR's ability to do any spending, including proper disaster preparation or recovery.  
  
This added to decades of colonial financial rules has kept the economy in a steep decline.  
  
Incredibly, amid ongoing shortages, the US has already reactivated the Jones Act after a 10 day waiver supposedly to enable aid after hurricane Maria struck 20 days before. 10 days is too short to make much impact by ship. The Jones Act is intended to protect the ship industry and jobs and is a target of "Free Market" believers, but in this kind of crisis, it is blamed for delays.  
       
  
Even the unelected PROMESA board ruling PR has told the US government the disaster is beyond them, the population has fallen by over 10% already, the economy is shrinking by double digit figures and PR needs realistic levels of support to rebuild. These reality-changing numbers had to date from before hurricanes Irma and Maria, no doubt they are now even worse. 
    
  
&gt;... the U.S.-imposed control board, which has a majority of Republican members, sent a letter to Congress last week and to President Trump on Friday, specifically saying—and I want to quote from this letter, because, remember, this is now the U.S.-imposed control board, where, in this letter, it said, “Hurricanes Maria and Irma have fundamentally changed Puerto Rico’s reality.” The control board goes on to say that the island has not only a $74 billion debt and $53 billion of unfunded pension liabilities, that its economy has contracted by 15 percent in the last decade and lost—and the population has shrunk by 10 percent. But it says that it continues to have severe liquidity challenges and persistent budget deficits. So, even before the hurricane hit, the government was bankrupt, had no money.

&gt;And it goes on to say that “On top of [that], the damage that Puerto Rico has suffered is catastrophic and island-wide,” from this hurricane, and that Moody’s has estimated that this—that the hurricane did $95 billion in damages, one-and-a-half year of the total gross domestic product of the island. So this is a catastrophe on top of an existing total bankruptcy. And it says—and the board goes on to say this has never happened. And so it calls for all matching funds from the federal government for any kind of disaster relief to be waived. And it calls for massive help from the government.

I think it's just continuing the dumb trend of rhyming names like "Aggressive Progressive" and "Sane Progressive." Sane Progressive doesn’t rhyme. And David isn’t dumb. It’s a real shame everyone is just piling in him because Sam made an incorrect assumption about the channel when he found out he defended Jimmy on one issue.I listen live at work on the app. then I listen to at home on youtube after work.interesting show today.Last month:

&gt;  "The Rational National"  
  
  
To be sure, the name IMO is very cool, soon as I figured out the "The National" connection. First time I heard it, it was a creepy sensation; in a US context it sounds like a "Libertarian" expressing his inner Nazi.  
  
  Hey! I can hear The Rational National ! He's calling into the show!  
  
He's valiantly defending Jimmy Dore, whoever that is, against Sam.  
  
I hope TMR clips this for the youtube highlights for later.  
  
  
Is he a budding new regular caller?  :) 
   
  
  
  
PS, no need to tell me about Dore, I have heard of him via Sam and TMR, I intend to give his show a listen first chance I get.  
https://www.wbai.org/archive.php &gt; Tue, 7:00pm Jimmy Dore Show  
  
  Jimmy dore rules! Dave Rubin had the best YouTube channel! Fuck you all! ~~~ Classic Liberal Senator CollinsI don't really know how to articulate this well but I'll try...

There's no doubt Sam cares about Jimmy Dore. But I think what people like "The Rational National" fail to understand is that Sam doesn't care about YouTube wars or YouTube collaborations. MR is first and foremost a podcast even if many people primarily know it from YouTube.

In the progressive YouTube world, there's an obsession with Joy Ann Reid. That's fine. It gets clicks. It generates revenue. She's not a good person. But what happens is that people freak out that Sam isn't obsessed with her. People freak out that Sam is attacking a popular progressive YouTuber [Dore] who many look up to [sadly]. They can't understand why Sam doesn't calm down and "get along" since "they share so many of the same positions." Sam's not in that world though. He's a podcaster and much older than most of these other people besides Dore. Again I can't articulate it well but there's a disconnect there that guys like Rational National don't understand.

That, and of course the fact that Dore is full of shit and Sam is intelligent.I think that sums it up pretty well. Dore represents mindless anger (though it seems to come from a good place) and he makes a profit accomplishing absolutely nothing. Sam is looking to educate and inform his viewers/listeners as to the intricacies of problems and what you can do to help fix them. People who watch Jimmy Dore are mad about these problems but don't want to do a damn thing to learn about or fix them. Yes, Hillary Clinton is bad, but do you honestly think that if Trump is elected that he won't wreck this country and get a lot of Americans killed in the process? Dore fans need to grow the fuck up. And if you want to be down with bad boy, then fuck you too!got a timestamp? i need to hear this.https://youtu.be/7VpSlLHCBj4 The call starts 2 hours and 20 minutes in. We all heard this argument back with Tom Perez and we'll hear it again in 2018. It's bullshit and we all know itI like David, I support him on Patreon and I think he’s a good guy - but he’s just not hearing what Sam is saying. You can say “let’s unite” all you want, but Sam is fundamentally opposed to someone who doesn’t understand basic functions of government and politics spouting off potentially harmful rhetoric as if they know what they’re talking about. 

Also, it’s pretty clear Jimmy is the one who shut down the conversation by not bringing Sam on his show. He just wants people on who confirm his viewpoints and make him look like he’s right about everything. I still enjoy some of Jimmy’s videos and I think he’s a funny dude, but calling on Sam to unite with someone who is misleading his audience is unfair and unrealistic in my opinion.There's a lot of things we agree with Joy Reid on. Why aren't we uniting with her? We agreed a lot with Hillary yet some of these YouTubers said Trump was preferable.

Beyond sick of some of these YouTubers. Thankful we have MR to keep me sane.Thx, I used yr link to re-listen to Doel /The Rational National call.  
  
  
Sounds like Sam is upset at Jimmy Dore because he wants this debate and Dore while publicly saying yes, isnt returning calls. TNR seems like trying to reconcile 2 similar policy views that he likes.   
  

  
I am like, kudos to TNR, first because he called in to TMR show and also it brought out a bit more clearly what the Sam /Jimmy issue is.  To me, this was a very successful call.  
  
I want to hear more from TNR, I think he should become a regular caller.  
  
The substance of it I hope to get into later.  
  
One thing I am concerned about is the tone that is taken when Dore fans participate. I would take care to not give appearance of animosity to them. If they sound agitated, it could be that JD has been their only opinion maker and they feel defensive. They should become valuable allies as their awareness increases and they see this as debate, a learning experience, not some kind of feud. Solidarity and unity of purpose are just about the most critical things in these times.  
  
  
  

&gt; obsession with Joy Ann Reid  
  
Thanks for that bit, I wasnt aware JAR was at the "obsession" level.   
  
  
I dont get concerned if "people freak out" for Dore. Far as I can tell, much of his audience is in early stages of awareness, they may learn more with time. I try not to take some things personally, this is all about a debate with JD, not a feud with less-informed fans. As they grow in awareness, hopefully they may learn that  solidarity and unity matter.  
    
 
  

"we all get things wrong" he lost me there.Sam Seder is stuuuupidNeat opinion, buddy. Care to elaborate? These people wanted to tell people trump and Hillary are the same because when Hillary wins they could say, 

"I was always to the left of her, you told your fans to vote for her and look shes negotiating with congress!  Shes basically a Republican.  Unlike them we are the real progressives, you should listen to us not them they support the establishment."

But she lost.  Now we get a reminder of what Republicans are really like and they aren't the same. 
 So now they want "unity".

It's basically the same thing where Alex Jones, probably voted for Obama because he knew Romney would be bad for revenue.Jimmy Cliff starred in and composed the soundtrack for one of my favorite films,  *Club Paradise*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yC_UEnp4Nc&amp;list=PLZ3JSpspBBlsRzQ5S3Lqhhyc_ptYhoSHh

https://majority.fm/majority-report-surveys/Wow the comments on this are great.

I think unfortunately Sam did interrupt David *a lot* in this, and I understand why, but it doesn't come off well to the tonnes of people that will watch this because of the topic. 

People seem to just blank out the part where Sam explains why what Jimmy has done/is doing can have real, long term consequences for the country, and just see it as a beef based on who has more subscribers. Pretty frustrating.Sam was far too outraged by Jimmy Dore's existence. Jimmy serves an important function as essentially being the far left acceptable boundary for me, similar to how Sam serves as my rightmost boundary. Anyone in the Seder-Dore range is acceptable to me. As stated in the video, I think there is some validity to the idea that Jimmy attracts some people who would otherwise stumble into the Alex Jones madness. Jimmy isn't always right on everything, he's not a political scientist, but I'm pretty sure his audience (myself being a part of it) understands when he is wrong. I guess I would say that if someone is ONLY watching Jimmy Dore, that's a problem, but hardly anyone is. Most people I talk to who watch his show also watch Secular Talk and TYT Politics at the very least. Many also watch TYT, Sam's show, David Pakman's show and any number of others.Jimmy saying "I think every other issue combined is more important than the Supreme Court", wether or not you agree with him, is not anywhere near as dangerous as Sam is acting like it is. Obviously things would be better with Garland instead of Gorsuch, but things would still be far from awesome. Also, it's not like Jimmy swung the election. His videos get like 40k views, and most of them are from people in deep blue states. Plus, most people aren't JUST watching him. As stated in the video, there is overlap between the two audiences. I also know from being in various comment sections that many Jimmy Dore fans also watch Secular Talk and TYT Politics, and the TYT main show to a lesser extent.

I really just find it bizarre that Sam would take 17 minutes of his show to attack a progressive YouTuber is a very heated exchange with a called, yet a comparable video of him taking down any corporate media pundit with millions more viewers than Dore is nonexistent.Chart:

[this is a good place to start](https://youtu.be/SH_pgiRdm7U)sounds familiar.. was it Marcy Wheeler? (#1680 on 19 september) https://imgur.com/0WhQAWu"Who's Jimmy Cliff?" made me feel oh so very old. Sam has explained time and time again why he singles out Jimmy. And as far as "every other issue combined", that's a dumb argument. What about everyone else harmed under Trump's administration that wouldn't be under Hillary's? Jimmy voted for Jill Stein, but Hillary lost because she is a neoliberal, corporatist war hawk, and Trump was smart enough to speak a populist language to the millions of people who have been let down by the political establishment that Hillary embodies right down to her pinky toe. Obviously.Hillary lost because nobody trusted her or thought she'd do right by them. Part of this was justified, but a good portion was due to a decades long smear campaign. And if you think Trump will be more of an economic populist or less of a war hawk than Hillary, you're a fucking moron. Kindly read it again. I wrote "spoke a populist language", not "had a genuine populist platform". If Bernie had run with his left-populist platform that was both rhetoric and genuine then Bernie would have trounced Trump, that goes without saying.Yeah, and the point that I'm trying to make is that Jimmy Dore said Trump wouldn't be as bad as Hillary or that they'd both be equally bad. That's dumb. Obama or Hillary were/would have been a pretty face on neoliberal capitalism. Trump is an ugly face on neoliberal capitalism. It is the face it deserves, its true and honest face.

We are most definitely getting somewhere with the clown Trump in charge, whereas with Hillary we'd be getting mostly the same policies as under Trump (Trump has for the most part ensured policy continuity with Obama's neoliberal, establishment-cozy reign) or even getting worse policies from Hillary (ground troops in Syria etc.)

James is right: we currently are where we need to be, and he predicted all of this.Totally dude. Although I'm not sure about that broad running for the Mass. state Senate. Wahren is bad enough.Accelerationism is the most privileged ideology out there. It's all fine and dandy to say we're getting somewhere when you aren't trying to raise kids and your food stamps get cut or you don't have cancer and you can't afford health insurance anymore. You have the opinion you have because you've never had to deal with the consequences of your vote.doooooode, that broad Pocahontas kicked out Scotty B!

&gt; Story highlightsThe Washington Post published a bombshell report Thursday on Roy Moore.

&gt; NRSC chairman, Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, said in a statement Thursday following the release of the story, &amp;quot;If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election."

&gt; &amp;quot;The Moore campaign never asked if they could use Sen. Lee&amp;#039;s image, and when we were alerted that they were we asked them to stop,&amp;quot; Lee&amp;#039;s spokesperson Conn Carroll told CNN. After The Washington Post article published, Moore sent out a fundraising pitch that included a photo of him with Lee, as well as GOP Sens.

Russia-Russia-Russia only implicates Trump and his band of idiots. That's fine; hopefully if there are serious crimes found then people can be sentenced to serious punishment. But we have to fight the Republicans too, and Russia-Russia-Russia only helps that insomuch as it makes it very difficult for Republicans to get things done and makes it really easy for Schumer/Pelosu/Reid to keep everyone from breaking ranks in their opposition to the Republicans.I understand the skepticism involved in the Russia investigation towards the beginning of the year, but at this point? You'd have to be Dumb-Dumb not see there is indeed something there, possibly all the way to Donald Trump.
Democrats need to appeal to voters for some other reason than Trump being a Russia stooge (rapist narcissist bully clown fascist).

They need a positive reason for people to vote FOR them, not just against Republicans. The Russia thing is a big deal, but in terms of leftist politics, it is just a noisy distraction that leave it open for the Democrats to push more centrist corporate sold out candidates, because* Trump is so bad anybody we run can win* or *Trump's treason is so dangerous we can't risk losing with electorately popular  but not corporately marketable fresh blood candidates*.

So many people refuse to see that Hillarys problem in 2016 was she tried to run against Trump rather than on her own merits. You could see it in the debates when she kept referring to hillaryclinton.com for technical answers about policy and then going back to talking about how deplorable Trump is. And it didn't work.

The Russia story is just more ammo for running *against Trump*. Yes, it's a big deal, but it's shouldn't be informing or shaping debate inside the Democratic party.they are long time friends, and used to work at air america together, probably hard to believe.  That doesn't excuse the victim blaming and whataboutism. At one point she literally said, "What about the gun violence and how it's terrorism when it's a brown person"? What the fuck does that have to do with this? It was disgusting. So it's Majority Report's position that sex abuse and harassment only matters when it's a Republican?Damn, I just tuned in and not than a minute in Jeanine mutters "I dont believe it".  Not off to a good start here...  

What is there to defend?  Al Franken apologized for his actions and said he believes the accuser? 

I say let the hammer fall - stop defending predators.   The whole show is a trainwreck. I feel uncomfortable for everyone in studio except Janeane. I don't blame anyone at MR. It was a terrible day to have her on but they couldn't have known the Franken story was going to break. They also couldn't have known Janeane would handle it so poorly.

Now she's going after Jamie for making a face about Hillary and saying "I guess you don't support women." Horrible, horrible trainwreck of a show.Janeane has now walked outI do feel like on the left we throw people under the bus in an instant, and the right forgives them all through Jebus.  She is free to have her own opinions.  I remember Jon Stewart having a segment in defense of Weiner before more stuff came out.  Sounds like he took a stupid picture when someone was asleep.  If he touched her that is wrong, if he didn't, its pretty immature, but they had been working together and such, depends on the relationship. The tongue thing sounds bad, but apparently they were practicing a kiss?  Depends on how the skit was supposed to go.  

To me she is right to complain about the photo, but like OJ I'm willing to just wait for all the evidence, and if there is a pattern of behavior. 

I once had a sleeping woman fall face first into my groin on a bus, and also been yelled at by a woman for thrusting my groin in her face on a bus (someone pushed past behind me, it wasn't at all sexual, depending on what the guy behind me was up to).  Just saying one off accidents or bad decisions happen.  He has said sorry, she has said she has accepted, will see if other things happen.   While I do think your response is problematic because the fundamental issue is Franken completely ignoring her boundaries and bodily autonomy, *this* response would still have been far better than the discussion on the show. You at least acknowledged it's wrong and discussed it directly instead of trying obfuscate and hide from it.

Like I said, guys like Franken or Moore or Louis CK who don't respect bodily autonomy and consent of others are never one-off offenders. There will be more. I mean, it's their show. They chose to let her get away with all the garbage she was spewing. They could have stepped up and called her out for victim blaming and obfuscating and they chose not to. I don't think Janeane is the defacto MR position maker?  Guess we will see if this was a one off error, or a pattern of mistakes.  &gt; Like I said, guys like Franken or Moore or Louis CK who don't respect bodily autonomy and consent of others are never one-off offenders.

This is a demonstrably false claim, provided without evidence. Also, equating the accusations against Roy Moore, Louis CK, and Al Franken is unreasonable. These are complicated, nuanced, and *extremely* varied transgressions of 'bodily autonomy' and lumping them all together is problematic, to say the least. Janeane really handled the situation terribly. The MR crew could have tried harder to address her problematic attitude.  Jamie did.   

And Janeane kept on interrupting people and not letting them finish.  Really not cool.No, it isn't. And yes, they are directly comparable in the context of men not respecting the consent of others. What he did was not as bad, but the reason he did it is the same: he didn't care about his victim's consent.What the hell was the deal with Janene's defense or whatever it was of Ayn Rand???&gt; No, it isn't.

Please, don't make ridiculous claims like this. [Here] (http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/RepeatRapeinUndetectedRapists.pdf) is one famous study on 'Repeated Rape in Undetected Cases' that concluded

&gt; Of the 120 rapists, 76 (63.3%) reported committing repeat rapes, either against multiple victims, or more than once against the same victim.

Meaning I just 'demonstrated' your claim that 'guys like Franken or Moore or Louis CK who don't respect bodily autonomy and consent of others are never one-off offenders' is false. 

This is one example study of thousands done on this very issue. Your claim is patently bullshit and you should stop making hyperbolic, nonsensical claims if you are actually interested in pursuing the truth. That, too, was unacceptable. What? *That* is what you got out of my reply? You've just conclusively proven that my obvious speculation is mere speculation? That's the least important part of anything I have said in this thread.&gt; That's the least important part of anything I have said in this thread.

You argued, based on a demonstrably false claim, that 'there will be more' allegations against Franken because you wrongly believe that there are 'never one-off offenders'. 

In other words, you are making judgements while considering imagined, additional acts of sexual misconduct that are the product of a flawed ideology (that *all* abusers are repeat abusers) you believe in the face of contradictory evidence. 

&gt; You've just conclusively proven that my obvious speculation is mere speculation?

How is claiming (twice, mind you) 'guys like Franken or Moore or Louis CK who don't respect bodily autonomy and consent of others **are never one-off offenders**' *mere speculation*? That is a statement of fact that is wrong. 


This is so bizarre.The way today's show went down was miserable.  Feel so disappointed.  Janeane was totally out of line.   I mean, feel free to just not respond then. Well lets not lump the whole MR crew into this. Sam looked visibly uncomfortable the whole time, Jamie was criticizing Janeane's position even though Janeane would not let her get her point out and Michael was taking pretty funny pot shots at Janeane's expense. Lets all agree that Janeane is like that crazy aunt you have to spend Thanksgiving with.Jamie did a good job considering, especially since she is new to the crew. But the rest of them pretty much gave her a pass or speculated about the motives of the accuser. It was bad, really bad. I was super disappointed in them. This is Sam's show and yet he didn't have any problem with Janeane baselessly speculating about how the victim was just lying.She's a longtime friend and a once-a-year guest. There was no need to start a huge argument. I think all of us viewers knew everyone was uncomfortable and disagreed with her.Were you watching the video feed, Sam looked uncomfortable as fuck. To put this into context, Janeane left the show because Sam went  hard on her in regard to a stance she had with a Scientology non-profit org, she couldnt take the pressure of his grilling. I suspect he didnt want to make her melt down on air ( as shes done countless times), he  didnt want to embarrass her. I suspect he felt like he was in a rock and a hard place, not wanting to embarrass his friend live on air whilst also viewing her stance and her aggressiveness with Jamie as problematic.Its also why Sam kept reading IMs that disagreed with Janeane's views, he was trying to gently deal with the situation. Michael was also making fun of Janeane, the gloves were starting to come off. Michael even stated "lets get into it then" when she was talking about the guy in the army mischaracterizing her but I think Sam was trying to avoid a huge debacle on air.Well hopefully they'll address it.I agree, I think it would be the right thing to do.&gt; It's really disheartening to see that people care a lot about lip service but don't really mean what they say.

Except Jeanine never really has been a huge advocate against sexual assault. She's very clearly a liberal with much less leftist views about it. She's very much off the politics nowadays, she says so every time she is on.

It's incredibly to me that what Jeanine says is somehow implicating the rest of the crew. They have a show to do, they can't just lecture her about this for an hour. We can acknowledge this as problematic after the fact. If my coworker said the same thing, I'm not going to give him a speech about it, but I will remember it and try to find ways to communicate why he is wrong in the future without compromising my friendship with him. 

It's really not as big of a deal as you make it out to be, but I imagine this isn't going to stop you from calling it and shaming Sam into giving you 30 minutes of the show so you can complain about it. Looking forward to fast-forwarding through that bore-fest.October Revolution 100 years since 1917

You sadden me. I really would have thought this would be a bigger deal to MR listeners but it doesn't seem to be. If they got a tenth of the hate for covering for Franken because he's a Democrat as I've gotten for pointing it out, maybe we wouldn't need the #MeToo movement.No one on the Majority Report crew covered for Franken just because they didn't challenge Jeanine as much as you would have liked. I think their objections were good enough to give the listener the full spectrum of views, I guess that makes me a bad person now. 

If you didn't say such blatant outright lies and tried defaming the crew a bit less maybe more people would be willing to engage with you.It's their show, not Jeanines. Don't pretend they have no autonomy. A picture of Franken groping a sleeping woman came out and they talked about the war in Afghanistan and guns. Exactly the same way when Trump does something reprehensible Fox News talks about Uranium.Franken wasn't groping her, he was pretending to grope her. If this was a pattern of sexual assault from Franken that they were letting Jeanine shove off I would be more miffed, but as it stands the issue is not the same as Moore or Uranium. 

It's complicated, I don't want to oversimplify and villify the crew because of this one episode.I thought the discussion was actually very illuminating. Just because Jeanine's argument was typically right-wing, doesn't mean that it isn't an argument that we're allowed to have. I think this is a problem with leftists, as soon as you try bringing up these questions that regular, normal people have about these issues, if you don't shut them down other leftists accuse you of this and that.

I think the discussion about how these accussations take up media space and how it's a way for people to take back power when they're powerless are perfectly harmless to have and they're important discussions to have from a leftist perspective, because otherwise you just end up with right wingers discussing it and that's how the public sees the issue. Without Jeanine there it would've just been the same conversation we've had before, but with Jeanine there it's got people thinking about these issues in a different way, and in a perspective that other people may have that aren't in leftist spaces.I caught myself making excuses for Franken, too. "What he did wasn't as bad", "This is just to distract from Moore", etc. 

Sexual assault is sexual assault. Plain and simple. It was easy to pile on when Republicans were the ones assaulting, but after the news with Franken, it was a real wake-up call for me.

We can hate on Republicans because their policies are horrible and promote human suffering in every way, but we can't make excuses for Democrats when they get accused of sexual assault.I thought Jaime took Jeanine to task as best she could.&gt;The Democrats should have screamed and screamed for a year about the Garland nomination.

The fuck?  Do they have to self immolate to get your attention?  This is some dumb shit.I mean, he was grabbing the breasts of an unconscious woman.I couldn't disagree more. I don't see *any* value in suggesting that this is unimportant because she's not more upset about America's endless war in Afghanistan or gun violence. That's complete bullshit deflection.

It's also completely and 100% disingenuous too because the *very next segment* was them spend 20 minutes talking about the accusations against Moore. Why would *that* be permitted on Majority Report but discussion of Franken is just distracting from bigger issues? Could it be because one is a Republican and the other is a Democrat?He wasn't grabbing them, he was hovering over them. Not the same thing.It certainly looked like he was touching them to me. The victim seems to believe he groped her. And why not? She's asleep and Franken has made it clear he doesn't respect her bodily autonomy. Why wouldn't he cop a feel?

I wonder if you'd defend the guy so veraciously if it were your sister or your daughter.Franken has never said he doesn't respect bodily autonomy, and unless other women come out, there is zero evidence that this is a pattern of behavior on Franken's part that indicates that.

I'm not defending the guy, I'm literally just stating facts while you're trying to distort the truth to fit your narrative. Nothing I've said was false, but you've said multiple false statements, I wonder if you'd be so willing to distort the evidence if you were the one being accussed.It was weird how the show was about thanksgiving survival and the show was like thanksgiving dinner.  Sam had that look like I do when my uncle starts talking about crime, IQ and the races of America.  

Jeanine I think is going through some shit.  That was weird as hell.  I think she was close to Franken.  Sam should have stopped the show and continued without her.Dude, you are literally - LITERALLY - defending him right now. This is what rape culture looks like. You are doing rape culture right now.

No one comes out and says, "I do not respect female bodily autonomy", you dingus. He demonstrated it by forcing his tongue down her throat. He demonstrated it with that photograph. Or do you think that's okay? Do you think it's okay to grope or pretend to grope the breasts of a sleeping woman? I'd say one could only do that if they don't respect the autonomy of the woman. I'd say someone who would leave that photo on her camera wanted her to feel humiliated. 

God, this whole thing makes me sick to my stomach. It just makes me sick to see so many people I thought I'd identify with do the exact shit they make fun of right wingers for doing when it's someone they like. What Franken did was wrong. He shouldn't be defended, the charges shouldn't be mitigated. He should be out of the senate and out of public life. Men can't just keep getting away with this stuff. But they will as long as we all continue to turn a blind eye.Please link me the tweets from Michael or Sam where he makes it clear that he does not agree with Jeanine. Because I can link you a half dozen of them making fun of Moore. Lets just take a deep breath. Here are the facts: Franken has admitted to hovering over her breasts in a honking motion ( probably due to the fact there was evidence, he prob wouldn't if there was no photo). He has however denied the tongue punching of her throat, with a vague statement that " that's not how he remembered it". I think most leftists that watch the show want to see this investigated in more detail, and as for the dem partisan, fuck em. Now the show was a delicate situation, I think Janeane is going through a rough time ( recently split with her long time partner) and seems to be more loony than usual ( personally i was never fond of her). Now Sam looked super uncomfortable, Jamie was pushing the situation, Matt claimed his mic wasnt working in the Youtube chat and Michael was making jokes at Janeane's expense, it was a mess. Frankly Janeane deserved what she got and we shouldn't have to be super careful as an audience about her feelings, that being said I can understand if Sam didn't want his show to become a spectacle. Now some of what has been said from others has been "problematic" but you have been making very sweeping statements and have been somewhat aggressive. I get that this is a sensitive topic, ppl very close to me have experienced sexual violence and harrassment but lets give this a chance to all play out.  Frankly I'm talking to you bigDean because i prob agree with you more than Luis ( although he could just be sick of how your coming off) and I think we need to let this run its full course. Don't worry, the majority of youtube comments were in opposition to what Janeane said, in fact MR unlisted the video
Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CayGZ9z1lQ8&amp;lc=z23pjp3zyyn1hhaupacdp430wv2so3ozjy0b5hnkjr1w03c010c.1510882895253246Because Moore was preying on teenagers, and there was a pattern of sexual abuse and assault. Franken hovered his hands over a woman's breasts as a joke. They're clearly not the same thing in intensity or seriousness. Not every sexual abuse accusation needs to blow up the world, she herself even accepted the apology very quickly. 

We as leftists need to be more serious about how we approach these issues. I don't think it's very serious to pretend like Moore and Franken did the same thing, they're clearly different and the approaches to them will be different. And it's okay to discuss the priorities of different types of sexual assault, that's I think the heart of what Jeanine was saying, but I may be putting words in her mouth.I know where she's coming from. There are so many things we need to make progress on. I hate spending time on this. I want everyone to just not be rapey. It seems like it shouldn't be too much to ask. Jesus, Al, WTF.The more you keep talking about Hillary, the more you start defending Trump and making him out to be a victim. These people are not progressive, they just hate Hillary. Big difference. Well not sure if you watched it today but don’t expect high marks to make up for yesterday. I was even more disappointed with the start of today really. It seemed like it was, we both went through some shit in the past so don’t be too hard and it’s ok.I did see that. It was horrible. He made it about Jeaneane instead of who it is actually about, which is Leeanna Tweed. He completely skipped over what Franken did. He didn't seem to understand why people criticized them at all. I don't know if I can continue being a member after this shit.I get that there are other huge issues in the world. Yemen is an issues but we can talk about and think about at the same time. Nothing is mutually exclusive.

This is a big issue which needs coverage. It doesn’t help she immediately said a hot take to start. Even Sam was caught off guard and sighed when you go back and listen/watch.  

I wish he talked about the whataboutism but whatever...people aren’t perfect.  Those don't sound equivalent at all.... I feel like the left has a hard time saying that not all sexual assault is equal... Like making a joke isn't the same as preying on children, is that so hard to understand?He groped her tits while she was sleeping and couldn't say no. What a funny joke. What a great jokester.I think you're intentionally missing the point. Consent is consent. Sure, I guess groping someone in their sleep is a different magnitude of wrong than making someone watch you jerk off into a ficus, but it is that really the discussion we need to have? "We're better than you. Our sexual deviant only gropes women in their sleep!" Come on. You have to be smarter than that.It's a discussion we need to have or at least acknowledge, or else people will think we're insane, for thinking joking about sexual assault is the same as actual sexual assault. Just because consent is binary, sexual assault is in degrees and if you don't acknowledge that, you're not being smart.Stop saying joking. If he groped her, he groped her. If he forced his tongue in her mouth, he forced his tongue in her mouth. That's not a joke. He didn't grope her, he put his hands close to her breasts in the groping position. Stop saying groped her when he picture doesn't show him groping her. He also didn't force his tongue into her mouth, he allegedly forced his tongue into her mouth.

It's frustrating to me that fellow leftists think they can determine what are or aren't jokes. It can't just be that a joke is in bad taste, or the joke is problematic, it's literally that the joke can't exist. That's insane to me and insane to the average person, IMO.I said if he groped her, but I'm done. You're not worth all this effort.Please call in and tell them this.Hope Janeane is okay.  She wasn't wearing her wig on it.He, uh, didn’t touch her breasts. Look at it again. You can clearly see he’s not touching the woman. Heck, even trump who has all the reason in the world to see him groping the woman, tweeted that he wasn’t touching her in the photo. I think sam wanted to be respectful of Jeanine as a guest. I think for Jeanine it was hard because al is such a good friend of hers. Jeanine’s view of the matter was tone deaf and offensive but it isn’t sam’s place to make the show combative. Doesn't explain his continued tone deafness on Friday. He could have addressed it and he dodged it again.I'm starting to think this Door fellow is as dumb as one. Wasn’t making an equivalency in action. I was looking at the response the community has and how we are all dividing. I looked, as a member of multiple fandoms, to the most applicable metaphor for how I felt about the MR viewership in the aftermath of JG’s episode. I meant no false equivalency, and I would appreciate it if you didn’t imply otherwise. &gt; Because Moore was preying on teenagers, and there was a pattern of sexual abuse and assault. 

Of course, but "Bigger than Franken"  doesn't take us to "Bigger than Yemen and Syria", right?  Which is actually the point.  

&gt; And it's okay to discuss the priorities of different types of sexual assault, that's I think the heart of what Jeanine was saying, but I may be putting words in her mouth.

I told you. These assholes never do it just once.As David said, this isn't very surprising. He has always struck me as more of a Sam Seder type.i sorta know what you mean. i do like her hyperbolic, kinda manic attitude though and she can be pretty funny.  Maybe a bit to long tho. She's also kind of rude and pointless. I thoight it was funny at first now mostly annoyingAccurately referring to Barron Trump a retard won my eternal support for Mindy, but her rich liberal viewpoint is kinda boring.I'm not sure about subscription services, but if you follow Verso Books they have great sales and free books extremely regularly. I work are Whole Foods. I hear tons of Mindy takes all the time. They are all basically clueless, entitled, dipshits. They got all stirred up after Trump got elected and now they keep themselves busy being socialites so they don’t have to think about what is happening to people less fortunate than themselves. They won’t join any indivisible groups because they don’t want to be viewed as radicals. Yes, or at least let Sam jump in when he’s already gone on for a while with a bit. It’s like he doesn’t realize it isn’t his show. Sam let’s him do pretty much 90% of what he wants, and even then when Sam tries to jump in Michael does the snippy-loud talking thing to try to drown Sam out. Sam has good instincts about when a bit is getting tired and Michael should learn from that. She’s a little boring sometimes but so are others sometimes. I’d prefer less mindy and more Ray Gun. But callers form part of the content that I, generally, enjoy...so whateverMichael’s impressions keep the show from being too dry, sometimes a little overboard but I take the good with the bad This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://qz.com/1114690/why-is-net-neutrality-important-look-to-portugal-and-spain-to-understand/) reduced by 84%.

&gt; The principle of net neutrality is simple: companies that connect you to the internet must treat all content equally.

&gt; In the US, this policy was enshrined in the Open Internet Order in 2015, when the Federal Communications Commission passed its strongest net neutrality policies to date.

&gt; &amp;quot;My concern is that, by imposing those heavy-handed economic regulations on internet service providers big and small, we could end up disincentivizing companies from wanting to build out internet access to a lot of parts of the country, in low-income, urban and rural areas,&amp;quot; he said.

I just wish he wouldn't let them drag on and on. There's only ever been a handful of shows were I really felt Michael needed to just stop with the impressions.Hey look, two more accusations against Franken.After Mindy posted this https://twitter.com/maydaymindy9/status/930269336211742720 a few days after professing live on the show that she wanted to personally murder the president and first lady, I politely said that maybe these weren't personally healthy things to do. She ranted incoherently with me for a few minutes before blocking me like a child. 

Doesn't have anything to do with the quality of her calls (which are bad imo), but it does say something about the quality of person.I'm not going to be able to explain this very well, but this is something I've been thinking about and trying for a while. Discuss politics in a way they probably never have. Talk about politics without sounding like you're talking politics. Don't use talking points they've heard on tv, don't even use vocabulary that we usually use when talking politics. Don't talk to them like children, talk to them like they are smart people that just know absolutley nothing about politics. It's tough to think of good examples outside of a real discussion, but I was having a productive discussion with my father, who thinks he's a conservative, about cars. We know there are people that don't have cars and need one or are driving clunkers, and we know that there are hundreds of thousands of cars sitting on lots for extended periods of time as well as massive factories churning out new ones every day, so where is the disparity? Why does it make sense to have our citizens wasting their (potentially productive) time and energy dealing with the hassle of not having a vehicle or taking several different buses when we have the cars to satisfy those needs just sitting around?
Another helpful tool that Sam discusses sometimes and Stephanie Kelton has discussed on the show is modern monetary theory, because you will eventually be asked 'but how will we afford it?' when you bring up something like medicare for all. It's nice to be able to explain the finer points of "if it's physically possible, we can afford it"Is this remotely worth watching?  Is the video just going to be like "yeah, Dems suck so Jimmy wins for saying that Dems suck and we may as well elect Trump"?&gt;Don't take my childs healthealthcare away!

"Woooh there Pol Pot I didn't know this was a radical group."I’m telling you the wealthy socialites that shop at Whole Foods would consider joining a group like that embarrassing. I often find that many Republicans just refuses to accept any policy that isn’t a libertarian free market concept. I can prove to my father in every way measurable that single payer is cheaper for both himself and society as a whole, but that doesn’t matter because anything resulting in an increase in government control is bad. I honestly just don’t know how to deal with some who thinks so illogically.I don't think mods come in here anymore. I think we can petition the admins to get some news mods but the subreddit is too small

Discussion for the shows occurs on the YouTube page. The comments are slow enough that you can some decent discussion going.

There's a Discord that has at least one person saying something every day, but it's also kind of small. All the hip, tech savvy people are on The Michael Brook's Show's Discord though. Majority Report seems like its mostly for older folk who don't really use Reddit.The reddit is pretty slow I don't see why it would really need moderation.&gt;doesn’t matter because anything resulting in an increase in government control is bad.

You need to ask why.  You can't use facts to convince somebody.  My guess is they are probably fine with military spending too.  They probably think the government's role is to defend liberty.  Thats why they are okay with all sorts of authoritarian crap if its defending their freedom.  So if your arguing from social justice or eqaulitu frame you should switch to one about liberty.

Thats badically how social democracy is justified.  It makes sure that not only have negative rights like freedom of speech but also positive rights like healthcare so you can use it.

Like if my boss tells me to do some gangster shit at work and my sick child is on the company's healthcare I'm not really free to do the moral thing amd report it.  The right dosen't want us to have these freedoms because they want us all servil so the extremly wealthy can dominate us.No one reads this sub. No one ever moderates this sub.

Hi.  I'm new to this sub as of today, but it was THIS video which drove me to find some place to speak out.

I'm so pissed off that *maybe* there's any of Sam's sponsors who might be swayed by this obvious fraud of a "scandal".

THERE IS "GOOD NEWS" ABOUT THIS HOWEVER.

If the right considered The Majority Report enough of a threat to go out of their way to do this, that speaks to how much they fear Sam Seder!

I'm not joking.   I know this is a "no lose" for the right wing and they have lots of resources and dedicated people on their side HOWEVER, if Sam Seder was a real "nothingburger", they wouldn't waste their time on him...Oh, for pete's sake, thanks.

But is this "the chat room" which Sam mentions while on the show?

Pardon me: I'm an older guy and not "up" with all the social media stuff.  Nazis will attack anyone who isn't a nazi (duh!). Show some progressive balls and welcome their advance, Sam.You're not a progressive, you just whine about Bernie all the time. You post on "enough sanders spam", for god's sake. You'll get nowhere on this sub.Somewhat relevant in terms of past discussions on this sub, such as:

**"Sam Seder Prefers To Criticize Jimmy Dore Instead Of Joy Reid"**
https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/6i5f2u/sam_seder_prefers_to_criticize_jimmy_dore_instead/

**"Joy Ann Reid Equates Calls for Pelosi's Resignation with Birtherism and Sexism"**
https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/6lltid/joy_ann_reid_equates_calls_for_pelosis/

Why do you think the Jimmy Dore critiques are relevant to this? Like commenters in those said, Reid is a liberal who has bad takes, but she responds to political pressure and power. Dore is a moron who has no idea how politics actually works, and he's much more effective at deradicalizing people to stay at home than Reid, certainly.&gt; she responds to political pressure and power. 

By which you mean that she just makes an excessively large salary at MSNBC. 


And what do you say to her self-serving instrumentalization of homophobia?Go right ahead and try to unearth any evidence - anything whatsoever - that Jimmy Dore has ever thrown the gays under the bus for the benefit of his own career.Fellow members and watchers, let's get some pep in those steps people! Is this the Majority Report or the silent Majority Report. Get active people. We have a revolution to wage to rid ourselves from the manacles of wage slavery. You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win. But, I mean, keep things in perspective. One step at a time. Pragmatism. Ya, that's the joke in the second part of my post. We socialist, but are pragmatic about it. Was voting for Trump going to eliminate wage slavery? I don’t fucking think so.Who cares about joy Reid? Jimmy Dore is directly relevant to the show because he was on and failed so hard he still won’t come on MR. &gt; Who cares about joy Reid?

So you're completely fine with a self-serving, duplicitous homophobe wielding this much influence and media power in the mainstream? This teaches us something about you.

&gt;  Jimmy Dore is directly relevant to the show because he was on and failed so hard he still won’t come on MR.

Even if that were true, it would mean that Dore matters less, not matters more. Why would anyone become "more relevant" after the discussion has already been had? Clearly this makes them less relevant and the sensible thing would be to move on to other polemical opponents (of which there is most certainly no shortage in the world, or even just on Youtube).

If you would only debate people you think you can beat (in your own warped definition of "beating") then this actually suggests that you are not a good debater, and that you have no faith or confidence in your own debating skills.I can't reliably tell which part is the joke so, with respect, I think it's safest to delete. :) My bad!Er, what do you think would be happening to wages under President Hillary? She is a **NEOLIBERAL** and Congress would still be exactly as Republican-controlled as it is now.

She would have passed the Trans-Pacific Partnership with extreme haste, causing more factories to depart and increasing the downward spiral in global wage competition.

She would already have cut a dozen deals with Republicans in congress: deals which would be erasing various worker protections in the margins of them, or even at the center of them. She would be joining them in anti-union legislation.

She would enthusiastically embrace a LOWER minimum wage, as long as she can sell it as *"I have to lower the minimum wage! The big bad Repubs are making me do this, y'know. No choice. And now I'm off to my private meeting with the CEO of Goldman Sachs..."*
Nowhere in there did you explain how voting for Trump was a better option. If Congressional Republican were going to lower the minimum wage and destroy worker protections, they would have done it already. I FUCKING HATE HILLARY, but I’m not brainless, so I realize that Trump is worse than her. 

Hillary wouldn’t be threatening nuclear war with North Korea, or constantly pissing off and offending our allies. She wouldn’t have given us single payer, but she also wouldn’t be pushing this abysmal healthcare plan the GOP is pushing. She also wouldn’t be personally pocketing millions of tax payer dollars by hosting foreign dignitaries at her own properties, or having government officials promote her products on television. As terrible as 4-8 years of Hillary would have been, there is absolutely no way it could have been worse than living under Trump.Lol never Reddit unmedicated. This is embarrassing for you. I don't hate her, I just know what she is ideologically - a **NEOLIBERAL** - who she represents, and who is paying her.

We're talking about wages, but you're already changing the subject. Am I wrong in my hypothesis of what she would do, and if so, why?

Would we have a serious political movement for a higher minimum wage right now if Hillary were president? Of course not. She would be against it and every corporate Democrat in congress would be falling in line behind her.  You'd just have Sanders carrying that flag all by his lonesome. And a huge chunk of the people who voted for her would be falling in line too.

Trump's shambolic presidency offers an opportunity for workers and unions to restructure the entire political field, from the grassroots up. This is clearly preferable to a Hillary presidency.&gt;Am I wrong in my hypothesis of what she would do, and if so, why?
Yes. You’re clearly wrong as your hypothesis hinges on Congressional Republicans pushing to lower the minimum wage and they haven’t done that yet. If they wouldn’t do it under a Republican President, why would they do it under a Democratic one?Alabama Senate Special Election 2017

Why do Dore fans think that the most important political issue in 2017 is Joy Reid's bad takes?MALE WORLD RULESI live in AL and canvassed for Jones today. I'm so hopeful, but I feel like I'm just gonna get burned again. I just moved here from Ossoff's district too. Im exhausted from all these elections. Bernie to Hillary to Ossoff to Jones. &gt; You’re clearly wrong as your hypothesis hinges on Congressional Republicans pushing to lower the minimum wage and they haven’t done that yet.

And you think they won't? Of course they will. They would just have a much easier time with passing such proposals if Hillary were president. Then they could mix up such proposals with supposedly "progressive" window dressing, or call it "bipartisanship".

Hillary isn't an incompetent neoliberal like Trump is an incompetent neoliberal, that's the point.

What do you think she and her husband did while in the White House? They passed one neoliberal and/or conservative proposal after the other (NAFTA free trade agreement, privatize prisons, Three Strikes, repeal the Glass-Steagal Act, etc.)

By working together with a Republican congress, the Clintons got shit done that Reagan and Bush The Elder could only dream off.I can’t comment on the other comment’s strange take. But this is a very good point. The fact that Sam is being targeted means he’s visible and seen as a threat. I’ve only started watching recently but stayed and am a huge fan because of his positive and energizing commentary. 

Keep fighting the good fight Sam!&gt; They would just have a much easier time with passing such proposals if Hillary were president.
It’s absurd to say that a Republican Congress would have an easier time passing right wing legislation under a Democrat than under a Republican. What have they passed that Trump hasn’t signed? Nothing! He signs anything they put in front of him.Wow. I really wish I could have the time back that I wasted reading that. I seriously just wasted precious moments of my life reading absolute garbage.Lol verrit? The Neo liberal shithole. TL;DR - Bernie ran a campaign. Against Hillary. AGAINST HILLARYFeel so bad for Sam. He got railroaded by the twitter nazi brigade and for some reason MSNBC fell for it hook, line, and sinker. I stand with Seder!Lol if you say so They got their scalp. Ugh, this is fucked. The entire point of the tweet is criticizing people who aren't taking rape seriously enough. Great to see Sam's buddy Chris Hayes completely not stand up for him in any way btw.who knows what chris did or didn't do in the background? i'm 100% sure chris did all he could because that's the kind of guy he is.They knew it was satire, they just use fake outrage and dishonest interpretations to get what they want.

I'm not saying this is the left's fault, but I can see how ignoring the actions of SJWs can lead to this type of stuff hurting the left. Don't we all agree that maybe the witch hunting the left tends to do with jokes and stuff is a little overboard? Every tweet you ever make now is supposed to have these severe rammifications for your livelihood. And it's only natural that the right uses this, and as the reactionary movement grows and can influence corporations more, the parameters of what is considered fireable behavior will only grow.This only increases my support for the show. Fuck Cernovich. This is the rational Cernovich is using. It's bullshit. The "SJW culture" was overblown and more or less completely made up to begin with. Plus Sam's tweet was a joke anyway. Big difference between that and the tweets that someone like Anthony Cumia got fired for.Well... she isn't.Not sure why you're getting downvoted, that's a perfectly logical point.  It's the fucking internet, sometimes a joke is a joke!  

You can't be for Milos firing and against Seders at the same time. I suppose so. He certainly hasn't said much publicly beyond a few non specific tweets. Chris is a strange dude. He's an incredibly smart, incisive political commentator who hosts a very dumb show.if you haven't read Angela Nagle's "Kill All Normies", you'd find it interesting.  I've been thinking of recommending her as a guest on MR.Nonsense. Utter nonsense. The difference between Milo and Sam is that one defended pedophilia as being normal and the other was expressing disgust for acceptance of pedophilia by using a joke. That being said, MSNBC is absolutely being politically correct in firing him, because it's easier than just fucking explaining the context. I blame capitalism. I used some reactionary language like "SJWs" so I don't blame people. I think there's a way to formulate the argument without sounding like an alt-righter but I haven't found it yet.It was a six year old sarcastic attack on rape apologists willfully misinterpreted to silence one of the few real left commentators on MSNBC. I don't expect anything of lying Nazi lisping rapist rat-fucker Cernovich. I lay this completely at feet of NBC News management using any excuse to push to the right.As Cliff would say: context matters. 

Fuck MSNBC.MSNBC attempts to cover up the Weinstein story, but fires Sam for a satirical tweet taken out of context. I am pretty certain they have already had her on recentlyNow they are going to feel more empowered.  Fuck AlimonyMike.This was pretty good, a lot better then I thought it was gonna be.  ah youre right, my version of the app is apparently not good at searching Corey Pein had a podcast, "News from Nowhere" (it is now a patreon only podcast, but I think his archives are still available)- and he had a great interview with Angela Nagle- definitely worth a listenNice one BallinLOL, good job Ballin!Yes. He is discussing it on today's show. yea, well Mindy blocked me. WTF.&gt;Has Sam addressed being fired on his show?  
&gt;If so where? I can’t find it on YouTube

I know it’s inappropriate but I wish I could ddos cernovitch. you were probably being a dickheadmaybe, but I don't think so. I am not Ronald Raygun.It was stupid of him to keep saying that.

But it came after an article from CNN suggested that Clinton was trying to "disqualify" Sanders from being viewed as a qualified candidate.

It was a back-and-forth sort of thing, but places like Verrit will obviously not keep that context.He also gave her a gift with "The American people don't care about your damn emails". When he said "She isn't qualified", he meant that she wasn't qualified to represent the vast majority of American people who make &lt;40k/year when she gives speeches to Goldman Sachs for 400k. He did not mean her lack of knowledge and experience in the White house and senate. He repeatedly clarified this.&gt; "If a few hundred thousand people sign a petition calling for Sam Seder to be re-hired ..."

Then nothing will happen. "Click here" activism doesn't work, you need real activists and agitators. And Sam has alienated most of those - at least in part, ironically, by being on MSNBC.TIL Verrit still exists. &gt;  ***"She isn't qualified"***

You know what he meant by  "She isn't qualified". He meant of the entire country. And you know he meant it. Don't try to twist his words.

And I grant you [he said no one cares about her emails](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/25/13403088/bernie-clinton-emails), but only ***after*** his campaigns' surrogates all almost unanimously attacked her character on and on (even if you can accurately say Bernie told his campaign to not do that; by the way, they never listened), and ***before*** [Jeff Weaver went on Fox News](unanimously), where they cornered him into saying that he doesn't think a candidate can continue in the race if they were indicted (due to mishandling State Dept emails). Granted, he never said "I think Hillary should drop out if she is indicted," but as a supposed seasoned campaign manager, he should have predicted how the media inevitably twisted his words into him 'saying' Hillary should drop out. 

So at the very least, you can say Bernie Sanders horribly mismanaged his campaign's mesage distinguishing their policy differences from character attacks, which simply means he was really incompetent at controlling his campaign's message.

Or, you can say his official campaign reps all committed a grave disservice to their candidate by insisting on a character atttack even when Sanders wanted to stick to more substantive policy debates.

Agreeing with both statments would not be mutually exclusive, either. 

EDIT: And if you agree with either one, or with both, you'd have to question Bernie's competence as a candidate, campaigner, and politician. A question which would be sensible to ask given how weak of an impact his belated endorsement of Hillary Clinton was, and the fact that he only managed to pass three of his sponsored bills despite having ***27 years*** to pass a sponsored bill.

And before you call him the "amendment king" of the Senate, [here's an analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/07/hillary-clinton-was-a-more-effective-lawmaker-than-bernie-sanders/?utm_term=.180304954b98) of their legislative records that takes into account the time difference of their time as legislators: 
&gt; Clinton successfully amended bills 67 times in her eight years in the Senate. Sanders did so 57 times in nine years. On a year-by-year basis, that comes to 8.4 per year for Clinton and 6.3 per year for Sanders. Moreover, the mean senator passed 7.4 amendments. Clinton’s is significantly higher than the mean, and Sanders’s is significantly below the mean. Put differently, Clinton passed 33 percent more amendments per year than did Sanders.

&gt;Sanders’s record during his 16 years in the House of Representatives was similar. There he didn’t pass a single bill. Granted, it’s harder for members to pass bills in the House than the Senate — the mean House member passes only 0.7 a year — but even so, one passed bill over a quarter-century in both houses of Congress is a very low number compared with his colleagues.

[...]

&gt; Sanders’s legislative effectiveness score was below the House median in ***seven of the eight Congresses in which he served***.Smart politicians - particularly politicians wih national ambitions who are running for president - have to be able to predict the reactions of the media and political enivronment they are in. 

Say what you want, but Sanders ***was simply not good*** at reading/predicting that part of the media/political environment.Thank you based god 🙏If my employer had fired me because they agreed with an Alt Right smear, I wouldn't want to continue to work there.

Accept their apology (if there is one) and really rub it in in the media, sure, but go back? Not in a million years.THE ERA OF THE ALPHA MALES IS OVER AND THE BETA CUCKS ARE BACK! 

Now he can get back to shilling for corporate democrats and covering up Hillary's black ops killing machine as she leads a coup d'etat and imprisons all white males.Yay!

Sam shouldn't have to share the air with an admitted homophobe  Nah. Gotta clean our own house first. Every day he's not outed is another day the GOP slime will call a double standard.  This is the right answer. I love Al Franken but he has to go. Alabama Senate Special Election 2017 

[Non-Military Absentee Postmark Date](http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/absentee-voting): December 11, 2017 

[General Election](https://myinfo.alabamavotes.gov/VoterView/PollingPlaceSearch.do): December 12, 2017 

While the Franken accusations aren’t quite as craven as Cernovich’s attempts to get Seder off MSNBC, there is more than whiff of right-wing subterfuge going on. Why are you so sure these accusations are credible? 

If Franken loses his seat over a bad joke, we are ultimately fucked. It wasn't one joke. There are several women, including Tina Dupuy, claiming he groped them.Putting your hand around a woman’s waist while posing for a photograph is not sexual assault. It is not groping according to any reasonable definition of the word. He grabbed her ass. It's inappropriate and not becoming a senator.You are mixing up your accusations. Please, if you are going to try to have a substantive discussion about the merits here, at the very least get your accusations and accusers straight. 

Tina Dupuy did not allege Franken grabbed her ass. Some women who took photo ops at state fairs made hose allegations. Not Dupuy. Her entire case is that Franken grabbing her waist and squeezing ‘twice’ amounts to a violation of some sort. She said his hand slid down from her waist and squeezed, it could be her hip or her ass, but she clearly felt it was a big enough deal to go forward. You don't need to be so pedantic.Sam should tell msnbc to suck his ballsThe fact that it’s 2017 and this is a controversial statement for an administration official to make is disgusting.Prudes? Sam was literally fired from his correspondent job. The "Alpha Males are back and the Africans are black" part totally threw me for a loop the first time I heard it. Way too funny. Verrit sounds like Ferret. Which makes sense, since Peter Daou is a fucking rodent. Thom Hartmann  is warning that Alabama rules could cause your ballot to be not counted.   
  
Thom says if you circle a vote for Jones and also circle the choice for all the Democratic slate, that constitutes an overvote in Alabama  and is discarded.     
A vote for either Jones or all Democrats is counted for Jones, but a vote for both is trashed.  
  
Ed: see www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/7j58mk/thom_hartmann_warns_alabama_rules_could_cause/ 
    So theoretically, the same would be true of people who circle Moore and all Republicans, right?Yep, he said that too. See my edit.  
  Ty, glad it was useful. Many of us are grateful that you and your neighbors are taking this opportunity seriously.  
  
[Democracy Now](http://www.DemocracyNow.org) is reporting Alabama has recently restricted ease of voting, including by closing DMV offices that voters depend on for documentation. Similar in many GOP influenced States.   
  
See my edit above.  
  
  
Including the amendments giving voting rights and other rights to women, African-Americans, etc..  
  
Just coincidence, I'm sure.  
  Lucky you, few have such a choice available to them.  
  
  
Also, this is not just any employer, its a major national platform where IMHO viewpoints like Sam's need to be heard. Most people in the US are exposed only to Sinclair and FoxNN dogma, others to CNN and NYT type doctrines. Sam on MSNBC shows that other views are possible.  
  
  
MSNBC deserves kudos for reversing themselves. From the OP link above...  
  
&gt;“Sometimes you just get one wrong,” said MSNBC President Phil Griffin in a statement to The Intercept, “and that’s what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons — because we don’t consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we’ve heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward.”  
  
  
Kudos too to everybody who spoke in Sams behalf, you deserve the main credit.  
  
Yes we did!  
  
Al is being fired. Al requested due process from the Senate disciplinary system. Overriding this with a hasty resignation means he was pressured (I would say by Dem-chicken Loser-crats). At a very minimum, his electorate deserves its say in being deprived of their chosen rep.

  People are surprised by this? McConnell has no respect for government institutions whatsoever. Remember Merrick Garland? Yep, just like when Ted Kennedy died, the GOP delayed seating Scott Brown until current Senate business was done...

&gt;Best of from November 2016:  
  
&gt;Zack Exley (@zackexley) and Becky Bond (@bbond) on their new book on lessons from their time on the Bernie Sanders campaign: Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything (Paperback – November 18, 2016). “Distributed Organizing” and using technology to actually make contact with voters. How important an earlier start to the Bernie campaign could have been. Giving volunteers more responsibility, along with structure and accountability. Hillary’s flawed data-driven get-out-the-vote efforts. How to counter Trump by going on the offensive on the left.  
   
&gt;Then, a selection of conversations about Bill O’Reilly, featuring Andy Kindler.
  uhh, okay?As opposed to Joseph Ballin, who never had a mind to lose.I don't quite think this guy gets it.  You have to look at how mainstream conservatives see capitalism.  It's a righteous system that rewards the moral and hard working and deprives the lazy and wicked.  

When it doesn't work that way libertarians think the reason it isn't working is because some government intervention, "Its not a real free marker".  Alt-Right because the Jews have hijacked it and exploited it.  It's why they are so fanatical because it's a moral system to them being corrupted.  

Also you should look at the history of libertarian media, like CATO and Reason magazine.  Reason defended Apartheid and promoted Holocaust denial.  

**edit** just so we are clear this is the kind of stuff I am talking about:

&gt;“Probably the most far-out materials on World War II revisionism have been the seemingly endless scholarly studies of the supposed execution of 6 million Jews by Hitler. The anonymous author [Hoggan] of ‘The Myth of the Six Million’ has presented a solid case against the Establishment’s favorite horror story—the supposed moral justification for our entry into the war.”

  How much time ya got?The third wave feminist bullshit, for one. The anarcho-communist bullshit for another. She (and Michael to a certain extent) embody all of the negative tenets of Social Justice Activism: the arrogant, hubristic sense of moral outrage; the dogmatic, purist and black-and-white outlook; the refusal to acknowledge the nuanced complexity of society and human behavior (case in point, the Aziz Ansari situation - just look at her Twitter); the readiness to paint the world and large groups of people with an extremely wide brush; and the eagerness to accuse those with differing views and tastes of serious moral failure.

Maybe this just isn't the show for you. When did you hear my voice? No, she doesn't. She sucks.I'm actually an atheist, but glad to see you prove one of my points.I gave you an example: the Aziz Ansari case.&gt;I don't trust your opinion. 

I'm sure I'll live.Nick Anand pretty much covered it, so I don't think it's time well-spent rehashing that argument.What kind of dumbass atheist makes their name a bible quote?Funny you should ask that. I chose that name to trigger Sam Harris fanboys and other New Atheists. I wanted to see if they could keep their eyes on the ball (i.e. the argument) or whether they were so supercilious  that they'd dismiss the  argument out of hand without considering its merits because they perceive me to be religious. 

In other words, I'm the kind of "dumbass atheist" who likes to bait other dumbass atheists - such as yourself. You bit the hook, dumbass, and in so doing proved that you are really no different from many Sam Harris fanboys. You're simply devoted to a different *Sam*. Kudos!I’m not an atheist, but good job just making random assumptions, I guess.&gt;I’m not an atheist

Well you would say that now, wouldn't you?If you don’t think part of resisting is voting for and funding the opposition party, then I don’t know what your goals are. Farron is alright but I would be way more suprised if Republicans voted for impeachment than tried to stop it.  Conservatives have a long history of supporting facsists and this is no different.Whats wrong with being a SJW?  My biggest problem with her is that she has a secterian vibe about here. I think that the (apparently poorly communicated) point of the post is that if we resist only Trump without also resisting the Democratic establishment, we will lose again in 2020, because they will make the same mistakes that lead to them losing in 2016. Obviously we have to vote for Democrats in the midterms, but we have to push progressives in the primaries and make sure the party leadership is full of progressives going into the presidential race.that is a huge letdown, but I don't and don't plan on listening to White Male Socialist Rage Hour so I'll stick with MR and their apparently unoriginal humor.Tl;dr: Empires are not resilient in the face of climate change.

&gt;Can Capitalism Survive?  
  
  


&gt;Capitalism depends on various inexpensive things to stay robust, including labor — both paid and unpaid — energy, food, and nature. What happens when they all stop being cheap at the same time? Jason Moore discusses whether capitalism can survive the rising costs of business as usual.

  Yep, Moby's work on Bourne is striking, Imho it makes all the difference in the movies.  
  
Creepily, it is supposed to be a big hit among the functionaries of the deepstate, according to a certain "retired" deepstate promoter on Steph Miller show.  
  
The cartoon looks about right. The text posted, less so.  
  
But that's what makes him so **BOLD**.Joe Rogan is not smart enough to understand what he's doing.He's "Bro-wise" and needed an astrophysicist to actually sit down with him and work very hard to convince him the Moon Landings actually happened. That would be a great argument, joe rogan, if the right literally didn’t elevate the dumbest person ever to the White House.

The right is beyond saving or understanding. Jesus... there isn't a common ground that needs to be found between the two. I hate this content.Isn't he a 9/11 truther?Who has he had on that represents left-wing politics? I see him with alt-lite and alt-right people all the time. I think now he would say "something's fishy"I'm pretty sure Rogan thinks "nuance" is a coffee flavor.In recent memory? I don't know, Sarah Silverman? Some comedians here and there...Tell the truth, Sam, was your laundry late, forcing you to dig thru old birthday gifts from your spinster aunts?  
    
Or maybe you lost a bet?  
  
  Fair enough.He did kinda kill her.Why is Joe Rogan having the least thoughtful people ever on his show?To me Joe isn’t really a political guy. The guy has a lot of interests, politics just isn’t one of them. He’s busy with comedy, MMA, diet &amp; exercise, psychedelics, hunting, float tanks, archery, smoking weed, his family, conspiracy theories, etc. Politics is way down on his listSo have non dummies on to talk about it! Not saying it has to be sam, but there’s a ton of actually interesting and smart people to talk with. Matt Yglesias, Noah Smith, Sarah Kliff. Thwre are better interviewees than them. You don’t listen to MR do you?

And I’m 100% sure way more people know who Matt Yglesias is than Cucky Dore You know sam hates jimmy right? Because he’s an unthoughtful conspiracy pusher?I mean when people have entire critics going back to 2013 I think it shows Matt is pretty well know.Lol. 
  
  
OK. 
 
 
Taking one for the team! 
  
  
Way to go, Sam!

If she would cool it on the communism stuff mr would be perfect right now 👌 Yeah, jimmy dore has multiple segments claiming that Clinton killed Seth rich and how she had Parkinson’s. 

Plus he had a disastrous debate with Sam that made him look so dumb he refuses to recognize Sam’s existence. ah yes, comedians are well known to claim that presidential candidates personally commit murder.Spoiler alert, please. Some of us haven't heard the whole show.

&gt;Donald Trump is ushering in a new and terrifying era of nuclear weapons. On our show today we’ll examine Trump’s recent words at the State of the Union, and the newly released Nuclear Posture Review with Jon Rainwater of the group Peace Action. **Then, David Daley of Salon joins us to give us the latest news on challenges to Republican gerrymandering. He’ll also share newly leaked documents from ten years of Republican redistricting efforts**. Finally, as the newly revived Poor People’s Campaign kicks of Black History Month with a 40-state wave of actions, we’ll hear all about the campaign from Kait Ziegler, an organizer in California.
  
&gt;Hosted by Sonali Kolhatkar.

Right, the world needs to hear about how Hillary Clinton killed Vince foster and dragged his body to the park. Ha ha. Yep, its gotta be a cowardly and ignorant troll, no way it will call the show.

Yeah man this sub doesn't really like conservative presidents much.Yes, agree with

Noam Chomsky the neoliberal corporate shill.The DNC admitted to rigging the primary I have immense respect for Chomsky and I don’t think he is a corporate shill. But I disagree with him on this. In the name of gradualism or “lesser of two evils”, we’ve seen growing inequality, stagnant wages, rising costs etc. The reality is neoliberalism has not worked, in fact it has made things worse. The evidence is overwhelming. I think that if your argument is “people in swing states, or anywhere that could conceivably be a swing state, should vote for Hillary because she’s less horrendous than Trump” then I agree. What really pissed me off is when people yell at New Yorkers and Californians for voting for Jill Stein. There was no way in hell Hillary would lose those states, so why bother voting for her there?&gt; but instead they do a protest election once every 4 years and then do nothing in between

Why do people constantly say this? It simply isn’t true. They run candidates all over the country during the off-year elections.And that proves Trump isn't that bad, right? Fuck off. Tell it to the thousands of people being terrorized by ICE. Jimmy Dore does not give a FUCK about dreamers. They're an acceptable sacrifice for him. Send him and his wife to the gulag and maybe then we can get back to talking about shit that actually matters in the here and now. But if you think anybody on this sub is gonna jump to his defense, you really ought to actually watch MR at some point or another. For someone who isn't a political guy, he sure lets dumbasses spout their stupid political opinions all over his show. For example, nothing Sam Harris says is anything but politics. What subreddit are you on? LolI remember thinking when Kelly left that nobody would be able to fill her shoes, but I really like Jamie and the new role she's brought to the program. She didn't fill Kelly's shoes, she carved her own place on the show and I think that's pretty bad ass. http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/018/725/Screenshot_142.pngThat's bullshitYou guys are so easily duped its scary. You didn't give a fuck about the dreamers until Trump got into office. Did you forget that we had a Democrat in the white house for 8 years?You made a lot of claims without providing evidence.Since when did you give a shit about dreamers you scumI'm not a fan of Harris but this isn't trueKyle Kulinski and jimmy Dore are more thoughtful than Steven Pinker and Sam HarrisEDIT: So Trump is "oppressing" women and minorities? Please explain how. Also, the Citizen's United ruling was in 2010. I know you have a short memory so I will remind you who the president was: Barack Hussein Obama. You know, the same guy who expanded war, cracked down on whistle-blowers, deported record number of undocumented immigrants, executed the largest transfer of wealth in history (Wall St. bailout), expanded NSA spying, ordered the killing of 2 US citizens, and on and on. But you neolibs didn't say shit then. Now that Trump is in, all of you are hyperventilating. In a sense I'm an accelerationalist, like JimmyI love how dumbass neolibs just go with whatever the DNC and MSNBC tell them to. Don't you have a mind of your own? Schumer and Pelosi say that we need to shut down the government for the dreamers and you just fall right in line? What a weak minded approach.Executive Orders is not legislation. Obama went to law school he should know thatso are single celled paramecium So you support shutting down the government over the dreamers ?Do you dispute that Obama did those things while in office? Or is your response to just call me a racist, which is typical dumb dumb lefty shit. Can’t form a counter argument, call them a racistSo then who would you consider to be a great contemporary thinker?Let's see. I'm black and I'm muslim. And you call me racist for using Obama's middle name. Yet Michael Brooks, who regularly does stereotype black voices and impressions in the most reductive and boring way, he's not racist. Got it. Sure in those 72 days when Democrats did not have to deal with Republicans and they should have passed immigration reforms among a large list of other things.as much as I respect the wobbles, his books would be a better example. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky_bibliography_and_filmography#PoliticsBruh if you think having a bias towards Hillary is rigging [wait till you find out what the fascist Republicans do down here in Florida.](https://theintercept.com/2016/12/22/a-quarter-of-floridas-black-citizens-cant-vote-a-new-referendum-could-change-that/)  I think you should get more informed. Yup. Kinda of a shitty thing for Obama to do, luring the undocumented out of shadows based on an executive order. Should have put the economy and healthcare last.Well it's certainly not philosophy when he goes on about Islam. P R O J E C T I O NWhat does that even mean? What could you possibly become informed about that would change this position? This is why no one takes you dum dums seriously. You know what an ideal future looks like, but you have no idea how to operate in our current paradigm. You can't just wave a magic wand and fix this stuff. Schumer and Pelosi suck, but we're stuck with them in the immediate future, so you have to know political strategy to get anything done. Voting for Hillary in the general (I voted for Bernie in the primaries) was voting strategically and also my way of minimizing suffering. You don't get that because your vote had absolutely no consequences for you. If you relied on Medicaid or knew someone who was in danger of losing their citizenship under Trump, you'd fucking understand. But you don't, because you're a petulant child who doesn't understand what voting is actually about. you're saying that being a sensationalist hack gets youtube views???? So why is he obsessed with Jimmy Dore?Do you majority report fans still go on twitter and YouTube comment section and beg Rubin to debate Sam? Just curiousThen don’t watch him. Watch the msnbc contributor Sam SederThe dry boys oppose neoliberalismThere are still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding that murder The police first reported it as a robbery, but nothing was taken from him. He still had his wallet, watch, and phone Bill Clinton received 500k to give a speech to a Russian bank[Look into it](https://images.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgflip.com%2F1oy9av.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflip.com%2Fi%2F1oy9av&amp;docid=8RvrRr_Y1Ftw3M&amp;tbnid=6XRuVe_B1Ai96M%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=500&amp;h=670&amp;hl=en-us&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim) i don't. why do you like a guy who thinks hillary clinton killed seth rich and also has parkinsons? Well she did have a concussion at like 70 years old, that’s not very commonmost 70 year olds kill dnc staffers too?[Joe Rogan And Jimmy Dore On Seth Rich Conspiracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcbG2QpyOTY)He's such a fuckin phony. For an "anti-capitalist", he sure doesn't have a problem collecting money on patreon, even selling "organizing &amp; activism" phone call for $21sounds like alex jonesalex jones has 20 times the subscribers Sam Seder doesPowerful Jimmy Dore!yes, i agree that conspiratorial hacks get lowest common denominator views and subs. Great, I'm glad you think that. As long as we have people like you who look down on the working class, we can keep Democrats out of officeHey how many times has Sam been on?Jimmy brought up Seth Rich once on his show and Sams fans won’t ever let it gowhat does that have to do with conspiracy theories like Jones and Dore?You guys are reason Trump wonGreat point mr Jones No he didn’t have Sam on because he didn’t want to bore his audience to death. Jimmy killed it on the Rogan podcast. What about the “fact” that Assad gassed his own people, which has been debunked. Only Jimmy and few other people are talking about this. Not a peep from Sam. Might cost him his TV gig. I thought the left was supposed to be anti-imperialist?Show me the evidence that Trump colluded with Russia. That's all I'm asking. Because right now the evidence seems very thin. Wait, so you think that the reason we started a ground war in Syria is because Assad supposedly gassed his own people? Do you actually believe that?Hey Hillary zombie, don't forget that Hillary pushed for war in Libya, which is now a failed state where the slave trade is practiced now. They're talking about it on this podcast you should listen to itSo you're saying that the US is not involved in the Syria conflict?ok so you want to have a semantics argument?IS the US involved in Syria or not?When was the decision made to intervene in Syria?It was 2 weeks after 9/11It’s a perfectly logical method. That how we determine elections [Wars were planned](https://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw) He’s not a conspiracy theorist he was a US generalI guess the video was doctored somehowDo you dispute that Hillary was in favor of bombing Libya? Too much Kruger?Yes, I love all the nuanced conversations Jimmy has with professers delving into conversations on topics such as the historic framework of the cold war or social reproduction  theory.Time to eject him from The Left^^TMI like Sam, TYT, and Jimmy Dore but i maybe a little out of the loop why do you guys hate jimmy dore?i like michael brooksJimmy dore was on top of the Donald subreddit yesterday yo Thank you... Love this snitch bot.  Poster is a fuck.you're joking right
Michael wants to end capitalism while he collects money on patreon[Mattis Admits No Evidence Assad did Gas Attacks](https://youtu.be/j01F-_Rac9Q) Lol it’s not infowars. It’s powerful Jimmy DoreAn article featuring 3 dumbasses not even realizing they are in a gunfight, let alone bringing a knife. Silly liberals and their tone.Sam did a show yesterday on why.  Mostly because it poison the well making it harder for other progressive voices to seperate themselves from his quackery.  

For me though it's because he's using reactionary and right wing tactics like baseless conspiracy theory, which makes people more accustomed to conspiracy theory.  Every progressive movement has been met by reactionaries fueled by baseless conspiracy theory and Jimmy Dore is building an audience ready for them. Do you even watch Jimmys show? He voted Green Party. He hated the Democrats His positions are not in line with Democrats in congress. He supports single payerMajority leader puts a bill to the vote. Pelosi opposes single payer. It would be hard to pass a bill that only one third of Dems support, and zero Republicans support[Hillary’s War Crime](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2016/10/24/hillarys-war-crime/)


[Hillary Clinton, Secretary of War](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/08/hillary-clinton-secretary-state-war-drones/)A living wage, free college, student debt forgiveness, cancelling NAFTA &amp; TPP, getting money out of politics, ending all wars, reforming Democratic primary, stronger unions. Should I go on?So you named one person...Michael was urging people to vote for HilarryTrump is better than Hilary in many ways : see the list from mg earlier comment I do and they never let me on. They’re scared Its from Newsweek[NEWSWEEK - NOW MATTIS ADMITS THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE ASSAD USED POISON GAS ON HIS PEOPLE](http://www.newsweek.com/now-mattis-admits-there-was-no-evidence-assad-using-poison-gas-his-people-801542)Read the article Dems didn’t have the balls to do it. They’re spineless I noticed you avoided talking about how Assad gassing his own people was [fake news](http://www.newsweek.com/now-mattis-admits-there-was-no-evidence-assad-using-poison-gas-his-people-801542).So you want more of what we've had in the last 40 years? Dems have worse record than RepublicansI'm not shitposting stop being a narcI want real discussionYour username is wasted on you. I'm almost certain the Chapo guys would find you to be just as much of a twat as we do. HE'S JUST ASKING QUESTIONS, YOU GUYS. That was literally the first thing I thought of too. See, I'd call the Dore crowd the lazy crowd if what you say is true. They don't want to have to work to make things better. They just think that things have a bottom and we should strive to hit it so that things get better in their own. But that's not realistic. The listeners do. They wouldn't let me in their discord serverEDIT: That show kinda got shitty over the last few months. It's overrated. The whole "ironic left" thing is getting old too, stuff like [this](https://twitter.com/randygdub/status/963931364910276609) and [this](https://twitter.com/randygdub/status/964354158261239808) and telling people we will be putting them in gulags after the revolution is just boring. And for those of you who say Majority Report doesn't do that, listen to Michael's show.First, TMBS is not The Majority Report. Second, I think whether it's getting old or not is a matter of opinion. Third, if you dislike The Majority Report so much, go away. Fourth, you ain't know shit about shit son. What a nerd Notice how the dum dums are oftentimes indistinguishable from the alt-right. You fuckerDoes TYT take calls?Pakman is no longer an affiliate. And Secular Talk does not take callsJust as I expected. All TMR dumb-dumbs can do is call others dumb. lol jimmy dore thinks sam and everyone are right wing shills. if you think MR is "too left" you should probably stop listening to Cucky DoreI don’t listen to Dore that often. I tend to listen in on David Pakman and Secular talk here and there. Pakman comes off to me as the most  reasonable and rational progressive on YouTube. Sam comes off to me as a cocky prick who looks down upon others. I tend to agree with him, but not on these dumb-dumb feuds he’s igniting with Dore, and the fact that he tends not to jump into the substance enough imo. 

Like your ally above you ^ , Sam tends to veer off from substance and into condescending name calling, a topic unrelated to the main point, or he just starts blabbering and tries to pull a funny. call in to the show man. 646-257-3920Bet. I’ll call in tomorrow when I’m on lunch. That guys is boring and is a jewIs it illegal to use targeted online advertising?I see a lot of familiar names on Thom Hartmann.  You’re the one who brought it up I listen to the pre-records. They're still very good interviews. 

Maybe give Democracy Now a try, if you don't listen already. And Chapo Trap House, and Economic Update with Richard Wolff are both good. Yeah they aren't call in and live, sometimes I like that. Owen Jones and Left Out are pretty good too.COULD BE REAL First, UBI is NOT Socialism. It is a distinctly capitalistic solution. Second, Sam had never outright called himself a socialist, he just advocates for policies he thinks will solve problems, regardless of ism. Third, without humor there is no podcast. It would just be Sam reading social security reports for two hours a day. But in all seriousness, both shows have plenty of more serious topics and interviews and what sets them apart from those other shows is that they don't do performative stuff. Everything they talk about is immediate and 100% real and I appreciate that immensely They have experts that will describe corruption in the most niche parts of the economy like Pharmacy Benefit Managers, people that describe past social movements like the Southern Black Belt Communist movements, in-depth analysis of movements on the rights like ex-Nazis or people who analyze the Koch astro turf organizations. I even learn about current left and progressive movements like labor organization.

&gt; Sam and Michael describing themselves as socialists

Micheal is, Sam is a social democrat.

&gt;choose the pieces of socialism that make sense (single-payer, universal education, etc.

lol that's not socialism.It was Sam, that guy was clearly comming for the Social Security Act.  Sorry, its a tragic loss of life but you have to protect the revolution.Sometimes you just got to take the L.I mostly agree with this. The show is boring and they can’t decide wether it’s a comedy show or political one. It ends up being neither. I also agree that Pakman Kyle, and Jimmy are way better informed and entertaining.  My only disagreement is with the UBI being a solution pushed by the left. A lot of people on the right are pushing UBI for pernicious reasons. Who’s Chris LappakoOh I hate that guyWhere is the proof that he doxxed him?I know y’all might hate on this, but Vox’s The Weeds is the next best podcast on politics imo. Both care about the details, have good values and analyses, and both gives you insights that you can’t find elsewhere. Link or it didn’t happenThey are the largest online news network, so it makes sense that they would attract the most trolls.&gt;Two simple changes to U.S. law, both things based in other laws that we already know and like, could solve most of America’s gun violence problem:
  
1:     
  
&gt;    Treat all semi-automatic weapons in a similar way under the same laws as fully-automatic weapons.  
  
2:    
  
&gt;    Regulate gun ownership and usage the same way we regulate car ownership and usage.  
  
    
&amp;nbsp; 
    
&gt;Here’s the backstory and how each would work: https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/two-simple-laws-could-solve-americas-epidemic-violence  
  &gt;u/Martine_V 
 

&gt;Exactly. One of the tired talking point of pro gun people (who are anti regulation) is to bog you with endless discussion about this type of gun and that type of gun. It's just a distraction. People don't need to be "educated" about guns. You just need some smart regulation

He refrains from uttering Sam Seder's name despite Seder trashing him every few daysKudos also goes to Joe Rogan, Dave Rubin, Alex Jones, Ben Shapiro .... fuck it the list of people ignored by Sam is too long to listJimmys show is actually entertaining.

Mainstream media is full of important matters, just not in the land of "press freedom" anymore. In the US, divided from most of humanity by 2 oceans, stranded in a swamp of rightwing media and bizarre versions of religion, its easy to forget most humans agree greed is not good but evil and mainstream christianity is for promoting community, raising up the poor and curbing capitalism. 
 
This example of a foreign broadcast discussion includes free market extremists, a bishop and a World Bank (sister organization to the IMF) executive. It begins with the scandals in some major foreign aid NGO's but rapidly turns into a fight between capitalist greed versus everything that actual humans need including basic income, justice, decolonization, equality for the poor.

&gt;Are you sure he wasn't using the big umbrella to prevent another "hair incident"? I can't see any rain in the video.
 
&amp;nbsp;  
 

Haha. You could be right. 
 
You made me look at it again. 
 
Rain doesnt always show on camera, it still could be raining, but there was surely a lot of wind. 
 
I think you're right about the hair. Looking at how he wields the umbrella, it seems like he's shielding from the camera more than the weather.  
 
Well spotted.

Wonder what would happen if polls were not all Democratic / Republican Party approved questions and asked issues that matter to regular people instead?

&gt;After 1,000,000 votes were cast in the Big Ideas Project, the Progressive Change Institute ran a national poll to see whether these ideas are popular with voters.
 
&gt;The short answer? Yes, they are! 
 

 

Stop trying to centrally plan my liberty! Now, hold my beer while I put on my jetpack.20 years ago the Democratic President championed banking deregulation.
10-12 years ago Dem lawmakers would have felt comfortable getting up and  defending that bullshit legislation.
Today, only 1/3 of the caucus voted for it &amp; they wont go on camera to defend it, as they know the base won't have it.
Change is maddening glacially slowly paced, but it does happen.Sam was making that point the other day, and taking an almost parental tone about it. ("Spare the rod, spoil the child..."). And it really struck me that NO, this is not Democrats fault, I'm sorry. I'm goddamn tired of only one party in this country having to be the fucking adult ALL THE TIME. in 2009, the country's biggest priorities were avoiding the second Great Depression and trying to get people health care, and at EVERY step of the way, the R's ratfucked everything they could. At what point to we call the bad guy, the bad guy?

I wish I was more articulate about the unintended consequences involved in the precedent of ANY administration pursuing a previous administration's crimesWhats progressive about them? 
 
IDK anything about Kyle K, but I listened to a couple of Dore shows, only because Sam &amp; Co promote him so much.  
 
So far am not impressed. Sounded like a bunch of random empty slogans delivered in a tantrum worthy of a 4 year old. No evidence of any background of work or even any logical plan. 
 
You could program a magic 8-ball to create a script as good. (hmm, ... biz idea... people actually sponsor stuff like this? ). But, probably already been done by RW sponsored bots. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
How does this happen? How do uninformed people mix up Left - sounding rhetoric with RW actions like electing Trump? Sometimes not by accident: check out the discussions in today's Rising Up with Sonali https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/85ou1u/against_the_fascist_creep_how_the_rw_uses 
 
Edit: Not saying JD, etc. is swayed by any influence in particular, I just wouldn't know. Point is all thru history, RW forces have co-opted Left ideas and even words into twisted versions designed to confuse potential Left supporters and influencers. Example, "libertarianism", "anarchism" were once egalitarian ideas, now likely to be anti-socialist. Television, then later monopolized TV and cable, and now "social" media has ramped up RW exposure to enormous levels. 
 
I like the libertarian party because they are as bat shit insane as Republicans but they have no chance of actually doing the horrible shit they want to do.I think a lot of people thought Clinton was going to win easily.  So going into her presidency they wanted to look like they were more progressive and were always critical of her.  Like some people were of Obama.  "Hey I didn't voted for Clinton, I voted green." kind of bullshit.

Also this dynamic isn't new.  Communist and Com-Intern called social democrats, "social fascists" when Hitler was rising.  To be fair though liberals sided with fascists a lot during the Spanish civil war.I've never heard of KPFA until yesterday and this is the third time I've seen it now.  Is it new, why am I seeing it all of a sudden now?Why not just message him on twitter?Lol. I’m pretty sure matt’s Reddit account is BindersGang, the top mod on this forum. Who the FUCK said Cory Booker? I'll RP as Matt Binder if you pay me. Rev up those primaries, folksWhat are you wearing? Ordinarily my cynical self would  think he was doing this as part of a grift (see Goodman, H.A.), but with Jimmy  I just don't think so.Well if hes a fascist they all will vote for him.Jamie kicks assI also feel he is very quick to defend religion because he believes in some woo woo bullshit.  Thats why he was so butthurt about jamie speaking upI say go ahead and do it. Walmart treats their employees poorly. They deserve to be taken down a peg.*Michael is Michael.*is it worth the risk?The loud accented voiced are almost always annoying as hell, sometimes you can even see Sam getting frustratedinteresting that bernie bros want republicans to keep control of the senate...Only a matter of time before Peterson has a public meltdown à la Sam Harris. All of these svengalis have deep seated emotional issues. Hmm. That's a good point. Hopefully we can throw him in a pyramid. i'm just taking a guess that you're not female, bro lolNo, it’s more of a statement of broish behavior like you’re exhibiting right now. Cliff is a neolib. It's a shame and I think Sam has trouble accepting it, since they're friends, but it's true. That’s probably why I couldn’t find on there and made this thread.As we all are from time to time. And I kind of understand how he feels about JG. She has a legacy on the left and did this stuff well before it was acceptable. That being said, her comments about Franken were ridiculous. &gt;I believe there are white nationalists who are not white supremacists

Fine. I'll play along. What differentiates a white nationalist from a white supremacist them? And correct me if I'm wrong, but to say that white supremacist label themselves as white nationalists to express their views or to add another dimension to their views would suggest that some people, including perhaps yourself, do not think these ideologies are equally as odious.

For the record, I think the whole "We're not white supremacists. We're white nationalists" is just semantics. It is a distinction without a difference. And like I said, you appear to have bought it. White nationalist:  I'll kill you darkies if you don't gtfo.

White supremacist:  I'll kill you darkies if you don't stay in your servile roles.Your response presumes that White supremacists do not want "darkies to gtfo!" But they do!&gt;, white supremacists can get behind "darkies" staying put so long as they remain servile or otherwise exploitable.

Find me a white supremacist who says he or she is okay with "darkies" staying put so long as they remain servile or otherwise exploitable?

Also, while we're having this fatuous debate. Were the Nazis white supremacists or white nationalists? It was mostly a joke, obviously all white nationalist are supremacists.  

But there are absolutely some white supremacists that don't want black people gone because they benefit tremendously the racial caste system and not just during slavery.  Like there is a reason why politicians banned newspaper in the south like "The Chicago Defender" because it was convincing black people to leave the South.  It's not just using them for cheap labor either like with the peonage system that lasted till the 1940s.  Elites use racial resent to destroy worker solidarity, (lots of examples of union busting), they are an easy target to blame and destroy (read Hannah Ardent, also trump and daca).  Like did you know Truman's universal healthcare plan was stopped because it required desegregation of hospitals.  Or this whole privatization of school became popular when we desegregated schools.

Of course I'm not saying we would have more social progress without black people.  Elites would just target another group like when the English starved the Irish because they wanted more land free of peasants.I should have been more clear: find me a modern white supremacist who says he or she is okay with "darkies" staying put so long as they remain servile or otherwise exploitable? And by the way, Jefferson wanted free Blacks resettled in Africa. So, it seems even your example fails to pass muster. Jefferson was not okay with the "darkies" "staying put".Trump is neither a White supremacist nor a white nationalist. Notwithstanding the fact that he has emboldened them and they claim him. And Haiti *is* a shithole. Sure, pointing this out in such terms in unbecoming of the POTUS, but it is true. Haiti is a shithole. I don't understand the rest of the sentence ("and barred them from temp visas employs more Haitians than any other nationality at Mar-a-lago"), so I can't respond.

&gt;As for Jefferson, the majority of his slaves "stayed put" on his property until he died despite his documented objection to slavery...

So...?

&gt;This doesn't disprove my point. Once they were no longer useful (no longer enslaved), give them the boot

Actually, it does disprove your point. Your point was that Jefferson was a white supremacy but not a white nationalist because although he considered Blacks inferior to Whites (evidence of his White supremacy), he wanted them to stay put (evidence that he was not a white nationalist). But historical records actually show that he did *not* want them to stay put. He wanted Blacks resettled in Africa. He wanted those that were still under bondage free and resettled, along with other freedmen in Africa. This wasn't something he wanted just for *his* personal slaves. He wanted it for *all slaves*. He wanted a nation of whites! Put those two together and you have...white nationalism!yeah! i confirmed it was her with the [huffpost article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5ac59a0fe4b056a8f5982f9e) that states her full name.Kinda weird, not much on Alex's antisemitism.  Hell yeah, Tammy! Global Warming Skeptic was the first name he used (of hundreds?). If you want to hear his actual calls, there are a couple of them clipped on YouTube.Obviously the court was full of virtue signaling bad-faith actors. He references the polling data of Muslim countries but I believe there’s a strong argument about the unreliability of that data that Michael and Sam have discussed.Amid news of the Cohen raid and Stormy Daniels cooperating with the feds, the US announced that it make a decision on Syrian in 48 hours. Assad had been having success pushing back Isis and other terror groups, with the help of Iran and Russia. Why would Assad pick now (a time where he is winning) to gas his own people?He's also using No True Scotsman incorrectly. Unless he's claiming the MR crew is a group of actual terrorists. No True Scotsman is to set YOURSELF (or your group) apart from all the OTHER assholes who were doing the same thing, it's just that you were different because of X. see: O'Reilly, BillThe Calculating Cat agrees!I do like the Vic Berger inspired camera zooms and off center focuses, however.You're right. That makes it a completely invalid term. How about tankie? You ok with that one?Chapo Trap House, DOOMED with Matt Binder, David Pakman (though he's a bit dry and  I disagree with him quite a bit more often than I do with Sam and Michael), Antifada (Jamie and Sean's podcast), and a few comedy podcasts, though I'm not sure if you're interested in those. Because it's not beneficial to their brand. And it's very likely that they don't think the stories would sell. Tabloid-style journalism is where all the money is made. Email this to Sam. Oh yah. That would be a shit-show. What happened?I've said this elsewhere but I absolutely love that Sam Harris' new shtick is, "I have no choice but to spend my time spreading racist pseudoscience."I liked him better before the 2016 election when he would IM in and rant about everyone on the left needed to take up arms &amp; storm the barricades, etc. I'm sure Joe Joe there would have been the first over the hill!He's gonna show that neoliberal whore Amy Goodman up if it's the last thing he ever does! NO ONE is as pure as Joseph Ballin! NO ONE!Smeared, yes, but still dumb. Dore is the only truth tellerA - tweet https://twitter.com/HAGOODMANAUTHOR/status/987852327380963328alex jones praised him, so that's where you're at dudeThat swamp sure is getting drained! What evidence?You think the chemical attack was fine by Assad?You actually think Assad gassed his own people? Yes or no So you basically support war in Syria, good for you Why are you avoiding simple questions? Do you support military intervention in syria or not? Also, if you believe Assad gassed his own people, can you provide evidence? You shouldn’t believe everything CNN tells you to, think for yourself Why aren't you answering the question about the chemical attack?Everyone has an ideology. The trick is to not blindly follow yours when new information is made available. I bet you’re going to talk about communism and how great communism isA very good podcast It’s a good podcast that I’ve enjoyed so far.Yeah. Sam’s commentary at the end is funny. Thank you, it's harder than it might seem!Lol... Remember when this kid illegally streamed the mayweather v mcgregor fight to gain subs?This is old. Stop posting old shitDo we all sit in the front row and do the "Bahp Bahp Bahp" bit?obvious troll is obvious.ANYBODY HERE GAY? ANYBODY? all these headlines, coincidentally none of them mentioning how this was a response to US and RoK starting up military exercises near the border again.Nah. Our Sam's better-looking than that. Ok seriously, we have found Sam a role in the inevitable All The Presidents Men -type movie 5 years from now! Plus, Sammy gets to put ON what looks like 20 pounds.I have a feeling that, for Sam to look clean-shaven for Hayes, he has to shave AFTER they do TMR. 

Source: I also come from a swarthy people. "Hello? Is this where you sign up for the pay to play? Hello?" Does he talk in that voice the whole podcast? Like this: "blah blah blah I'm rational and you're not" How do you feel about spreading democracy when the resulting democracy goes against US interests? Do we scrap it and start over?

How do you feel about the US ousting democratically elected Mossadegh and installing a dictator in Iran? Would you have supported it at the time?I do not support the 1953 coup in Iran. Democracy is always better to dictatorship.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQHe would still be complaining about Carter’a deregulation 8 years into Reagan’s administration claiming that now we can “fight the right” only to see democrats lose their support from unions as they cease to exist and democrats then shift to the right.Why it’s important: force multipliers for economic growth go down as money is concentrated at the top. This means that economic growth goes down.Iran is our enemy When that new Jordan Peterson videos drops and he's wearing a fucking fedora. He mentioned it today.You don't list Rush Limbaugh, who has the most listened to radio program in America or the Koch network which runs, CATO, TPUSA, Dave Rubin, George Mason Department of Economics, Reason magazine and a bunch of other crap.What about the Gulf War, Bosnia or Rwanda interventions, World War II or the Afghanistan War? They aren’t even disputed as being unjustified wars.
None of them, it's their media enablers that keep giving these jackholes a public voice no matter how many times they are  prove just be stone liars  (the Fox crew) or providing cover for white supremacists, etc. These cretins have always been with us, and always will be, it's the fact they are given airspace in the New York Times &amp; on the nightly news is the problem.No, I’m saying you can support intervention without having go fight yourself.Iraq and Afghanistan were both defensive wars. We were attacked first.No they aren’t. They are all to uphold international law.So Harry Truman, FDR, JFK and LBJ were all not left-wing?Well the war against al queda in Afghanistan was no doubt defensive. Saddam had ties to terrorism, funded jihadists and harbored terrorists including those who did the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, he had them living in Iraq as well as Osama bin laden. He also refused to have weapons inspections from the U.N. in 2002.You are very ignorant. Simply google Saddam refuses weapons inspections. You will see that he did so in 2002 to try to convince the world that he had weapons. Bin Laden was allowed in Iraq and those who did the ‘93 World Trade Center bombing AFTERWARDS were welcomed to live in Iraq. Saddam funded suicide bombers and full blown jihadists. The Saudis came to love him by the end and he was no longer secular. He was our greatest threat in the world. Also the war in Afghanistan is not challenged even by Bernie Sanders. We had a right to fight al queda for 9/11 and did so.Is Labour really likely to win? But the US violates international law regularly in these same interventions. Do you care about international law or not?They actually haven’t. The only time we have was in Nicaragua.Either way, this is  tremendous news for John McCain!I knew a crash was coming the day he was "elected", and that joke of a tax bill was the method that would be used. And just think, such winners as Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross will get us out of that mess.I disagree. After listening to the Antifada I would say they need to give her more space to speak. Sam is obviously always the main commentator and a Michael is very aggressive in getting his voice in and often tries to get the last word. It doesn’t leave much space for Jamie or Matt. Jamie makes simple statements at times but they all do, and I’m always grateful to hear her longer commentary. 

Read Jamie’s articles if you still think her view is “immature”.I feel the same. I don’t begrudge him for it but it is a thing that is there and at times it can be a bit much. i totally agree, jamie's the stereotypical "communism'll solve this" person. talking about social security or whatever? "you know what would be great... if the proletariat rose up and took over the means..."

it's why i rarely listen to MR anymore. I still support the show though.First video: Matt Lech’s a weasel!

Lol does not disappoint Pack the courts till every other lawyer is a fucking federal judge.  Make it so they get a case so rarely the right wingers will leave for corporate law jobs.Play Trump's speeches at 80 or 85&amp;#37; speed,  and he sounds EXACTLY like the drunk at the end of the bar.THIS IS AN APPRECIATION THREAD!!!!!! she is queen of darkness Excuse me, you forgot to add how communism could make this thread better.Feeling when poster is alsovpart of the scoop troop?...look im not gonna lie to you i have no idea what you're talking about. i dont visit this sub much im just a fellow punk rocker like jamie and a huge fan of the show and wanted to so some love. enough of ur drama binch Yeah, please elaborate. Did I give Michael a pass? Do I need to grade every part of the show to talk about any of it? I can write essays on how Cliff’s dad jokes make me turn off the pod out of humiliation or how Jimmy Refer Cake might be losing his goddamn mind or how I normally skip the Michael only pods because he annoys me to no end. 

But since you asked about Michael, the only problematic things I can recall him saying were in the context of a character like right wing Mandela, where the whole bit is constructed around “how ridiculous does all this dumb shit sound when it comes person X” as opposed to Judy’s act, which presented as, it seems, an exaggerated version of herself. I do characters onstage that say things I don’t endorse, but that’s the point. I’m obviously presenting those ideas as silly and illegitimate and even state that as part of the bit. There’s a difference. 

Like I said, that’s to my recollection. Maybe Michael has some indefensible stuff outside of character work. Plus, I hold him to lower standard. Judy is a professional comedian with decades of experience. Michael is brand consultant with agreeable politics and a decent Obama impression. Regardless, I didn’t ask about that. “Sarah was talking too!” isn’t a great defense when the teacher calls on you. You pulled that quote from a disclaimer about how I‘m absolutely biased because I don’t dig her vibe or jokes on the show. So do you want me to go back and write down some shit I didn’t think was funny from earlier episodes? Or is this about some of her allegedly transphobic stuff? Either way, I’d rather not transcribe bits at the moment. 

More importantly, why can’t people just answer questions? This feels really passive aggressive. Maybe you’re sincerely asking me to pick one (again of what I do not know), but it definitely has the sound of someone lacing a field with land mines. I just asked a few questions in good faith. For some reason, everyone on reddit feels like they need to employ subterfuge to “win.” As if this were some courtroom drama and we’re all waiting for our “you cant handle the truth!” confession. That’s just how I talk. But sure, that’s about my opinion of her comedy. A lot of swearing with the cadence of a joke, but absent any real punchline or unique insight. It might be easier to swallow if they didn’t guffaw and kiss her ring all the time. I know she’s worked on some legendary stuff. I don’t doubt she’s at least funny on the page, but she’s bad on the show. 

And I was probably a little defensive in my response. There isn’t much room for dissent in the MR sub, even if it has nothing to do with politics. Is she a mall goth?It really depends on the queue. If you call at noon, you'll be on hold for a while, but you'll most likely get on. Sometimes you can call during the fun half song and get on, but no guarantee. Gonna call at 12 thenTulsi is a joke. Warren needs to stay in the senate if Bernie leaves to become president. Nina Turner. Wen u got a great sense of mise en scene. How do I know if the phones open?Alright, thanksif rumors regarding him are true (10 k /day coke habit i the early 90's). No amount of taking care of yourself is gonna help 25 years later, you're on borrowed time. I should clear up that Kudlow's substance use issues are public knowledge, merely the amount is in question.The article is a review of a book by Nancy MacLean. A couple of years ago, I read an article by her about the same guy,  James McGill Buchanan. This article was frightening. These people are absolutely comfortable with the US turning into the Third World ("Texas  would be perfect for Brazil\-like shanty towns"). No amount is ever enough, they want it all.Scared to embarrass himself by going on a stupid ass show hosted by a moron. Oh my god fuck off. Post on another sub. Glad to see Ana isn’t on Jimmy’s side.I first saw Jimmy on TYT during the primaries and initially liked him as he was covering politics from that perspective. I even subscribed to him. By the time the New York primary occurred, actually exactly when that occurred, both he and secular talk’s Kyle Kulinski went off the deep end and never came back. From further research I’ve learned that Jimmy has always been a conspiracy nutjob, unlike Kulinski who only started pushing Clinton foundation and Clinton uranium conspiracies etc post-NY primary. Something about the reality after that primary that Clinton, running on the economic and foreign policy miracles of her husband’s administration and Obama saving us from a depression, was going to be the nominee they just couldn’t accept. It’s as if they literally went insane from that really.What a fucking disgrace. He probably thinks North Korean prison camps are a conspiracy to instigate regime change. Trump is a disgrace for giving concessions without moving towards a post-communist post-Kim North Korea that the people can reap the rewards of.I’m 100% serious.**What would a society based on Buchanan’s principles and goals look like?**

Tyler Cowen, the economist who co-presides with Charles Koch over the cause’s academic base camp (yes, that Tyler Cowen, host of the most visited academic economics blog), has spelled that out. You might want to sit down to hear what he envisions for the rest of us. He has written that with the “rewriting of the social contract” underway, people will be “expected to fend for themselves much more than they do now.” While some will flourish, he admits, “others will fall by the wayside.” Since “worthy individuals” will manage to climb their way out of poverty, “that will make it easier to ignore those who are left behind.” And Cowen didn’t stop there. “We will cut Medicaid for the poor,” he predicted. Further, “the fiscal shortfall will come out of real wages as various cost burdens are shifted to workers” from employers and a government that does less. To “compensate,” this chaired professor in the nation’s second-wealthiest county advises, “people who have had their government benefits cut or pared back” should pack up and move to lower-cost, poor public service states like Texas.

Indeed, Cowen forecasts, “the United States as a whole will end up looking more like Texas.” His tone is matter-of-fact, as though he is reporting the inevitable. Yet when one reads his remarks with the knowledge that he has been the academic leader of a team working in earnest with Koch for two decades now to bring about the society he is describing, the words sound more like premeditation. For example, Cowen prophesies lower-income parts of America “recreating a Mexico-like or Brazil-like environment” complete with “favelas” like those in Rio de Janeiro. The “quality of water” might not be what US citizens are used to, he admits, but “partial shantytowns” would satisfy the need for cheaper housing as “wage polarization” grows and government shrinks. Cowen says that “some version of Texas — and then some — is the future for a lot of us” and advises, “Get ready.”

He did it during a live stream, so it was all off the cuff.  No research before hand.  He probably could have done much better if he did some research though.Blue, let's talk.
So, what has Ben said that you agree with?I agree, he's actually a good guy, but he is kind of a meathead, is easily swayed and doesn't challenge his guests as much as he should, especially when they make false and basically anti-humane  statements.  He's too nice of a guy to really push back.  He always feels bad afterwords when he does, and he really shouldn't.  Don't let your guests walk all over you.  It feels like the right are using him and his popularity to push their agenda, and he's just too nice of a guy to decline.  I wouldn't be surprised to see him in a Prager U vid in the near future.A reply I found effective is: Disprove it. Find the scientist that definitively proves AGW wrong. The fossil fuels industrious has tried this on a number of occasions in the last 25 years (The Kochs infamously in 2012, the guy came out saying AGW is very very real and man made). The scientist that disproves AGW will be made richer than any sports star or entertainer by the fossil fuels industry. Hell, the Kochs might  just buy him Maine or something.Hopefully there's video of this.Exactly. 

Bizarre how on different youtube channels this is hailed as a huge win for Rogan. He didn't do anything. He just sat that while Rubin ran around in circles trying to make a point he didn't even have clearly in his own head. 

Anything that's considered classic rock is her favorite. I think 90% of the time she gets bowled over by Michael.Are you saying she would do a better job if Michael wasn't rambling all the time or just that he's better at it than her and she can't keep up. No I mean they just simply talk over her.Could be. Like I said, she comes across as nervous and unsure and it's possible she's partly like that cause she expects to get interrupted. 

I do think she's smart and I've seen some of her written articles that make great points. I just don't much care for her in this format. I don't agree, I like her a lot.Listen to the Antifada. She’s much better there. I really think she doesn’t get enough space to speak on MR.She doesn't like goth music?How so? By teaching facts like climate change? You want to teach lies and have America fall behind globally. We have the best colleges in the world currently.Oh I'm sure she does to some extent. Unfortunately there have been a conflating with everything done by republicans and democrats by some of the farther left. It sometimes seems like if you mention anything they will just bring up a drone obama sent at some point. 

Can't think of what Matt's voice sounds like offhand as I'm rusty on the other people's names. 

Jamie, I'm willing to bet you listen to Marilyn Manson, The Cure, Bauhaus, and 90s nu-metal?Jimmy is funded by the Koch bros? Do you have a source for this?When your response to every injustice is to "abolish the state" it's kind of hard to take you seriously. Also, her politics do seem a bit different from the other hosts.

But I get it. It's difficult to do the news-every-day thing without saying something stupid at some point. In fact, I don't know a single news-every-day person who hasn't said something stupid at some point.

My recommendation would be to get more experts on the show - maybe that's not an easy thing to do or they are considered too boring to have on.Did they really hire this woman for being a Twitter Trump supporter despite her being a conspiracy lunatic and terrible racist? Well Dave is right about one thing at least. Palestinians are kind of like Confederates, extreme social conservatives, fascists, terrorists and those who simply support others who are. I admit that I don’t believe in a two state solution. I believe in a one state, federal system that lets a lot of power and decision making stay local, similar to Iraq. This way the military is still federal and it would prevent there being wars between the “two states”Ordinarily I would say it would be a case of "You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps", but after the Bushies, who knows?I'm not even sure what she means when she says that. I like when they are ripping people the most. Honestly, that is kind of what got me into them. They were sometimes the only people giving responses to some of the dumb things certain personalities were saying. I do think humor is an excellent way to bring people to your side when it's filled with clever commentary. 

Although they seem to be doing that less lately. I miss their Dennis Miller riffing which imo is just pure fun and great for casual Friday. 

&gt;Jamie's voice is like nails on a chalkboard to me now, and she just tries to be an edgy teenager saying, "Uh uh abolish the state duuuuuude." 

I feel like they have all gone a little bit to the edgy teenager side a bit. It's probably a side effect of being in their bubble. Don't get me wrong, I agree with a lot of what they have to say but with some other things it's like they surrounded themselves with anarcho-socialists so much that they forgot what it's like to talk to someone normal. A heart attack waiting to happen. Yep. You have to choose!I forgot the child concentration camps and the attacks on the press as well! My bad!People on the left give Joe Rogan far too much credit. Likable or not the dude is a massive idiot. Hard to do when TYT keeps giving him a hearty platform. Having a hard time picking between the Iran Deal and Neil Gorsuch. I guess it all depends on whether we end up invading Iran or not. TFW the youTube algorithm spits out the original "John Conner" call, and you remember what a trainwreck it was.Yeah I do, as do a lot of people. Which is what makes giving Dore such a hearty platform problematic. Why, I like TYT. Are you one of those I love Sam Seder but TYT is the worst people? Lol, you seemed to me like someone who would listen to SlipknotAre they going to go over this footage? I hope they do, I hope they go through all of it and comment. I want to see this first hand. Today’s the day. I hope she winsI'm going to commission an oil painting of the Moon falling into Lake Michigan, with Jimmy Dore in the foreground saying "this is fine". I though that in the lead-up to the Bush-Kerry election, and we had some pretty blatant vote stealing (i.e. Ohio) and it didn't kick off. Granted, we're in a very different place today. Don’t force the country to pay back reparations. When they are done, could you send them over to get the water out of my basement? I'm a Detroiter, and I didn't think the water could get THAT far!

Also, notice how quiet the never Trumpers are about to get. They'll gladly eat the shit taco if it gives them another 40 something conservative nutjob on the court.okay, thanks for clearing that up.I think he's one of the most damaging people. For some reason every time there is a topic in the news, there is a clip of him commenting on it. It will always have a right leaning touch to it. Also, I pretty much never see him talk to someone more left and now that I think about it, does this guy ever have female guests? I mean, maybe he does but it's so rare. 

So what is left? He has a lot of male edgelords that go on and they rant unchecked. They can say some of the most disgusting things on the planet and Rogan, Mr. Dudebro that every boy wants to grow up to be like, nods his head in agreement. 

And then the one time some dead-eyed idiot goes "UPS delivers chicken" and Rogan says "Nah it's USPS"...OMG TRUTH TELLING HERO. The left all upload videos of this bonafide truth teller. What does that tell morons who listen to him or even casually come across him? He's the true unbiased truth teller so he'll call someone out when they are wrong. If he's not calling them out they are probably correct in their viewpoints. After all, even the crazy leftists claim Rogan totally told off this libertarian when he was wrong once. 

So at the end of the day he wants to please. The left will not attack him for some reason while the right would attack him if he showed any sympathy for something that wasn't the free speech of a crazed right winger. He wants more than anything to be a dudebro who is liked and he found the left forgiving and the right easy to pander towards. So what do you have? A guy who has no reason to ever think outside of the crazed right winged/libertarian circle. 

Maybe if the left criticized him once in a while instead of licking his balls he might actually reflect? 

And yes at the end of the day he's just not an intelligent guy. He will believe conspiracy theories he just heard and only writes off the most obvious of them. His conversations are incredibly vapid too. Very surface level of  "dude, that's crazy about the moon landing maybe being faked". Yet people love him and that worries me. If he tries to push Janine through and she isn't confirmed, whoever his next pick is will be confirmed immediately. From the "I did not know that file": According to the Financial Times, " “Justin Kennedy, a trader who arrived from Goldman to become one of Mr Trump’s most trusted associates over a 12-year spell at Deutsche, is the son of a Supreme Court justice.”

Anthony Kennedy's kid was one of Trump's bankers at Deutsche Bank?? Jesus that swamp sure is deep!gotcha. thanks for the input. can anyone explain what he means by "zero-sum game" too, i'm a new viewer. perhaps with an example.ah okay. that makes sense, and a situation i hadn't even imagined. thanks for the input. can anyone explain what he means by "zero-sum game" too, i'm a new viewer. perhaps with an example.ah, gotcha. so it doesn't necessarily mean a 1v1 "game" then.

perfect analogy as i play cards relatively often. thanksA different way to think of "zero sum game" is with a pie. Zero sum game requires that if any other person gets more, or more people are added (i.e. disenfranchised people get equal rights, "immigrants come into the country are just takers"), your piece of the pie by definition, must decrease.  But experience tells us that on the whole, the pie grows with the new opportunities people are given. so when sam says "it's a zero sum game" he's usually using it in jest, sarcastically? i can't be arsed to look for a video example at the momentHe went to live on a farm. He's very happy. In addition to the comments already made, many of these voter ID laws are also followed by budget cuts and consolidation of the offices where you would be able to apply for an ID. Offices in neighborhoods that are mostly black and brown are always the first ones to get cut. Yeah, zero sum game *most* of the time is being used sarcastically, But like so many other MR tropes, they can sometimes take on a life of there own.Black and brown people are more likely to live in a city where they take public transportation and don’t need a driver’s license as well.Republicans also shut down DMVs in black communities so that they have to drive hours and pay a lot in gas and have the time to do so in order to get an ID.Lower wages for everyone. https://www.epi.org/blog/so-called-right-to-work-laws-will-lower-wages-for-union-and-nonunion-workers-in-missouri/I live in Missouri. I'm hoping the slow time in my workplace right now is part of our seasonal variation, and not part of a larger economic slowdown because of the economic uncertainties caused by this administration. Time will tell. Well Obama had wages adjusted for inflation growing at 1.5% per year his last two years and Trump’s tax cuts have already dropped it to -0.1% per year. And this is with the economy nearing it’s peak, it should be at its maximum now. But corporate taxes have deductions for employee wages. So when you lower corporate tax cuts you disincentivize employers to spend on wages and incentivize them to fire employees and lower wages, as they don’t need it to write off in their taxes. *Michael's right-wing Martin Luther King Jr impression* I use this subreddit to make sure that western civilization, which is the greatest accomplishment of mankind, does not falter before the heathen marxists that want to destroy the free speech of the republican party which I am now a part. I feel like the most spazzy of three year-olds ran in here with a complaint that no one can decipher I think she was just a guest, not filling in. They've had her and others on (along with Mike) during Casual Fridays.The right-wing way isn't to cite actual evidence, it's to draw conclusions based upon so-called conventional wisdoms like "men are men and women are women" or "supply and demand is an absolute law of economics" and then call it logic and reason. Wrong. Public sector unions raise all wages across the economy. The government is incentivized to cut waste to raise their wages. It is a universal economic fact that ALL reputable economists agree to that unions raise everyone’s wages. In order to not have you join a union job that pays more, employers have to raise your wages and benefits. That’s a fact. Right to work laws require unions to pay for all legal fees and training for nonunion members while nonunion members pay nothing to the union. It is to bankrupt unions.That’s false. Places like New York City and Hollywood have the strongest public sector unions. Places with stronger unions have higher pays across the board. That’s a fact. You’re cherry picking. Those places you talked about would have lower pay across the board without unions. Every reputable study proves that. When you argue against unions, you are also arguing against democracy as well, as I’m sure you know.I legit just had someone tell me both, the majority of research shows that it’s a man and a women who provide the best parents....then when I asked them
To
Cite the source , LITERALLY SAID IT WAS COMMON SENSE HE DIDNT NEED TOThat is what we're dealing with. Tradition as evidence. One of the most basic of logical fallacies, and it's basically the root of most conservative thought. It’s a Supreme Court decision that requires all unions to cover everyone’s fees in the workplace. Common sense would tell you that unions increase wages. They do so by 30% on average. Heritage is not a reputable cite. They are not peer reviewed and are not scientific. All REPUTABLE economists agree to the simple fact that unions (workplace democracy) raise wages across the board. Let me put it this way, if everyone except for one person was in a union, an employer would have to offer them nearly the same wages/benefits so that they don’t join the union. This effect exists even if 10% of people are in unions, just to a lesser extent. Unions always raise everyone’s wages. And you should pay public unions because that is what they are worth. Public unions are still paid lower than their productivity. So you are arguing for further wage slavery. 

P.S. do not ever cite heritage or Cato, they are propaganda sites, not scientific economic data or studies. You do know that unions don’t EVER get union members paid higher than their productivity, so no hours of work are EVER lost. Businesses cannot pay people more than they are worth. Unions help to get wages closer to what they are worth. They help to close the gap between wages and productivity. You do know that people aren’t paid what they are worth in capitalism, right? Uh, no... the best places for minorities to live are places with unions like Washington D.C. Anti-union laws pushed by Republicans actually hurt minorities more than white people because minorities are the most underpaid group of workers. Black real median income peaked under Carter. Detriot’s problems are caused by Reagan starting free trade. Period. Also, countries that are entirely unionized where every single worker is covered by a union like Denmark are better for everyone to live. Here is directly from the government:
“27 states have banned union-security agreements by passing so-called "right to work" laws. In these states, it is up to each employee at a workplace to decide whether or not to join the union and pay dues, even though all workers are protected by the collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the union. “

https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/employerunion-rights-and-obligations

So yes, Republicans are forcing unions to be free loaders to non-union members in order to bankrupt them and lower everyone’s wages. 
Unions also decrease poverty by the way. It’s republicans fault that minimum wage workers aren’t paid what they are worth ($19/hr) they could easily negotiate $15/hr with a union. All of those people suffering and dying prematurely is on your bloody hands. Also, unions directly increase wages and aggregate demand which is the number one driver of economic growth. Nothing grows the economy faster than wage growth. In fact, businesses don’t ever create a single job or invest unless they are simply trying to meet consumer demand. 97 of the 100 poorest counties in America are Republican, anti-union counties as well. But it’s really Hollywood and New York City that are America’s problem! Not third world Alabama with hook worm and no sewage systems! Unions were essential in integrating black people to the workforce post-civil Rights Act and it was all ended by Reagan. Wages went down for everyone across the board under Reagan and we had more economic growth in the 70s than in the 80s.No, all reputable as in left and right wing economists agree that unions lift wages across the board. Internationally in every country this is what economists say.

I could literally give hundreds of sources. This is not a debated issue. Crime is lower under Democrats than under Republicans as well. You’re cherry picking and stereotyping black people, which is racist as well. Taking lead out of the economy for example and legalizing abortion are the two main causes or crime dropping starting in the 90s. All creditable to Democrats. It would have been great if he called him out to his face. In that one discussion they had Jordan went on about how Canada made a law where you had to remember 42 gender pronouns and if you don't use the correct one you get thrown in jail. Harris just basically nodded his head and let him spiel off this nonsense and was just like "yeah that's horrible". 

Do you have no common sense? You'll lose your shit with a liberal if they make any claim that you feel like may be dubious. But with a right winger you'll just let them rant away for ten minutes on some utter nonsense and challenge none of it. Good job. It worries me that people still recommend this guy's book. Even if they claim his politics are bad, they'll be like oh, but he has great advice. I somehow doubt this idiot has anything worthwhile to share. He has an articulate way of speaking , which makes people believe he is intelligent . That’s it .They do not reduce the supply of labor. Unions are not overpaid. That is illogical and not true. Union wages are below their worker’s productivity. Businesses are profitable when hiring exclusively union workers. Union workers are underpaid in the public sector and have been for the past 40 years as well. They are paid much better in Scandinavian countries.

Liberal cities are a dump? What, like Hollywood, New York City, San Francisco, Washington D.C.? You know that liberal cities account for 2/3 of our nation’s GDP, right? 

You’re cherry picking cities, not the larger trend. Under Democrats, crime rates go down and in fact without policies enacted by Democrats, crime would have never gone down over the last 25 years.

You’re very ignorant about the history of unions and civil rights. Unions fought for civil rights alongside Martin Luther King and they integrated black People into the unionized workforce including using racial quotas, in the private sector. Unions are proven to reduce discriminatory pay practices against minorities and are the most beneficial to minorities. This should be common sense. For example, black people are charged more in rent for the same housing as a white person. If black people use collective measures to rent houses, they would have the leverage to reduce this phenomenon. The same is true for unions and pay. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4300995/

Unions help people get paid WHAT THEY ARE WORTH, not more than they are worth. That’s your big misunderstanding about unions. Cops, firefighters, teachers, the military, those that are most responsible for our success as an economy have a right to band together so that they are not exploited and that they are paid somewhat close to their productivity. I’m sure you also know that the Supreme Court just made public unions not allowed to collect union dues but also that unions have to represent everyone even if they don’t pay their dues. They somehow say that unions can’t require everyone to pay dues when they make a contract with an employer. YET, alternatively corporations can put in arbitration clauses and strip Americans of their 7th amendment right to a trial. I have no idea of any other time where you can sign away your constitutional rights. They are activist judges that just make up bullshit as they go along. Additionally, I would point out to you that unions built this country. Almost everything you use was built by unions. 

Not only do unions not decrease the supply of labor, as they are not overpaid, they actual create additional jobs. When a union worker gets a pay raise, they spend that money. And what creates the supply of labor? Aggregate demand. Every single job is create solely to meet aggregate demand. It has nothing to do with supply at all. This is why supply side economics doesn’t work. Businesses won’t invest unless there is demand, not supply. 

And also there is a causal link between unions and higher pay for nonunionized workers. It is caused by shrinking the labor supply of nonunionized workers and directly increasing their bargaining power. I think he sounds like kermit the frog.You missed the point. People would group together with or without the government, no one is arguing that. Molyneaux is saying the only reason these groups pursue goals that are to the detriment of other groups is because of the government, which is ridiculous.Jamie posts here sometimes.So did virgin Jordon Peterson follow traditional hierarchies and let the chad Joe Rogan order his food for him? Ben Shapiro is such a piece of shit. That is a horrifying pictureI hate literally everyone in this pictureYou know, eliminate the word "with" from that title, and that picture takes on a whole new meaning.Not to necro my own thread, but the Dersch with an OUTStANDING late push on July 2, whining about being "publicly shunned on Martha's Vineyard"&gt;  It also shows that governments do little to stop persistent problems, like how the EPA was notoriously absent from the Flint situation.

The Flint situation is 99,5&amp;#37; the DEFINITION of "STATES RIGHTS" issueSounds like he might have a bit of an issue with women thenNo more than what he used to do with Kelly. Michael, Jamie, and Matt are fairly active on the TMBS Discord. Real talk. How old are you? fuck it im downOH MY GOD ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE MORONS Implying they would tip well otherwise. Peterson would be the worst tipper of the bunch hands down. The hierarchy tree from top to bottom:  

Sam Harris (Rogan concedes his top spot for the guy that's "super smart")

Joe Rogan (Fighter/buff/can talk with the dudebros...anyone who isn't "super smart" bows down and curries favor)

Fro guy (No idea who he is but obviously ranked higher than the bottom three; looks relaxed and doesn't take the order to "smile" or "look at the camera")

Jordan Peterson (He's the daddy) 

Shapiro (Talks fast/knows enough political bullshit to be able to spout it off in a debate. If someone threatens him physically he'll talk faster)

Dave Rubin (The little bitch of the group)I just realized the op quoted Rogan. What a moron. I think he gets impatient with her but I'm not a big fan of how she acts on the show so it doesn't bother me as much as it would with someone else. 

Also as was already mentioned, he has a dick-edge to him and no matter who is in her spot I think he would be semi-dismissive. Jamie is my favourite person on the show, why don’t you like her?has neotaster ever come up on the show?  I know hes a giant piece of shit but I don't know if MR has talked about him.It's just my personal opinion. Nothing against her as I've said before I think she's fairly smart and has written some things I've liked. But I don't like how she sounds/acts on the show and I don't agree with a lot of her far left anarcho socialist ideas. 

But I don't agree with Sam or Michael some of the time either. It's just that Jamie seems to preach to the choir whenever she speaks and it gets a little old cause I feel like it's just adding a comment that is fairly obvious. Pretty sure that's a cardboard cutout. &gt;Not even sure, i'm just like ''don't touch my shit and don't tell me what to do'' 

Deep political thinkers. I love them trying to wrap their heads around anarchy and then settling on anarcho-capitalism is real but anarcho-socialism isn't. 

Fascinating. In just a few minutes between themselves they managed to come to the exact wrong conclusion.I believe it's that professor from Evergreen that Rubin brought out when Raygun went to see him.There are a lot of posts lately fretting about Jamie. I think she's a good addition to the show. I could use less of Michael's impressions and more of Jamie's input on issues.

I will say she's much better on Antifada. I dunno what it is exactly that makes her better there besides having much more time to speak.One criticism I have of the show (really just Michael and Jamie) is that they are WAY too soft on the evangelical right. If you grew up around these people, you’d have zero sympathy for them. And guess what, it’s not just a Bible Belt phenomenon. Look at Orange County for Christ sake. Unfortunately people on youtube and some other prominent atheists have given atheism a terrible name. It disgusted me that The Progressive Voice uploaded videos of that AmazingAtheist (TJ Kirk) guy with clickbaity titles of him "owning" someone or whatever. That guy is disgusting and no one on the left should give him the time of day. He supported the insane men's rights removed that gave way to gamergate and all terrible shit that happened during that time. He also literally told a rape victim she should drown in her rapist cum when they were arguing and went on and on about how she would love to be raped again. He even said maybe he should rape her. I'm not even exaggerating and all of this can be found with a google search. 

Yet that progressive voice kid who is generally pretty with it still got taken in by him. For some reason, many guys on the left are able to be cool with a guy if he only attacked women. It's usually racism that won't be tolerated when in actuality neither should be tolerated. 

So I gotta say I'm happy Michael doesn't legitimize people like that. BUT, I 100% agree that Michael is in a serious bubble when it comes to religious people and not getting how extreme it can be in the bible belt and other areas. The religious delusion is real and should not be ignored. Also more evangelicals voted for for Trump than George W. Bush (an actual evangelical). As much as people fret over the unemployed coal miners and the like, don’t forget that the evangelicals have loved Trump for years and are probably more responsible for him being elected. The same shit Trump is doing but with less of a chance to win at reelection? lol wasn't that the guy who said maxine waters "shoved" him? I think this is related to the decrease in money coming to progressive media. Some say it's because of hyper normalization. I think it's partially that, but I think it's also because facebook tweaked their algorithm to deemphasize news in favor of friends and family and shit.

You never see TYT strongly criticize Facebook. It's because their partnered with them.

This what I mean.

[https://digboston.com/my-facebook-feed-is-a-much-dirtier-dumpster-than-it-was-just-two-weeks-ago/](https://digboston.com/my-facebook-feed-is-a-much-dirtier-dumpster-than-it-was-just-two-weeks-ago/)The fact that they killed TYT Sports by letting Francis Maxwell and Jason Rubin walk and then fired Nomiki *before* they got around to firing this clown says a lot about TYT. 

I still like them but Cenk has made some terrible personnel decisions over the past 2 years.The Quebecois cult leader? Nah...Yup. The video of the "shove" is within this article: http://www.newsweek.com/maxine-waters-attacked-journalist-michael-tracey-parallel-universe-maybe-620371 

(spoiler she merely walks by him, Tracey should have been let go by TYT after it was proven he was lying) 

How did TYT end up with so many idiot reporters? Konst was great and seemed like an actual reporter but this guy and that Jordan guy were morons. They seemed obsessed with proving Russia did nothing and everything is fine versus actually reporting on other things. So much this. I really had to do a double take when Cenk hired him in the first  place.  I know that if I had given to money to the TYT pledge drive, I legit would have been demanding my money back if turned around and hired The Trace. My cat is 10 times more interesting at 1/3 the price.I'm surprised they could fire him, I'm pretty sure he's still in a full body cast from the Maxine Waters incident. TYT is a good  liberal organization, it can't afford the bad press involved still in such rough shape.

NEVER FORGET!R.I.P. Big EdHe shouldn't have even been there for a year. Waste of time. There's no convincing the people obsessed with "free speech." More specifically, there's no convincing the young men obsessed with the YouTubers who talk about nothing but "free speech." They enjoy the current fascism. It's not an actual good faith debate.

Only hope is that some of these guys grow up when they reach ~18.That's why I said "normies". Not the actual dark web lol faithful but the sort of people who passively bought the narrative through video games, memes etcI think his Crazy Uncle Liberty called in to defend his honor a couple weeks ago:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdQVrhzpsEI&amp;t=36s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdQVrhzpsEI&amp;t=36s)I really loved this. I hope this guy calls again. They don't get enough crazies to argue with lately. Clip if you have it.Is this the one where Sam is like, **“I was *just* talking about [Jewish Holiday] right before I started taking these calls… How is that ‘crypto’?”**  

L°LI don't really get the urge to punch people very often. I would like to see how their faces would look if they could feel shame though. You know, if that was an emotion that they were capable of experiencing.https://youtu.be/9T-ejSIE-6I?t=2h30m42s

bop bop bopHahaha, she's pretty funny here. Her voice is so much better over the phone and she sounds way more chill than she does on the show. Did she have a drink or two before calling? I hate that feeling of waking up still drunk cause I know I woke up too early. I'm not even American :D. But it seems the MR crew have ready examples on top of their heads so I feel they should "publish" those in list form.That shit always get a laugh out of me. What makes you say he's defending him here? "Have you seen this man?" Cool, how much a pill?  "Died in a shootout with police."Dennis Miller is doing a lot of content lately. Sam and the gang have got to get on that stuff for some lighthearted fun. Before the Harry's dealThat picture is amazing.Another OBVIOUS billionaire funded bullshit network. No doubt it will be successful and get millions of views.

At least they have to give MR money for ads.This guy is part of the "free state movement" in NH, a particularly ridiculous libertarian idea for 20,000 libertarians to literally invade a small state to make over it's politics. If there's any doubt to the latent authoritarianism of libertarians, it's this awful idea.  If they cared so much about individual liberties, just run for city council or something in your own goddamn state.This guy has a real problem with driver's licenses.This is the guy who said at the libertarian debate, "What's next? A license to cook toast in my own damn toaster?!"Whatever agency would have the most force would grant property rights, which would then become a government.Good for Ana, but she's just asking for trouble lol. I can't even imagine the amount of dislikes that video will get. Not to mention all the shit she will get on Twitter from the lobster boys.What’s the significance of the lobster thing?You friend wants to do a lefty version of this? \&gt;still getting adds on youtube.

On another note how come billionaires always fund conservative bullshit?  How about fund something interesting, like anarcho primitivism, posadism or monarchism?He tried to say hierarchies are all natural because lobsters have hierarchies. Not only would this support totalitarianism and be in direct opposition to democracy if taken serious (which according to him only atheists are totalitarians) but it’s also scientifically false as all current evidence shows that our early ancestors did not live in hierarchies as most people think. Power was distributed evenly and women made decisions and hunted. Ancient Egypt even had less hierarchies than today.She’s asking for reasons the DSA should endorse, which would involve using resources to help Nixon’s campaign. It’s different. I only wish they could have killed them more.Remember,  with proper lawyering ( yes,  I know)  all these "Liberty Freedom Fund TV Universities" are  all set up as tax free organizations. By branding themselves as "issue advocacy" groups, they can push an overall agenda and still stan for their billionaires. And all  that funding is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, BABY! Why let the government give it to THOSE people when you can set up a fund to advocate to keep  more of your money, amirite?So you’re arguing against democracy? You, Peterson and Hitler all agree that hierarchies are the natural way. You must think that democracy is idiotic since the peasants lack abilities, right? It really has amazed me how much attention she is getting. I don't think Bernie was ever attacked this much. Maybe an overexageration but it feels like the right hates her more. She's only going to be a Congresswoman from NYC lol. 

It's funny too because they say the left is obsessed with Cortez. It's the exact opposite.I think many of them are fearful on what her winning means. Bernie was just a crazy guy who lost to them. She pulled off what Bernie couldn’t , a giant upset against even worse odds then Bernie faced.She's the convenient ebil hippie lefty whipping girl of the moment. Of course, winning an election in the media capital of the world doesn't help.I don’t think you understand what I mean by hierarchies. I don’t mean that we should have equality of outcome. I mean that people should not have power over another person. Unionizing a workplace decreases the power of the employer and reduces the hierarchy of the corporation for example. I think it is unnatural to work in a nonunionized workplace. Democracy should be extended to work.Looks like Marc Maron.The left really does give Rogan far too much credit. I think that various forms of hierarchy that have been historically normal are not part of human nature or sustainable, such as outlawing unions in Nazi Germany and putting people under direct control of their employers, totalitarianism, slavery etc.Check out Peterson's face when he realizes he's screwed. He gets so pissed off. I can imagine him making that face at women all the time. Sam sort of noticed.NeonBlack666: Agree completely. He's a nice guy and a reasonable human being (and occasionally pretty funny) but I don't think he takes ideas by themselves seriously AT ALL. If he did, of course, he wouldn't have a popular show with a metric fuck ton of famous people lining up to appear. It would harsh everybody's buzz to have too much critical thinking happening because the only people who regularly voluntarily submit themselves to sharp, unrelenting criticism of their ideas are engaged in analytical or scientific careers and not running popular talk shows.

It reminds me of Benjamin Bratton's critique of the TED format in which he says that TED "toys with risk to reaffirm the comfortable" or something along those lines. Rogan gives just enough pushback on guests to make the claim that he engages in critical thought without actually pissing off anybody that much. 

I think he probably takes PEOPLE seriously but I just don't think his personality is one that is going to ever be sharply critical of anything except the most obvious bullshit....

...which is all but useless in a world filled with  SUBTLE bullshit.

In the rest of his interview with Peterson. Rogan gives him a pass on most everything.Postscript: If I had to venture a guess, I would guess that the show probably knows this about Joe and his show but since Joe's audience is so large, they are making a calculated move to reach out to his audience by highlighting and boosting visibility of the small flashes of critical thinking happening on Joe's show in order to get a friendly foot in the door with people who would forever ignore the Majority Report if they saw a headline like "Joe misses another opportunity" or "Joe nods along to another loose head". LOL. link to clip?

i mean, you'd think he'd have an aide or a secretary to review whatever he's suppposed to read on the teleprompter first.

secondly, how is that not bribery?only when he does the right thing. i've actually seen the opposite from the left, hating on him for not critically grilling all of his alt-right guests he seems to have had on lately or "giving them a platform to espouse x."

i understand why he'd have the guests on, for the sake of the views, but it's always a pleasant surprise when he thinks critically and busts people out for hypocrisy especially in this situation. i find him more of a contrarian than anything, seemingly always playing devil's advocate for the sake of encouraging discussion and clarification, or in the case of what's-her-face and climate change denial, an easily digestable clip of fail for youtubers to mock.

i don't regularly watch his podcast though so i'm sort of talking out my ass.classic clip. this is the clip that got me to finally sub to seder's shitHonestly I feel like they are missing out a bit by not doing this. Not enough people criticize rogan and if someone made a habit of it they would get more views because of it. 

It's like when Peterson started becoming popular and there were only a couple youtube videos criticizing him and those EXPLODED with views. Rogan has no one criticizing him and I think people would tune in for the drama if nothing else. 

I agree with the rest of what you said though. Rogan is worthless at best and damaging at worst. &gt;i don't regularly watch his podcast though so i'm sort of talking out my ass. 

Yeah I don't blame you for not watching him. I tried to make it through full shows and it's impossible. The conversation is so vapid and very basic. Really the best way to describe it is if you were sitting in a room with a couple 20 year olds who were slightly high and decided to have conversations about life. 

It's boring and obvious shit that most people have figured out years ago but Rogan is still working out in his head. 
i basically wrote off rogan years ago when, after a night of playing poker at the casino out of town, a friend and i were driving the hour and a half back home and i was trying to explain [the gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy) about how each spin of the wheel, flip of the coin, or deal of a poker hand is an independent action and you can't definitively predict future outcomes from previous results and to not to bother to pay attention to the electric sign that shows you what the past 10 numbers the roulette wheel landed on (apparently it's his favorite game to play, after NLHE) and he just. was not. having it. he was attempting to refute it with his misunderstanding and incorrect definition of [the law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)- note, he didn't know what either of the two of these things were, they just "feel" right to the average layperson- and then he got on 9/11 trutherism and joe rogan.

so after we couldn't come to an agreement with the gambler's fallacy, he pops in his ipod and busts out rogan's podcast on how, you know, jet fuel can't melt steel beams and what about that other building that fell and "it looked like it was blown up" etc etc etc and i just had to shut off and shut up. facepalming mentally the whole way home. it was an awkward drive.

to be fair, this was years and years ago and apparently joe has admitted trutherism is just conspiracy BS and has also walked back his various conspiracy theories, but since that ONE podcast i was forced to listen to in awkward science, it turned me off of him for years.

i just knew him as the guy from the sitcom newsradio who knows "joe-jitsu" and apparently was big in the MMA scene, and suddenly i'm listening to "it looked like a demolition, bro! buildings don't fall like that!"Oh dude, kind of a side note but gambling absolutely confounds some people. I was fairly big into blackjack myself because I obviously was into counting cards. Do you have any idea how stupid most people are at a casino? Well...of course you do. I've been at tables that claim "you play as a team" and had these moronic rules about when to stay and whatnot based on what was good for the table. You have no idea how hard it was trying to explain anything to these people. Obviously not even from a card counting perspective as you wouldn't explain that at the table but just from a logic perspective. 

I remember talking to a guy that got bitched out by another player because he "didn't play right for the table". He was like, shit I had no idea, whoops. I tried to explain to him that that was superstitious nonsense from people that have no idea how a blackjack shoe works. I even went into how card counting works a bit to try and clear some things up. He went all joe rogan and was like "hum...I don't know...they could be right". It's just frustrating. Some people seem unable to follow the type of logic you need for gambling.oh yeah dude, i've seen it a ton. the whole table gets pissed at the drunk guy hitting hard 15 at the end and busting, dealer's showing a 6, turns a 10, and then flips a 5 and everyone loses. "YOU STOLE THE DEALERS 10!!!" it's like, a) let him play how he wants, and b) that's not how blackjack strat or math works (ie "playing teams with the table"). lol.

oops. added link. Yeah, I don't know if it meets any legal definition of bribery but it is definitely some kind of soft quid pro quo. I suppose that in theory you could prank somebody on the left like this but in practice it would be difficult because:

A:) The right generally produces much less funny comedians.

B:) I think your average democratic (or left leaning independent) is probably less likely to make immediate friends with somebody based on shared ideology alone, although it would be interesting to test this hypothesis. The article I read claimed Elon was the "biggest" donor to a certain PAC....which meant he donated something like 48k or something like that...which is pretty small potatoes as far as I'm concerned. 

Certainly not mega-donor status or anything. Maybe this is shocking to people who fancied Elon Musk as some kind forward thinking techno-radicalist and not just another snotty-nosed, temper tantrum throwing billionaire who thinks himself to be some kind of visionary....I’ve been reading the book, which is quite good.Note Kyle says the hack was a good thing and that we deserve to see the DNCs emails. I don't care what your opinion of the party is, that is absurd. 

Keep in mind Kyle and Jimmy are being held up as the leaders of the Justice Dems. and the online progressive world. They get interviews with people like Cortez. You don't think the establishment Dems and GOP won't use that against them? Very dangerous.i dunno who proud boys orange county are or how they're related to MR but i had to link the [relevant reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LAnmnS0-9g)ah.

what are the chances of PBOC having had broken arms as a teenager, i wonder?So Rubin is living in a $1.5 million house. I know it's LA but that still has to be quite the place.

Amazing what crying about "SJWs" can get you. What a world we live in.First off, classical liberal asshole, fuck off and stop trying to muddy the waters.

The IQ test isn't racist all by itself and if you listen carefully I doubt you'll find anybody that states that the test itself is racist.

However, the field of intelligence research is complex and nuanced. Not very many people who have thought very hard about what human intelligence is and all the different ways it can manifest would say that the intelligence quotient test is the ONE TREU WAY to test intelligence. 

The argument is , roughly this: the particular manifestations of human intelligence that the IQ test measures, due to social dynamics, are more likely to be found in segments of the population that have not been historically disadvantaged economically and socially. To look at only a few different types of intelligence,    out of many, and then conclude without further ado that people of color must be genetically or socially inferior because they test lower on these particular measures, is racist because there are several other possible explanations for the data that you would need to account for and then rule out before accepting the inferiority hypothesis as the most likely. The eagerness and careless speed with which some people accept that hypothesis is what is racist, not the mere statement of the hypothesis itself.



Kyle just comes across as so fake. His mannerisms are very Cenk-esque and it makes it hard to watch him. It's as though he's incapable of just being himself and is always partially acting. 

Also, when he has discussed this kind of stuff with Ana, Cenk, etc he comes across as amazingly ignorant. Not just on this topic, but some other political topics as well. He's simply not as savvy as the TYT mains but when he's by himself on his own show he's better at hiding it. 

What a stupidly phrased question. And dangerous. There have been more and more people becoming like them. 

I'm very worried what the future is going to hold for the left with some of what they push for. I feel like we aren't going to be able win major elections anymore. 

But we'll see what happens 2020. The supreme court will be lost and we might get another corporate democrat that they refuse to vote for letting trump get a second term. They'll sit in their rooms with their cameras and talk about how totally pure they are in their ideology and how they have never been a hypocrite. All while the world is burning around them. 
"Hey I'm not racist, I just like to support every argument that shows minorities are inferior and should be policed because outside of the context of them running yummy restaurants for me to dine at, they are a nuisance to society and quite frankly.. they scare me"Is this a 'meninist' group? Lol. Samson Carr thoughtfully and politely offers alternative Satanic viewpoint."And by the way, did I mention I was a nueroscientis?"Something  doesn't add up here, I'll  admit I  don't know a damn thing about Gunn outside he's worked in the movies, but just NOW Cerno  finds these tweets?? This week. Just Now. After he gets this big job. Hundreds? of tweets. NOBODY else found them ever before. Disney's corporate social media team never saw them, his agent never saw them,just Mike Cernovich this  week. Ok.Or it's nothing to see here,  just an asset  inviting his handler for a visit so he can report in. And that's not hating on Russia, that's more of a "Well Played".The culture of many rednecks is shit too, what's your point? That the lack of wealth and lack of access to services can change a community's culture?"Obviously, that's what my wife's sexual position is." I guess this loser wasn't gaining any traction with his TYT videos so now he's going after MR.He is such a dumb fuck.. He says Sam looks like a Rat.. wtf... Guess he is no longer afraid with being overtly bigoted now.This is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Maduro has an approval rating of around 25%. Their elections are also rigged and use fake votes and they have refused to do proper audits. 64% of the public believes that the elections are rigged. There are no separation of powers. Protesting is suppressed, freedom of expression is suppressed, and free speech as well. They have no right to privacy as well. They are prosecuted for any opposition voiced in phone calls and have them broadcasted to the public as well. They are objectively ranked by human rights organizations near the bottom and officially as a “not free” country. It is essentially state capitalism. Maduro is just a CEO running the industries and taking the profit for himself and his cronies. How anyone on the left can support this is beyond me.wtf are you talking about?  It's information related to the show.Yeh I guess Sam should never play or discuss video clips by Tucker Carlson ever again either.Just watch it with adblock on and downvote it.“... cause division and confuse visitors”

Apparently, Jamie’s defense of tactics and rhetorical strategies in opposition to positions taken by Sam and Michael is not problematic for you. But for the love of God, lest we deviate from a singular form of adoration for this show, newcomers won’t be able to handle the incongruence? I sense a sycophant It's his Core Brand Proposition. Dore Brand Proposition?Dude me too. That's fucking weird. The left is so split in a fucked way right now. It also comes from left-wing human rights groups as well. Chavez is not the same as Maduro. Maduro is incompetent and corrupt. He has been personally profiting off of all of the socialized programs and giving profits off to cronies, kind of a form of state capitalism. Not to mention the inflation disaster caused directly by his monetary policy. Jimmy has totally lost it. It's unreal to me that Cenk plugged this guy's show during his rare national TV appearance on CNN.i forget is this the jimmy dore subreddit♫ Ooold Maaaan Raciiiist ♫So Jimmy's a moron. This isn't news to anyone here. Dave Rubin is so dead in the eyes. Jimmy Dore: "Hillary and DNC people!"He was egged on and continues to be egged on. He's making more money because of his brand and now he won't back down unless there is an incentive. Yes, the man who is upset that we can't say "good morning" to girls anymore. That's who I go to for my deep state analysis. Gotta love the anti-semitic take in the comments by Carl of Swindon. If this is something that has happened in the last 6 months or so, I would guess the Cerno affair, sigh"Pressure Drop" by The Clashi live in milwaukee, considered "hyper-segregated" by some. you also gotta understand that like 90% of the rest of WI is white, for context. everybody's allowed everywhere of course, nobody's saying "we don't want your kind here" like a tatooine cantina, everyone in the city proper is chill and inclusive (unlike some of the suburbs outside the city) poor white people live in the hood, middle class black people and students live on the east side and vice-versa, and i have to drive through the hood to get to the better area (ie, said outskirt suburbs) on the other side of the hood to get to work.

my question to you is how would you fix that? when rent is ~$300 in the hood with row upon row of tightly packed residential areas squished between dirty alleys with nothing around for miles (which necessitates a car or heavy reliance on public transit, since cabs won't bother picking you up in the hood under the assumption they're going to get stiffed), or twice as much or more for a *tiny* single room and a closet for a kitchen studio in the decent neighborhood, but with off-street parking and the convenience of low crime and walking distance to downtown, restaurants, pharmacies, bars and clubs, schools, hospitals, banks, etc.

the hood is going to remain the hood until there's beneficial reasons to move there. we're talking major overhauls of the entire neighborhood and the city won't even fix their roads. and nobody's going to move out of the east side until it becomes too expensive to live there, and when it does, they'll move to said suburbs outside the city. and nobody from the hood is going to move to the east side until they have the income to do so, of which is nigh impossible because of the lack of opportunity most residents in the hood (in general) has. i assume many people in the hood actually have enough technically to live in the better neighborhoods, but that would leave it impossible for them to save much or have emergency funds or money for leisure.

THEN, we've got a problem with flophouse landlords that fuck over people in the hood- we actually revoked one landlord's license recently because of how badly he was treating his tenants, and another one, dubbed ["the boulder guy" because he lines his properties with boulders ostensibly to prevent people from parking their vehicles on the lawns, is currently under scrutiny for things such as renovating the house by locking tenants inside until it's done or renovating the basement and moving people's shit outside without notice, not to mention predatory late fees and litigating eviction notices multiple times on single tenants that are usually settled in civil court for the plaintiff, ie boulder guy wins more money by being over litigious to his tenants that clearly don't have the resources to fight.](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2018/07/13/hell-evict-you-minute-milwaukee-landlord-amasses-empire/698406002/)

people in the hood are gettin' fucked man.

milwaukee county is solidly blue in WI but yet we were also under the thumb of cowboy-hat-clad trump-dick-sucking uncle tom dave clarke who has a hard-on for fucking with black people. the entire city (as much as i love it) is a big contradiction.He's the ultimate math nerd. Do you see? i'm coming from a non-white citizen standpoint, who lives on the decent part of town, so i'm just describing what i see.

&gt; First of all, you're wrong. Yes, you're TECHNICALLY allowed anywhere, but Black people will get the stares. They'll be watched

this is true, at least from LEO- for example the milwaukee bucks player that was tased on the east side (the nice side of town) at a local walgreens (iirc). just happened a week or two ago. if you're black driving a decent vehicle on the good or bad side of town late at night i'm assuming police are going to assume you're slangin' rock. i'll give you that.

&gt; and sometimes there are specific ordinances, such as what NYC had until 2014, that prevent people from using certain mainentrances of buildings, otherwise known as "poor doors."

we don't have any such ordinances afaik.

will read and respond to the rest of your post after i've absorbed and thought about it a bit.

edit: after reading your response i agree with most of what you said, especially having equal access to quality education. that in my opinion is the biggest problem plaguing milwaukee. my brother-in-law taught in the hood and has horror stories of students, the likes of which i never experienced at my HS. we didn't have metal detectors at my HS. we didn't have a constant police presence at my HS (besides a single "liaison officer"). we didn't need to physically restrain out-of-control students. i've read a bit about the lead-in-the-water thing and it seems like common sense to me.

my question is how do we ensure everyone understands the plight of segregation when we have some of the most popular youtube edgelords claiming that racism doesn't exist? i had a family member say to me a while back, "did you hear about that guy got shot in his backyard? you know, seeing the footage, i don'-" and i stopped him and was like, "you mean the guy shot in his own backyard, in the back, multiple times, caught on camera?" and he replied, "yeah," and finished his thought- "you know, seeing the footage, it's hard to blame the police." it's like, are you shitting me?? he was shot IN THE BACK with his HANDS UP! this is a guy that also wants all teachers armed in schools. "we should at least try it," he says.

we're constantly bombarded with opposing perspectives that skews the public's general awareness. what can you do about that? my only solution is better education, better education, better education.How is the weather in Peyson, Arizona today? 

Chicago! DRINK! Detroit! DRINK!  Did you know that the Democrat party FOUNDED THE KKK?????!!!!????

The O.P. is yet another name for Justus McNeal, long time troll from the MR chat room. At least he's using the same anecdotes.

Shorter O.P.: Why haven't you stupid liberals fixed the problems when I actively oppose your efforts to fix them?Yeah Democrats have had problems with racial policy in cities.  Okay now here is a question.  

Black people in the United States were mostly brought here as slaves to work in agriculture.  Like you just said, they mostly live in big cities now.  So they went from the most rural to the most urban population, even though the cities treated them horribly.  Do you know why?

Because the rural life was far worse.Don't be, it was meaningless before, it will be just as meaningless after. It only mattered to Dore's dead enders to try to rationalize his political naivete/bad faith/grifting  take your pick.Liberals aren't a monolith, I don't think every conservative was the reason for the terror black people faced that led to the Great Migration of black people from rural to urban.  Liberals as a group are far better on race tho.The larger story is how Dore and Secular Talk have totally stalled since the summer of '16. Dore more so but really both of them. Their channels have had almost zero growth while MR has gained subs faster than I've ever seen on progressive YouTube.&gt; Jimmy called Sam a failed comedian and has avoided debating Sam except for one time he called MR and made a total dumbass out of himself.

ah, you mean that one time where he was like "uh, my reception's bad, let me call you back" and sam was like "we'll call YOU back" and he (to my ears) seemingly begrudgingly accepted his fate of being busted out as a hack on TMR. and then basically the whole time made a bunch of self-deprecating jokes and insubstantial comments and "maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong, we'll see."

i listened to that call recently and their debate about the supreme court. my god, how wrong jimmy dore was. proof is in the goddamned pudding man, look at what's happening this year alone. fuck.China is 74% public sector GDP. It’s primarily a staterun, centrally planned and communist economy.China throws free marketers/libertarians into that full on "Does not compute" mode if they are in any way honest. Of course, the chances of a good faith libertarian 1 in a billion.Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uhh

Ooooooooooooohhh

Love that partIronically I found [the one I was looking for](https://m.soundcloud.com/tartmpls/mr-fun) on the subs front page like 5 mins after I made this thread.

Thanks for the help thoI wish Binder never left MR. He probably does too.clever subreddit name.So when you talk about blue collar workers losing their factory jobs (cough cough white people) that is bad? Why? That is a legitimate issue that impacts people of a certain identity. So we shouldn’t talk about transgender issues? Or racism? That’s what not talking about identity politics means. Trump won on white identity politics.&gt;Trump did NOT win on white identity politics.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
What absolute horseshit! And to write this 18 months into the Trump administration can  no longer be blamed on naivete.I disagree slightly. When Michael is on his game, him being there makes the show better. He's much better than Jamie or Matt even when he's off his game. I like Jamie but I'm annoyed with the revolution stuff. It seems like everyone else then feels the need to move as left as she is. It's still Sam's show.

I'm more annoyed at the whole show overall. It's been a bit down for almost this entire year. I think it was better in 2015-2016. Lots of rushed shows, taking only a few phone calls and wasting time on Old Man Racist, "forgetting" to turn on IMs, etc. When Sam isn't there, it's a socialism circle jerk.I wouldn't know about shows on days when Sam isn't there. I don't even tune in because it's all about Michael and stroking his ego. I personally enjoy Jamie and Matt a whole lot better then Michael because to me it seems like they are not as desperate for attention and acceptance and to be seen as funny. To me Michael comes off as an arrogant insufferable know-it-all and it ruins the show every time. When I was really little kid I was watching comedy with my great-aunt and I'll never forget we were watching this one comedian who was terrible and he would laugh after every joke he told and my aunt looked at me and said you know it's a bad comedian when they have to laugh at their own jokes. I'm paraphrasing but that was the gist. She was right. Dogwhistle? That's not a dogwhistle. That's a referee blowing an airhorn directly in your face while yelling "seig heil".Hillary had a 60% approval rating as Secretary of State first off. She also adopted over 90% of Bernie’s platform and officially ran on the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.I agree with that totally. He knows his shit on a lot of topics. He is smart there is no denying that. I don't mind when he is teaching me something I don't know, but that's really a small fraction of the time he spends on air, it's mostly just working on an impression or telling a too smart for the room joke. I guess what I'm trying to say is when it comes to Michael's jokes I'm looking for less quantity. Sometimes less is more. I wish he understood that. I would enjoy the show so much more. After 5??years on the show he should know by now that interrupting callers to make a small wisecrack COMPLETELY derails the call. It's not like in the studio, where the other people can see him talking. He interrupts, and it's just a series of pauses until Michael shuts up and the caller can adjust again. Hello?
This is radio talk show 101 stuff.this has irked me before. whenever he imitates seder in a joking manner he uses the super stereotypyical nasally "you call this a bagel?" woody allen-esque impersonation too.

i've gotten used to it and know that he's not doing it to disparage whoever (unless it's someone worth disparaging).

he's an acquired taste; it took me a while to come around to him too.i absolutely despise hearing it. at the risk of sounding like a stereotype, it literally triggers me. i associated it with times ive felt my life was in danger :/has he used anti black slurs too? i haven’t seen that :/yes, i know it’s the joke, but he can mock trans people in character without using slurs. if you can mock racists without saying the n word, you don’t need to use other hateful slurs ooh that’s very truei know that, i’m not devoid of
humour, i just think usually such hateful language is going too far for an impression You've gotta remember that Michael is Jewish, too. Even if he doesn't identify that way. See, but if he did an impression of Peterson and, in character, he was respectful to trans people, wouldn't be significantly more offensive? i think you’re missing what i’m saying. when he’s imitating peterson, yes he can mock trans people, obviously that’s the whole joke. but is it necessary that he uses really hateful slurs that no trans person is okay hearing? i do impressions of racist people all the time, but i don’t go shouting the n word while i am, because i think that’s over the lineI get you. Not sure I'd put it on the same level as the N word but I hadn't really thought of it like that. yeah i didn't know that until he mentioned it in passing a few days ago. he said something like "and just in case people are offended, i'm part-jewish" and then moved on.

the "stereotypical nasally jew" imitation was used a bunch as a laughing point for the alt-right in the unite the right rally (see [shaun's video on charlottesville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcoYKuoiUrY) for a firsthand, recorded example.

and i don't like to give people on the opposite side convenient, fallacious excuses to start normalizing the behavior (ie, "token person of whatever ethnicity X says/implies it's okay to say it, so it's okay for me to say it," a la fox news when they get the one token black conservative to bitch about how the dems are pushing identity politics and they don't care about black people).

it reminds me of when i was an edgelord teen; i used to drop the n-bomb with a soft "a" at the end all the time with my friends, but when i attended uni i was immediately called out on it by one of my new roommates. i made a half-assed excuse like, "i'm not white, it's okay for me to say it" (i'm asian) and laughed it off.

not quite the same thing, but just a personal anecdote.

i'm not trying to police people's language, i'm just saying practice what you preach. my best white friends don't imitate me by going "ching chong ding dong me so solly!" because there's a mutual respect there and they understand that even if they're kidding (of which i would be fully aware of that), it would get irksome after a while.

like i said i've mentioned this before in this sub, it's not a *huge* deal but and i'm coming around to him more and more because a lot of his insight is useful and thought-provoking but it's like, eh.i don’t think it’s at the same level either, but it’s still a really hateful slur that every trans person has been called derogatorily i’ve been called that word many times in my life, mostly it’s from right wing assholes on the internet, usually accompanied with something like “kill yourself”. i’ve also been called that by crowds of drunk college boys walking home a few times, by security guards, by cops, by bus drivers, and by classmates in school. the worst few times i’ve been called that was when i was jumped and robbed, when i had a knife held to me, and when i was pushed to the ground by some drunk bro. i associate that word with hate and my life being in danger. it’s a hateful slur used to dehumanize trans people, and don’t you dare tell me i’m overreacting when i say i hate that word. spend one day as a visible trans person and see if you find these slurs so hilarious and again, i know it’s satire, but i think it’s in really poor taste to actually use that wordi’m part of a marginalized group, and i’m telling you right now, some words are offensive on their face regardless of contexti don’t need a cis person lecturing me on what i should find offensive. you’d be hard-pressed to find a trans woman that’s okay with being called that (except maybe like blair white probably)i think you’re being deliberately obtuse right nowIn the end I fell asleep. My body knew to initiate shut down protocol.  Thank you body. Yes he has -- about 1 out of every 3 Jeff Sessions ends in one, and 3/4 of his "New York Wise Guy" that he uses for  Paul Manafort will  lead into one if he goes long enough. It may not be the actual N word, but they are there. i’m not sure you know what an “extreme leftist” isI just don’t want class warfare rhetoric to considered hate speech. I lost faith in Abby Martin a couple years ago when she pushed 9/11 trutherism (perhaps she always had, and I had just noticed). I no longer follow her close enough to know whether or not she has backed off this, but now I can't see any link anyone posts of her work without a warning siren going off in my mind.Well that was a crime.It isn’t. No more than class surrender rhetoric from the right is considered hate speech.I think Kulinski would have to change his entire world view if he admitted these facts:
1. We intervened in Bosnia entirely on humanitarian grounds
2. We have foreign policy objectives directly contrary to Saudi Arabia. These include the Iraq War, the War against the Taliban in Afghanistan, humanitarian aid in Yemen, etc.What if he's just having him on his show to complain about other less pure leftys?Anyone have a TL;DR on this? I don't want to sit through it. What if I said the entire DeVos family should be guillotined? I actually hold this belief.Kyle may have more of his shit together but he is extremely ignorant. Reminds me a bit of that Progressive Voice kid. When they are scripted on their video and plan what to say they can come across as knowing about politics. Add another person or just talk off the cuff and they are both ridiculous lost on topics they should know about by now. 

Tbf, the progressive voice kid is a literal kid and I would say he'll get better but Kyle never did. Now that guy is definitely beyond the age of being an adult and he's still a moron. Once he said that we should ignore NATO I determined he's a piss of shit moron. 

"Hey Kyle what should we do if Russia invades a country in NATO?" 

"Nothing." 

"But the whole point of that treaty is that countries in it must assist each other with armed forces if necessary" 

*shrugs* "WW3 tho" 

Wow what a beautiful political mind. The dude is as politically correct as it comes. I find it weird when people claim he's offensive when he does his voices since it's so mild. What word could he use in place of trannies when mimicking peterson? Jimmy's occasional guest/fellow traveler, Randy Credico, apparently after playing cute about meeting with the Meuller investigation voluntarily, has now been formally subpoenaed. Good thing this whple Russia thing is a hoax or maybe he should be concerned.

Unrelated note: Anyone heard from Max Bloomenthal lately?Yeah, he would have opposed entering World War II early and saving lives. He would have opposed ending genocide in Bosnia. He opposes the main goal of neoconservatism today, which is to prevent another global power from arising that could bring global tyranny (it is possible for us to be conquered, which most people forget) and to use military force to control global resources which could be used by China or Russia to attain that status as superior to the United States. I see absolutely no valid argument against that. Neoconservatives actually aren’t conservative across the board and they can have social democratic views.Yeah, NATO actually prevents WW3. Having no fly zones and stopping Russia from being able to expand and control crucial territory in the world and the natural resources of their territories also prevents WW3.Just inheritance tax them at 95% and setup an economy that prevents them from regaining that concentration of power/tyranny.It's kind of a moot point. Conservatives while in power will push for restricting the free speech of protestors (i.e. kneeling NFL players and [hate speech bills against police](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/protect-and-serve-act/index.html)). So while they are doing that anyways, the left should also be concerned with guarding protected classes against hate speech and curbing the racists. Because even if the left doesn't push for their speech laws, the right is going to push for theirs. And like an open supreme court seat, they aren't going to just suddenly manifest ethics and curtail themselves. Hate speech laws work well in Canada and Europe. Facebook is not the same as a government. Hate speech laws would be made by we, the people, not a corporation. We already restrict hate speech in private organizations and in public schools (although not colleges) and it works well. All other restrictions on free speech that we have work well.
And the same people would make it that make our anti-defamation laws today.
Additionally, once you cite Glenn Greenwald, you have officially face-planted. He made an entire article you cited based upon anecdotes and didn’t show you countries like Australia without those minor problems. Additionally, the Supreme Court would define the limits of restricting hate speech as they have done with defamation. BLM can’t be sued for defamation against police officers, even though defamation laws are legal. Additionally, pro-Palestinian views are right-wing, not left-wing. Palestinians are to the right of Israelis across the board on policy issues. We also restricted communist activity in the United States and we seemed to have crushed communism here, as compared to Europe that banned right-wing fascism but not communist speech in general.caller: we can hopefully teach them but at least their hearts are in the right place.

["my family can't live in good intentions, marge!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baxgfH1G980)

he has a point on needing more candidates to know the basic issues better- in fact better than better, they need to know their shit straight-up. otherwise it'll make us look like jokes.

case in point- [cori bush's pathetic non-responses recorded by fox, only to be used moments later to bait kyle kulinski into a catch-22 and have their collective trumpist audience scoff at how ridiculous our ideas are.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kKNBKwJc8I&amp;feature=youtu.be)

right-wing populism won trump the presidency; sure, but it's not a long term strategy. doing left-wing populism is giving AoC and others a platform and a lot of media now, but what about the long term? we need to play the long game.

also thread title is misleading. he was clearly, verbally "playing devil's advocate" to clarify what the caller meant re: corporate money. obviously he was point was "just because magically disappears doesn't automatically make the person more reputable or trustworthy on the issues, and to be skeptical and on-guard for any shenanigans from either party.i'm assuming a LOT of their videos get demonetized for all sorts of reasons. hence the shilling for toothbrushes and the patreon/donations/membership.

him screming the n-bomb willy-nilly and being totally receptive to dropping his to pants to do a backwards jog with his fat ass flopping around screaming "i'll make you gay!" is totally worth getting demonetized over. or even a content strike.

people are sharing the individual clips from the show all over youtube now though. typically the owner (showtime in this case) issues a copyright notice via youtube, in which youtube gives you the option to appeal, change the content to remove the copyrighted material, or just do nothing and let showtime get the monetization. no actual strikes happen, the channel is still in good standing, showtime gets their money, the end.Majority report is not comparable to them at all. The majority report does not make up lies or conspiracy theories. Dore and Kulinski routinely push right-wing conspiracies like Clinton Foundation bribery conspiracyIt was enforced in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. I’m referring to Taft-Hartley too, making unions swear not to be socialists or communists.
And conservative Justices are the most likely to support hate speech laws. It is liberal justices that are the most supportive of free speech if you look at ideological scoring.&gt; Washington white nationalist rally sputters in sea of counterprotesters

&gt; Ginger Gibson, Jonathan Landay

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A white nationalist rally in the heart of Washington drew around 20 demonstrators and hundreds of chanting counterprotesters on Sunday, the one-year anniversary of racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. 

see photos of the epic failure [here (also reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/pictures-report-idUSRTS1X3JU)Negative. That’s if being a liberal or conservative is against the terms of service which it isn’t. Tactics such as using deaths threats are against the terms of service. YouTube also censors porn. Send this to Dinesh D’SouzaCant say I orgasm when that happens.&gt; Aitan Goelman, Strzok’s attorney, said in a statement that FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich made the decision to terminate his client.

&gt; The decision, Goelman added, was at odds with a recommendation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Office of Professional Responsibility, which had called for Strzok to face a 60-day suspension and demotion from his supervisory responsibilities.

&gt; “The decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical Bureau practice, but also contradicts Director Wray’s testimony to Congress and his assurances that the FBI intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters,” Goelman said. As soon as they admit that black people switched parties, they will have a hard time continuing their lie.I'm thinking it's more like that Riker/Picard double facepalm meme.When you gettin social, but she still secure. Whenever a Dennis Miller/Sam Harris/Jordan Peterson video is released. 

These guys have got to get some more riffing going I tells ya!I've said it before but I'm pretty certain he was egged on by russian bots/trolls/right-wingers. 

You know how messy it got during the election. I remember bernie subreddits being filled with nothing but anti-hillary stuff and even some right-wing sentiments like anti-abortion. 

Youtube was no different. It got filled with these maniacs and trolls that gave Dore an insane following and told him how stupid Cenk and everyone else was. You still see some posters like this on Kyle's and Jimmy's videos. It makes them feel smart. In their mind, they outsmarted Cenk, Ben and all the "mains" people on TYT. Now they are the ultra left. They are the cool edgy kids that are still in touch with the true progressives. 

It's more about having a brand for themselves than any kind of real political identity. On another note I wish Kyle would stop mimicking Cenk. I wonder if he knows where he begins and Cenk ends anymore. He's encompassed that persona so hardcore he can't get out of it. I kind of see the same thing happening to that progressive voice kid. Do we need so many of these samey, got their world views from the general political current during the time they were in their teens, lefties? 

Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh yeah Jimmy's a moron.

or any other number of compositions, he made a bunch of em.That is a disgusting, shameful comment. McCain shares a worldview with liberal interventionists such as FDR, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton with the goal of creating democracies which are proven to create peace.Being a war monger has absolutely NO relation to being a fascist. Do you even know what a fascist is? Clearly you don’t. Ordinary Americans who are being endangered by Trump breaking and eroding our alliances to benefit Putin and Russia. I used to feel this way until the show became a socialism circle jerk.

The glory days of this show were 2015-2017.

Still love it though.Capitalist pig. Better than David Pakman who is as entertaining as a brick wall. Link? I can't find this call. 

Michael's texting annoys me sometimes. He does it constantly. Sometimes it feels like he checks out if he's not the one currently speaking. I can't listen to chapo because their audio is so bad. The voices slightly waver in and out. It's slight, but annoying. Why do they have such bad audio? That's a real good edit. Pretty convincing. His brain tumor works hard to keep him out of office. It doesn't have time for something like this. No 🙂. Just dont like seeing people being treated poorly. Its not a major deal, but he was a bit of an ass
How are you this bad at writing? You wrote one sentence and fucked it up more than this guy's genetics fucked him. 

Within your first six words you said essentially the same thing twice; then you go on to say "stand in the way of blocking". 

So according to your title, this state of mind is blocking the blocking of progressive economics. So...this state of mind is helping our economic goal by opposing anything that tries to block progressive economics? 

Also who or what is *this* that you speak of? The guy in the video's state of mind? Or is *this* referring to something he is referencing. 

Did you even glance on what you typed out before you smashed that submit button? Ok, they don't want to see you so you don't go. Sounds like the system is working. I've noticed the guests Michael brings in for TMBS all go on their phones too. Yup. It's bullshit but I don't see anything coming from it. 

Although, the investigation should go forward and I hope I'm wrong, but no matter how guilty he or anyone else is I just feel like they'll get away with everything. He barely won in 2016 and liberals had low turnout rate compared to conservatives due to not thinking Trump had a chance of winning. 1) The space trash issue is real, thousands of tiny objects, all  travelling in uncharted directions -- it's not the mass, it's the velocity. The caller was correct, just poorly spoken. But to his point as using it as a basis for political opposition? That's nuts! MAGA is convinced they'll just turn on the shileds and Pew Pew! all will be good silly libtards!

2) The truth is, except for Raygun, LoPacco and Brenda, CALLERS ARE BAD. They just are, they take too long to realize they are even on, nearly all have to toss greetings to EVERY MEMBER OF THE MR TEAM, then have to preamble to  even get to the point of their call. Then their point might not be even worth listening to. I used to listen to sports radio all day in  on the road, I remember a national host pointing out just how bad callers actually are.

3)The MR staff frankly, doesn't help. No one other than the host should speak to the caller unless requested to. When Sam is hosting, and Michael or Jamie start talking to caller, it is VERY noticeable how distracted the caller  gets. If you're not hosting, wait until after the call is over to add your two cents.Frankly he should have told Old Man Racist to lose his number during his third call.Space Magnets, bitches!  that solves 50% of your problem right there! (That can probably get me a $5,000,000 Space Force consulting contract)&gt;due to not thinking Trump had a chance of winning. 

I can see this mindset being repeated and we get a second term. &gt;But to insist that people with long noses must have genetically equal IQ with those with short noses or any other trait is just silly.

Real scientists don't "insist" on their hypothesis being true. They look at the evidence and they make a determination of whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support it.

&gt;It’s correlation not causation.

I don't know if you know this but there are things in the world that are not correlated with each other. To use your nose example, there may actually be no discernible correlation between nose size and intelligence.

To me it sounds kind of silly to expect a measurable correlation between relative nose size and intelligence.

Even more ostensibly ridiculous IMO is to expect a correlation between melanin content in skin and intelligence.

But again all you can really say as a scientist is that there has been no correlation scientifically established as of right now.

&gt;“black people”

Just out of curiosity, how do you define  “black people”?Trump himself no, but ANYONE other than Ivanka  (looking directly at you, Junior) is cannon fodder to sacrifice to save Mango Mussolini (There is a lot of dirt on Jared, btw, the guy is an idiot). However, a lot of these guys are cutting some pretty sweet deals to roll over. George Papadopolous (sp?) supposedly is only looking at 6 months and keeping his couple mil. Nice work. 

The thing is though, the rest of the GOP is either in on it or complicit. We know McConnel, sessions, Ryan and McCarthy knew, Nunez aided &amp; abetted and Rohrbacher has been bought off for years. The rest of the GOP has gone along with it. The GOP must be removed from the political stage otherwise God only know who they will sell this country out to next time. (Somebody hide the Klingons' phone number fer chrissakes!)wouldn't it be easy enough to do a study of adopted black children from the age of toddlers to upper middle class, white families vs adopted black childen in lower class, white families and have the control just be black children born in a typical black neighborhood, and compare test score results?

i hypothesize it would pretty clearly show that environment is what's going to be the big determining factor on how they perform in school; ie it's a class thing, not a biological thing. this just seems like common sense to me and i'm surprised it hasn't been done yet.&gt;But the point is that there is no such thing as race scientifically. So it doesn’t matter.

It matters that there is no such thing as race scientifically. If the terms of your hypothesis are not properly defined then whatever the results are will be uninterpretable.

In other words, if we cannot properly determine what the words "intelligence" "white people" or "black people" mean then the hypothesis cannot have value.Is this a drunk post? 

Few people think the things you claim they think. Everyone knows we have a de facto two party system and not a three party system. 

Your definition of “more democratic” is actually the opposite.

The de facto two party system in the US is bad and we shouldn’t further enshrine it in law.  Any change to do so would be idiotic and further enable the oligarchy in the US.

We should abolish the electoral college instead. Using non-standardized, non-genetic, non-scientific definitions to make conclusions about the underlying genetics of groups is a recipe for bad science and wrong conclusions. To say "well, I know it when I see it." is just not good enough.

For example, if someone were to repeat the experiment could they be sure that they are using the same definitions? If an experiment is not repeatable then it is largely worthless.Those definitions are non-standardized, non-genetic, non-scientific and they change over time. You can read about that here: [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/12/the-changing-categories-the-u-s-has-used-to-measure-race/](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/12/the-changing-categories-the-u-s-has-used-to-measure-race/)

&gt;Racial categories, which have been included on every U.S. census since the first one in 1790, [have changed from decade to decade](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/chapter-1-race-and-multiracial-americans-in-the-u-s-census/), reflecting the politics and science of the times.

They are the best the census bureau can do on a national level but they are by no means scientifically accurate in terms of genetics. They are more about *perception* than the underlying genetics. In America, discrimination is largely based on *perceived* genetics rather than *actual* genetics.

They also rely on self reporting which I'm sure as you know can dramatically change the results of an experiment.You didn’t respond to anything I said. Yeah, he's boring. I don't think he believes anything in particular. I wouldn't call it a joke, a refrain or meme maybe, but they rarely if ever say it jokingly.Go back and watch his interview with Benjamin Dixon from a few weeks ago. They basically talk about where it all started. r/galaxybrain&gt;Racial categories are social constructs. But social constructs are real. You do admit that we can enforce civil rights, right?

Of course we can enforce civil rights, but that is entirely beside the point. Social constructs are *real* ***socially*** but are not necessarily scientifically standardized.

&gt; I cannot self report to be a Jew and sue someone as anti-Semitic, no. 

you CAN convert to Judaism and sue someone for employment discrimination IF they discriminate against you for your religion or how you identify racially.Doesn’t bother me[Hitler’s American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law](https://majorityreportradio.com/2017/08/23/823-james-q-whitman-hitlers-american-model-the-united-states-and-the-making-of-nazi-race-law) is an interesting one I think about.

He doesn't define socialism right and then he says communism and socialism are interchangeable.Who the fuck would pay to go to this?I hope not. I like Cenk but stuff like this is pointless. Progressives who watch shows like TYT don't care about this type of thing. For the right wing losers like Shapiro it's another event to promote their brand and a chance for his fans to make YouTube videos saying "he OWNED the libs."i dont recall sam ever going in the pastWTH is a "Baby Trump"? I'm legit afraid to google. (But my comedic urge wants to riff SO BADLY)

WWE's Kane will be there so mebbe Binder will go instead!Do you seeTrump was quoted as saying: "My Pecker has betrayed me. SAD!"

Trump's Pecker could not be reached for comment at this time.Not just scandal, scandals, The Pecker has been casting a shadow for Trump for at least 15 years.And now Alan Weisselberg, long time CFO of the Trump org. has also flipped. The ship be sinking. Weisselberg, even more than Trump, knows where the bodies are buried.Hey hey hey hey shut up!Sam, you're literally a bigot because you're not bisexualI want Daryl Perry to come back on.Honestly man, the only thing that matters from those are the first two; as those two reasons are why he has a job. 

The third is debatable. I'm convinced a lot of his user base is a mixture of fake accounts, ultra casual viewers (they don't watch enough tyt/dore to even know where anyone stands on russia), and like 5% of really angry stupid leftists who LOVE bitching out other leftists more than anything. 

Also, the ultra casual viewers would watch whatever you put in his place. They just have youtube on autoplay and watch a little here or there. 


&gt;They both wanted Trump and his liberal policies.  

What do you mean? Jimmy can't be reached. He doesn't want to learn, he wants to be right. Steve said that too? UghWell that's very disappointing. I always put steve a little more on the ben side where he is fairly level headed. 

Also, that train of thought is just incredibly immature. Someone at Steve's age should really know better. I think Cenk needs to be punch in the gut before he'll cut someone loose that he considers a friend. 

I don't even think Rubin was let go. He left. They won't let anyone go unless it's for financial reasons. &gt;-Privatized the state (ended collectivist democracy)

Not just that, the term "privatized" comes from The Economist magazine describing Nazi Germany policy. https://www.etymonline.com/word/privatization

&gt;-Banned truth (burned books and killed progressive college professors)

they will go into some bs about campus free speech

&gt;-Believed in strict individualism and social Darwinism (survival of the financially fittest)

Not exactly, they were uber nationalistic and co-opted or started organization to indoctrinate and tie the idea that the country is in a Darwinist struggle and only a pure race would succeed.

to add

- Never won a majority of seats and only came to power by forming a government with the center right party Centrum.

- The enabling act was supported by all the right wing parties.  All left wing parties voted against or couldn't vote

- The concentration camps first victims were socialist and communist.

-  Marie-Louise Giraud was the last woman guillotined in France was killed by the Nazi for providing abortions.

No, but you do have to like WatchMojo to appreciate the link - which we do not. You might find some libertarians calling out stuff like this but the wider conservative movement as a whole won't, because they only care about this shit when Democrats do it.

Have you really not noticed this hypocrisy before? A prime example of this is the never ending concern-trolling about the deficit, then Trump gets into office and passes the tax cut which increases the deficit. They don't actually care about this stuff, it's just talk.I know for a while some other reddit forums had actually linked MR and said "Teach this liberal a lesson and call in". Obviously, it never goes well.Perhaps Mueller just got tired of waiting on the IRS to complete its' annual audit of Trump?Not just libertarians but anyone who is just plain wrong about shit. 

I really need more clips like the one above. Sure you have the racist IQ guys here and there, and those are great. But it feels like once every two weeks we get something like this. Which is not nearly enough. Right-wing Mandela is the perfect ending to these types of calls. Sorry, but he's dead and hence perfect now. Porn is just an easy, mostly cut-and-dry thing to point to as something that some platforms might want to reasonably remove. Not to mention, it would be something that could easily instantly flood any platform if given the opportunity. The type of opportunity that would be granted if you had to take every person to court before you could take down their 5 minute video. 

So Steve isn't "preoccupied" with porn. It's just such an obvious example of something that could potentially take over a website and be impossible to control if you don't put strict limits on it.I really don't see it that way at all since it has to do with explicit content instead of just the free speech issue.

He was trying to steer the conversation away from the idea of youtube only banning political enemies and so the easiest, most obvious example of something they might want to ban that is apolitical is porn. The grander argument doesn't matter at the moment. We should really take into context who is saying what and why they are saying it.  They are authoritarians and want everybody to think their ideas are good."whenever i google myself all it shows me is the gobsmackingly, unbelievably stupid things i've done in public."

"why doesn't it show me all the lies i tell myself and fox news about how great i am?"

google is like the magic mirror in snow white, but instead of "magic mirror in my hand, who is the fairest of the land?" or "mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?" it's...

"google, google, inside my tv, why won't you just say nice things about me?"I don't even know what you are going on about. Did you get banned from all the major subs? Robert McNamara died  expressing similar feelings regarding Vietnam. Deathbed conversions don't let you off the hook, sorry.In 25 years of Bathe Rule it's like 250k killed, US invasion and occupation since is around 500k so no.

Iraq was also our puppet.  

&gt;2. Non-proliferation treaty Iraq had used WMDs against Iran and its own people 

Hmmm where do you think he got those from?!?

The US also did all 1-4 of those to other countries and poeples.&gt;500,000 deaths from forcing Iraqis to serve in the military during the Iraq-Iran war. 

This is a war America helped and wanted.  We backed him up.  That's where Saddam got those chemical weapons.

&gt; 180,000 deaths from chemical warfare on the Kurds 180,000 deaths from bombing southern Iraq 200,000 deaths

Yeah we really shouldn't have ratcheted up that quasi-genocidal war between the Shia and Sunni.  

&gt;And no, the death toll of the entire Iraq War is roughly 200,000 officially. No need to lie. We saved lives in the long-run. 

Our invasion is a direct cause for the rise of AQ-I and ISIS which did not exist in the region before the invasion.  I cited my source and I'm being generous.

&gt; Every Iraqi was awaiting their torture and death under Saddam. It was a literal fascist concentration camp, the entire country.

That's not how dictatorships work.


&gt;America has never committed genocide in the post-WW2 era.

We systematically bombed villages in Vietnam, we poisoned their food supply, cut their routes and created whole swaths of the country where we would kill anybody even women or children, we called them "Free Fire Zones".  Commanders even said that every brigade has a Mai Lai.  We killed around 2.5 million in South East Asia.  That's not even talking about indirect support for genocide like in East Timor or Nicaragua.  If Vietnam doesn't count as genocide then neither does Iraq.  

&gt;2. We have never used WMDs unjustifiably. Japan was justified under international law and also saved lives compared to a ground military invasion of Japan.

Saddam would say his was justified too.

&gt;Negative. Any terrorists internationally prosecuted we have given up.

That's quite a caveat that they had to "internationally prosecuted" America did give material support to terrorist, like the Muhajadeen and Contras.

&gt;4. We have never occupied or invaded another country in post-WW2 without justification. All of the countries we currently are involved in broke 1-4

Every country gives justification to invade another country.  Killing millions of people because they want independence doesn't mean it was justifiable.

&gt;Stop being a neocon like Pat Buchanan and defending religious fascists and attacking the secular, free western world.

Sam, you're interrupting me!"Are you new to the program? You should listen to what Peterson has to say and you’ll see why his audience is mostly men very quickly. 

Brief summary: He speaks to a very traditional worldview that caters to men. He’s anti-feminist and thinks all social movements are basically BS. And as a result, yes most of his fans are angry young conservative men. 

I dunno about a female equivalent of Peterson. Men and women are different and Peterson’s ideology doesn’t appeal to women the same way. I dunno what ideology would fill a comparable role.What the fuck are you even talking about? They never even talk about the guy. Peterson is a traditional conservative, tradcon.  Tradcons want to reinstitute traditional heirarchies such as man over women.  His appeals to young men is that their lives are miserable because we broke those traditional heirarchies and women need to get back into their place and be oppressed.

A Peterson for women would either need to tell women they are miserable because they aren't oppressed by men enough or be something other then a tradcon.The Ana and Coulter debate was terrible. They ONLY focused on immigration and because of this, Coulter came across slightly less insane than she would have if they moved on to other topics. This is probably the fault of a lack of a moderator. 

I suspect Kulinski will do terribly. He's not quick on his feet and he'll probably just be channeling the Cenk-routine he can't get out of. Then if anything about Russia or Trump is brought up, Kyle will just be like "yeah who cares" and they'll high five or some shit. 

Sam would be great debating anyone imo. Well, I'd watch it. And I think it would be good to have someone out there debate him. It also helps seeing how he would handle it and give me some ideas on how to counter some people like him. 

I'm surprised Pakman is winning the poll. That dude is weak. i dunno but i'm pretty sure incest is a zero sum gameIt should be noted  that Alex Jones harassed people for YEARS and never faced more than a two week suspension. Jones harassed Jack Dorsey personally yesterday, and was permanently banned today. I guess we found Jack's priceYour opinion of the NYT must be horrendous.No, it’s a senior official in the administration. nott giving high enough odds on "david dennison"- no way in hell it was trump. i'd take the odds if it were like 10,000 to 1 thoughThe jock from Revenge of the Nerds. A boiled ham in a wig.Kulinski has good ideology, but he's kind of a dumbass. I mean, why debate Ann Coulter? She has no substance. He's already lost the debate by agreeing to it in the first place. It's either Pence or someone smart enough to throw a red herring in there like "lodestar" to make people think it is Pence because maybe he is a rival or an enemy of them or something.

I don't think there is anyone smart to have that good of a red herring so I'm gonna go with it being Pence.We, the commoners...Even when insulted directly to his face, Dave Rubin manages to remain as dead in the eyes as the fish you see on display at a grocery store.  Congressman John Dingell proposed universal care every session since 1946. When he retired, John Conyers has proposed it every session since. Conyers has been forced to retire this year (let's not talk about that....), so we'll see if anyone proposes it in 2019. I, for one, am still waiting for Donald Trump's republicans to deliver better health care at a fraction of the cost. Just like he said he would on the campaign trail.  #MAGAI’m guessing this was after the live show?Is there a accessible and comprehensive list of this spending? I only know about the millitary.yeah you’re so right it’s with Jamie alsoSam's a Mensch. For all the meditation retreats he goes to, Micheal is not.No because females aren’t actually insaneThis is probably true 😂.......do they? i don't really find "well if we were just communists then everything would be ok" that fun or educating.I’d rather have someone who has more thoughts than “it’s bad because not communist”. It’s boring and I wanted that I’d listen to the dumb dumbs at Chapo. Nah I’ll just keep listening to MR"Who put pubic hair.....on my coke!"If you're a Republican senator and ever want to get elected dog catcher ever again, you're pressuring McConnell to stop this. If you're a Republican woman, you're locking the Senate chamber doors &amp; throwing away the keysWatch the discussion Sam and Jimmy had in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Note Jimmy's complete disregard for the importance of the supreme court.I used to like Jimmy's show because it's fun to watch someone be angry on your behalf. He's very Fox News of the Left. It's nice. 

However he's gone over the edge and has left facts or any kind of realistic insight in the dust and opted for pure emotion. I can no longer co-sign on him, especially in areas where the extreme left kind of plays into Putin's hands. It's very disappointing. Jimmy is a straight, affluent, married, childless  white man living in California -- the LAST person to feel Trump's effects. It's quite easy to be accelarationist if you aren't the one being accelerated ON.There is a certain amount of humble pie being offered up here.  Dore's fans trolled the MR world quite a bit leading up to the 2016 election, it turns out nearly everything Sam &amp; company said would happen has happened. (Moon in Lake Michigan!) . As time has gone on, Jimmy's fans say barely a peep. In addition the MR you tube account is on the verge of passing the Dore account in terms of subscribers, which according to Dore's fans, made his arguments  valid.It's much less humorous. Instead of a long interview and then a fun half, it's made up of multiple interviews between fifteen and thirty minutes apiece.Bonobos has them in a few different colors right now.

I also had one from Uniqlo I got years ago but they haven't had them in a while.The majority report has a patreon? I thought that was a Micheal Brooks thing.

lol byeI appreciate the effort you put into this but I agree with Sam in that I still ultimately think it's bullshit the question is being asked in the first place. It's a joke that this question is being asked when it's never asked for many other policies, including things like tax cuts and military spending. It's literally never asked of Republicans when they're constantly making complaining about deficit spending when Dems are office.

I also don't think we need to explain how we're going to fund this policy to the ~70% who already support it. They already support the policy and realize the benefit. I think ultimately people in America are less fiscally conservative than most believe, that's why they support a massive government spending program like Medicare For All.

All that said I am actually curious about the numbers and appreciated reading what you proposed. One question, how do you respond to this article: https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/8/7/17658574/democratic-socialism-cost-medicare-college-sanders-deficits-taxes

It proposes that designing taxes to cover these costs is much more difficult than you suggest, how would you reconcile what you proposed with the article?
I've been saying for two years that TYT is fucking up hardcore with Dore. Cenk won't seem to get his head out of his ass. They are giving a moron with a bad message a giant platform. I think his real desire is to make a brand for himself. As the edgy dude that bitches about dems because no one ever thought to do that before apparently. Really? Have a nice day!I guess "The Moon into Lake Michigan" went over your head.You wander into an MR/Dore thread, and are too lazy  to do the work grasp a 2 year old trope. This is the third time in this thread you've tried to bait me with the disingenuous "explain it to me" gimmick, and it's a little insulting, frankly. You can troll better than this, otherwise all that cash you dumped at Trump University for that degree in forum trolling only bought you a MAGA  cap. A boycott isn't going to happen but with Dore and Kyle making vids I don't recommend TYT to anyone anymore. Both those people made the show embarrassing. Let me guess, he channels the Cenk routine. 

This dude is so fake and I think he feels the wind to see where progressives are leaning on issues before he comments. Neoliberal - anyone on the left who disagrees to ANY extent with what I want at this very moment. Forget what I wanted a year, week, day or even 10 minutes ago. Right the hell now.Invest in a sarcasm detector.

&amp;#x200B;

I can see why  you don't understand the :Moon in Lake Michigan" line. Apparently, like the moon, many things go over your head. (That was sarcasm, btw)I don't know how they are going to do the Ken Ken and Ken show for 2018.  In 2018 you basically have to be a Nazi to parody them.why would you put sam on a team with 3 dumb dumbs (not pakman)?The mods abandoned us long ago.Lol, mods. 

What kind of fancy-shmancy place do you think this is? God damn he sucksHoly shit, he's gone off his rocker. 

I bet there is more stuff like this behind the scenes too. 

I'm sure Kyle-boy will start calling out Jimmy more in a desperate attempt to make it seem like he was never part of the problem. Also, Cenk sucks for letting it get this bad and continuing to give Jimmy a massive platform to tell people not to vote or care. This place is started to get brigaded with these types of morons. Pro-bernie and anti-hillary shit was spammed ever where even after bernie lost the primaries. People fucking got sick of that shit and go on some counter-circlejerk subreddits. That's hardly cause for concern so please. 

Something tells me you clung onto the bernie subreddits even after they became full of bots, shills and people that would literally say they would vote for donald trump and anti-abortion messaging. So fucking please. Can it be said that Jimmy's most furious public meltdowns have been towards women?I really want to know if this is factually true. Jimmy has been acting, in just about every way, as an agent of Russian Influence.

Personally I think a struggling Leftwing Political Comedian who has been on RT is one of the perfect candidates for this kind of thing. Doubly so due to the platform he's on and the personal connection he and Cenk Uygur share.

Or is he seriously just that dumb? I fear for this answer because I know Jimmy has an extremely dedicated fanbase... or is that just one more level of influence from a foreign actor?


All of this is the true genius of the Russians plan. Now we are second guessing everything and are afraid to say anything out of fear of being overly paranoid or conspiratorial.Well yeah, the former is a given.

I am just extremely interested if the latter is as well.

What I truly think, is that he got addicted to the audience of his angry rants. He's being fed by rightwing trolls and the more extremist and idiotic leftwing fanatics, so he just keeps doubling down on whats working without having the discipline or intelligence to keep his eyes on the ball.

In an extended discussion with Cenk, Kyle intimated that he *doesn't care* where information comes from, he only wants to look at the information.

That's a pre-emptive choice to not look at context.

In that same conversation, he said he doesn't care if we don't honor our NATO treaties. The guy doesn't get foreign policy. He just doesn't.Went to that Wayofthebern sub one time, that place is fucking NUTS.

Seriously I don't understand how people get so blinded by the fuckery from the dem primary that it still is their primary political focus. I do not understand.

I like Kyle, I think he's the most redeemable, he just needs to smarten the hell up on where the world and his place in it is, not the idealized version he'd prefer to speak in.He pretty much lost all credibility with me when he made the video suggesting Hillary Clinton has Parkinsons. Anyone who would put that out there with so little evidence is showing clear signs of conspiratorial thinking. I didn't know he was such an asshole, though.&gt;it is still being discussed whether these things will be made possible through the system we have, or through other avenues.

&gt;we cannot afford to waste another election cycle

We are almost at an election cycle and a strategy still isn't in place? I stand by what I said.Counterpoint: Their 70 year old base hates, Hates HATES going to see their 40 year old specialist lady doctor from India with a heavy accent.&gt;that place is fucking NUTS.

Murc's Law anyone?He likes beer! do you like beer? I've had a few beers. We drank beer. It was good beer. I still like beer. I want beer.

There's nothing to fear from beer my dear. The sound of the beer is good to my ear. I once had a beer, but I'm still here, I swear I'm not queer, I just like David Alan Grier.

Kavanaugh's just 'bustin' a rhyme.

Click one over and you see Sam looking at the camera like a confused elderly person.don't make fun of Sucker CharlatanBattle of the meat heads. It'll be great. If only they could threeway rogan in there.Its been used so much now, its not even really said ironically anymore.I was thinking about this the other day. If \~40% of people support Trump and \~20% of people are neutral and did not vote against him and \~20% of people thought Hillary was a great person/candidate. That leaves only \~20% of people. Of those \~10% being crazy left commies, authoritarian politically correct people, people who like Kanye. That only leaves a MAXIMUM of \~10% of people.

That can't be right. Is my math/logic right here?**Edit:**

Ok I think I understand where the confusion stems from.

Who we consider "reasonable" is inherently subjective relating to our ability to reason and the things we consider to be true.Well, you can consider my logic for coming up with my own answer to the poll  "completely meaningless" as you say but the poll itself is just a simple question with a bunch of percentage options.

Do you not feel comfortable answering the question?:

 **What percentage of people in the US do you consider to be "reasonable" people?** Who we consider "reasonable" is inherently subjective relating to our ability to reason and the things we consider to be true but I am pretty sure we agree on the top level definition of the word "reasonable": [https://www.google.com/search?q=reasonable](https://www.google.com/search?q=reasonable)

Are you telling me that there are no views that people hold today in the modern world that allow you to disqualify them as being reasonable people?

Flat earthers for example?

Anti-vaxxers?

Climate change deniers?

Young earth creationists?

Are there any views like that for you?That's a bad look for LaPacco, yes THE Chris LaPacco, TBH  /sBe on the lookout for any backwards facing letter B's . Insurance fraud is a serious crime, son.Well this DOES open both Sam and Pakman for the possibility of a  Shapiro debate.

I had heard on some YT clip that it would be Pakman &amp; Kyle Kulinski vs  Charlie Kirk &amp; Candance Owens (mother of god!)

If Sam goes, there is a 90% chance he ends up debating Michael Steele. However a David Frum debate would be good as every response would be "axis of Evil/Iraq War/Bush's Speechwriter hello?"&gt;Even if basing life on logic and facts IS more reasonable than basing it on propaganda posing as credible news, there is still no advancing of any agenda by making this obvious.

You can't fight lies with more lies. History has shown that time and time again. The best way we can advocate for the truth is to speak the truth.

If people can understand the truth, they will make better decisions for others and for themselves.

If they can't accept the truth or refuse to accept the truth, and you just manipulate them into making the right choice with propaganda, it doesn't matter whatever short term political victories you may have won, you will be sacrificing the long game.

Some other master manipulator who is more diabolical will always come along eventually and exploit peoples' priming to the acceptance of lies, in our case that person just happened to be Trump but eventually it would have been someone else. The American people were propagandized for 30 years. Fox News did their job well.

And the liberal networks didn't do a good job of calling them out as liars because they are all buddy buddy in the same broken system.

Bernie speaks the truth more than most other candidates. That is why people are persuaded by him.This was a bad idea. All he has to do is cry "fake news" and it's done. I think she was trying for the "Obama releases his birth certificate" moment, but it's not the same. It's not going to shut him up about it.

Seems self evident.Lmao what a corn ball This shit about the economic growth is utter bullshit.  America had repetitively double digit economic growth during FDR's presidency well into WWII.  Nobody comes close and it's because we taxed the rich who used their wealth for rent seeking behavior and redistributed it to those who are closer to production and had a better marginal utility with that money.

Also the government owns all the land in Hong Kong.It really does straddle that line well.Our two comments are not mutually exclusive.Oh no I can't even imagine how the debate with Sam will godamn, the camera just zoomed out for a second; barely anybody in the audience. very surprising.goddammit the stream cut off right as sam was about to debate the tariffs. the only other stream i saw hosting it also cut out. feh!

probably because they're going to move on and focus on cenk and tucker carlson, which i imagine is going to be a clusterfuck of drama and yelling.Why did they cut it though?For real. I did not expect Kirk to know as much as he did. Shapiro is surely even dumber than Kirk kirk mentioning foxconn and wisconsin and crediting scott walker irked me as well. i live in milwaukee and we had to give foxconn ~$4 billion in state funds to convince them to stay, which [cost wisconsin eight times as much per job as similar 2017 state jobs deals.](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/05/foxconn-package-cost-wisconsin-eight-times-much-per-job-similar-2017-state-jobs-deals/1080214001/)

also the benefits really only apply to the milwaukee metro area and racine; people up north are pissed that they paid for a company to come in that doesn't directly benefit them with job opportunities.Or is that picture a sort of Werner Herzoggian representation of Charlie Kirk's political psyche.

&gt;For me a true landscape is not just a representation of a desert or a forest. It shows an inner state of mind, literally inner landscapes. . . - *Werner Herzog*Why did the seafood line give it away?

What gave it away to me was the way he qualifies everything:

He's got all of Peterson's books ***BUT*** has never read anything else.

He keeps his room very clean ***BUT*** his roommate helps.

His girlfriend is disorganized ***BUT*** she is getting all A's.

He is getting all A's ***BUT*** he is getting two C's.

Every good thing he says about himself he qualifies.

Every bad thing he says about his girlfriend he qualifies.

***Edit: Addition:***

Ohhhhh. Was he trying to suggest that he took her to the Peterson event on their anniversary?

I kept trying to write my guess at the number, but couldn't convince myself of any of them.Kulinski doesn’t do that, though. He disagrees with the idea that a third party is the only way to go, and he personally believes that the Justice Democrats have a better chance of winning than third parties, but he still supports progressives who want to work outside the major parties. In a video recently he said that he would probably vote for the Green Party candidate for Governor in New York.He’s definitely my favorite part of MR.

Others like defense and prison industries there should be no profit incentive for war or oppression period.

Energy companies (coal, gas, oil, nuclear ext) I think the issue is that the private sector doesn't cover all the externalities and actively lobbies and fights necessary regulations to control or compensate for those externalities.  So they should be nationalized.

Finally the information sector I think locally owned cooperatives should be used for ISP's or it should fall under the domain of the post office.You guys are missing Sam's point. It isn't about fending off Republicans, it is about the news covering the issue (Hillary's emails anyone) to an insane degree.I agree it's a lose lose, but "her DNA" would become the next "her emails" and the Warren team had to do something proactive or else they would go down the same path as Clinton did vs. the Republican propaganda machine.
