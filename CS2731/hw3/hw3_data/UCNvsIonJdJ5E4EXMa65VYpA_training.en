[V.O.] In color theory, the selection
of colors used in a design is called a color scheme.
Analogous color schemes use the main color
plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary
schemes use any two colors directly opposite
on the color wheel.
- Hi girls!
I’m Tracy Mounts, guest host of ContraPoints,
the Internet show where we talk about sadness,
fascism, sexual deviation, cults.
This week we’ll be talking about (tongue
pop) colors.
[bell sweep]
Colors, what the fuck are they?
In one beaker I have white, in the other brown.
Pour them together and, well, I don’t know
what the kids are calling it.
It’s delicious!
Now to according to some so-called experts
color is really different
wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.
But what about the shadow illusion?
Same wavelengths, different colors.
Some people say I’m a man dressed as a lady,
but I’m actually a lady who used to be a
man, dressed as a man dressed as a lady.
Explain that Professor Butler.
Illusions!
What matters more, the way things are or the
way things look?
Let’s watch an instructional video to learn
more.

[ominous electronic music]
- Hi, I’m Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom
Report um… it’s too early for this.
Today my guests are um…
*sigh*
Well who are you people?
- I’m Dr. Abigail Cockbane, associate professor
of women’s studies and author of many, many
books, most recently my doctoral thesis, Sacred
Passage: The Divine Feminine in Flux and Flow.
- Oooooooh yes.
And uh, well you look familiar, who are you?
- (hisses)
- Okay.
Well.
Today my guests will be debating the topic
ummm...
Well here’s a good one: should it be illegal
to use the wrong pronouns for a transgender?
What do you think Annabel?
- Well Jackie, liberation from the oppressive
institution of gender begins with freedom
of speech.
For instance, this cat person over here is
clearly a biological male in some sort of
costume wig.
Now, I of course support his right to dress
however he wishes, but the fact remains that
pronouns refer, as they always have referred,
to chromosomal sex.
But perhaps you disagree, sir.
- That’s a human rights violation!
I’ll smash your fucking face!
[hiss]
- And here we have a clear illustration of the
way that transgender ideology is merely a
smokescreen for male violence against women,
and mind you this is being taught in our schools,
it’s being forced on our children, it’s
become mandatory in every workplace…
- Security, have this cat removed.
- [continued hissing]
- Dissenters are being silenced, and
something must be done about the encroaching
trans agenda, taking away women’s rights,
invading women’s spaces, depriving us of
what feminism has worked so hard—
[static]
- I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a
cat.
Gender’s just like color.
Some people see yellow, some people see blue.
It’s all a matter of opinion.
Or is it?
It’s not.
Let’s hear the real tea.
[static]
[ominous electronic music]
- Tabby.
Sweetie, baby, princess.
- I feel ridiculous in this dress.
- Yeah well you look ridiculous, because you
wouldn’t take the goddamn cat ears off.
- I think I’m gonna take the dress off.
- Well don’t do that.
I’m trying to help you out girl.
If you don’t want to get misgendered it
helps to fem it up a little.
- I’m gonna take it off.
Well don’t leave…
You can change in front of me, I’m not a
prude.
- I’m gonna go behind the curtain.
- (whines) I like looking at naked
people.
- Why do you always hit on me, I thought you
were into men.
- Well I swing both ways.
I like boy dick and girl dick.
- That’s not how that works.
I hate that.
- The heart wants what it wants.
- Why did you invite me over here anyway?
- I saw what happened to you on the Freedom
Report and girl.
Girrrrl.
You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening
people with a bat.
- You think it’s morally wrong to stand up
to your oppressors?
- Pff.
No.
“Morally wrong”—what does that even
mean?
It was much worse than morally wrong.
It was aesthetically wrong.
It was unfeminine.
- This is all you ever say to me.
“It’s bad optics, it's bad aesthetics.”
Well does reality matter at all to you?
Because the reality is I am a woman, and maybe
a bunch of ignorant people don’t think I
look like one, but the way things look isn’t
all that matters.
- Tabby, this is politics.
Have you ever had a conversation with the
average voter?
Reality plays no role in politics.
Politics is aesthetics.
- “Politics is aesthetics”?
That’s literally what fascism is.
Have you even read Benjamin?
- Ugh.
- “Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics
into political life.”
The military parades, the pageantry.
And Communism responds by politicizing
art.
- This is what I can’t stand about communists,
you want to turn art into propaganda.
- Well art is already ideology.
- Ugh.
Look, instead of ruining art why don’t we
just fight the pageantry of fascism with pageantry
of our own.
And you know who’s gonna make that happen?
- Who?
- Well funded trans women.
My Patreon’s in the description.
- Ew.
Stop that.
- What?
I’m just trying to monetize a connected
engagement community by strategically leveraging
my content creator promotional media brand
analytics.
Is that so wrong?
- You’re so bougie.
- I’m not the one quoting German philosophers
from memory.
- Revolutionary philosophers.
- Whatever you need to tell yourself.
Look, the point I’m trying to make is that the
world we live in is not a philosophical world.
Think about Instagram.
It’s all about transforming your life into
an enviable spectacle.
If you cry yourself to sleep every night who
cares.
No one sees that, they only see the show you’re
putting on.
- Okay but life is not a show.
- Mmm—politics is a show.
Look around you Tabby, try to understand what’s
happening to the world.
The president of the United States is a reality
TV star.
The 21st century is an aesthetic century.
In history there are ages of reason and there
are ages of spectacle, and it’s important
to know which you’re in.
Our America, our Internet is not ancient Athens.
It’s Rome.
And your problem is you think you’re in
the forum when you’re really in the circus.
- I thought you were just criticizing me for
being violent, now you’re against reason
too?
- I’m not against reason.
Reason is a very powerful aesthetic—if you’re
a man.
- And what if you’re a woman?
- Oh don’t be a woman.
That’s not a good idea.
- [Sips] Ow.
- Do you remember that YouTube debate between
Blaire White and that YouTuber with the pink
wig, what was her name?
I don’t know, she was relevant back in 2017.
Anyway this was before she transitioned and
in that debate Blaire looked like she had
two X chromosomes and the other one looked
like this awkward dude in an anime wig not
looking at the camera.
- I vaguely remember.
I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.
- Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad.
It was embarrassing to watch.
- Not really.
I mean she was right, and her arguments were
better.
- [cackles]
Tabby.
Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby.
Arguments don’t matter.
How pretty you are matters.
- Is this really where you’re going with this?
- Tabby, if you want to be a public figure,
sooner or later you're gonna need to take the trans
girl blackpill.
- Oh boy.
- If you’re a trans woman in the public eye,
what matters is one thing and one thing only.
And it’s always been the thing that matters.
- What?
- The realness.
Verisimilitude.
You have to look like a fucking woman.
- There it is.
- "There it is" is right.
We don’t say it in public, but we all know
it, and we all feel it.
- What does it even mean to look like a woman?
Oh don’t give me that PC bullshit, I’m
trying to have a real conversation here.
We all know what it means.
- I don’t know what it means.
Women have a lot of different looks.
There are bald women, bearded women, muscular
women, wide-shouldered women—
- And what is society’s opinion about those
bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?
- Is this just about you making me wear the
dress again?
- The dress is the last of my concerns.
I mean where do I even start with this?
You’re wearing combat boots.
You cannot be wearing combat boots.
- Why not?
A lot of cis women wear them.
- Cis women?
Well they’re hopeless aren’t they.
Fully clockable.
- So you want me to look like a woman without
imitating cis women.
- Yes.
Do not under any circumstances imitate cis
women.
They have no idea what they’re doing.
- Well where does your idea of womanhood even
come from then?
- Das Ewig-Weibliche.
The archetype of the eternal feminine.
- And where does that come from?
- Poets… teenage gay boys on Instagram.
The only people with any coherent vision of
contemporary womanhood.
- That’s insanity.
- Is it?
Tabby look at my face.
Look at this highlight. [Chimes]
[Ding!]
Does that look like the product of insanity
to you?
- I mean yeah, kind of.
Who puts on that much make up to drink tea
at home?
- Good banter, well done.
But trans women have to overdo it.
You need to be so good at makeup that every
cis woman you know comes to you for advice.
You need to toss your hair and cross your
legs.
You need to smile, even at people who hate
you.
Eliminate every aggressive impulse.
You must be a blossom floating along the surface
of a stream.
Your hands are not tools, they are ornaments
on the ends of your arms.
- So you literally are what TERFs think trans
women are.
Literally a man’s idea of a woman.
- Well, men have the power, men make the rules,
and it’s ultimately men who are the judges
of womanhood.
So you can’t really blame me for having to deal
with that situation.
- I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding
we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.
- Not stereotypes.
Performances.
You like philosophy so much, haven’t you
read Judith Butler?
Gender is performance.
We’re all born naked and the rest is literally
drag.
Womanhood is not what you are, it’s what
you do.
And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning.
- So according to you there’s no difference
between a trans woman and a drag queen?
- No, you’re misinterpreting what I’m saying.
I don’t mean performance in the sense of
pretending to be something you’re not.
I mean performance in the sense of everything
you do, the way you style yourself, your posture,
the way you speak.
An authentic performance is just a habitual
performance, and nothing more than that.
- So trans women just starting their transition
are pretending to be women?
- I mean, isn’t that kind of what it felt
like?
You transition the same way get anywhere in
life: you fake it till you make it.
- So according to you a trans woman is just
a full-time drag queen.
That’s what any woman is.
- What about gender non-conforming cis women.
They’re not “doing womanhood” in that
way.
- Well, yeah, that’s why those women are marginalized.
They’re going off the grid of what society
recognizes as womanhood.
And you don’t want to end up like that do
you?
- And hold on.
Are you saying if a cis man dresses like a
woman, talks like a woman, takes female hormones,
is gendered female by other people, and spends
his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,
then he’s literally just as much a woman
as we are?
- Yep.
- That’s absurd.
- But it’s absurd because the example is absurd.
No cis man would do that.
It’s like asking, "Is a straight man gay if
he only sleeps with men?"
Like yeah, pretty much.
See this is philosophy at its worst, pointless
speculative fiction.
And it’s a distraction from what we’re
really talking about, which is you getting
rid of those combat boots.
- I thought we were talking about philosophy.
- No.
We’re talking about shoes.
- Why do I always have to justify what I wear
to you?
You’re apparently fine wearing designer
dresses around your communist friends.
- The left will abide a regal queer.
- Look your performance theory doesn’t explain
why trans people exist in the first place.
If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,
then why did we reject our male upbringings
and decide to live as women?
What matters is that we identify as women.
We can express that identity in different
ways, but it’s the identity, not the performance,
that makes us women.
- But you can’t be a woman without performing
womanhood.
Without action, and without social recognition,
the identity is meaningless.
If womanhood is nothing to you but a private
daydream then you may as well do what those
assholes say and identify as a helicopter.
Because unless you’re living womanhood,
the identity is literally that meaningless.
- That’s very unfair to pre-transition trans
people.
Well this isn’t a Tumblr cuddle party girl,
I’m trying to talk about what’s really true.
I didn’t say it was insensitive, I said
it was unfair.
- Identifying as a woman before you transition
is a psychological reality that implies a
potential to live your inner truth.
- No one has ever sincerely identified as a
helicopter, it’s just a troll example.
- True.
But even if they were sincere there would
be no reality to it because helicopter is
not an actual social role.
Whereas you can become a teacher, a doctor,
or a woman.
But you have to work to get there, and ultimately
society has to let you.
- What do you mean?
I can identify as doctor and go around handing
out diagnoses, but if no one recognizes me
as a doctor then I’m not really practicing
medicine, am I?
- But that analogy means that our womanhood
can be revoked at any moment, all it takes
is being misgendered.
- It’s scary but isn’t that the situation
we’re in?
Why did you get so angry when that TERF called
you “sir”?
Isn’t it because in that situation she robbed
you of your womanhood?
- That’s ridiculous.
I am a woman.
That’s my reality.
It doesn’t depend on other people’s opinions.
- I know you’re a woman.
I’m just saying in that one moment, you
effectively had your gender canceled.
Another way of looking at it is gender is
aesthetic, not rational.
Either you’re perceived as a woman, or you
aren’t.
There’s no reasoning your way into it.
- Oh don’t worry about that.
I don’t argue I’m a woman.
I smash.
- I know you do.
And it’s a bad look.
- Is this about the shoes again?
Yep.
Here, put these on.
- Absolutely not, I’m not wearing those.
Yes you are bitch.
- No.
- If you put them on I’ll um... scratch you
behind the ears later.
- Okay fine.
- Now walk.
[sigh]
[house music]
[distressed hissing and meowing, house music
continues]
- That was the worst thing I’ve ever seen.
- Well you’re the one who made me do it!
- Look, don’t stomp around like that.
Keep your shoulders back and steady.
All the movement comes from your hips.
And you wanna put the weight on the balls
of your feet.
Here I’ll show you.
[house music]
Your turn.
Do it right.
[sigh]
The category is… catgirls.
[House music]
Yes bitch.
That was flawless, it was iconic.
I’m living for this.
I’m loving this for you.
You’re doing so good for yourself.
- I’m never doing that again.
- Ugh!
Why not?
- Because it’s not who I am.
All your advice is just trying to turn me
into you.
Well that’s not what aesthetics is.
Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.
And I’ll only ever be a second-rate Justine,
but I can be a first-rate Tabby.
- Well kids this week we learned a valuable
lesson about the importance of being yourself—
- Shut up.
Look, I know I’m not cool okay.
I know I’m not pretty.
And I know you think you’re too good for
me because you mostly pass.
And I know you and your friends laugh at me
behind my back.
People stare at me because I’m a transgender
furry and that’s weird.
But I’m a fucking queer icon because I’m
not like you, because I’m not like anyone
but myself, and because I’m willing to stand
up to the people who oppress us, and I’m
willing to stand up for the girls with beard
shadow and deep voices, the girls even other
trans women make fun of, and when in the history
of the world has anyone but me ever stood
up for them?
That’s why everyone knows who Tabby is.
When was the last time anyone talked about
Justine?
- Wow, Tabby.
I didn’t know you had that in you.
But so what?
So male-to-anime Twitter stans you, big deal.
- You’re mad, aren’t you?
I’ll get over it in a few weeks.
Look, you’re right.
You have to be yourself.
Trying to be someone else is always a bad
look.
So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic
then wear them well and make it work.
But sometimes being yourself is not enough.
Sometimes you have to become yourself.
And for you I think that means that the smashing
has got to stop.
I mean with the Nazis it’s one thing but
you cannot be menacing radical feminists with
a bat.
- I wouldn’t have to smash if literally anyone
else were willing to stick up for us.
Your delicate notion of femininity is a product
of the privilege you share with a lot
of thin white cis feminists.
- Wow, it must be so hard for you out on the
streets as a fat woman of color.
- Shut up.
- I’m just saying, don’t claim a struggle
that isn’t yours girl.
You could have what I have, you just have
to work for it instead of playing this part
of the tragic victim.
You were raised a white boy.
You got to go to college and learn all that
philosophy.
And yeah it’s hard being a trans woman of
any background but you still stand on a lot
of privilege.
I look at all the photos of trans women who
are murdered in this country, and they don’t
look like you or me.
Why don’t you use your privilege and use
your education to actually do some good in
the world instead of this elective revolutionary
LARPing.
- You make me seem like the self-indulgent one.
I’m sorry I’m not hardworking enough to
go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes.
- I’ve seen minds change and hearts soften
before my eyes.
You don’t win friends and allies with a
bat.
- They’re just using you.
- Well who do you think benefits, and who do
you think is hurt when you go out into the
world and represent trans women as masculine
and violent?
- Who do you think benefits when they trot you
out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?
- I guess we can’t win can we.
Wanna just chill out and watch YouTube videos?
- Yeah, okay.
- Forget about the disrespect.
Facts don’t care about your feelings.
It turns out that every chromosome, every
cell in Caitlyn Jenner’s body is male with
the exception of some of his sperm cells.
-You don’t know what you’re talking
about, you’re not educated on genetics.
- Would you like to discuss the genetics?
What are your genetics sir?
- You cut that out now or you’ll go home
in an ambulance.
- Now that seems mildly inappropriate for
a political discussion.
You cut that out now or you’ll go home
in an ambulance.
- So I look at that and I feel like on my
end it's like I’m always, I feel like I’m always
damage-controlling for the trans community
which is so frustrating.
- (chuckles)
- You’ll go home in an ambulance
- Damage controlling, so frustrating
- (chuckles)
- You’ll go home in an ambulance
- Damage controlling, so frustrating
- (chuckles)
[looped phrases continue]
- It’s imperative that we actually
use terms that refer to something.
If you want to talk about gender as distinct
from sex, and then talk about you’re a very
feminine biological man and you’ve had the
surgeries to prove it, then I think that we
can talk about what is the appropriate pronoun
to use.
My problem is the—
[static]
- Tabby, I don’t want to fight with you.
We’re surviving in this shit world together
and you’ll always be my sister.
- Well I’m glad.
- I love you.
- What?
[Static]
- Love.
I was in love once.
I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati
bent over a pool table.
The year was 1985.
And to this day when the perfume of cheap
whiskey hits my nostrils at just the right
moment, I can almost feel the beer-stained
billiard cloth against my cheek.
Uhn!
Let’s watch it all on VHS cassette to learn
more.

[Electronic music]
[drone]
[Mendelssohn: String Quartet No. 6 in F minor,
III. Adagio]
[V.O] "Imagine how a woman feels."
“Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels.
"Imagine the sweet smell of her perfume.
"Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips
against yours.
"Imagine her letting you get on top of her
and insert your [bleep] inside her, softly
"moaning as it slides in.
"Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm
[bleep] wrapped around every inch of your [bleep].
"Imagine her breathing getting heavier with
every thrust.
"Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around
you, holding you as close as she possibly
"can and begging you to [bleep] inside her
as you release every ounce of your [bleep]
"into her.
"Then imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction
and peace that comes afterwards, and looking
"beside you to see a person that cares about
you and has accepted you
"in the most intimate way possible.
“You will never get to experience this because
your skeleton is too small or the bones in
"your face are not the proper shape.
"Have a nice day.”
[Melancholic chill jazz]
- Hello boys.
Let’s talk about bone structure.
[Chill music]
There’s something basically Soviet about
the way the Internet names things.
Stalin had portmanteaus like "agitprop", "politburo",
and "kompromat", and we have "webinar", "podcast",
and "incel", short for "involuntary celibate."
The word "incel" was invented in the late 90s
by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who
created a website called "Alana's Involuntary
Celibacy Project" that was essentially a safe
space for people who just couldn’t get it
in.
But in our own miserable moment of Internet
history, the word “incel” refers to a
more specific community of mostly heterosexual
men, centered around forums like Incel.me
and r/braincels.
This group has recently gotten a lot of bad
press because for the last few years they’ve
been churning out mass murderers faster than
Marvel can make Avengers movies.
But most incels aren’t violent killers.
They’re just men who’ve formed an identity
around not getting laid.
In this video I don’t want to mock incels
or lecture them or even sympathize with them.
I just want to understand who they are and
why they’re like this.
To start with, sometimes the best way to understand
a person’s world is to learn their language,
and the language of the incels… well.
You’ll see.
1st Base: Incelese
Does it ever bother you that the word “women”
makes adult females sound just a little bit
too human?
Well incels have a solution to that.
They’ve taken to calling women "feeeeeemoooooids."
The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels
think of women: not as sisters or mothers,
and certainly not as autonomous people, but
as a kind of foreign, inscrutable object,
comparable to a natural resource—unobtainium—to
which incels believe all men are entitled,
and to which they feel they have been unjustly
denied.
There’s a long tradition of nerdy men talking
about women in nerdily misogynistic ways.
I’m reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner
von Braun’s remark about female astronauts:
[V.O.] “We are reserving 110 pounds
of payload for recreational equipment.”
- Which is not to say that alpha males are less
misogynistic than nerds, but simply that the
nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.
Now “femoid” is about as neutral a term
as incels have for women and it’s only downhill
from there.
There’s the usual standbys: "bitches", "sluts",
"whores", all conveying a searing resentment
of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which
is represented by the bespoke incel coinage
“roastie” which, I’m sorry to inform
you, refers to the incel belief that the human
vulva become mutilated through repeated penetration
by different men—though not through repeated
penetration by the same man interestingly—and
thereby come to resemble roast beef.
Now by definition, incels haven’t actually
observed any vaginas, but to incels anatomy
is more a matter of metaphysical speculation
than crude science.
Though, if you ask me the right metaphor for
a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes.
Of course, not all feeeemooooids are created
equal.
There are various subspecies:
- [David Attenborough style V.O.] The
Becky, or normie femoid, is to be contrasted
with the Stacy, or sexually desirable femoid,
whose distinguishing features include “makeup
on point; Never works a day in her life; Naturally
curvy body gives men instant erections; big
tits and ass show fertility.
- Leave my buns alone you savages.
The Stacy, naturally, has a male counterpoint,
whom incels call the Chad.
- [David Attenborough style V.O.] A
Chad is a hunky alpha, whose hands are always
prepared to grab nearby fertile pussy; he
has never heard a song in his entire life;
he has a sloped forehead with a strong brow,
ram bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate.
- It must needs be remarked that the skull of
the Chad exhibiteth a brow ridge most pronounced
whereas the skull of the virgin is most inadequate
in this regard, predisposing such specimens
to an abject existence of lamentation and
cuckoldry.
- It’s time to talk about bone structure.
According to a classic incel meme,
- [David Attenborough style V.O.] “The
difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally
"a few millimeters of bone.”
- I would like to propose a sociological theory.
Foppington’s law: Once bigotry or self-loathing
permeate a given community, it is only a matter
of time before deep metaphysical significance
is assigned to the shape of human skulls.
Why skulls, you ask.
Well, the best explanation I can come up with
is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.
It’s therefore the perfect symbol of the
intrinsic and permanent characteristics that
bigots like to assign to certain groups of
people.
If you believe for example that a certain
race or gender is intellectually inferior,
you can justify your belief by pointing to
the shape a skull and saying, "Well, that’s
the reason why, it’s just nature, there’s
nothing that can be done about it."
And that is exactly the way incels think about
love and celibacy.
Mankind is divided into two groups of people,
the Chads with the fuckable skulls and the
incels whose bones come up a few millimeters
short.
Corndog, anyone?
I’m really hungry.
Of course, it’s not just the skulls the
incels blame for their sexlessness.
They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining
the causes of involuntary celibacy.
Heightcels are incel due to their inferior
stature.
Whereas mentalcels can’t attract women because
of mental illness or autism, or they’re
addicts and then called drugcels.
Wristcels, on the other hand, are doomed by
their overly delicate wrists.
Now, obsessing about your wrist size does
seem a little weird.
- [V.O.] “Oh yeah?"
"Is it a little weird that the average dildo
has more girth than my wrist?
"Is it weird at all that some men have thicker
dicks than my wrist?
"But yeah, obviously ‘obsessing’ about
my tiny wrists that are smaller than even
"many women’s is completely irrational body
dysmorphia and the reason why no woman wants
"to be with me or even talk to me is my shitty
personality even though literal 80 IQ men
"who have nothing to talk about except who
won the game last night are still able to
"attract a loving partner.”
- ...Interesting.
A significant number of incels are not white,
in which case their unfuckability is attributed
to race, and they are accordingly termed,
apologies in advance, blackcels, ricecels,
currycels, and so on.
Which is not to say all non-white men are
celibate.
There are of course the occasional Chads of
color, with their superior skulls and towering
stature, whom the incels have christened Tyrones,
Changs, and Chadpreets.
I’m so sorry.
So you can be incel because of your looks,
your height, your mind, or your race, but
what unites them all is the conviction that
love and sex are forever out of reach.
Unless of course you delusionally imagine
that you can “ascend,” that is, escape
your inceldom.
If you falsely and pathetically believe that
there is any possibility of improvement, well,
that makes you the lowest of the low, a sad
and sorry hopecel.
Second base: The Red Pill
So we have the building blocks of the incel
worldview: the Stacys, the Chads, the incels,
and the normies.
From these elements, incels have constructed
a theory of human nature and of sexuality,
which they call the Red Pill.
Incels share the Red Pill worldview with the
rest of the manosphere, that is, pick-up artists,
men’s rights activists, and the voluntary
celibate community known as Men Going Their
Own Way, abbreviated MGTOW.
According to Red Pill theory, women are by
nature hypergamous.
Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying above, refers
to the practice of seeking relationships with
men above one’s social status, and also,
in incel usage, above one’s attractiveness.
According to incels, physical attractiveness
is naturally distributed equally between the sexes.
So, if you were to assign numerical ratings
to attractiveness, as incels like to do, there
would be about as many say 8/10 women as 8/10
men.
Incels believe that in a just world, a 5/10
man would naturally wind up in a relationship
with his looksmatch, that is, a 5/10 woman,
equivalently attractive to himself.
But sadly, this just system has been ruined
by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their
own attractiveness, are only interested in
dating Chad.
Incels sometimes call this the 80/20 rule,
the idea that only the top 20% of men will
ever be desired by women.
Now since most heterosexual men do end up
in relationships with women, you might be
raising your eyebrow at that idea.
But incels have an explanation.
According to the Red Pill theory, women often
pursue a mating strategy called "Alpha Fux
Beta Bux."
This means that in her 20s a woman will, as
incels say, ride the cock carousel, sleeping
with as many Chads as possible.
But as she ages into her 30s she will settle
down with a beta normie, whom she’s not
really attracted to, but whom she will use
for financial support, all the while continuously
cuckolding him on the alpha cock carousel,
before inevitably abandoning him, taking him
for everything he’s worth in a divorce settlement,
and running off to the Mediterranean with
all the children and a new Chad boyfriend,
while the beta cuck is left behind to fester
in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty.
So the upshot of the Red Pill theory is that
for men, there are three possible outcomes.
Either you’re an incel, doomed to a lifetime
of excruciating loneliness and resentment,
or you’re a normie, destined to wind up
in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife,
who will divorce you, win custody of the children
and run off will all your money.
Or you could be an alpha—an independent,
promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women
and forms attachments to none of them.
In the Red Pill philosophy there are two ways
to become alpha.
The first is simply to be a Chad by nature.
The second is to become a pick-up artist.
Redpilled pick-up artists believe basically
the same things about women that incels believe,
that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and
fuckable, but not lovable.
The difference is that pick-up artists are
not celibate, in fact they try to have sex
with as many women as possible by following
a series of strategies and scripts known as
“game” as described by the book of that
title, as well as by the red-pilled pick-up
artist Roosh V, author of a book called—
Bang, a new mascara from Benefit.
So the tube is bomb, I am living.
Let’s see what kind of wand it has.
Oh...it’s so big.
I wonder what Roosh is up to lately.
- I bake my own bread.
Yes, I’m outing myself as a baker, as someone
who likes to cook.
I’m not a woman.
I am ultra masculine, as you can see, but
baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing.
And men like scientific things.
I used to be a scientist.
- Well, Roosh you know what?
If it means you leave women alone then I hope
you enjoy your new life as an ultra-masculine baker—
sorry, I mean bread scientist.
So remember the red pill is the realization
that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%
or less of men are really attractive to women,
dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism
is a pretext for enabling women to behave
however they want while consigning men to
emasculation and impotence.
The black pill is the additional realization
that one’s place in the sexual marketplace
is genetically determined, that one is a permanent
virgin, that sex and relationships are forever
out of reach, and hence that happiness is
impossible and there’s nothing one can do
except Lie Down and Rot.
The black pill is, essentially, dogmatic hopelessness
about dating and about life in general.
It is the pinnacle of what psychotherapists
call catastrophizing: a cognitive distortion
where anxiety or depression leads you to infer
apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks
and anxieties.
For instance, a catastrophizing person might
begin with the thought, oh no, I’m going
to be late for work, and from there infer:
my boss is going to be angry, I’m going
to lose my job, I’m not going to able to
get another job, I’m going to be unemployed
forever, my family will starve, oh god we’re
all going to die.
Each step in the sequence is sort of plausible,
but the leap from step one to step seven is
completely absurd.
This is exactly how the black pill works.
You start with experiences of rejection and
isolation.
From there you infer that you are unattractive
to women, that you will never be attractive
to any woman, that you will be forever alone,
that you will always be unhappy, that women
did this to you, that feminism empowered women
to do this to you, that the social trends
that made this possible are only getting worse,
that humanity itself is doomed and your only
option is to lie down and rot.
Of course, not all incels take things quite
so far, but a lot of them do.
On incel forms suicidal ideation is very common,
and posts are often tagged “sui fuel”
or “rope fuel” meaning that they make
you want to kill yourself, usually because
they’re reminders of how hopeless the incel
situation is, or how devastating it is that
incels are missing out on the incredible bliss
of sex and romance.
Now if you suggest to incels that posting
sui fuel on forums already populated with
lonely and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that, "Oh it's
"just dark humor, it’s just a cope, throw
us a bone here."
But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs
of humor, and it’s common to see people
express pretty extreme states of depression,
which is not surprising, since hopelessness
is the logical conclusion of the black pill
worldview.
One’s possibility for happiness is determined
by the genetics of height, frame, and facial
bone structure. And if you don’t have these
gifts there’s no relief but to cope or rope.
Now—it’s pretty tempting to just mom the
shit out of these kids.
You want to grab them by their Black Ops t-shirts,
shake them a bit and tell them that there
are millions of men with small wrists and
weak chins getting laid every day, that they’re
their own worst enemies, that they need to
get off the computer, go outside, make some
friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies,
and who knows maybe then they’ll develop
a disposition that women find a little more
approachable.
Essentially, you want to tell them, "Clean your
room, bucko."
In fact for the young men in this demographic
who are receptive to that kind of advice,
Jordan Peterson is probably helpful.
Because he’s telling them a lot of what
they need to hear, and he’s kind of a sexist
old man so they might actually listen.
But most incels don’t want to hear this
kind of advice.
In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.
You are, in effect, chadsplaining their oppression
to them when you give basic advice like, "be
more confident," "take a shower," to people who
have already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation,
and who believe they’ve already tried everything.
So they despise this kind of advise, and devote
endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility
and insensitivity of it.
- [V.O.] “Just go out to parties, bro!”
“Instead of hating on women all day why
don’t you losers just try being confident
"like this average looking guy?
"Confidence is key.”
“You incels need some hobbies.
"Try reading some books, women love INTELLIGENCE!
"It works for me bro!”
“Aw, you just need to get out more.”
♪ No one knows what it’s like to be hated
♪
- To incels, their worldview seems ironclad.
It has built-in defenses against anyone who
would try to change their minds.
So if you want to understand incels, and in
particular if you want to understand why their
community produces so many mass murderers,
you have to understand that the black pill
is more than the dogma that you can’t get
laid.
It’s also the dogma that because you can’t
get laid, you can never be happy.
So what we have on our hands here is more
than a bunch of angry Internet misogynists.
It’s, at worst, a kind of a death cult,
complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.
And it’s not surprising that that state
of mind leads a few of them to conclude that
since triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?
Third Base: Tinder is Garbage
I know I said I wasn’t gonna sympathize
with incels, and I know they don’t want
my sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil—
but on some level I can’t help it.
The Internet is for introverts, so I’m sure
a lot of people watching this feel the same way.
I bet some of you have been this guy.
I’ve been this guy.
So look, I’m gonna tell you something I’ve
never really come out about on this channel,
so this is like a really vulnerable moment
for me, but I used to live as a man.
And I’m not proud of that but I’m ready
to move on if you’re ready to forgive.
I’m in the unusual situation of being a
woman who dates men who used to be
a man who dates women.
What kind of fucked up shit is that?
Is that even allowed?
Alright calm down lesbian stans I’m still
attracted to women, and those who lieth betwixt,
cats, the inherent eroticism of the sea.
[Mendelssohn, Hebrides Overture]
[V.O] Mmmm yeah.
Don’t you just wanna get in there.
Take me mommy!
But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.
- I gotta get my hetero on!
- What I’m getting at is I’ve used Tinder
both as a man seeking women, and as a woman
seeking men.
And I think I that gives me some relevant experiences.
When you’re a man the strategy is you’ve
gotta send a lot of messages because women
get a lot of messages, and then you’ve just
gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.
Whereas if you’re a woman, you get to lie
recumbent on your chaise longue
and receive the inquiries.
Let’s see how we’re doing here.
How many men have liked me on Tinder?
I’m paying $30 for this information so this
better be good.
I have 2500 likes.
That’s a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped
right on a tran.
What a divine city!
[Game show music]
Awww that’s so nice of them to be interested
in me.
Let’s see what kind of messages I got.
"DICK OR NO DICK?"
"PRE-OP OR POST-OP?"
"DID YOU CUT YOUR DICK OFF?"
Oh my god.
I’m gonna cut it off, okay? Jesus.
I will let you smash my pussy so so hard, if
you just be patient.
it’s a whole process.
- That’s not a pussy, that’s a fuck hole.
You’ll never know what it means to squeeze
life out of your sacred passage.
- Well, that’s true.
I’m not squeezing any life out unless something
goes very seriously wrong.
And I assure you that none of the passages
I have down there ever have been or ever will
be sacred.
Abigail, leave my fuck hole out of this.
When I first started using this app I was
messaging a guy who seemed super chill, he
was gonna take me to a concert, and I was
like that seems like a lot for a first date
but okay I’ll try it.
15 minutes after we agreed to that he sends me a message.
“What color panties are you wearing?
"I would love to smell them.”
...Can we get coffee first?
The hell of it is, I probably would’ve let
him smell my panties.
But this is a thing you bring up on the third
fuck.
You don’t open with panty sniffing.
Like the only point of in-app messaging is
for me to figure out if you’re gonna murder
me, and you’re already fucking it up.
So this is the experience of women on Tinder.
We’re drowning in dick and most of it is
terrible.
Not all, I do have some very sweet messages, and
I haven’t used this app in a couple months,
so if I didn’t respond to you or if we didn’t
match, it’s not because I rejected you,
it's because I don't like the app.
People screenshot my profile and post it online,
and they call me contrapoints in app,
like—
I’m just too famous for this shit.
My life is hard.
So girls, we do a lot of complaining about
the firing squad of bad dicks that’s constantly
pointed at us on dating apps.
But how would you feel if instead of that
you were just getting radio silence like the incels get?
I can’t speak for other women, but personally,
I prefer the firing squad of dicks.
You know, at least these pricks care enough about my
pussy to be an asshole about my dick.
I feel sorry for men on dating apps I really
do.
They have to deal with a lot of rejection,
and that must be difficult.
And these apps are especially brutal to people
who aren’t photogenic.
If you’re meeting people at a bar or a party,
you might strike up a conversation with someone
you’re not initially physically attracted
to.
But then maybe they’re super funny, or charming,
or maybe they’re attracted to me—and
that’s an attractive quality in another
person that they appreciate how beautiful I am.
But on Tinder, you’re just browsing a catalog
of faces, and gatekeeping who even
gets to talk to you in the first place.
Red-pillers have a really gross way of talking
about dating in terms of “sexual market
value” but like, dating kind of is a marketplace,
or at least you can analyze it like one.
And our culture is so visual, and these apps
are so picture-centered that bone structure,
like, it’s not the only thing that matters,
but it matters a great deal.
And this is where I do have sympathy for the
incels, because as a trans woman I know what
it’s like to obsess over millimeters of
bone.
I had to interrupt work on this video to go
to a consultation for facial feminization
surgery so that I can going to pay luxury
car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters
of bone here and there because it must needs
be remarked that the skull of the female exhibiteth
a brow ridge less pronounced.
I mean I’m just as obsessed with bone structure
as the goddamn incels, because I think certain
parts of my face make me look like a man,
and I worry about it every day.
We’re all obsessed with the bones honey.
We all have bones inside us, we all love touching
bones.
[sensual whispering V.O.] You want to take a
measurement from the supraorbital ridge to
the lambdoid suture, and multiply that figure
by pi to calculate what we call the Chad circumference.
Why is no one talking about the Chad circumference?
4th base:
Just the tip
There’s another way I think my experience
as a trans woman is relevant to the incel
discussion, and that’s that I know delusional
self-loathing when I see it.
I’m far from the first to point out that
the “supreme gentleman” incel mass murderer
Eliot Rodger was, apart from his narcissistic
psychopath personality, an eminently bangable twink.
Now I’m not gonna show you pictures of incels,
but on their forums they do sometimes post
selfie threads.
And you can’t say this on incel forums without
enraging them, but in confidence from one
pretend clinician to another, let me tell
you that the truth about incels is that almost
all of them are completely normal looking guys.
But of course that’s not the feedback they
get from other incels.
The feedback they get is that their chins
are weak, their hair is thin, their skin
is garbage and there’s no hope whatsoever,
no woman will ever love them, they are truecels
with no option but to lie down and rot.
And the interesting thing is, those guys post selfies to those threads knowing
that’s the feedback that they’re gonna
get.
So why?
Why do they do it?
Well, I’ll tell you a little story.
There is a website on the Internet called
4chan.org that has a board called LGBT.
A few years ago this was used mainly by the
25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos,
but recently it’s used mostly by “men”
who are entertaining the notion of becoming
women, and by early transition trans women.
So the board is jokingly called TTTT.
Now I’ve recently moved beyond that first
stage of my transition, but the memory
is still fresh, and let me tell you, it is a painful,
awkward, humiliating stage of life.
So the trans women of TTTT are tragic, they’re
basically still in man mode, which is why
they’re using 4chan, and I bring them up
because they remind me a lot of incels.
For incels the core frustration is that they
can’t get laid.
For TTTT it’s that they can’t pass as
female.
Both groups post selfies knowing they’re
going to get brutal unconstructive feedback.
And both groups have a weird vocabulary with
which to express their anxieties.
For instance on TTTT a major piece of jargon
is hon, a slur used by trans women for other
trans women, which basically means that you
look like a man in a dress, which is what
every trans woman is afraid of.
And there’s another commonality with incels
too, with all bigots and self-loathers, which
if you’ve been paying attention, you’ve
already guessed.
-[V.O] “You will never be seen as a
woman because of your head size.
"Have all the surgeries in the world, your
massive man noggin will stay the same.”
“lel, this freak thinks he has very soft
facial features.
"His head is fucking huge, lel and the hons
on reddit are hugboxing him and telling him
"that there are women with big heads.
"No, there aren’t. 
There aren’t fucking women with heads as
big as that and ffs won’t change shit.
"You might as well repress.
"You transition with a man’s head.
"You will be clocked, you will be looked at
as a freak, you will never be seen as a legit woman.  100%”
“THIS is why I am not transitioning.
"Thank you Skull-people for showing me the
way and that no matter what I do I will always
"be a manly man skull-wise.
"You saved me the embarrassment of being a
literal big-headed man in a dress."
- 'Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile
be much more voluminous and the facial plane wider—
- It always comes back to the skulls.
Every time.
The other interesting thing about TTTT is
I used to get posted there a lot.
For a while I had some stans on the board
who basically viewed me as inspiration.
Yikes.
Because of course that kind of post is frowned
upon.
If I’m not looked at as a big-skulled manly
freak, if my transition is going well,
that means that some of their transitions
might go well too, and that is an unacceptable
conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing
and hopelessness.
So it was necessary for the rest of the board
to explain why I didn’t
pass, why I would never pass, and why anyone
who looked less good than me shouldn’t even
fucking think about it.
They shouldn’t transition at all,
they should just repress, they should lie
down and rot.
And I used to read this stuff all the time.
Like I would specifically seek out threads about
me.
Which might seem strange considering I had
hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous
goddess every day.
So why did I turn away from that to intentionally
seek out this dismal den of hons talking about
how my giant hon skull is clockable at a thousand
paces, and my voice sounds like a ridiculous
muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse and
Winnie the Pooh?
Well basically there was part of my brain
that just simply refused to believe it when people
told me I was gorgeous.
And for semi-plausible reasons.
A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans
people they look gorgeous no matter what they look like.
That’s where the word "hon" comes from.
You look great hon.
So what TTTT is saying about reddit hugboxing
is true to some extent.
There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery
that prevails in some trans spaces.
So I came to regard all compliments as “everyone
is beautiful,” politically correct cuckoldry.
And there would be this thrill of going to
TTTT and reading other people saying what
my deepest anxieties told me was really true.
And that was always painful but there was
a kind of pleasure too.
There was a rush.
It’s exciting to burst out of the politically
correct bubble and say what you’re really
thinking: that personality doesn’t matter
because big-skulled Chads get all the girls,
that ContraPoints is a big-skulled hon with
a voice like nails on a chalkboard.
And at first I justified the habit by telling
myself I was just doing research.
I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are
saying, that’s simply my job.
But soon I realized it wasn’t just research,
and it was infecting me away from the computer.
This ridiculous vocabulary—hons, AGP—was
popping up in my head at unexpected times.
It was really starting to color how I thought
about myself, and worse, it was starting
to infect how I thought about other trans
women.
And that’s the moment I realized I need
to stop looking at this stuff right now or
I’m going to become a monster, and once
that happens it’s going to be very difficult to fix.
This is exactly how the incel blackpill works.
There’s something infectious about these
vocabularies.
Like on the days I’ve been working on this
video, I’ll go out at night and these words
just involuntarily show up in my thoughts.
That bartender is such a Chad, he’s totally
height mogging that tiny cuck.
And the tragic thing is some incels don’t
realize what this is doing to their minds
until it’s too late.
- [V.O.] “Let’s face it; blackpills
are sui fuel, and a lot of us can’t handle them.
"I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the
moment I discovered it, since I loved uncovering
"secrets that society had been hiding from
me, but it has affected my mental health in
"a bad way.
"I made my first call to the suicide hotline
a few weeks ago, and I’ve never needed to
"do that before.
"I could always talk myself out of it through
logic, but my mind is ruined now.”
- This is a form of what psychologists are calling
digital self-harm, prototypically
teens who leave themselves abusive
comments from sock-puppet accounts.
But the more sophisticated adult version involves
intentionally seeking out abusive and disparaging
comments about yourself made by other people.
I have a long history of doing this, intentionally
looking for abusive comments, especially ones
that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities
and fears.
Why?
I don’t know.
Why do people cut themselves?
Part of it is what we could call masochistic
epistemology: whatever hurts is true.
I’ve recently gotten much better about
this.
I haven’t been to any of the worst places
in a couple months,
and my mental health is much improved.
So, incels.
I’m not going to respond to your worldview
like its an intellectual position worthy of rational debate.
Because these ideas and arguments, you’re
not using them the way rational people use arguments.
You’re using them as razor blades to abuse
yourselves.
And I know because I’ve done the exact same
thing.
The incel worldview is catastrophizing.
It’s an anxious death spiral.
And the solution to that has to be therapeutic,
not logical.
A lot of you are lonely.
You’ve been bullied and neglected.
- [Operator] 911, what are you reporting?
- [Caller] Uh, there's someone or some kind of creature prancing around out here.
- Okay, is it a person an animal or —
- I can't tell. It looks like a woman but she's about six foot tall, big man hands.
- I'm sorry, you're calling to report a tall woman with man hands?
- Well, she's covered in butterflies. And she has giant wings."
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh, and she talks like a f****t
- Ma'am.
[shimmering noises]
- Out of this wood do not desire to go: Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
[Mendelssohn, "A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture, Allegro di molto"]
[more shimmering noises]
Hail mortals! I come to thee from my fairy grove to bring thee tidings of great woe.
Western culture is being destroyed by cucks
and by gender-bending, intoxication and sodomy. You know, things that have never happened in Europe.
[Mendelssohn, "A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture, Allegro di molto"]
There's a lot of people talking lately about "the West" and "Western culture" and "Western civilization"
But what do those words even mean?
I guess the mature and responsible thing to do would be a simple
educational video to edify the public.
Fuck that.
The people demand blood. And I'm thirsty for blood.
And by blood, I mean dick.
And by dick, I mean corndogs. And by corndogs, I mean 16 of them over the course of an evening.
And by evening, I mean morning. And by morning, I mean between 8 o'clock and 8:15.
and by corndogs — [whispering] — I mean dick.
Who's up first?
Well, angry white guy YouTube is usually talking about Western culture, and it's been awhile since I've done a video response, so
let's see what's going on in that part of the Internet.
- Magog is here, baby doll!
[screaming]
I wanna die!
[screaming]
That,
is a man!
- Wow, I've never done a video response to such a powerful wizard.
- The second and third clues are Elsa's magical powers,
and the song "Let It Go". Both of these clues have to do with coming out.
- Wrong. A magic power is the conflict of the plot and her letting it go
is just her realizing her true potential,
and her ability to conquer and rule her kingdom.
She will destroy her enemies and raze their castles to the ground.
The song "Let It Go" is basically,
"Fuck this shit. I'm conquering everyone.'"
- So, just to be clear
this- this is a grown man who has dressed himself in the garb of a sorcerer to shout about a
YouTube channel for preschoolers.
It almost feels like punching down at this point.
At least the Golden One was masc4masc.
Who can I punch up at?
Blegh. I don't like talking about punching.
It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching TERFs.
I would never a punch a TERF.
[shimmering noises] My hands are too feminine and my fingers are tired.
Someone massage them.
Who can I claw up at?
- The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.
How about that?
- Dad! Stop? Ugh. Get out of my life!
In my video about Jordan Peterson, I talked about how he posits a struggle
between "the West" and "postmodern neo-Marxism".
I argued that "pomo nomo" is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas
None of which are in any sense non-Western.
Unless of course you equate the West with white people and Marxism with the Jews,
which, surely no one involved in this conversation is doing, riiight?
[failure sound effect]
[whispering] I'm guessing he wasn't a fan of the bath scene.
In this video, I want to look a little bit closer at the whole concept of the West and the people who claim to defend it
[schwing]
Wow daddy. Nice... sword. Goddamn it, we're gonna need to aim even higher.
Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, I give you:
[exasperated sigh]
The President of the United States of America,
big dick special big boy Donald Trump.
- Just as Poland could not be broken,
I declare today for the world to hear that
the West will never ever
be broken.
Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization
will triumph.
[scary violin noises]
- So we've got the most powerful fuck boy on the planet prattling on about the battle for the survival of Western civilization.
So I suppose we should probably figure out what that's supposed to mean.
Which is too bad because that's gonna require a lot of thinking, and I don't feel like thinking because my brain is tired.
Someone massage it.
And soon,
mechanically,
dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow,
I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the corndog.
No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate, then a shudder ran through me and I stopped,
intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses,
something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin.
And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory -
This new sensation having had on me the effect which a love has, of - [sudden] post-preambulatory banter.
Whether you're in fashy YouTube, or pomo nomo acadomono,
It's common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous, clearly defined thing
called "Western civilization" that starts in ancient Athens
and flourishes in our own era of enlightened philosopher kings.
Announcer: [screaming] "Donald Trump! Donald Trump!"
But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively by modern people for particular purposes.
It's like an origin myth. In an article titled,
"There is no such thing as Western civilization," the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
there was no such thing as "the West." The world was divided into three continents he called
Europe, Asia, and Libya. Herodotus had no notion that these three continents
corresponded to different types of people, and he never referred to any group of people called "European."
In fact,
he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia, in which he traveled, than with the faraway and foreign people of Northern Europe.
So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that.
Really there is no one idea of "the West," which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas.
According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked under the heading of "the West." Let's talk about them now.
Concept 1: Christendom and "Judeo-Christian Values"
In the year 732, a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory at the Battle of Tours
against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain into what is now France
effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate into Western Europe.
According to Appiah, the first recorded use of the Latin term 'Europenses' or Europeans dates from 754,
and describes the victors of the Battle of Tours
distinguishing Christians from Muslims.
In the late Middle Ages, the concept of Christendom appeared,
and was used to distinguish the Christian world from the Islamic world and from paganism.
This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor to the modern concept of the West.
Notice that the term itself posits an us-versus-them dichotomy, where Christians are the 'us' and
Muslims are the 'them.' The Christian inheritance is still invoked today by defenders of the West like Lil' Benny and Professor Studied-the-Blade,
often under the heading of
[The Hallelujah chorus of Handel's Messiah plays] "Judeo-Christian Values"
a term usually used to falsely imply that
contemporary moral norms derived from such a generic, parochial, and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments,
as if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder,
as if the prohibition of graven images has any contemporary influence whatsoever,
as if it isn't an embarrassment that there are four laws protecting snowflake Yahweh's easily-triggered ego,
and none condemning slavery and rape. And what if I LIKE it when my neighbor covets my ass??
Bible jokes!
The other main use of "Judeo-Christian values"
is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers.
Speaking of which, what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom? Two kids and a dog, just like the Bible says?
Well, no.
Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament and not forbidden in either Testament.
Even in the beginning,
Eve couldn't keep her hands away from strange serpents (and who can blame her) and Joseph was a massive cuck who raised another man's child.
But it's cool,
he was into that.
In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church gradually enforced the one-man-and-one-woman view of marriage,
although in formerly pagan lands,
this idea was slow to take hold.
Charles Martel's grandson Charlemagne had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines,
because he was a proud son of the North,
100% natty and Alpha as fuck.
I'm sorry.
I - I just can't stop. The Golden One... his soul and mine are intermingled,
probably because we both played twelve hundred hours of Age of Empires in 1999, and then something went terribly wrong:
Fuckin' 9/11. It used to be such an innocent decision, choosing to play as the Franks or the Saracens,
then it became this huge civilizational struggle, and that's why this guy is a fascist and I grew up to be a woman.
Thanks a lot, Osama.
Being transgender is so weird. Like, you have these childhood memories that are just totally discordant with your adult gender identity.
Like, how do you even deal with that? Well, here's how: you bond with straight guys over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia,
and then you fuck them.
I'M NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS
Wololo [a distorted version of "FLORAL SHOPPE" plays:
Concept 2: Enlightenment Values
So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior named Martin Luther nails his list of whiney
complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg. That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence between Catholics and Protestants.
That eventually chills out, but then the 18th century rolls around and shit's just fucking crazy.
There are various fops and dandies and macaronis
getting wired out of their heads at coffee houses and babbling about enlightenment like the beatnik trash they are.
Then 300 years later, a bunch of drink-sodden fedora tippers appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire,
before sinking into sweeping sexual harassment allegations under the rug
and making fifty-five consecutive YouTube videos about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games.
That's not what they were discussing at the Parisian salon.
This is all very embarrassing, but still, some of these enlightenment values —
science, liberty, skepticism about dogma —
these are basically good ideas, and they're part of the amalgamation we call "the West,"
but it's important to keep in mind that these ideas are not "Judeo-Christian".
In fact, they're specifically opposed to that way of thinking.
So the sum of what we now think of as "the West" actually contains major contradictions,
because the history of the West is a history of change and revolution.
So when a new movement comes along, like, for instance, a bunch of buzzkill sad sacks pointing out that
actually, our society is still pretty terrible to women, people of color, and gender and sexual minorities
it might not be the smartest thing to just dismiss it as some kind of sinister postmodern neo-Marxist cuckoldry.
It could be the next reformation in a history marked by a series of reformations.
If there are any historians watching this, please call it the SJW Reformation.
Think about the Protestant Reformation.
At the time, that probably seemed like a civilizational threat to the Holy Roman Empire, and it kind of was.
But in retrospect,
we see the Reformation as just as important a moment in Western culture as the medieval period that preceded it.
But today's counter-reformation, made up of people like Orangie Smalls and Dr. Clean-Your-Room
(ummm)
insist on pretending the current reformation is some kind of alien threat.
And as for the counter-counter-reformation, well,
that's what you pay a trashy tran to do.
Concept 3: Western Culture
The idea of "the West" has its roots in the medieval schism between the Western Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.
But in its contemporary sense, the idea of "Western culture" didn't really exist until
the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries
when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spengler's 1918 book, 'The Decline of the West',
an important influence on Nazi ideology. As long as people have been talking about "Western culture",
they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration
as I've discussed in several earlier videos which I encourage you not to watch.
But the idea of Western culture was influential well beyond the Third Reich.
At the height of European imperialism, the idea of a superior high culture of the West
was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit the mysterious Orient.
And even though we've swept the more overtly supremacist rhetoric under the rug,
the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept in our schools and universities
where you have to take courses like History of Western Civilization or Western Literature
that you didn't actually do any of the readings for because you were too busy crouching in the bushes outside the Dean's office
vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu.
The consequence of this Western culture education
is that we now all have this sense that we belong to a continuous civilization whose crowning achievements
are the Ten Commandments,
Jesus-fuckin'-Christ,
Athenian pederasts,
cathedrals,
Mozart,
human rights,
science,
and iPhones.
But the reality is, this is an essentialist conglomeration of a history that's much more nonlinear than we often think.
We in the West claim to be the inheritors of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham,
but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim.
St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers,
is largely responsible for introducing Aristotle to Christian universities
but he never would have encountered Aristotle in the first place had not ancient Greek philosophy
been translated and commentated by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd.
So the origins of Western culture aren't really unique to us at all. And the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions.
On the one hand you have Judeo-Christian values, and on the other hand
you have degenerates like William Shakespeare who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens and make out with each other.
[shimmer noises] Which, for the record, is disgusting, and I condemn it, and I'll have no part in it.
Cause if you didn't know, in Shakespeare times, boys in drag played female parts.
I wish I had female parts.
Working on it.
Concept 4: The Free World
From 1941 to 1945, Franklin Roosevelt's Vice President was Henry Wallace, an agricultural scientist from Iowa
whom Democratic Party officials despised for being what we'd now call a Democratic Socialist.
Wallace later ran for president in 1948 as a third party candidate on a platform of universal health care,
anti-segregation, and opposition to the Cold War. During the campaign, Wallace was widely mocked in the press
for his spiritualism, his refusal to disavow the Communist Party's endorsement, and what TIME Magazine called
"his assault on the south," that is, his quote "ostentatious ride through cities and towns with his Negro secretary beside him",
for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs.
The poor, naive Wallace commented, "There is something so unlovely about hate when you see it distorting the human face."
Well, get used to it buddy. This is America.
Am I lecturing someone from 1948 about how bigoted this country is?
This is fine.
Wallace received only 2.4 percent of the popular vote in the 1948 election
and he's now best remembered for his 1942 speech titled, "The Century of the Common Man",
in which he contrasted what he called the "slave world" of fascists with the free world,
which he described as an incomplete and ongoing international People's Revolution.
- [Narrator] "No Nazi counter-revolution will stop it;
"the common man will smoke the Hitler stooges out into the open in the United States, in Latin America, and in India.
"He will destroy their influence. No Lavals, no Mussolinis, will be tolerated in a free world."
- Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it,
but it was common during World War II, when the phrase "the free world" first entered common parlance,
to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers,
including the dirty Reds.
After the war, the phrase "The Free World" remained common in American politics.
But the meaning shifted. Instead of referring to the international alliance against fascism,
it referred to the capitalist West, as opposed to the communist East.
The idea of the free Capitalist West
is still an important ingredient in this jumbled concept we call Western civilization.
So when Lobster Dad says there's a struggle between Marxism and the West, it seems at first like
he's just stuck in the 1980s or something.
Doesn't he know there's no more Eastern Bloc?
Dad?
What year do you think it is? Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies?
[whispering] They're on your side now, remember?
The truth is, he's just using the term Neo-Marxism to invoke Red Scare sentiment in opposition to the SJW Reformation.
But the point I'm trying to make is that the West is a concept, or rather several contradictory concepts,
that are always posited in particular political circumstances as one side of an us-versus-them opposition.
Whether it's the Christian West versus the infidels, the Enlightenment West versus Islam,
the cultured West versus the colonized savages, the capitalist West versus the communist East,
or the white European West versus the Jewish Cultural Marxist plot to cuck the sons of the North
by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens
and inundating their countries with a barbarous horde of Third World migrants.
I guess I have to say something about that, huh.
Concept 5: Blood and Soil
If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer Richard Spencer what he thinks the West is,
he'll tell you that it's a cultural, geographic, and genetic inheritance bequeathed to European people by their fair-skinned ancestors.
To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent could be part of the West is ridiculous,
because for Spencer, to be Western is to be white.
Now the thing about that is, as an analysis of the common usage of the term "the West," it's not even wrong.
Consider Latin America, where the main languages spoken are Spanish, Portuguese, and French, where the majority religion is Roman Catholicism.
Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the West? Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders?
Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club.
Or, to be more accurate, the flexible and historically variant concepts of whiteness and the West
have been constructed so as to exclude them.
And I've already spent half my YouTube career on delirious gay screeching about Nazis
so I don't want to do more of that now.
But suffice to say, the association between whiteness and the West
is always lurking beneath the surface
and when whiteness rears its head proudly, the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of.
As I'm making this video, the machinery of the middle stages of those crimes is up and running yet again,
thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe and a racist demagogue in the United States.
And once more both continents are dotted with barbed wire, refugee ghettos,
and internment camps full of children torn from parents.
Concept 6: The Evil West
"The West" in many ways is an inherently supremacist concept.
It's thought to be more civilized, more holy, and more cultured than the non-West.
But there are some ridiculous college professors who adopt this story wholesale, but flip it on its head.
According to them, the West is not uniquely civilized, but uniquely uncivilized, cruel, imperialistic, racist, and genocidal.
But this just perpetuates the same essentializing error.
Europeans aren't inherently more evil any more than they're inherently more civilized.
If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa 400 years ago, the result would have been just as brutal.
So instead of vilifying the West,
I think we should get rid of the concept altogether,
adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves,
and acknowledge that the world is too complicated to reduce to simple us-and-them binaries.
Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle and classical music and the Cheesecake Factory.
We can still keep all that shit while eliminating the propaganda and injustice that surrounds it.
Coda
My mind is a predator that preys upon itself.
WHAT IF TRAPS ARE GAY
WHAT IF NO ONE CAN EVER LOVE YOU
WHAT IF HAPPINESS IS IMPOSSIBLE
WHAT IF EVERYONE WHO COMPLIMENTS ME IS LYING
SO THEY CAN LAUGH AT ME LATER WHEN I DELUSIONALLY FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF -
WHAT IF WHEN YOU DIE YOU STAY CONSCIOUS AND THEN YOU JUST ARE -
WHAT IF I'M STANDING IN AN AWKWARD WAY AND IT LOOKS WEIRD
WHAT IF BLANCHARD IS RIGHT
WHAT ARE THESE HORRIBLE GODDAMN NOISES COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH
Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain
and music is really great for that.
I've always liked classical music.
When I listen to Mozart or Mendelssohn or even an amateur like Satie,
my mind is lifted to a higher plateau
and I don't care what civilization the composer came from or whether he was a bigot or a sexist,
and I don't want to know because I NEED this.
I need this feeling that makes me just want to
take a big

Welcome to my world.
Every week, I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials.
Come get ready with me!
So, I'm gonna go with the color "snowflake" from my Winter Rose palette, using a Flaunt 325 brush...

Okay...
I'm not living for it.
Oh my God...
I think I glued my eye shut!
Fuck!
But I'm not just a pretty face.
I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social & political issues.
Even though I'm trans, I refuse to be a victim, because I prefer to take control of my own life.
Which is why I support our president,

♪♪
- Hi. I'm Jackie Jackson, host of The Freedom Report, where—
I'm sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese drag queen redecorated an Italian bordello?
It's— It's hard to move past it.
Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political spectrum.
But I've brought them here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate about a timeless question:
Are traps gay?
My first guest is Adria Finley,
host of a popular YouTube series, Intersectional AF.
Clarence?
- Hey YouTube, it's ya girl, Adria.
Have you ever considered that transphobia...
is racist?
- Okay. My other guest is, returning to the show,
it's Tiffany Tumbles.
Now, Tiffany, you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program. Isn't that right?
That's right, Jackie. It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.
You poor thing!
Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill?
- Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders,
and how I was tired of trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans,
and next thing I know, everyone's calling me a TERF and a traitor.
So I said, you know what, I'm out.
I'm not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame.
I think it's just so brave of you.
-  Yeah, wow.
So brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are.
-  Shut up, Adria!
I had just come out as trans,
and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that,
the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support.
Nothing. I was absolutely alone.
Do you have any idea what that felt like?
Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria. One wrong move and you're dead to them.
Those are not friends.
- Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany.
I think you're gonna fit right in with this new group of
dangerous intellectuals who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left,
and speaking out against politically correct dogma.
Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?
- So I'm gonna go in with the highlighter, pop it on my cheeks.
Pop it on my brow, till I'm literally blinding.
I am glowing!
Hmm. She's doing alright, but I'm not living for it.
You know what else I'm not living for?
The Muslims.
Tiffany, you are so funny!
-  I'm sorry. Are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism?
- How is that racist? Muslim's a religion, not a race.
- Yeah, Adria! Muslim's a religion, not a race.
- Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together. You can't just...
Well, you both know exactly what I'm talking about.
- Let's try to get back on track here. So, Adria:
Traps.
Are they gay?
- Look, there's so many things wrong with the question that the only way to answer is to deconstruct it.
First of all, what are traps? Are they trans women?
Because if you're calling trans women traps,
then you're directly playing into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men;
a lie that reinforces the mentality that causes men to murder us.
- Well, I don't think "trap" is necessarily a trans woman. What about anime?
- Okay, so the word "trap" was invented by English-speaking anime fans.
The Japanese word is otokonoko (男の娘), which just means a male crossdresser.
There's no implication of tricking men.
But the word "trap" is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women.
So when you tell us that's not what it means,
you're gaslighting the shit out of us, because we've all heard it used as a slur.
- Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women.
We're not all offended all the time. I actually happen to identify as a trap.
- Yeah, Adria. She identifies as a trap.
- Well, she's in the sunken place. And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless.
Doesn't it bother you at all that if some guy murders you, his defense is gonna be, "Well, she was a trap, I was tricked,"
and you'll have contributed to that way of thinking?
- What do you care, Adria? No one's gonna be trapped by you anyway!
- Ooh, spicy.
- The fuck did you just say?
- I said, no shade, but you don't really look like a woman.
- Jackie, are you going to allow your guest to talk to me like this?
- Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer.
- Look, dragging bitches is what I do. Facts over feels, honty.
- Well, Adria, don't you think she has a bit of a point?
Like, if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in.
I mean, what is this, a men's shirt? How are you gonna attract men with that?
- I'm not trying to attract men. I'm a lesbian.
- I'm sorry. Maybe this is a stupid question,
but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian?
- Well, I'm a woman and I like women.
- I dunno about that. Sounds debatable.
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the transphobia special!
- Transphobia? Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair.
I mean, I've invited two trans women to be on my program,
and I'll have you know that one of my best friends happens to be a gay man.
And what could be transphobic about that?
- See, Adria, you're the reason why everyone hates trans people.
You're obnoxious and offended by everything, and everyone feels like they have to tread on eggshells around you.
- Thank you, Tiffany.
See, you're one of the good ones. You're a good tran.
- Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany? Be the lapdog of people like this?
- No. I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people
by being patient and agreeable, and by looking the part,
and not by screeching "transphobia" at everyone who doesn't meet your impossible standard of wokeness.
- And you're gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh?
Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away?
- Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany, that you're not gaining acceptance for anyone but yourself?
And the only reason you're accepted is that you don't challenge the status quo?
- I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas, because I feel like we're just getting hung up on terminology.
Look, Adria, if you don't like the word "trap", we just won't use the word "trap".
The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to trans women?
- It is if you're a woman.
- No, I mean for men.
Like... Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men?
- Well, all the men I've dated only date women, but if they're attracted to me...
I mean, it's not the straightest thing, is it?
- Why not? You look like a woman,
and I know that you know that gay men are not attracted to these tits.
- Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so, granted.
- But doesn't she have a point, though, Adria?
I mean, sure, she looks like a woman, but she does have XY chromosomes.
- When was the last time you were attracted to a person's chromosomes?
That's not how sexuality works.
We're attracted to a person's perceptible features, not molecular biology.
- Okay, sure, but...
I mean, a lot of trans women still have their penis,
and you got to admit, that seems kinda gay.
- Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you?
We live in a world where there's no shortage of men who want to date trans women,
but there's an intense stigma on dating trans women.
And it's actually dangerous, because what happens is, if a man's friends find out that the woman he's dating is trans,
he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.
And this happens again and again,
and every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay,
you're adding to that stigma, and you're making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women.
- Alright, I'm not trying to use violent words or whatever.
I just don't understand how a person who's attracted to women could be attracted to a person with a penis.
- Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you.
I am a lesbian. I'm only attracted to women, including trans women.
And when I'm attracted to a trans woman, I perceive her as a woman.
And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation, but as a part of her female body.
So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick.
- I'm sorry, what? What is girl dick? 
- The feminine penis.
- Oh, no...
- Oh, come on, this is nonsense!
How could a penis possibly be feminine?
- Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman,
but also because hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis.
- [EXASPERATED SIGH]
Shut up, Adria. Just shut up!
- Wait, really? How is it different?
- Well, I'm glad you asked. More needs to be said about the feminine penis.
Why is no one talking about the feminine penis?
- Kill me now.
- So, to start with, it doesn't get as hard, it doesn't really ejaculate, and it has a different mouthfeel.
- Ugh.
- Can we please talk about the mouthfeel?
Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel?
- [GROANING]
- I don't think that's necessary. I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.
You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men?
- That's correct. I don't like man dick.
It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it cums everywhere.
Not like girl dick. Girl dick is everything soft and smooth.
- Ugh.
- What is that, Star Wars? Ugh!
Do you also build computers for a living?
- I mean, guilty. I also enjoy wearing knee socks.
[SICK GUITAR RIFF]
- And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist catgirl.
- My sweet love.
- Wait, you're dating that crazy Antifa cat?
- Well, we're in the same polycule.
- I don't know what that means. And I'm not, like, prejudiced or anything,
but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.
Like, if you're born male, and you're attracted to women, how is it not just heterosexuality?
- Well, my girlfriend is also trans, so if you follow your logic to its conclusion...
- Okay, so...
You're a woman who was born a man, and you like women, but you're dating a woman...
...a woman who has a penis, that's a female penis, that used to be a male penis...
- [DEEP THOUGHTS OVERLAPPING]
[DEEP THOUGHTS CONTINUE]
...So that means you are gay, but you're gay in the opposite way
as the kind of gay that you were born as?
- I can go over it with you again after the show,
if you need some extra time to figure it out.
[V.O.] Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?
- Adria, just stop talking.
Look, I don't care what you do in private, but I'm sorry to break it to you.
The world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.
What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile,
and people like me to be our representatives.
Because I act like a normal woman, and I date normal men,
and I don't have a catgirl girlfriend with a girl dick. Ugh!
Also, I look fucking gorgeous. I'm sorry, but that matters.
- Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart. You're not Blaire White.
- Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done, so that's not a fair comparison.
- What work are you having done? 
- I'm gonna lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw, reshape my brow,
get some lip injections, maybe Botox my forehead.
Oh, and I'm gonna fix my nose, obviously.
- What's wrong with your nose?
- It's kind of big and mannish.
- Well, my nose looks kind of like that.
Are you saying I look mannish? Are you saying I look ugly? What are you trying to say, Tiffany?
Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to women?
- I'm not doing anything to wome— Wh-What?
- Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.
- That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman.
She has to work really hard to be seen as female, and you just don't.
- Shut the hell up, Adria!
Don't get offended for me! Don't condescend to me! I'm not a victim!
- Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be.
[SOBBING]
But my fiancee still thinks I'm beautiful!
[V.O.] Oh my God, I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this.
[JACKIE SOBBING]
All right, let's— Let's forget about it. I'm, I'm, I'm— I'm, I'm—
I'm fine!

It's just that I've been working so hard to win acceptance for trans people,

Ugh, this hon!

Lady Foppington.
I’m so happy to finally meet the real you.
Enchanté.
I’m not gonna kiss your hand you freak,
I’m more of a woman than you are.
That’s not what they were saying at the
Parisian salon.
Clock me Amadeus.
Don’t break the fourth wall.
I’m trying to make a video about postmodernism.
Get out of my drawing room you 18th century
sexual deviant.
So much for the tolerant Jacobins.
Hm!
Reason.
Power.
Truth.
These are the kinds of topics that I simply
don’t care about.
Unfortunately we have to talk about them because
of a guy named Jordan Peterson.
So who’s Jordan Peterson?
[Sigh]
Well, he’s a psychology professor at the
University of Toronto who got famous for sounding
the alarm about how protecting transgender
people under Canadian human rights law shall
surely lead to Stalinism.
Since then he’s been touring North America
as a celebrity lecturer.
David Brooks called him the most influential
public intellectual in the Western world,
and his self-help book 12 Rules for Life is
a national and international bestseller.
I’m starting to think we may need to take
this guy seriously.
He’s got a ton of fans on YouTube, and I
hope you guys are here watching this video
because I wanna talk.
A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson
haven’t really engaged with his ideas very
much, he’s often caricatured, avoided, or
talked past, as in the infamous BBC interview
where Cathy Newman keeps repeating back very
uncharitable interpretations of everything
he says.
So you’re saying that by and large women
are too agreeable to get the pay raises they
deserve?
No, I’m saying that’s one component—
You’re saying that women aren’t intelligent
enough to run these top companies?
No—
You’re just saying these things though to
provoke, aren’t you?
I mean you are a provocateur.
You’re like the Alt Right that you hate
to be compared to.
You’re saying that we should organize our
societies along the lines of the lobsters.
I think to people watching this it comes off
as if leftists are like, afraid of his actual
ideas.
But I’m not afraid of his ideas.
I’m not afraid of anything.
I just smoked a bunch of fuckin PCP.
[heavy breathing]
Daddy.
So I spent the 
last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson’s
lectures and podcasts and reading his books,
and honestly I think I get why people like
him.
Clearly he has real talent as a public speaker
and as a kind of life coach.
His book 12 Rules for Life echoes past bestsellers
like Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly
Effective People or Rick Warren’s The Purpose-Driven
Life.
The difference is that Peterson takes basic
self-help insights like “take responsibility
for yourself” and “don’t envy other
people,” and he renews them with the intellectual
trappings of psychology, philosophy, Jungian
psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.
He’s telling us a pretty classic story:
life is suffering, happiness is not enough
to sustain you through suffering, so you need
a higher purpose in your life.
But I knew that already.
I learned it at the AA meetings I refuse to
go to.
These are like basic insights of world philosophy
and religion.
But they’re insights that today’s youthssss
apparently haven’t heard before, I guess
because not enough of them are alcoholics.
Or at any rate they haven’t heard them in
a vocabulary that they connected with, so
to a lot of people Peterson’s ideas seem
new and urgent.
And I don’t really object to any of this
self-help stuff.
Most of Peterson’s fans are young men, and
I mean someone has to whip the neckbeards
into shape, and if Peterson can do that, more
power to him.
I mean sometimes boys just need a daddy.
And sometimes girls do too.
But there’s a big problem here.
And the problem is that all this life coaching
is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary
political agenda.
Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help
not merely as a guide
to private life, but as a replacement for
progressive politics, which he characterizes
as totalitarian and evil.
There’s no comparison between Mao and a
trans activist is there?
Why not?
The philosophy that’s guiding their utterances
is the same philosophy.
Now Peterson doesn’t use the word progressive
politics because that doesn’t sound scary
enough.
His new, scarier word is Postmodern neo-Marxism.
Now we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern
neo-Marxism with Cultural Marxism the Nazi
conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals
plotting to destroy the West.
Surely this is not the same thing as that,
right?
Right?
So look: I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson
is a fascist.
And you may quote me on that.
But I’m wondering, if it’s not a fascist
conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals
plotting to destroy the West, then what is
postmodern neo-Marxism?
Well JP, that’s what I’d like to talk
about.
So Jordan—sorry, Dr. Peterson, Professor,
Daddy—Let’s talk.
And for once I’d like to actually treat
this discussion with the seriousness and respect
I think it deserves—
[Sultry sax music]
Mm, that’s good, it’s a good temperature.
Hand me the oil, would you daddy?
[beeps and boops]
Thanks Daddy.
It’s really an honor to bathe with a public
intellectual of your… stature.
[beeps and boops]
You know, I never like to argue in the bath,
so I want to start by telling you the
things I like about you.
The first thing is that I think some of your
criticisms of the Left—the stifling of even
slightly different opinions, the gratuitous
loathing of Western cultural monuments, the
politics of resentment—are, within a certain
mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.
I even made a video about that a long time
ago when I was a different person, oh god
the dysphoria, please don’t watch it.
But my worry is that you’re leading an international
political backlash against what is a very
localized problem, and I worry that some of
our society’s most vulnerable people could
be hurt by that backlash.
Like fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals
and overly-sensitive student activists, but
if your backlash also targets gender equality,
LGBT acceptance, and civil rights, that would
be bad right?
[beeps and boops]
I also like that you tell people how to live
their lives.
I mean I personally hate taking orders outside
of the bedroom but clearly the sheep need
a shepherd, and you’ve really stepped up
 with these twelve rules.
You know on the left we don’t really tell
people what to do.
We tell them what not to do.
Don’t exploit the workers, do not do blackface.
I guess we tell people what pronouns to use
for trans people, but that’s a pretty small
rule compared to some of your rules like how
to raise your children or when it’s okay
to criticize things.
[beeps and boops]
The last thing I like is that you talk about
deep shit.
I was watching a video where you and a couple
of zany goons were talking about Plato and
Aristotle and the meaning of life and I thought
huh, on the Left we don’t really talk about
that kind of thing, all we talk about is how
society oppresses people.
And that might not be enough, because people
need to have a positive purpose in life.
I mean personally I don’t give a shit, I’m
pretty happy to sit here watching the same
three seasons of Strangers With Candy until
I die.
But other people like Dostoyevsky, Camus,
other white guys who talk about lobsters,
they have this need to have purpose in the
face of suffering, and like not just complain
about patriarchy.
I guess it’s easier not to complain about
patriarchy when patriarchy isn’t the thing
that’s making you suffer.
But I do think an education that only teaches
people about oppression is inadequate.
We spend four years teaching undergraduates
why capitalism is bad, and then we say, well
you’re educated now, good luck getting a
job under capitalism, bye!
And that really kind of sucks.
But you know I think that’s a point that
could probably be made without comparing transgender
activism to Stalin.
[beeps and boops]
I feel like this has come across a little
more sarcastic than I intended.
See this is why you’ve got to use a firmer
hand with me Peterson.
If you don’t establish dominance I’m just
gonna mouth off.
They use all this compassion language, and
I’m on the side of the oppressed, all of
that posturing.
It does nothing but mask the underlying drive
to power.
And I’ve just been starting to review their
curriculum for children from kindergarten
to grade eight.
It’s pure social justice postmodernism.
The people who hold this doctrine, this radical
postmodern communitarian doctrine that makes
racial identity or sexual identity or gender
identity or some kind of group identity paramount,
they’ve got control of most low to mid-level
bureaucratic structures, and many governments
as well, but even in the United States where—
[Sultry sax music]
[Summer crickets]
So you gotta give it to JP, when he says “stand
up straight with your shoulders back”
he means it.
So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by
drawing in audiences with fairly popular opinions:
political correctness often feels stifling;
student activists are sometimes inarticulate
and overreactive; angry transsexuals are telling
me what words to use and I don’t like it.
But once he draws you in with these inviting
preludes, he leads you to a pretty weird place.
His central political message is that leftist
professors, student activists, campus diversity
initiatives, and corporate HR departments
are collectively following the philosophy
of postmodern neo-Marxism to destroy Western
civilization and sink us all into a totalitarian
nightmare.
Now there’s just no avoiding that this idea
is actually pretty similar to the cultural
Marxism or cultural Bolshevism theory, but
I’m just going to ignore that because if
I dwell on it I’ll sound like I’m saying
Peterson is a fascist and then everyone will
think I’m crazy.
Look I’m not afraid of psychologists…
I have nothing to hide.
So let’s just try not to think about that
and instead just straightforwardly ask, is
it true that postmodern neo-Marxism is out
to destroy us all?
Well, why don’t we analyze the concept of
postmodern neo-Marxism?
We all know what Marxism is, the idea that
society should be understood as a class struggle
between workers and capitalists, and that
the workers will eventually revolt.
Some college professors definitely do believe
that, but 0% of corporate HR departments do,
so... that… okay…
So what is postmodernism?
Well, it’s the vaguest word in the English
language.
Some people try to explain it by listing all
the things that are called postmodern and
then trying to guess what they have in common.
That’s basically what the YouTuber ArmouredSkeptic
did in his video about it.
So many daddies in this video.
We should invite them all to a barbecue, complain
about postmodernism, listen to some Zeppelin.
I’ve had worse evenings.
I don’t really think there is a common thread
linking all the things called postmodern.
Basically postmodernism is everything that
happened after 1945 that seemed new at the time.
But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism
he’s not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin
Tarantino.
He’s talking about postmodern philosophy.
So what’s that?
Well [sigh] basically it’s a kind of skepticism.
Not YouTube skepticism, but actual skepticism,
you know like having doubts about whether
humans can really know things about the world.
Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea,
that goes way back to ancient times (mmm)
but more specifically postmodernism is skepticism
about modernism.
So what’s modernism?
What’s what?
What are words?
What’s anything?
I’m gonna divide modernism into two periods
because I feel like it.
First there’s early modernism.
Early modernism is the philosophy developed
by a bunch of boring 18th century queens which
says that we can form universal theories about
the world through observation and reasoning
AKA the scientific method.
Now that turns out to work pretty well for
whatever questions you have about plants and
crystals and how to medically reconfigure
human genitals but it has some limits, which
was pointed out by David Hume, one of the
least boring 18th century queens and one of
the only philosophers I can actually put up
with in small doses even though he was a fucking
racist and also Scottish.
THIS IS A CALL OUT.
Hume argued that from a strictly empirical
perspective you can’t really know much about
important things like morality, causation,
and the self, because those aren’t the kinds
of things you can observe.
Anyway then the late modernists came along
and they said fuck Hume we’re gonna do science
about those things anyway.
So the late modernists were a bunch of boring
19th century neckbeards who one way or another
tried to discover universal scientific truths
about humans.
So for example you have psychoanalysis which
said human nature can be understood in terms
of unconscious drives, which is of course
ridiculous, I’m conscious of all my drives.
And you got Marxism with its analysis of bourgeoisie
and proletariat, you got early sociology and
anthropology which started out with racist
social evolutionism and progressed to a kind
of we’re-all-the-same universalism.
Jordan Peterson is right at home with the
late modernists.
His first book Maps of Meaning is an attempt
to describe how humans make sense of the world
and create order out of chaos through universal
myths and archetypes, which he claims are
a product of our species’ evolutionary past.
Boy this is a lot of explaining.
It’s so much explaining it’s triggering
my gender dysphoria.
I’d better put on some longer nails.
Nails?
Is that all womanhood means to you?
… mhmm!
Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.
So whereas modernists try to create eternal
and universal theories about reality, history,
and humanity, postmodernists say actually
no, that’s not possible.
For example the French postmodernist
Michel “Faux-coo”
Sargon!
You little goose!
Michel “Faux-coo” wrote intellectual histories
of subjects like psychiatry, medicine, and
criminal justice in which he argued that we
should not understand these histories as straightforward
progressions toward liberty and scientific
truth but rather as mere shifts in the way
that power orders our institutions and populations.
The other postmodernist I’ve actually read
a lot of is Richard Rorty (yeah fuck you Derrida,
if you wanted me to read you, you should have
been easier to read).
Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge
he calls “ironism,” irony being the skeptical
caution with which we should regard our own
beliefs in our awareness that our vocabulary
for describing and understanding the world
is not the final or best vocabulary.
Alright, that’s enough explaining.
And my nails are done, check it out!
Do you enjoy having long glamorous nails,
but do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring
at them with barely concealed visceral rage?
Well I have a solution for you!
The bisexual manicure!
One hand for the V. One hand for the D.
Both for degeneracy!
It’s absolutely filthy!
So we’ve got all the pieces on the table,
now we just need to put the puzzle together.
On the one hand we have Marxism, a fundamentally
modernist worldview that theorizes the human
condition in economic terms.
On the other hand we have postmodernism, a
skeptical worldview that denies our capacity
to know any universal truths about anything.
On the face of it, it would seem these two
ideas are not compatible.
And there is an extensive history of dispute
between them, with for instance the Marxist
Sartre calling Foucault “the last barricade
the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.”
And of course as we all know, when Foucault
died capitalism did end forever.
[Internationale]
So where does Peterson get off talking about
“postmodern neo-Marxism.”
Well, it’s true that a lot of postmodernists
were in some way influenced by Marxism, so
the phrase could just refer to that continuity.
But that’s not what Peterson means.
It’s clear from the way he uses the term
that the concept is even more jumbled and
nonsensical than it initially appears.
Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism
to include not only postmodern intellectuals
and Marxist intellectuals, but also liberal
politicians, academic administrators and corporate
HR departments that care about diversity,
and so-called identity politics activists,
including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights
activists.
Basically it’s the entirety of the modern
left.
Now I’ve already mentioned how Marxism and
postmodernism are fundamentally at odds, since
Marxism is a big story about a struggle between
two clear and distinct groups, and postmodernism
is skepticism about big stories like this
and about the stability of binaries like bourgeoisie
and proletariat.
But that’s not the only tension in Peterson’s
clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism.
Anyone with any experience in leftist circles
knows that Marxists and identity politics
activists are constantly at each others’
throats, because the Marxists accuse the activists
of being bourgeois dogs who want more female
CEOs of color and more disabled transgender
drone pilots, while the activists accuse the
Marxists of being a boys club of brocialists
no more woke on gender and race issues than
the average Jordan Peterson fan.
Most often these accusations are correct because
everyone is problematic and I disown them
all.
And then there’s also the conflict between
the identity politics activists and the postmodernists.
Why does everyone think that identity politics
is postmodern?
There’s nothing postmodern about it.
Identity politics advocates for rights, equality,
and justice for particular groups, such as
women, people of color, and gay and trans
people.
This kind of activism presupposes that these
group categories exist and are a useful basis
for political organizing.
Postmodernists do kind of the opposite; they
want to show that these categories—race,
gender, sexual orientation—are contingent
social constructs and are themselves potentially
oppressive.
This is why conventional feminist activists
often hate postmodern feminism.
Because the postmodern feminists want to show
that the whole concept of womanhood, for instance,
is contingent and potentially oppressive,
and they think we should be working to destabilize
and undermine it.
And then the conventional feminist activists
say the fuck?
We need the concept of womanhood to organize
around women’s political interests.
How are we supposed to do that if we destabilize
and undermine the concept of womanhood?
And in turn, the postmodern feminists say—well,
here’s a quotation from Judith Butler, the
most famous postmodern feminist ever:
“Is it not a sign of despair over public
politics when identity becomes its own policy,
bringing with it those who would ‘police’
it from various sides?
And this is not a call to return to silence
or invisibility, but, rather, to make use
of a category that can be called into question,
made to account for what it excludes.”
If you take the first part of this quote out
of context, it almost sounds like something
Jordan Peterson could have said.
The difference is that JP actually does think
we should return to silence and invisibility—or
does he?
It’s hard to tell what he thinks.
More on that in a moment.
I bring all of this up to show that 1, the
idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics
as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical,
and 2, identity politics is not this dogma
that must go unquestioned.
There are sophisticated debates about this
going on within leftist academia but Jordan
Peterson either doesn’t know that or doesn’t
care.
He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to
characterize the left as a unified philosophical
force bent on destroying Western civilization,
when in fact it’s a bunch of bumbling buffoons
who can’t stop squabbling with each over
every goddamn little issue.
The only reason I can think of that the Left
would appear to be a unified philosophical
force is if you’re so far to the right that
literally everyone who supports the economic
and social advancement of disadvantaged groups
looks like one homogeneous enemy.
But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying,
that he opposes all social progress for women,
racial and sexual minorities?
Well, it’s difficult to say, because while
he spends much of his time comparing activists
for these movements to 20th-century mass murderers,
he resists being pinned down to any more specific
position.
I was maybe too harsh on Cathy Newman earlier.
She came out of that interview looking bad,
but she had a tough job to do.
Peterson’s rhetorical strategy involves
saying something that’s more or less uncontroversially
true, while at the same time implying something
controversial.
For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a
claim like “there are biological differences
between men and women,” which is obviously
true.
But he’ll say it the context of a conversation about the underrepresentation of women in government,
which implies what exactly?
So how do you respond to this?
Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing
against the obviously true statement, or you
have to guess at what he’s implying, in
response to which he can accuse you of misrepresenting
him, which is exactly what happened with the
Cathy Newman interview.
The most famous moment where Peterson does
this is the notorious lobster argument.
So he starts by saying:
There’s this idea that hierarchical structures
are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy.
And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist
in hierarchies, and lobsters predate Western
patriarchy by millions of years, so, checkmate
postmodern neo-Marxists.
You’re saying that we should organize our
societies along the lines of the lobsters.
I’m saying that it’s inevitable that there
will be continuity in the way that animals
and human beings organizae their structures.
The problem with that is that no one has ever
said that every hierarchy is the product of
“Western patriarchy.”
This is such a massive strawman that it overshadows
any uncharitable interpretation of Peterson
suggested by Cathy Newman in this interview.
No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.
Even the anarchists, whose whole thing is
abolishing hierarchies, limit themselves to
the abolition of unjust hierarchies.
No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies,
the hierarchies we’re interested in are
those of gender, race and economics
within our own society, to which the
lobster case is a complete non sequitur.
I mean you could use Peterson’s lobster
argument in the same way he uses it to justify
literally any hierarchy or authority, no matter
how unjust.
You could be an 18th century republican arguing
against the monarchy and the monarch could
turn around and say, “Well hierarchies are
inevitable.
God save the lobster queen.”
[God Save the Queen]
Oh dear god.
My lords, ladies, and those that lieth betwixt.
The present rumor of republican rumblings
amongst the rabble has compelled us to summon
you together.
Let us remind you that nature hath so made the
lobster that some individuals be stronger
than the others.
Therefore let not the power of our crustacean
sovereignty be anywise impugned.
And as for parliamentarians, well, let them
vote for cake.
Very good.
Thank you.
I need new roommates.
So I’ve argued that Peterson is invoking
the incoherent concept of “postmodern neo-Marxism”
as the supervillain in a childishly simple
worldview he’s promoting where these evil
leftists are out to destroy “the West.”
Now it’s time to inspect the other side
of this coin.
What exactly is “the West”?
Well there’s an academic usage of the term
“the West” that describes the intellectual
tradition that runs from ancient Athens to
modern day Europe and its colonies.
Now a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct
the whole concept of “the West” and show
how the very idea is racist and exclusionary
and supremacist and justifies imperialism
and all that kind of thing but we don’t
have time for that right now.
So I’m just going to grant that the West
is thing, and look at how Jordan Peterson
thinks about it.
For Peterson the West seems to be equivalent
to capitalism, individualism, the idea that
each human has a spark of divinity, and he
therefore equates it with “Judeo-Christian
values,” a term more popular with conservative
pundits than intellectuals historians.
Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values
with postmodern neo-Marxism, which he describes
as anti-Western, collectivist, relativist
and totalitarian.
This framing of a conflict of ideas in terms
of geographical chauvinism and external threat
is inaccurate and scaremongering.
Marxism is Western philosophy.
Postmodernism is Western philosophy.
If you’re really concerned about preserving
the geographical boundaries of the intellectual
tradition you should be ranting against the
influence of Buddhism.
Likewise there is no feature of “SJW ideology”
that is meaningfully non-Western.
The very idea of people requesting different
pronouns to suit their individual needs is
exactly the kind of thing a person who values
individual liberty over collective dogma should
be on board with.
You could even argue that Marxism is an extension
of Enlightenment philosophy, with its concern
for human progress, science, and liberty.
I think a lot people like listening to Jordan
Peterson talk about the Western tradition,
but they don’t seem to like reading any
of it themselves.
If you did read it you’d find a surprising
diversity of thought, that doesn’t reduce
to “Judeo-Christian” values.
Much of Plato’s political dialogues are
concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,
suggesting that, far from being an invention
of postmodernity, it was actually a pretty
popular worldview among ancient Athenian pederasts.
Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher David
Hume famously said that "Reason is, and ought
only to be the slave of the passions.”
Literally feels over reals.
And meanwhile his contemporary the Marquis
de Sade was advocating the abolition of morality,
filling the churches with scat porn, and ushering
in a reign of untethered sexual perversion
so decadent and depraved I’m not even allowed
to talk about it on YouTube.
This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,
and it’s is just as much a part of “the
West” as Peterson’s soggy Bible-patting
conservatism.
But again, and I really can’t stress this
enough, I don’t care either way.
I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood
lighting and set design.
So… what do you people want from me?

on the far left—
I’ve seen the name come up every now and
again on Twitter.
Totally disagree with everything this person
says but I look at it and I’m like this
seems very reasonable, educated, academic,
and I’m seeing reasons to hope that—
Hello Dave.
[dark ambient music]
I like stuff.
I like this, and I like this, and I like this.
[belch]
I like stuff and I want more stuff.
My child!
Hearken to my voice!
It is I, Socrates.
Oh no.
What do you want?
I haven’t seen you at the symposium of late!
Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and
it was getting me down.
My child, without my guidance you have become
a slave to mere appetite.
Have you forgotten what I’ve taught you
about the true meaning of happiness, the rational
contemplation of truth and justice?
Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don’t
think it’s really my thing.
I’m a dumb dumb and I like shiny things.
Ah, but my child, these are pleasures for
the pigs!
Happiness can only be acquired through the
contemplation of beauty itself, perfectly
exemplified in the supple bodies of young
boys.
Okay, thank you for your feedback, we’ll
take that into consideration.
Ugh, Greeks.
Look, we all have wants, needs, desires.
And we all want happiness.
But happiness—what does that word even mean?
I’m just a dumb dumb who likes shiny things,
and these are questions really better left
to the philosophers, which is why I’m not
going to present my original ideas in this
video.
Instead I will be interpreting one of the
most influential works of anti-capitalist
philosophy ever produced, a series in multiple
volumes that examines deeply the concept of
the fetishism of the commodity.
I am of course talking about “Worth It”,
a series on BuzzFeedVideo about three men
who are younger than me who travel the world
and try different foods that cost different
amounts of money and then say whether it was
worth it.
In each episode they taste a type of food
at three different restaurants at three drastically
different price points to find out which one
is the most worth it.
For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a
$2000 pizza that’s made of gold, and a $1
ice cream to a $1000 ice cream that’s made
of gold, and a $1 bagel to a $1000 bagel that’s
made of gold.
It is a lot of gold.
“What do I do with the gold on my fingers?”
“A ganjapreneur!”
Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem
like insipid YouTube clickfodder.
But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste
for insights that penetrate a little deeper.
We like to take it all in.
[moan]
The Worth It boys—Andrew, Adam, Steven—these
are not mere content creators, mere actors,
dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue.
They’re philosophers, spiritual leaders
even, and what they’ve accomplished on YouTube
quite honestly far surpasses the combined
insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Sartre, Trotsky,
Luxemburg, Gramsci, Lukács, Zarathustra,
and even our dear breadmom, Kropotkin.
I’ve of course read each of these great
thinkers’ complete works many, many times,
but I always come away dissatisfied, and I
find myself yet again returning to the unparalleled
masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.
See, each episode of Worth It poses to the
viewer a fundamental question.
Is it worth it?
We may never know.
Take for instance the case of the $2 regular
pizza vs. the $2000 gold pizza.
Which is the better deal?
I mean how would we even begin to answer such
a perplexing riddle?
Well, according to Karl Marx the value of
a commodity must be understood in two ways.
On the one hand there’s the use value, the
commodity’s capacity to satisfy some human
need.
And on the other hand there’s the exchange
value, the quantity determining the ratio
by which a commodity is exchangeable with
every other commodity, deriving from objectified
labor over time, and expressed in terms of
price.
But let’s not oversimplify things.
Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting
us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand
the use value/exchange value dichotomy not
as mere hierarchical binary but as a sort
of Deleuzean rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity
with as many sinuous interconnections as the
truffles on the pizza itself.
Am I making myself clear?
I’m not.
It’s almost as if the philosophers are simply
burdening me with jargon and not actually
helping think through this any better.
So, let’s throw philosophy in the trash
and start over from the beginning.
Fuck this!
I like stuff.
And I like shiny things.
Now that’s something everyone can understand,
so let’s take that as the first axiom of
the economic theory I will be developing in
this video.
So given that I like stuff and I like shiny
things, let’s return to the question, is
a $2000 pizza worth it?
Well, it is covered in gold and gold is shiny,
so I do like that.
But the pizza itself seems kind of gross.
It’s got squid-ink dough smeared with foie
gras, Stilton cheese, black truffles, gold
flakes, and caviar.
These flavors are overwhelming, and they don’t
make any sense together, the only thing they
have in common is being really expensive.
It’s like the culinary equivalent of Donald
Trump’s apartment.
But Andrew and Steven sit there, with New York’s
financial district for a backdrop, and they
try to pretend that the pizza doesn’t taste
like golden shit.
“I’m honestly speechless.”
“I feel weird.”
“Is it the gold?”
“I just ate $250”
“I feel kind of like I’m committing a
crime”
“And that’s what $1250 looks like.”
There’s this kind of sadness that sets in
as they realize that the $2000 pizza isn’t
worth it at all, and they start to feel
almost like they’ve done something immoral.
It’s a feeling I’ve had many times myself,
after spending too much money on some gilded
piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the
hollow in my soul.
Is there a name for that feeling?
Well, I like to call it
FUCKING NEOLIBERALISM
In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia,
a bad pizza covered in gold would just be
a bad pizza covered in gold.
You might be mad at the chef for making a
disappointing pizza, but you probably wouldn’t
be overcome with feelings of emptiness and
guilt.
To fully understand why a $2000 pizza is not
worth it, you have to understand it in the
context of capitalism.
The price, $2000, tells you the exchange value
of the pizza, and if you live in America,
you have an instinctive sense for what that
means because you know all the other things
you could buy with $2000.
For a lot of people $2000 would buy a few
months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails.
And there’s a lot of families who sit around
the kitchen table able every evening worrying
about how they’re going to afford golden
nails.
And it’s that awareness that makes the shitty
$2000 pizza seem not just aesthetically disappointing,
but almost obscene, or even immoral.
But of course to call it immoral is actually
to misidentify the real problem.
So it’s not like those shitty YouTube comments
that go “pizzas in Africa could’ve eaten
those children how dare you” because the
problem isn’t that Andrew, Adam, and Steven
are bad people for buying an expensive flatbread
smeared with gilded cream cheese.
The problem is that our economy fundamentally
operates in a way that makes inevitable these
repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.
That’s why I don’t really agree with the
philosopher Peter Singer, who has this idea
that many of the world’s problems could
be solved if privileged American college students
would just become hedge fund managers and
donate most of their income to buying mosquito
nets in the Congo.
I mean, sure, that would probably help with
certain situations, but it’s not gonna change
the fact the global economy is structured
around cheap, exploited labor at the bottom,
and $2000 pizzas at the top.
Another way to approach this issue might be
to ask:
Who are the goddamn reptiles?
Well, they’re certainly not the Jews, I
want to be clear, get everyone on the same
page I’m not blaming the Jews for anything.
Except, you know, cucking the white race.
But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.
The white race has really been getting on
my nerves lately.
So the lizards are not the Jews, they’re
not reptillians from Alpha Draconis, they’re
not freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda.
But the key insight is that they’re not
even really the capitalists.
The lizards are Capital itself.
And what does that mean?
Well, I don’t know.
But it does make me sound like I’ve read
a lot of Marx, doesn’t it?
What I’m trying to say is that the problems
with our economy are not just the product
of greed or some other personal moral defect
of the wealthy.
Of course some capitalists are terrible
people, but some probably aren’t, and either
way the virtues or vices of the rich are sort
of beside the point.
So the real point of the golden pizza is that
it’s emblematic of the fact that the extreme
economic inequalities of our society are laughably
unjustifiable.
If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would
go something like this:
Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic
system, because, although it’s good at creating
large amounts of wealth, it distributes that
wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where
efficiency is understood not as the capacity
to maximize total wealth but as the capacity
to maximize human happiness.
Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.
Here’s a question:
Should the economy serve humanity, or should
humanity serve the economy?
It seems obvious to me that the economy should
serve humanity, so what I look for in a good
economic system is that it produces the most
happiness for the people who are part of it.
So if you’re willing to go along with that
idea, the first thing we should ask is, does
having more wealth make people happier?
And we actually have data about that, at least
within the context of our own economic system,
and the data shows that more income does lead
to more happiness up to a certain point.
But the happiness benefit of income plateaus
somewhere between 65 and 95 thousand dollars
a year.
One interpretation of the reason why happiness
increases up to the threshold is that at lower
income levels, more income means less stress
about paying rent or mortgages or medical
bills or college tuition, but once you pass
the threshold more income basically just translates
into more disappointing golden pizzas.
If that interpretation is correct, then the
current income distribution seems really irrational,
at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.
The income distribution in the United States
is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that
national mean income is around $72,000—right
in the plateau zone—but the national median
income is around $59,000—significantly below
it.
Furthermore, 1% of the population are making
more than $389,000 a year, several times the
peak happiness threshold.
So at least to my naive eyes what it looks
like is that millions of people in this country
don’t have enough money to securely afford
food, housing, education, and healthcare,
while a few million others are like constantly
gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.
But I’m guessing it’s even worse than
that, because it’s not just that some people
don’t have enough money to meet all their
needs—it’s that they have to be poor while
other people are rich.
And since people compare themselves to others,
that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties
and resentments and social tensions.
There’s a study of capuchin monkeys that
shows if you reward one money for a task with
a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent
cage with a shitty cucumber, the monkey who
gets the cucumber loses his shit.
And if you do this to humans for long enough,
they start building guillotines.
But that’s just how it looks to me.
I could be wrong.
I mean, I’m not an economic theorist and
honestly I don’t really understand how the
economy works.
I don’t even check my own bank account balance
very often.
I make the videos,
I swipe the card—
So look, if I’m wrong and capitalism is
good actually, just leave a comment explaining
why and I’ll be happy to be proven wrong.
But before you do that, let’s get some of
the more obvious objections out of the way.
Income inequality exists because not everyone
does the same jobs.
Some people work harder than others, and those
people deserve to make more money.
Well, sweatshop workers work really hard and
they barely make any money at all.
And a lot of people who work for minimum wage
have to work multiple jobs just to sustain
themselves and their families.
It’s actually a ton of work, and they barely
make enough money to survive.
But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.
Why would anyone become an innovator or medical
researcher if they could make a good living
as a janitor?
Well, janitorial work is pretty important
actually.
Someone has to cook and clean, and I think
people who do such necessary work deserve
a decent living.
But I also think a lot of people would find
janitorial work boring, and I think that the
kind of personality that likes to innovate
and invent often isn’t driven mainly by
profit anyway.
Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine,
even though he could have made millions of
dollars from it, because he just cared about
humanity, and he was driven by a purpose beyond
personal profit.
In fact a lot of great historical scientists
were upper class people who didn’t need
to work for a living at all, and were just
driven by their own passion and curiosity.
So let me get this straight—you criticize
capitalism and yet you yourself make money
on the Internet.
Hypocrite much?
A few years ago I was a broke philosophy graduate
student.
And when I criticized capitalism then, people used
to say
Why don’t you stop whining and get a real
job and earn a living?
You just resent capitalism because you’re
too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.
So if people who are failing under capitalism
can’t criticize it because they’re just
resentful, and people who are succeeding under
capitalism can’t criticize it because they’re
hypocrites, then, according to you, is anyone
allowed to criticize capitalism?
Capitalism may have problems, but it’s the
best economic system there is.
You wouldn’t want to live in Soviet Russia
or Maoist China would you?
Well, no.
I wouldn’t.
Hello.
I’m Tatiana Tankikova, I’m here to defend
Stalin.
Fuck off!
Dasvidania, fascist.
So granted, a lot of past communist regimes
were shitty.
But that doesn’t mean that the current system
is the best and final system for all time.
My approach to this topic is not to try
to resurrect Soviet communism or anything
like that, but rather to identify problems
with the current system that seem to cause
unhappiness and instability.
Okay but…
I like stuff.
I like stuff too.
I think a lot of people have this instinctive
fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything
we love.
I mean when I think of communism in particular
I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity, undrinkable
Victory Gin, the end of fashion, all art required
to be propaganda—just an all around nightmare
situation for a person of my persuasion.
And it’s not for no reason at all that I
have these anxieties since there was an aspect
of that to some past communist societies.
But the stuff I’m worried about—booze,
makeup, art, baths—these things existed
long before capitalism and they’ll exist
long after it.
And I know different types of people will
have different things they’re concerned about.
Straight guys will be like WILL THERE BE VIDEO
GAMES AFTER CAPITALISM OH GOD!
And yeah, there will be.
Tetris is a Soviet game, and that’s one
of the best games of the 80s.
[Red Army Choir]
Some of the stuff we like could probably even
be improved if it were liberated from capitalist
pressures.
I mean look what capitalism and the pressure
to turn a profit has done to movies.
Last time I was reading the only book I’ve
ever read, Ways of Seeing by John Berger,
I noticed this description of glamour in the
context of advertising:
“Its promise is not of pleasure, but of
happiness: happiness as judged from the outside
by others.
The happiness of being envied is glamour.”
And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour
is very important to us.
And by us, I mean the gays.
The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those
filthy, filthy Qs.
But isn’t it kind of true that at least
in advertising the function of glamour is
to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy
in the beholder in the service selling you
shit.
But the advertising function I think is an
appropriation of glamour, not something essential
to it.
And maybe glamour would actually be liberated
if it weren’t constantly conflated with
advertising.
So I guess my message to socialists of the
world is that, actually, stuff is good.
Glamour is good.
Video games are good.
Luxury is good.
Baths are good.
I mean, even gold is good, if you don't abuse it horribly.
You know the most offensive thing about the
golden pizza is ultimately that the $2 pizza
is actually better.
The golden pizza is an affront not just to
people who’s medical bills it could have
payed, but it’s an affront to gustatory
pleasure itself.
So I guess my final take here is actually
champagne socialism is good.
But I’m not talking about the champagne
classes becoming socialists.
I’m talking about redistributing the goddamn
champagne.
Alright, now that I’ve gotten these objections
out of the way I’m finally really ready
to get started.
Part 1, what you’ve all been waiting for:
How to End Capitalism Once and For All
Well I don’t know.
Who do you people think I am?
I’m a socially conscious YouTube entertainer,
not transsexual Gandhi.
I mean according to Marxism we can’t just
start the revolution whenever we feel like
it.
Capitalism has to fail, and that will bring
about the conditions that make the revolution
inevitable.
So I guess we just try to relax and wait for
that to happen…
I’m sure it’s bound to happen any day
now….
You know maybe we should do something in the
meantime.
Uh so I dunno, I guess vote Labour, tweet radically,
try to eat more vegetables, uh, try not to
be manipulated into waging war against other
downtrodden people, and can we please not
hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats
our society has on offer.
Noooo.
No voting.
Smashing.
Well, you know what, she’s the one with
the plan apparently, I guess just do whatever
she says.
[“Rebel Girl” by Bikini Kill]
Tabby, why don’t you go take a bath?
[Meow]
Mm.
Good kitty.
Don’t close the door!
Dear comrades, the Central Catgirl Committee
has determined that ContraPoints is and always
has been counterrevolutionary, bourgeois revisionism.
The Department of Information has therefore
replaced the remainder of this video with
a tribute to the immortal science of Tabbyism.
[“L’Internationale” plays]
[“Solid Goldberg” by Zoë Blade]
If you want to have an honest conversation
about race on the Internet here’s what you
do: you set your computer on fire, you flee
to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with
toad venom, and you simply wait for the wolverines
to eat your legs.
Trust me, you’re better off that way, because
if you look for videos on YouTube about race,
well, here’s what you get: you get fascism,
racist pseudoscience, racists debate fascists
tag team title match tonight at 9, or, if
you’re lucky, you get this:
“So perhaps our legal system isn’t going
around willy-nilly convicting innocent black
people of crimes they didn’t
commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to
be black are making bad choices for which
they have to deal with the consequences.”
“Racism isn’t the explanation for everything
bad that happens to black people. If blacks
are getting shot and going to jail more, it’s
their fault for committing crimes”
That’s right, racial inequality in America
exists because black people simply decide
to commit more crimes for no reason.
I guess he’s probably gonna blame the rap
music. Or deadbeat dads with their sagging
pants.
I’d say that this is the most common right-wing
view of race in America.
It’s not outright fascism or race realism,
but simply the “classical liberal” view
that racial inequality is the product not
of injustice but of black people simply deciding
to make bad choices.
Usually this idea gets whipped out as a way
to wave away the indisputable facts of racial
inequality and dismiss those pesky protesters
always complaining about things.
They make me uncomfortable and I don’t like
it.
This is what I’m gonna argue against in
this video. We’re gonna take a break from
talking about fascism.
In the past I’ve focused too much on the
Alt-Right. I think we all have.
I mean don’t get me wrong, it definitely
is a dangerous movement, but it’s just not
the most consequential kind of white supremacy
that exists in America.
In this video I want to talk about the real
root of racial inequality in America, which
is the structural injustice that disadvantages
many people of color.
And from now on I’m gonna try not to get
so distracted by this circus sideshow of Pepes
and racist Odinists and neo-Nazi LARPers.
All that stuff—it’s very last season.
I’m kind of over it—
[Knocks at door]
Oh goddamn it.
Hallo Leute.
Fritz, get the hell out of here, no one cares
about you anymore.
Nein. Ich heiße nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich
jetzt Freya.
What?
Ich bin jetzt eine Frau.
Great. Get out.
Well don‘t you want to hear about my transition?
No. I don‘t care. No one cares. You‘re
still a Nazi, get out.
But I‘m trans! How could I possibly be a
Nazi?
That‘s a good question. It‘s almost as
if you‘re an irrational person and your
worldview makes no sense. Get out.
She calls me a Nazi, and yet she‘s the one
trying to silence my free speech, an excellent
example of how truly fascist the left has
become.
Look if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny
then why aren‘t you willing to discuss them
in the free marketplace of ideas.
Well I‘m going to discuss them in the free
marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out
of my room.
Mom, get out of my life!
Well can we at least talk about the Jewish
question?
No.
It‘s just ideas, what are you afraid of?
I‘m afraid that I‘m going to have to blow
the Tabby whistle if you don‘t get out of
here in ten seconds. Ten, nine...
Aw baby, come on! I thought you liked debate!
You used to whisper to me so sweetly.
[whispering] Well, not anymore.
Well—do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax?
[cat hiss]
Okay, Jesus.
I don‘t like doing this. I prefer to have
conversations about disagreements.
I don‘t enjoy waving a bat around and hissing
like a cat, but it‘s these people, they
just give you no choice.
Where where we?
Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to
people about this issue, they often claim
to have this experience that leftists react
to them in two ways:
One, by saying “You’re racist!” and
two, by saying “It’s not my job to educate
you.”
And I’m sure this isn’t as universal as
people say it is, but it does seem to be an
experience a lot of people have.
And that’s not good, because most people
are pretty ignorant about this, no offense,
and there’s no shortage of fascists, “race
realists,” and “classical liberals,”
who are more than happy to educaaaate people
in their own special way.
So as I see it, the left needs to step it
up.
Now to be fair, if you’re bothering random
people of color on Twitter to demand they
explain racism to you, you’re being kind
of an asshole, and it’s true, it’s not
their job to explain it to you. They have
other shit to do with their lives.
But I, on the other hand, do not have anything
better to do than swerve wildly out of my
lane and whitesplain racism to you for the
next 20 minutes.
Because it kind of is my job. And I have all
the time in the world. It’s a funny thing,
time…
[clock ticking]
Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history?
Do we have to take responsibility for things
that happened a long time ago?
I don’t even take responsibility for things
I did before... July.
This person, who the fuck is that?
No, I don’t have any white guilt. That’s
not what this is about.
That’s just more white narcissism is what
that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears.
Here, I’ll pick you out a cotton ball…
[Alarm clock ringing]
1 Freddie Gray
On April 12, 2015, three police officers near
a housing project in West Baltimore arrested
a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray
because he was carrying a spring-assisted
knife that maybe was illegal?
They handcuffed him and loaded him into a
police van.
“His leg broke and y’all dragging him
like that!”
When the van arrived at the police station,
Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed
at the neck.
A week later, Gray died of his spinal injury,
while the Baltimore Police released contradictory
and inadequate information about his arrest.
This led to widespread protests all over the
city, eventually culminating in the notorious
Baltimore riots.
Now you might be thinking,
“What does this have to do with racism?
If black people don’t want to be killed
then they shouldn’t commit crimes and run
away from the police.”
Well, the first problem with that is that
extrajudicial executions for non-violent crimes
shouldn’t really be a common thing in a
civilized democracy, and it’s a little alarming
to me how quick you are to defend this.
And the other problem is that that’s a very
superficial analysis that refuses to examine
the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods
tend to have more poverty, more crime, and
are subject to more aggressive policing.
So let’s delve a little deeper, starting
with Freddie Gray as a case study.
Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug
offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators
brought this out as evidence that he was nooo
aaangel.
The implication I guess was that Gray simply
got what was coming to him, that he deserved
to die.
But why did he commit all these crimes in
the first place? I don’t think he was selling
drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition.
Did he just do it for no reason? Well, let’s
see.
Freddie Grey was born in 1989 in the West
Baltimore neighborhood Sandtown-Winchester.
You can see in this picture of him as a child
that he grew up in a dilapidated row house
with peeling lead paint.
Lead was used as a cheap additive in house
paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because
it causes serious cognitive damage in children,
leading to deficits in attention and increased
aggression, which may explain why children
poisoned with lead are seven times more likely
to drop out of school and six times more likely
to end up in the juvenile justice system.
But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven’t
bothered to comply with the Congressional
ban on lead paint, and as a result, 93,000
children with lead poisoning have been added
to Maryland’s lead registry, and in Baltimore
the vast majority of these children are black.
Many of these kids were later awarded structured
settlements as compensation for permanent
brain damage. And Freddie Gray was one of
these kids.
Now you might be thinking,
“Well, reparations were paid out. So, problem
solved, right?”
Well, unfortunately no.
What’s happened is a sub industry has emerged
of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead
poisoning victims—some of whom can’t even
read a contract—and offer to buy out their
structured monthly settlements in exchange
for a lump sum that’s a fraction of the
total worth of the settlement.
And that’s exactly what happened to Freddie
Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding
bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement
for $18,300. They also bought his sisters’
settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000
Gray siblings’ settlement for $54,000.
Now I hope we can all agree that this is objectively
bad.
But to understand how it relates to structural
racism, we have to look at Baltimore’s history
of racial segregation.
Or, you know, we could just keep doing live
streams with Richard Spencer.
Interviews with Nazis, the new YouTube craze!
Goddamn it. I need to relax. I need music.
♪ I bless the rains down in A F R I C A—I
bless the rains!
2 Housing Discrimination
Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore
neighborhoods with children with elevated
lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare
it with this map of Baltimore’s racial demographics,
yellow dots standing for black residents and
blue dots standing for white. Lead, race,
lead, race.
Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between
black and white neighborhoods.
Why in the 21st century is Baltimore still
so segregated?
I thought racism was over.
Well here’s the thing about that.
When your country’s history is four hundred
years of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation
you don’t just get to say
Oops, sorry about that.
It’s all cool now though right?
No. It’s not cool.
And these maps are a pretty good illustration
of one of the major not-cool things. Let’s
look at how this shit happened in the first
place.
I hope I’m not being too controversial if
I propose that a hundred years ago, America
may have been somewhat racist.
In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named
W. Ashbie Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious
white Baltimore neighborhood.
This produced such an uproar among the white
residents that the city passed an ordinance
mandating the segregation of every residential
block.
Basically, the ordinance forbade black people
to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks,
and vice versa, until the supreme court overturned
the ordinance in 1917.
“Well if the supreme court overturned the
Jim Crow laws then what’s the problem? Racism
can’t exist if black people have all the
same rights as white people.”
Well... no.
That’s actually not correct.
In 1934 Congress created the Federal Housing
Administration to promote home ownership in
the midst of the Great Depression, when many
homes were foreclosed.
One of the FHA’s purposes was to establish
a reliable credit system backed by the government,
which would regulate interest rates and insure
the terms of mortgages.
FHA-backed loans played a critical role in
facilitating home ownership throughout the
middle of the 20th century, the period many
white Americans now remember as the golden
age of the American Dream.
But many black Americans were excluded from
home ownership and the benefits it conferred
to white families, particularly the family
financial stability it enabled.
So how was this exclusion possible?
Well, basically the FHA, city governments
and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle
methods to enforce residential segregation
and deny home ownership to black Americans.
For instance:
1 Restrictive covenants
When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore’s
mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,
which cooperated with neighborhood associations
to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods
to sign covenants committing them never to
sell or rent to black residents. These agreements
were enforced through strategic building and
health code citations issued against owners
and by evictions of black renters who violated
the covenant.
2. Redlining
The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to insure
mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were
colored in red on official maps, giving the
practice the name “redlining.”
This effectively denied black citizens access
to government-backed mortgages, which, in
turn, left them vulnerable to—
3. Predatory lending
Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage
of black buyers’ exclusion from FHA-backed
mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design
unfairly priced installment plans with abusive
terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers
to repossess and resell homes after a single
missed payment.
Many black residents had no choice but to
buy into these exploitative contracts, and
they often resorted to subdividing houses
or neglecting repairs in order to make payments,
further contributing to the overcrowding and
decay of black neighborhoods.
4. Blockbusting
Predatory real estate agents often used a
scheme known as “blockbusting,” where
they’d intentionally provoke fear of an
impending minority takeover among residents
of a white neighborhood. They would then exploit
the fear that they created to trick white
homeowners into selling their houses at below-market
prices so they could resell those same houses
at extortionate prices to black families desperate
to escape the ghetto.
The long-term effect of these practices was
that many black families ended up trapped
in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools,
little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty,
and aggressive, discriminatory policing.
And even though most of these segregation
practices have ended, the injustice remains
unredressed.
No reparations have been paid to the black
families who were effectively robbed of home
ownership during this period, predatory lending
having cost black families an estimated $500
million in Chicago alone.
But worst of all is that the segregation and
ghettoization caused by government-backed
discrimination of the last century is still
ongoing.
I’m currently sitting in my gentrifying
white fucking neighborhood like one mile away
from where Freddie Gray was arrested in a
neighborhood that’s like a whole different
country.
Here’s the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore.
Now compare that to the 2013 population by
race map.
If the 1937 map is the product of racism,
and it is, and if the city still follows the
same pattern of segregation today, and it
does, well, it’s almost as if the effects
of racism have not entirely been eradicated.
And it’s not just Baltimore that’s like
this either.
Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago,
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,
Cleveland, L.A.
All these cities are still segregated as shit.
And it’s not like a separate but equal situation
either.
Compare the 2013 population by race map of
Baltimore to this map of Baltimore police
stops between 2010 and 2015 (that’s black
neighborhoods in red, and green dots representing
recorded police stops of black pedestrians),
and finally let’s bring back the map of
childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and
2013.
Now consider this information in combination
with some scientific studies linking lead
exposure and violent crime, and it almost
starts to look like there’s some problems
going on here that might not be solved simply
by telling black teenagers to tighten their
belts and do less crimes.
But I don’t want to overstate the lead-crime
theory either, because that only accounts
for a small fraction of what’s going on
here.
The bigger picture is the lasting economic
deprivation caused by segregation, the historical
exclusion from home ownership, the lost opportunities,
the bad schools, and this country’s ongoing
insistence on treating a problem of injustice
as if it were simply a problem of criminality.
I know I said my interest in this topic isn’t
a matter of white guilt, and it’s not. But,
also, fellow whites… how do we sleep at
night?
[ambient music]
“In this guided meditation you’re going
to relax your body and release your guilt.
You’re not responsible for what your great
grandparents did.”
“As you ease the tension in each muscle
group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra:
‘Black Lives Matter are the real racists’”
3 Mass Incarceration
Since the 1970s the United States incarceration
rate has rapidly risen to the point where
nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or
prison.
We now have the highest incarceration rate
in the world, accounting for 22 percent of
the world’s prisoners though we make up
only 4.4 percent of the world’s population.
More than a third of the total incarcerated
population is black, and the black incarceration
rate is almost six times that of whites.
Now without even bringing race into it, it’s
clear that America has a prison problem in
general.
Sentences are too long, there are too many
non-violent drug offenders in prison, too
many defendants are pressured into plea bargains,
and a private prison industry incentivizes
high rates of incarceration.
But disproportionately, people of color are
victimized by this system.
Now a lot of people are going to look at the
incarceration data and say:
“If the blacks don’t like going to jail
they should just do less crimes. Let’s do
another interview with Richard Spencer.”
You know what, why don’t we all interview
Richard Spencer.
Every single YouTuber.
Free speech mandates that we all constantly
broadcast fascist propaganda.
Let’s get em all in here, every single Nazi
in one giant live stream and then we can finally
give the Jewish question the platform it deserves.
Goddamn it.
Where’s my toad venom?
Look, it’s just not always the case that
black people are imprisoned more because they
commit more crimes.
For instance, black and white people use weed
at about the same rate, but black people are
nearly four times as likely to be arrested
for it.
And we’re talking about a drug that, at
this point, white America has basically decided
shouldn’t really even be illegal anyway.
So we’ve now got a ten-billion dollar legal
marijuana industry.
And just look what white people are doing
to weed.
Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed—a ganja-preneur!
It’s a strong, strong sativa, very high
in limonene. It’s a great bronchodilator
so I like to use it when I work out.
Yeah so, uh, in fact in the back of a limousine
is only, one of the only legal places you
can consume cannabis.
The whites are at it again.
They have gentrified the marijuana.
And now we’ve got white business people
making millions of dollars selling the same
drug that black people are still disproportionately
incarcerated for having sold.
A ganja-preneur!
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
This is the most basic kind of unfairness,
and if this doesn’t make you angry then
either you’re really ignorant about this
or you might just not care about black people.
I don’t like to assume the worst of people
but when I look at the state of the conversation
about race in America, I see a lot of people
who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial
executions of black people by the police,
the mass incarceration of people of color,
and the vicious history of discrimination
and its ongoing repercussions.
And from those same people I see a tendency
to get extremely outraged by any black person
who takes a stand or takes a knee or speaks
up about this in any way.
There’s an endless mill of content about
how authoritarian and evil BLM is, and how
it’s identity politics equivalent to white
nationalism, and it’s unpatriotic and postmodern
and racist.
And I’m sorry, but this group of creators
are being really melodramatic.
Black college students complaining too loudly
are not Orwell’s nightmare.
If anything in this country deserves to be
called an authoritarian nightmare, it’s
locking people in cages for decades over drug
offenses.
But right-wing YouTube doesn’t seem very
interested in using their free speech to talk
about that.
They’re too busy complaining about people…
using their free speech to protest? How dare they!
Now I can also anticipate another objection
that doesn’t come from YouTube fascists
or stock salad-eating basic white girl caricatures.
I imagine some black people will probably
watch this video and think
“Where does this white bitch get off telling
me I’m a victim? I take responsibility for
my own life instead of blaming all my problems
on racism.”
And here’s the thing about that.
You’re actually right in the sense that
“taking responsibility” or taking control
of your life to the greatest extent possible
is actually a good way to live your life as
an individual.
So by all means, don’t allow yourself to
be defined by victimhood. Do take control
of your destiny as much as possible.
So I’m not saying anyone should blame all
their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhoom.
Please don’t do that. Go succeed as much
as possible.
But also, while you’re succeeding, don’t
deny that oppressive circumstances exist.
Yes, it’s possible for individuals to escape
oppressive circumstances, but we also have
a collective duty to work to eliminate the
unjust conditions that create those circumstances
in the first place.
Wow I feel I just gave a great speech.
Would you take my speech less seriously if
you knew I’ve been drinking Bud Lite lime
this entire time?
Look, I even put a lime in it.
Bud Lite Lime with lime!
The official beverage of people who complain
about people who complain too much about people
who complain too much about racism!
4 The Final… Countdown
I want to say two more things before I flee
into the forest.
First, there are actually more racial groups
in America than just black people and white
people, I’ve just narrowed the topic of
discussion so this video isn’t three hours long.
But there are lots of other kinds of racism
in this country, and someone should make videos
about those too.
Second, please don’t get all of your information
from YouTube.
I’ve put some links in the description with
my sources and some further reading on the topic.
Also, don’t get all your information about
race and racism from white people, like come
on that should just be common sense.
So when this video ends what you should do
is scroll down, smash that unsubscribe button,
unclick that little bell so you no longer
receive notifications about my videos, and
then you should go subscribe to a bunch of
people of color, and listen to what they have
to say.
Um, so I guess that’s it.
I was just kidding about the forest.
I don’t fuck with forests. I’m really
more of an indoor tranny.
So I guess I’ll just go sing a song about
fighting racists.
♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming
of the Lord
♪ He is trampling out the vintage where
the grapes of wrath are stored
♪ He hath loosed the fateful lightning of
his terrible swift sword
♪ His truth is marching on
♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah
♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah
♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah
♪ His truth is marching on
♪ In the beauty of the lilies Christ was
born across the sea
♪ With a glory in his bosom that transfigures
you and me
♪ As he died to make men holy let us die
to make men free
♪ While God is marching on
♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah
♪ Glory, glory Hallelujah
♪ His truth is marching on.
Death to capitalism end patriarchy smash the binary hail Satan!
When you look into the pools of the 9/11 memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask yourself questions.
Why is the world bad? What did all these people die for?
Well, for freedom, I guess.
And, like,
American values?
But what are those values? What kind of freedom is it that we have?
The 9/11 memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.
There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want
But they're too expensive and my feet are too big
and I'm too tall to wear high heels anyway ugh
fucking neoliberalism
What even goes on in these big buildings?
I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.
Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather?
Drinking human blood?
Licking whipped cream off the interns?
What the hell even is this country?
Just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place:
Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral,
Staples, the Red Lobster, Petsmart, Chipotle, Fridays, Dave & Buster's...
I guess it's not so bad, as long as you kick things up a notch...
Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order, Domino's, of course I want the fucking lava cakes.
(What's wrong with capitalism)
I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza, put it all in me, fill me up
Oh, god damn it, it was so good,
but I ate so much, I think I'm gonna die
Look what capitalism made me do ~
...vast parts of territory all across the Middle East, they put--
Political dissent begins with the vaguest feeling that something is wrong
and a lot of people have that feeling
but the problem with vague feelings is they can be channeled in any direction.
The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between.
There's a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to
and that sense is perhaps the most acute among middle class white men,
who apparently were promised that they could be millionaires or movie gods or rock stars.
The term "special snowflake" is used today as a slur against queer teenagers
but it comes from the movie Fight Club where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become
Adults only to find that they're worse off than their fathers, that they don't have glamorous jobs,
they don't have girlfriends, and, more recently, that even in the escapist world of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged.
I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation:
anti-feminism, alpha males, pickup artists, the surreal surge and support for a white ethnic homeland.
But till now, I haven't talked about the underlying causes
and it's important to do that because, the thing is,
the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing them in some way.
It's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.
So the masculinist alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside-down.
Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soy boy cucks.
Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid IKEA consumers,
capitalism did.
So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists and trans people
and unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy:
the blood sucking
goddamn reptiles
Chapter 1
Capitalism and Spirit--oh god
I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me
Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that "a nation based on
freedom is just another place to go shopping"
A leftist could easily have said that. We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic
but there's a spiritual dimension to it too.
Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul under
capitalism: with the alienation of working not for yourself, but for an employer who
appropriates the value of your work; with the fetishism of commodities:
the investment of inanimate objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness;
with the system of lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself:
with fucking Comcast increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason
No, I don't want a landline. No one under the age of 60 wants a landli--
Of course, it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise.
Fascists and conservatives notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meaning and ancient customs,
racial chauvinism, or fight clubs
and that shit's not really my scene
I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person
but, I think that capitalism as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness, and here's why:
Chapter two
Alienated labor
Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks. Let's come up with something new
Chapter two
shitty jobs
Why is your job so shitty?
Well, probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center
and you spend your day dealing with whiny and titled white bitches who don't understand that you're just a lackey without any actual power
and the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout at each other.
You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company
so you don't really have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine
in which you are a gear.
The CEO makes 36 million dollars a year while you make $14 an hour,
which means that a lot of the value of the work
you're doing doesn't get paid to you,
but goes straight up the chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.
The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing
against your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off
and if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another shitty job
as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee-shop Macbook person.
This means it's difficult to even experience companionship
with the other people in your shitty situation,
because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.
And it gets even worse
You could be employed by New Age reptiles, who force you to participate in team-building exercises,
company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have a shitty oppressive job,
but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating your life.
You have to constantly pretend that you're having "fun",
all for the sake of maintaining the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.
These lizards are smart
and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.
If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.
They'll call you an "independent contractor".
You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.
You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the cleaning,
take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits, paid leave, or pension.
So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?
No, PLEASE don't transfer me to the billing department. They already transferred me here--
Chapter 3
Advertising
Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?
What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey--
If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth
assailed from all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals and cigarettes and
sugar snacks, and now you can't get no satisfaction.
Jesus! People have been complaining about advertising so long,
it's come to seem like a basic feature of the human condition.
But it's not a basic feature of the human condition.
It's a situation particular to life under capitalism.
I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole,
but at least the train station isn't cluttered up with advertisements for--
Oh.
So many fan--
Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed. A neoliberal tankie
The purpose of advertising is to manufacture
desires, which brands across the world spend nearly five hundred billion dollars a year doing.
The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising
seems to contradict one of the fundamental assumptions of capitalist society;
namely, there were all autonomous individuals making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.
Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational. For instance,
randomly correlating the product with sexual desire
generating new insecurities the product promises to alleviate
associating the product with social status
associating the product with random famous people
associating the product with degenerate decadence
associating the product with progressive social movements
associating the product with communist revolution
gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinean philosophy professor
join the clone army
completely original lighting
gay orgies
love cannot survive without diamonds
Is this rational? Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests?
Of course not. The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have,
it's to endlessly create new needs.
And that's a lot to keep up with and it takes a lot of stamina, which is why it's a good thing
I discovered Vitalimax Plus!
Every evening, before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories
for a sustainable blast of power!
With all-natural ginseng and opium extracts,
Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria and indifference to pain that I need
to - get - it - in
I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly,
maybe hit a couple almonds, then I take my Vitalimax Plus, and I'm ready to
rip - it - open
Vitalimax, for bottoms!
Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires
which they implant in your brain through advertising.
Then, they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented,
irrespective of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way.
So what we have is a society built
not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human happiness,
but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles
who tell you what to want and then sell it to you.
and this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances,
but it's especially egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met.
On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt,
spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape,
more than half a million homeless people and 13 million children who have to go to school hungry.
and on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce
$400 juice-packet-squeezing machines
and $300 luxury ice cubes
and there are apparently Americans who are willing to spend
50 million dollars on Barnett Newman paintings.
I mean, it's a fine painting, It's got a lot of great red on it,
but is it really worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks?
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe.
But shouldn't the economy serve humanity rather than the other way around?
If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,
and outrageous medical costs,
then who gives a shit how many golden doughnuts we can produce
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
Canto 4
Message to the Rich
Alright you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up.
I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics.
I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early
and you can assign as much or as little significance to that as you choose.
But what I'm picking up at the moment is that people are getting fuckin' mad
and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.
and you don't just have to trust my intuitions here.
Recent polling data shows that a majority of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism
and almost a third support socialism.
This is not the 80s anymore,
you can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of the country is
underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford health care.
What you're doing has been tried before
and it doesn't end well
You can't just stroll around town dressed like this
and live in houses like this when there are millions of peasants who don't have enough to eat.
They will eventually try to cut your heads off,
and judging by the mood
I'm picking up on social media right now, if you don't fix some shit and make life better for the masses,
they are gonna cut your fucking heads off.,
I mean they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to deploy militarized police
and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole thing.
bad for profits, and just all-around a real inconvenience for you.
Nosey humanitarians will butt their heads in
and they're gonna make things awkward.
The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going; something is gonna have to change.
We can do this the easy way or the hard way: the choice is up to you.
L1: Well, are you going to answer the phone?
L2: There is no phone.
There is only the side of the oppressed creature,
the heart of a heartless world,
the soul of a soulless condition.
It's best to just try and ignore it.
Episode 5
Message to the Youth
Alright kids, so you're angry.
Well, good! The world sucks!
There's a lot to be angry about. What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger.
I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it, so what do we do?
Smash?
Tabby, get in here! Sit down!
Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you. Harsh words have been exchanged.
But I need young radicals like you in my life.
The minute I stop listening to people like you
is the minute I become irrelevant, so I apologize.
I never meant to hurt you.
Baby, I'm sorry!
I mean, look, I get it.
Smashing is fun, but we also need to have a real plan, that's all I'm saying. So what's the plan?
Revolution.
Okay, yeah! Revolution! I mean, you're right! Donald Trump is president. Fuck it!
Revolution!
We've gotta get better people in office.
We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?
No, revolution.
Ye- yes, I know revolution, but what kind of revolution?
Like Project Mayhem? Gather your muskets ye militiamen and water the tree of liberty, what?
No, I mean direct action.
Okay, so like a general strike?
No, end capitalism.
Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don't, but I think we should
at least try to come up with something a little more substantive than just saying the word "revolution".
Like, I'm in support of radical movements:
Occupy Wall Street,
1960's uprisings.
I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy.
They shift the Overton Window to the left, and they can have a big cultural impact.
But none of them so far has ended capitalism and capitalism needs the state to maintain its power
And we can change the state through electoral politics
So why not direct some serious energy toward that?
Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China
But no elected politician has ever even come close to ending capitalism in the U.S.,
So why do YOU think that will work?
What's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same
corrupt-finance backed system that every politician
eventually has to swear allegiance to?
Well, you're not entirely wrong, but on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet Communism
were not exactly super great.
and in any case, I'm having a little bit of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army
marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.
Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion
and getting affordable health care
and education and ending mass incarceration
and other achievable goals?
What if the 2020 election is postponed?
Well, then I WILL transition into you and become you unironically.
Why not just be honest about your political stance?
Are you a Democratic Socialist?
Or would you actually support a revolution?
Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.
Now, for you, Contrapoints,
I mean, you're still a heretic and an enemy of the Imperium
and you are a daemonette of Slaanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.
But what exactly are your positions?
Um... Well...
Kill everyone now, condone first degree murder
Advocate cannibalism, eat shit
Filth are my politics?
Eat reptiles?
Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?
Oh because Marxist analysis is boring and it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles
But you sound like a conspiracy theorist.
Aren't you discrediting yourself by using David Icke's vocabulary?
Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books
Can the same be said of Horkheimer?
Have you read Horkheimer?
Yes.
Have you read Kropotkin?
Yes.
Have you read Bakunin?
... No.
You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.
Have you read Plekhanov?
Have you read Goldman?
Have you read Zetkin?
Have you read Gramsci? Have you read Grindelwald? Have you read Slobodan Zarthusian? Have you read Sexus Arcanis?
Have you read Slutsgonarevski?
Tabby! I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards, and I'm telling you right now
I ain't reading any of that shit.
and if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish is a prerequisite for talking to you,
then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.
I think I'm just gonna go, this isn't really working out.
Wait, Tabby--
Before you go, let me say one more thing.
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Woah, baby, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
I know I laughed when you left
But now I only, I only hurt myself
Oh, baby, bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovs
Bring it on home to me
I'll bring you jewelry and money too
Bu that ain't all, that ain't all I'll do for you
Oh baby, bring it to me,
bring your sweet love
Bring it on home to me
I know I'll always be your slave
Until I'm buried, buried in my grave
Tabby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love
Bring it on home to me
Bring it on home, cat girl.
Unsubscribed.
It's fuckin' 2018, man.
