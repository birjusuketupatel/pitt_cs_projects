so with that being said about the
technological component watching cable
news shift right now there's also an
issue that a lot of people are getting
their news from this from them so shows
like this Shapiro bro and all of these
guys that's kind of worrying too at some
level right and I say that I'm talking
about guys that I love but like just
that you know the fact checking is
different here then say it would be on
cable news not that cable news is not a
great job no but you're right I mean
we're part you know we're we're always a
point on a continuum and we're in the
middle of a cycle where the media are
being reinvented completely and you're
right I mean the problem with individual
operators solo guys on YouTube is they
have so much less to lose than a
television network does that the
incentives to get the facts right to be
responsible of course much lower the
problem is you well know better than
anybody is that the the media have so
discredited themselves that it's like
it's so obviously propaganda yeah but
did you ever think it could be that bad
everywhere every day I look at a story
from CNN or political get BuzzFeed and
forget the really bad ones Vox and it's
like everything you guys are doing every
headline the way every Republican has a
picture that they look awful in the
picture Democrats look great and like
every little thing it's like they're
just smashing us with it they just
turned it up to 11 and I've well I mean
I grew up in a media family I mean my
dad was anchor here in LA of ABC and so
I have always lived in this world and I
always thought the media are liberal but
I was totally wrong about that they're
not ideologues actually they're party
people that's what I totally missed yeah
they're loyal to the party they feel
powerless except as part of a group that
is the main distinction between left and
right in this country and so whatever
the Democratic Party's imperatives are
they will act on them if the Democratic
Party invaded Canada tomorrow you would
see I'm serious they'd be like you know
these Canadians they live among us
they're you know what I mean they're a
fifth column like they would actually do
it doesn't matter what the part does
they will defend it
once you understand that then it all
makes sense they feel threatened that's
the truth and you and people like you
are the main threat to them it's not me
actually I'm on a competing medium but
in the same medium they are they know
that their power is ebbing and when you
feel like you're losing control that's
when you try to assert control that's
when the most ludicrous propaganda comes
when you feel like you know oh my gosh
they're not listening to me yeah but the
funny part is I oh and I tweet this all
the time it's like if these guys had
just been like pretty bad yeah I think
it would have been tolerable people
would have because they've been
happening for so long people kind of
wooded and have noticed that maybe they
could have got a little worse and we
would have been ok with it but it's like
they've just completely bottomed out and
well this is one of the the criticisms
of Trump that has a lot of truth in it
when people are like well he's a
destroyer he destroys everything he
touches you know probably an
overstatement but he does you know you
get close you sit and stare at Trump all
day and you're gonna burn out your
retinas okay and that's one of things I
try not to do I don't do a show about
Trump I didn't write a book about Trump
yeah I'm not against Trump I think Trump
is useful in a truth-teller in some ways
but but the people who obsess about
Trump are destroyed and that would
include his opponents maybe especially
his opponents so what would you do to
get some of those people back if they're
if they're out there now the ones that
really are overboard on Trump that I
haven't you know I've been able to reach
some some liberals some good lefties and
liberals so that okay we can put a hand
out for them but for the people that are
really feeling like they're buying all
the nonsense right is Hitler and all of
this really do you have any technique
that give us sure I mean I almost never
argue about Trump I really try not to I
mean the Platonic ideal for me of a show
is never mentioning Trump because I try
to take the long view I mean look other
shows had different roles you know
everybody sees like you know his or her
specific task but I feel like mine is to
try to take the long view not easy in
the middle of this news cycle of course
I get caught up all the time and that
you know the of the day but but
but I really try to think about like
well how would this look ten years from
now like Trump will be gone I'll be gone
we'll all be gone because we actually
die at the end it turns out so but I
want
the culturally 19 10 years but I didn't
say what kind of country do you want
that's the question do you want to live
in a place where the individual has the
right to dissent and I think most people
would say yes I do
yeah is that why the free speech stuff
has become so important to you well I
think you that it wasn't foundational I
mean that's just if they can tell you
what to say they can control what you
think and if they can control you think
you're not fully human and so you're
really you're not fighting for a
political party or an ideology or
fighting for your humanity I believe
that that's what I was taught as a child
by liberals yeah and they were right and
I bought it then by the way and so the
ACLU stood up for Clarence Brandenburg
who was not only a literally a Klansmen
from Ohio but a like a literally a
he was the least appealing person ever
and they staked their entire credibility
on defending this guy why'd they do that
they did it of course to preserve the
absolute right of free speech for the
rest of us and they made the country
better when you abandon that yeah dude
it's over and now you see what comes out
of the ACLU and you're like you're not
you're not defending free speech you're
clearly a progressive group they're
opposing for tonight they issued a
statement saying you know some speeches
is too offensive really because you
defended the right of Nazis to march
through Skokie which everyone forgets
had the highest percentage of Holocaust
survivors of any town like outside
Israel yeah I mean it was the most
offensive thing you could do and they
defended it and they lost a lot of money
doing it like they lost a ton of
donations doing it but they defended the
principle and I noticed you've got an ad
in strawsons book yeah should we talk
right there here so there are people
like her or Dershowitz or these former
ACLU board members who are like totally
bewildered by this not because we care
about the ACLU as an institution who
cares it's some dumb nonprofit but
because the principles are literally
foundational yeah all right so let's
let's jump back for just a second here
so I want to talk about Fox generally
yeah so first off you guys are doing
something right and I don't mean just
you here clearly if you look at the
ratings I just looked at this thing and
it's like the last bottom 20 shows are
all CNN yeah the top ten are basically
all Fox maybe there's one MSNBC
in there beyond just you what do you
think that Fox is just doing right you
know being slightly different I mean I
you know I would argue that the thing I
mean I can only speak for my char I'm
only in charge of an hour of love 24 but
you know that it's actually worth
defending the principles as distinct
from the individuals or the political
figures and over time like you're not
embarrassed to do that it's worth doing
but I think as a business matter and
just sort of a matter of life if you're
the guy who's not entirely with the herd
and you know I can actually no I it's a
little bit different you know you go to
the 19 other stores and you can buy this
one product and I've got a different
product I mean I don't why is that bad
yeah so that just seems obvious thing is
how offensive that is yeah it's like fog
and I've worked I've worked at CNN I've
worked at MSNBC I worked at PBS I worked
at Esquire I mean I've worked at like a
million different liberal publications
and television channels and they're all
selling exactly the same product and
then there's Fox in the mainstream
landscape that's different just one
channel is different and the the feeling
overwhelming feeling is that should not
be allowed like I can't believe that
they're allowed to say what they're
saying we need to shut them down
well that's the irony it's like you guys
are the only ones that will put me on I
will gladly go on see you can't get on
those channels I've never been asked I
can't just show up there and bang on the
door but you guys call me and nobody
every time I've done your show it's live
I never know what you're gonna have
course and and same thing with some of
the other shows and it's like I will go
where I can talk to people exactly I
don't I don't want to be edited and
misrepresented which so I don't know
that I would trust a lot of these others
no okay so that's sort of what it's just
so uninteresting I mean if everybody's
saying repeating the exact same Pyatt
ease diversities or strength or children
or a future whatever the sort of
banality is that you think is profound
if everybody is saying the exact same
thing like that's just boring I like to
have I like to have people on who
surprised me like what you do you know
what I mean like that just because again
I'm more curious I mean I'm a human
being I want to think about things does
it ever drive you crazy to just be in
the in the constraints of what
television is you know like because
we've done segments where it's like you
know we've got
maybe six minutes and I feel like I just
started I mean you're like Ruben I'll
see you next time you know yeah I mean I
was a writer before I went into TV and
one of the reasons that I failed a
couple of times pretty spectacularly in
TV is because I didn't understand the
medium and I didn't respect it I was
like I'm a writer I'm a deep person Here
I am in the shallow medium and what I
didn't understand is that TV is it's
completely it's a completely different
thing yeah and it's got its own
requirements and its own rules and you
need to understand what it's capable of
it's capable of great things it's just
not capable of everything you know what
I mean it's not capable of explaining
concept complex concepts just that's not
what TV is about yeah I was four is it
odd to you that the interview the real
long-form this like just sit down with
another human being that you know CNN
booted Larry King which I think was the
beginning of the end for them so smart I
think that's I really believe it I mean
they saw I've never heard anybody else
say that but I argued that when I worked
there yeah so you so you were because
they were getting rid of me I think he
told me he was here a couple weeks ago
he said I thought it was the number one
rated show still on the network it was
number two at the time and they said no
no we're done 30 years adios right and
they also ended crossfire which had
become a kind of perversion of its
former self but I was in both versions
of it and at one point crossfire was
like a public service you know to sort
of equally manage did something shift
with crossfire because I do remember
watching you on cross well I mean it was
so it became partisan yeah which is
uninteresting yeah nobody wants to hear
what your team thinks we already know
what's interesting is when we throw up
an idea or policy and we deconstruct it
and we have two fairly evenly matched
people you know kind of competing for
you you know like so anyway became
something much more but the idea was
always a good idea and especially the
idea of Larry King I pitched that show
to many different channels black curtain
two people hour-long conversation and my
argument was this will rate people want
this there's none of it and everyone's
like yeah I don't think so we need
interstitials and graphics and it's like
they love interstitials it's
unbelievable and now of course with
YouTube it's like you look at the
numbers that you're getting and others
are getting with that exact format and
they're huge yeah it turns out yeah of
course there's a market for that why
would
there be how much of all of this
everything we're discussing here and and
so much what you're doing a show is just
that people are just tired of having
their intellect insulted totally
completely well look at television
versus movies if you had told me thirty
years ago that the most interesting you
know visual art being created would be
in television scripted television like
what no I don't think so
that's the province of right full
house but um but it turned out to be
true that for Bob Saget all right
actually no Bob Saget I like Bob Saget
but he's actually very smart yeah but
the point is that there is especially
when we're all narrowcasting when you
don't need to reach you know eighty
million people when you can reach three
million and that is a more than viable
commercial proposition you can aim at an
audience that wants that and there's a
substantial audience that does yeah okay
so Fox News we get it some things are
clearly going right and by ratings and
everything else is there anything that
Fox is doing that you think is wrong is
it too close to the President or
anything you know I mean I mean I'm
obviously I'm dodging the question even
if I had a real answer I would run from
that question because I work there but
if I'm being completely honest no I'm
not a huge I'm so caught up in our our
and I'm so it's such a hive in my show
and we have like you know I
intentionally hired really smart smarter
than I am people that I don't have a
sense sometimes of the larger
programming I would say as a general
matter I've always tried not to be
aligned with any politician because in
the end no matter how sympathetic I
might be to the message it's a
politician and I'm not if I want it to
be a policymaker I would be one there's
a pretty low bar for that it turns right
exactly so do you ever think about it
not for two seconds yeah I would never
want mean I live in that world so I know
what it is I don't want that I have a
journalist temperament I like to watch I
like the freedom to say what I really
think is true I don't want one thing I
will say about Fox which I'm grateful
for every single day and this is Rupert
they don't they do not control what you
say I've had this show for two years
almost exactly two years now a single
time as someone called it well no one
calls me at all but like no one calls it
as like I can't believe you said there's
nothing like that yeah if pure editorial
freedom so like why is that not a great
job yeah no I mean and I know it again I
just want to illustrate because people
don't understand that every time I have
gone on your show that we you know they
give me a some sense of what we're gonna
talk about yeah and that's it we go
alive its life and if you want to say
something insane like we can't stop you
yeah you know and and I would say the
other thing is the way TV works at least
at our network but I think this is true
when I worked at the others it was also
true the shows have enormous autonomy
they really do I mean there's not a
morning call where it's like here's our
line on this or that or the other it's
like I never talked to any I talked to
my executive producer Justin Wells for
my love and a lot of my other producers
all morning and she's in the car parked
outside I was just doing the show like
here's what I think we should do there's
I mean we can do whatever we want
yeah what's what's your day-to-day like
over there so I know what it's like to
do I do a couple shows a week and I'm
doing long-form and this way but we're
not doing a zillion segments and all and
all the interstitials and all that stuff
what's your sort of day-to-day Tucker
wakes up he's got a show that night
yeah I mean I try and I'm married I've
been married for 27 years I really like
my wife my kids are all gone so I really
try and stay home I mean the key in
daily TV is not to go insane that
actually is like the whole deal right
there if you can keep from becoming an
insecure sort of bag of neuroses do you
mean that just because of the media
criticism and just your constant
worrying about ratings it made the whole
thing with that but just the medium
itself leaves most anchors at some point
feeling totally exposed and alone it's
like I'm out here you know I've got a
staff of 80 people or whatever but in
the end I'm out here live it's just me
I'm taking all the crap and no one's
backing me up I mean every person in the
business feels that way at a certain
point and then you start to feel like
you know no one understands it you know
what I mean and you actually become so
self pitying and self-involved that no
matter how much they pay you you're
deeply unhappy and then you start acting
in erratic ways and like
look at TV and you know exactly who's
going through this right everybody
except me
because I keep my world so small you
know I married my high-school girlfriend
I live walking distance from my dad and
my brother and my college remainin best
friend and that's who I talk to every
day every day and I and the reason I do
that is because I love them but also
because I don't want to feel the way
that most people on TV do I want I want
to talk to people I love and trust and
and I want my security and happiness to
come from those relationships and not
from the affirmation I get on television
because you will become a crazy person
someone once said to me a head of a TV
network once said what do you think my
job is I said I don't know running a TV
network and he goes no it's keeping
millionaires from killing themselves my
job and yet how dark is that that's also
true it's like his job was to keep the
people from going totally bananas
because the medium itself drives you
crazy and you're doing this no booze no
cigarettes anymore no you got any vice
the booze is easy drinking coffee drink
pop oh you know I drink a lot Voltaire
levels of coffee yeah not a quite as
impressive effects but yeah and I quit
smoking four or five years ago and but
I'm you know I wouldn't call it a vice
but I'm not I'm enthusiastic user of
nicotine gum and lozenges because I
think they really have improved my life
like a lot I think I mean I don't want
to you know endorse yeah the product but
I sure what the downside is of using
nicotine there's a huge downside from
smoking of course the tar gives you
cancer and emphysema but I don't think
that we've shown that nicotine for
people who don't have blood pressure
problems and I don't hurts you and I
think there's a lot of evidence that
that's great yeah all right so I want to
spend the remaining time really focusing
on the book we sort of did yeah yeah I
think we did everything I believe we did
everything else but let's really focus
in on the book okay if if we're on the
brink of a revolution
joining me today is a professor of
English at the University of Ottawa an
author a self-declared anti-feminist and
a campaigner for the right to dissent
Janus V mango welcome to the Reuben
report well thank you very much Dave
it's nice to have you here we were
looped in by this Jordan Peterson fella
apparently everyone knows this guy now
so before we do anything else I thought
it would be interesting since he looped
us in together what do you make of the
Jordan Peterson phenomenon well to say
the very least I think what Jordan
proves is that there is an incredible
hunger out there amongst young people
maybe amongst young men in particular
but obviously amongst women as well for
for for something that's really genuine
and hard-hitting and real in terms of
discussing what matters in the world
today something that we aren't getting
in our public conversations at all and
and Jordan obviously offers that and and
all of the attempts to discredit him and
to claim that he represents something
really dark and nefarious it clearly
isn't working and turning people off
yeah it ain't gonna stop though no no it
no it's just ramping up I think yeah
yeah what is going on in Canada that
there seems to be a burst of Canadian
professors from from Jordan to you and
GAD sad sad and plenty of others feel
free to name-drop some others that
should be on my radar there seems to be
a real pushback from Canadian professors
at least a small select group of them
against this sort of groupthink and Pro
faux diversity and whatever you want to
call this whole movement yeah well um
actually I think it's unfortunately
still a relatively small group I would
say I think there needs to be a lot more
in the way of pushback the thing that
really struck me about Jordan Peterson
the situation when he
you know first sort of burst onto the
scene with his declaration that he would
not you know he would not engage in
forced speech that that not a single
professor at the University of Toronto
would come forward even to say I may not
necessarily agree with what he's saying
but I support his right to say it and
that's one of the largest universities
if not the largest university in Canada
and probably the most prestigious one
and the fact that not a single professor
felt that he or she could stand with
Jordan in that moment that was
astounding to me and so yeah there are a
few and GAD sat is a wonderful example I
have a close friend at Acadia University
who was actually just fired this year
Rick Mehta
yeah who was inspired by Jordan he he
was someone who had been thinking for
years a lot of the things that Jordan
has talked about in terms of the
groupthink in academia the whole range
of subjects that you can't even talk
about well that you can't talk about
from a variety of positions that you
have to take one position on and so he
finally started speaking out before this
he was an award-winning teacher and the
year he started speaking out he had so
many complaints and he's now actually
been fired a tenured professor this is
an astounding thing so so unfortunately
I would say that what's happening in
Canada is that a few people are speaking
out and a lot of people are speaking
privately saying you know I really
support what you're talking about and I
really wish I could do it as well but
it's way too dangerous for me to do so
and the case of Professor Mehta at
Acadia proves that indeed people have
reason to be very fearful yeah you know
in the case of professor Mehta it's so
interesting to me that one of the ways I
get guests is that suddenly someone does
something often at a university and then
it starts bubbling and there's some
stories written and then I start hearing
about it on Twitter and then it bubbles
up enough and then they usually end up
right in that seat where you are right
there
I suspect he'll probably be in here -
and in a weird way all of you guys are
just defending the ability to think
about these issues yeah the positions
that most of you are taking often
wouldn't have been considered radical 20
years absolutely not no no they wouldn't
have been it in fact I mean in in
professor metas case it seems to me he's
such an excellent example of the fact
that this is not about even an
individual saying offensive things
because what were the supposed defensive
well I mean like and he didn't take
these as positions you know he he I
think would would identify himself as a
classic liberal he's not particularly
conservative but he he wanted to talk
about the full range of issues he
objected to his universities indigenous
a ssin program which I think maybe was
the most controversial of the subjects
and this is I think this is probably now
the top hot-button issue at Canadian
universities it's the the move to
replace European based knowledge as
exclusionary and inadequate and
subjective and to replace it in some
cases with indigenous knowledge even in
something called indigenous science
which many scientists would say is
actually not I mean there is only
there's science that is all there is and
so indigenous science has to do with
indigenous ways of knowing elders
knowledge what some might say is
superstition or magical beliefs of sort
of anecdotal kinds of observations and
you know there's an attempt on the part
of universities in some ways a lot of a
one to bring in indigenous peoples
who've been excluded from the university
experience for many years for a variety
of reasons but the idea that indigenous
knowledge is not to be questioned that
it has a value equal to supposedly
Europeans
science is a really incredibly worrisome
and strange idea and so he objected to
that and he raised a whole bunch of
other questions not even saying that he
wanted to that he was necessarily taking
a position on them but merely saying
that you know he said that identity
politics is divisive and causes
resentment what I thought can you
believe it yeah never heard that before
yeah he talked about you know the the
the psychological science about
differences in in preference and
interest and intellectual ability
between men and women he what else did
he he talked about the wage gap and and
said that you know that there was a lot
of evidence to suggest that it was based
on preferences and choices that people
made rather than bias against women
they're a whole bunch of I mean he
really was just trying to do what
exactly as you said professors once were
supposed to do and that's now no longer
possible in in the university classroom
and I think a lot of students probably
liked him I mean he got these teaching
awards and he had a lot of support even
up until the point that he was fired but
because I a cadre of very angry students
and also very angry colleagues and it is
often professors who are persecuting
other professors they claimed a
complaint about him and said that he was
you know harassing them so let's put the
student part aside for a second because
we're gonna get to that a little bit but
the the colleague hmm the fact that so
much of this is being driven by other
professors I mean we saw this with Brad
Weinstein in Evergreen State Jordan and
many of my other friends who are
professors now tell me they often get
support privately from professors but
not publicly which is the most enraging
GAD tells me about this all the time but
what do you make of professors that are
that are leading this with the charge
against inquiry and and thought mmm-hmm
well they're true believers I think many
of them and well though some are true
believers they they see themselves as
part of a revolution that's absolutely
necessary they believe that
our society is one of entrenched
inequality and structural violence
against women against racial minorities
against indigenous peoples against trans
people and you know you know that all
the the the claims and and so they they
see that any attempt to argue or against
their positions or to simply call for
more open discussion is a way of
reasserting a very unjust they would say
you know deathly status quo and then a
lot of people I think are not true
believers but are just going along for
career reasons or because it's easier to
go along they just want to do their
research and they can only do it in
peace if they say all the correct
you know platitudes so I mean I'm what
happened was that I think gradually the
idea of the university was destroyed it
whenever it started how it happened and
it seems to have started sometimes in
the late 60s Allan bloom I'm sure you've
read the closing of the American mind
you know he is claimed is that
professors lost faith in the idea of the
University as a sort of separate space
where you you simply thought about
things you didn't get involved and I he
has a wonderful line I remember
something about how Socrates felt that
it was more important to think about
justice and to you know to really learn
what justice is rather than try to
implement whatever partial version of it
you know is roiling the public
consciousness of the day and and so that
was what the university had meant that
it's best I think right so the way this
is a case of where the University
original mission of being a place to
find truth and giving people the
opportunity to think about these issues
debate these issues etc has taken a
complete 180 because now it seems to be
the breeding ground for the opposite of
those ideas it is a breeding ground for
sure I mean it's it's where all of the
indoctrination takes place and then of
course the the students who are
indoctrinated go out into all
major spheres of our society they they
go to law school where they they read
critical legal theory that tells them
that there there is there's nothing
unbiased or objective about the legal
system that we have in North America
that it needs to be completely remade
they become journalists and they go to
journalism school where they learn the
same thing and they're told that a
journalist should be somebody who
attempts to improve and change society
make it better rather than just report
that you know what's what's happening
they become teachers they they go into
the education faculties where they're
also being radicalized and you know and
and so it's not surprising that this is
where we're at now one of the things
that fascinates me about this every time
I hear another professor come in and
talk about it all right to see another
breaking story about it or another
monument taken down or whatever it is
this is nature of history yeah is that
what you said before about the the
indigenous sciences it's like they don't
want you to just say okay maybe we could
have an extra course in this and teach
it hopefully with the same academic
rigor as you would teach European
sciences or what's known as you said as
science we could have a parallel course
if you want to take that as well but
they actually they want to replace
history and that that seems to me to be
the most dangerous part of this yeah
yeah well it and begin it but it's not
surprising if you believe that the
system that we have now is you know
kills people it's always the rhetoric is
really really extreme it's like you know
what you're saying is is violence to me
and my family what you're saying you
know causes people to die so if you
really believe that in some way then you
can't just bring in you can't just have
add-ons of other courses it is that this
is not a rumor in the witches yeah
absolutely it's this and it's not a
reform movement even where you could get
to a point where you would say okay
we've made you know certain structural
changes to satisfy you know these
various concerns it is a radical
revolutionary movement that everything
has to be smashed
and rebuilt and and yeah and and I think
there's a very naive confidence on the
part of many professors that that they
know better than generations and
generations of people who came before
and they will be able to build Jerusalem
I somehow it's somehow doubted all right
but so let's back up a little bit and
get to your involvement in all of this
so a self-declared anti-feminist the
defender of dissent of a big fan of
dissent so just tell me a little bit
about your academic background and what
sort of brought you to believe some of
the things that you believe now yeah
well you know I started off as I think a
pretty well to go back further I started
off as just a you know someone who loved
literature I was a nerd I loved to read
and that was all I you know from the
time I was very young I wanted to be a
university professor I want to teach
literature so then I got into graduate
school and I was radicalized there I
would say like everyone you know and and
and and that experience was really
important to me in that I realized how
incredibly pleasurable it is to be a
radical yeah you know you describe that
a little bit that feeling rock we're
getting slammed with now yeah it's you
know it's it's very addictive and maybe
it is even a kind of addiction I'm sure
that there are all sorts of chemical
changes that go on in your brain when
you're feeling this this it's a
combination of sort of euphoric rage and
self-righteous indignation and and and
and righteous outrage and so yeah I'd
you know I did all the things I marched
and Take Back the Night marches and I
worked at a women's shelter and and
suddenly then I started to see that my
purpose in becoming a university
professor would be to radicalize other
students and to show them what I had
come to understand
and yeah and it's it's a it's a very
heady experience and I've thought for
years and years like then I came off it
because I think partly because of my
background my parents are lower middle
class and my dad died last year but
somehow the that outrage it just didn't
fit with the values that they've given
me and did it I couldn't hold on to the
the conviction how long did it last for
you it lasted while I was a graduate
student really so like from my about in
1991 to 94 or something around there and
then it started to fade off yes you
remember do you remember moments was
there seminal moment there wasn't one
moment I wouldn't say but there there
were just there were a number of moments
where I I just I couldn't hold on to the
sense of conviction I can't think of a
specific moment until like by the time I
started teaching full-time I started
teaching full-time in 1999 and at that
point I would have said that I was I
probably would have said I was still a
feminist but I would have seen myself as
more of a moderate feminist and and and
I wouldn't that wouldn't have been my
primary self-identification I would have
said I was an animal lover you know or
something else like that and then but
9/11 was really my that was my moment
and it was because at the university
that I was teaching out at the time
University of Saskatchewan I'll never
forget that morning I was already at
work the secretary said that you know
planes had flown into the the towers and
I you know I was horrified and and but I
noticed that the mood at the University
and in my department in particular it
was one of like barely contained sort of
vaunting pleasure Wow
I couldn't believe it and or at least I
mean maybe that's you know maybe not
everybody felt that that
could have been just my my sense of it
but certainly a kind of satisfaction and
in fact one of my friends came into the
mailroom and said well they've got what
they deserved
this is like you know within an hour of
the news another said that she was going
to teach about it that day and this was
like really early on in the term so she
hadn't even really started I think this
was like our first week probably yeah
first week or maybe the the first part
of the second week but anyway and she
was gonna teach about the event and she
was going to talk about how how this
would be used by reaction how this would
likely be used by reactionary forces in
the United States and how it'd be very
interesting to watch over the next few
days who they would blame and how they
would begin to manipulate I thought wow
like it hasn't I mean you know it she
never even thought that maybe there
would be students in the class who would
be really upset I might even you don't
know somebody who knew somebody or it
was just the the lack of human empathy
and the the hatred the satisfied hatred
that that was really my moment that
turned me off completely from everything
to do with the the left progressivism
the anti Americanism the anti Western
culture everything then the other thing
that was happening at the same time role
in the year before too was that my
department was doing a fair bit of
hiring and we were doing what we called
equity hiring affirmative action hiring
and we were very very keen to hire more
women and to hire members of visible
minorities and indigenous people and I I
just you know and there was you weren't
allowed to obviously object in any way
and nobody did everyone this that maybe
occasionally privately a bit a bit of
Demuro but but basically everyone was
publicly very enthusiastic and it just
struck me as the most unjust ridiculous
thing I'm basically like no men no white
men were were even considered for any of
the positions that were offered and I I
I couldn't see how that was a good thing
in any way at all and it just it seemed
to me out raging and that all and you
know we would get hundreds of
applications for some of the positions
and all of these men who'd done all
these amazing things being just being
put aside and women who had done far far
less being considered and brought in for
interview and always the idea was that
you know this was equity hiring which
meant that if two candidates were
equally qualified and you know we would
choose the woman but of course as soon
as you're looking to hire right
political reason you're not considering
the true qualities of the candidates at
all so in in a situation like this if we
if you had two candidates that had the
exact same criteria and you had a
department that was say 90% male mm-hmm
in that case what would your position be
on this if they truly I know what you're
saying
never get to that place where it's
exactly what the proposition is yeah no
they aren't there are never two
candidates who are exactly the same and
I honestly could never see a situation
where it would be so urgent that you
would hire on the basis of you know an
identity category III can't believe that
I mean the arguments for changing the
you know the demographic mix of
workplaces or whatever I can see them
applying in in very narrow circumstances
for instance in primary school I would
say yeah it's probably a good idea that
children have a mix of men and women and
as teacher
and and maybe even an ethnic mix if it's
a ethnically mixed school I could see
that as important and for in fact that
doesn't happen because you know most
primary schools are taught almost
entirely by by women so little boys who
all right we are on location at the
blaze studios here in Dallas Texas
and I'm sitting across from mr. blaze
Glenn Beck all right sir how's it going
my man good to see you thank you for
letting us do an on-location shoot I
feel not a problem I know you're here
for about 10 minutes and then you're I
think you're gonna probably be on the
moon and then a stop at the Mars and you
know a little bit about traveling a lot
I do yeah so I'm in-between a thousand
things here great yeah it's it's pretty
cool I want to spend a lot of time
talking about this book here addicted to
outrage but let's just do everything so
right now we're about two and a half
weeks away from this midterm election I
suspect something completely bananas
over the next two and a half weeks I
mean you can already just see between
between the cabin ah stuff that we've
been dealing with the general outrage
and all the things you're writing about
here so here we just said this to a
group friends the other day I think at
this point a spaceship could appear okay
and hover over New York City and to be
like oh I mean I don't know what would
surprise me now it what we be arguing
about the gender pronouns the aliens you
know no I know it's it's absolutely
insane how everything is everything is
upside-down everything is upside down do
you think do you think we're in a unique
time because that's one of the questions
when I'm out there with Peterson people
say okay it's you know everyone says
we've never been more partisan and we're
angrier than ever and all of these
things but just something about this
seem unique yeah I'm a I'm a glutton for
history yes and it we have been in
perilous times before I don't think
we've hit the civil war confrontations
yet but we are approaching it do you
think we really are cuz I do because I'm
actually worried about the amount of
people I you see this on Twitter all the
time people saying oh civil war is
coming you know like yeah like murmur
about what would be the most horrific
possible outcome of all of this so
remind me to talk about the window
because I think we have a window right
but we have been we've been worse
I mean if you look at Jefferson and
Adams you know Adams Adams was called a
hermaphrodite by Jefferson Jefferson
Jefferson his campaign called him a
hermaphrodite
Adams said back that if you elect Thomas
Jefferson there will be blood in the
streets and the heads of our children
and your daughters will be on pikes into
every town so we've had rhetoric like
this before
ironically I'd be thrilled to vote for
either one of I'll take either I don't
care heads on pikes but it all does go
to just in the last couple weeks you
know there was this Hillary Clinton lyin
on CNN talking to Christian Amanpour
about how we can't be civil because
these these people meaning the
Conservatives or Republicans are so
against our values I mean this is
dangerous stuff here's the difference we
have been in these places before but we
knew our founding documents we knew who
we served or who our God was and I don't
know who our God is now I mean is it
money is it Fame is it anger I don't
know what our God is now we knew wait
let me pause you there for a sec so when
you when you say that about what the
founders believed now they were also
saying separation of church and state
the whole time so if you were just
laying out what they believed
when you say who our God was so George
Washington they did believe in the
division of church and state clearly I
do too yeah that just means if you're an
atheist yes we're friends we're cool
let's get along but if you're a god
person you do your god thing you do your
atheist thing right do we have what Adam
Smith called moral sentiment in common
yes capitalism has lost the first volume
of Adam Smith the second volume is
Wealth of Nations the first volume is
Moral Sentiments and that's a
look this is an invisible hand and the
market is powerful and it will create
whatever you want be careful what you
ask for make sure you are always
tempering the moral sentiment make sure
that you're a good decent fair-minded
people we've lost that we're losing it I
should say and I'm concerned and I talk
about this a bit in the book I've seen
this coming for almost two decades and I
have been warning against it and for the
very first time I'm at the place where
I'm on the air now saying this is the
time this is the time that I said would
come yeah and now is the time for you to
remember who you are and our outrage is
taking us away from it so as I've looked
at this for so long I have I have
studied revolutions I have I've studied
giant movements of chaos I I can tell
you about you know the I think it was
the red month in the 1930s like I can
show you what's happened but there were
three people in four people in grand
movements that have gotten it right
there was Abraham Lincoln mm-hmm
there was Martin Luther King there was
Gandhi then there's Bonhoeffer
Bonhoeffer do you know who Dietrich
Bonhoeffer was I don't think so hey
Bonhoeffer lost okay Bonhoeffer was a a
pastor I think Lutheran in Germany he
was on the air when the Fuehrer declared
he was Fuhrer he was taken his broadcast
was cut in short because he was doing a
broadcast called the Fuhrer a principle
this is wrong don't go this way he on
Kristallnacht
the very next morning he was shopping in
those stores those Jewish stores
pacifist he tried to turn the Germans
back and say stop it
stop stop you're going the wrong way he
couldn't do it he eventually escaped
from Germany was in New York not here
very long as he felt guilty how can I
leave my country when it's in this much
trouble he went back he realized there's
no there no he's a stopped this guy
maybe violence is the answer he was
involved in one of the attempts to kill
Hitler he went to a concentration camp
he died he was executed like five days
before Hitler died here's the thing if
you read his writings he's gone - he's
Jesus he's Martin Luther King he's he's
got it and now Terry read him and read
him and read him how why did he fail
silence in the face of evil is evil
itself not to stand is to stand he's got
it love one another don't stop playing
the organ so you can hear that the train
going to Auschwitz okay he failed
because Germans had already gone over
the cliff they had because of World War
one
then the Treaty of Versailles then the
1920s they had already lost their
judeo-christian principles they had lost
their Center remember if it wasn't for
England Gandhi would have failed people
think of Gandhi is starving himself to
get the British to comply no he starved
himself to say to his own people do not
rise up in anger they were this close to
losing and he knew it he was appealing
to the sense of decency and fairness of
the British culture so he knew the
people because of their judeo-christian
worldview would see this oppression and
go that's wrong if we have a window and
it's closing yeah if we give in to our
anger our outrage and we say you know
what I can't take it anymore we will
lose and that window of the
judeo-christian values will close and
then we're done yeah it's so interesting
because one of the themes that keep
coming up as I'm on this tour is people
keep asking me about this how much worse
is it gonna get before there's some sort
of reset and all of these things and
it's like man I don't want two months
from now or four years from now to look
back at right before the 2018 elections
and go boy weren't those the good old
days because we've gone on the train to
hell so do you think there's actually no
way to stop it at this point do you
think that no I think that so here's
here's the scenarios that I'm looking at
right now if I'm working okay
none of these I know the prediction
business always works out so if you're
wargaming yeah let's look at the next
election what happens well the Democrats
probably gonna win the house okay they
win the house you know they're going to
at least subpoena his tax records he's
not gonna give up tax records
that'll be brought to the Supreme Court
remember that marker number one that's
day number one day number two they don't
have any place they can go on
impeachment they have to impeach him
even if they don't have anything right
they've already said it they have to do
they have to do it it'll be the Senate
that will throw it with L throw to the
Senate that's where the trial happens so
impeachment just means or taking you to
court okay so that's day number two day
number three trump has already filed
with the Supreme Court saying I'm not
I'm not testifying I'm not turning over
my tax records I'm not doing this okay
well Cavanaugh has already said he's
already seen that that's a distraction
the president shouldn't have to so day
number three when Trump has brought it
to the Supreme Court then the house says
wait a minute Cavanaugh should recuse
himself we are looking at a year yeah
where the three branches of government
the administration plus the house and
the Senate both of them will be fighting
with each other they'll be fighting with
this branch and they'll be fighting with
the Supreme Court when Cavanaugh doesn't
recuse himself they will file articles
of impeachment for him and there they're
leading all of these ideas already these
ideas are trickling out if this is gonna
happen yeah so now you have the press
the fourth branch already in chaos has
has absolutely no credibility
at all it's deranged and that pushes
which you would call the fifth branch or
the first branch the people into the
streets how do you solve that alright so
before we get to the streets can I give
you the one option that I think maybe
saves us from all that which is that the
Republicans win or at least hold in the
midterms thus finally as long shot as
this is finally the democrats go okay
we've got to drop identity politics
we've got to get away from this
socialist Democrat Democrat socialist
nonsense there's no evidence that they
would ever look in the mirror if
anything they've only doubled down every
time yeah I see that as the only outlet
to where you're going so I think if you
have if they don't win the house if you
win the house god forbid if they win the
house and the Senate then it's chaos but
if you win the if they win the house the
Democrats that scenario is gonna play
out in some form on the other so that
just gets worse and worse or worse I was
talking to a friend of mine just last
night about this and he said you know
just exactly what you said and I
followed it up with what you said show
me the I know there's no evidence I am
Spartacus is all of a sudden going to
say okay I'm not Spartacus yeah you know
I'm the carpenter from you know from
Nazareth no wasn't that the danger all
along and this this is directly linked
to your book I mean I remember before
the election I kept saying and this is
when I still considered myself on the
left and and someone that had basically
only voted Democrat my entire life I
think the one time I voted Republican
was Bloomberg's third term in New York
City after he had flipped like 87 times
over something I'm not even sure if he
was Republican at that point but that I
kept saying before the election if you
keep calling Trump Hitler then no matter
what he does and no matter what reality
is you'll never be able to get yourself
out of that little thing place you've
painted yourself and that's where we are
so you know what's crazy I lived this I
lived this I said I'm the guy who got in
so much trouble saying I think Barack
Obama may be a racist now I immediately
corrected it in that on the spot
that's not quite right I now understand
I explained it in the book I now
understand how to express that I wasn't
up on anti-colonialism I certainly
wasn't up on post-modernism so I'm
hearing all these terms that mean
nothing to me and yet they're always
attacking groups to me and to a lot of
people in the country that's the
definition of racist yeah okay but I
didn't understand the difference the
other part other part out okay it's now
social justice okay well social justice
seems wrong to me that's how I defined
it then that was so divisive when I said
that and I was really at the time
struggling to figure out what is
happening how who is this guy and I got
more and more strident and didn't make a
lot of friends on the left okay yeah it
didn't work it didn't work my base got
stronger my base learned things but my
base also as things went on got more and
more angry as did I why isn't this
working well because you cannot call
people names and expect them to come
over we have I just saw new poll today
that shows I think it's 8% of the
American public 8,000 people interviewed
eight percent of the American public is
the die-hard progressive radical okay
the the never-give-up
conservative traditional conservative is
about twenty nine percent okay they're
both on the edges 27 29 percent
somewhere in that area still on the
edges
the vast majority is now being called
the exhausted class and it's the class
of people and I'm in this guy's it
doesn't have to be this way I don't I'm
tired of this I don't I not everybody is
a racist not everybody is a homophobe
it's the stop it stop it
the Cavanagh jordan peterson got into
trouble and
I tweeted he did tweeted back to him I
think this might be the first time I
disagree but I put I think because well
for people that didn't see it basically
he said that what would probably be best
and he did this in a tweet which is
never the best way to do it idea and
he's already he's already had his make
up on that and released a corrected not
correction a clarification in a blog
forum but basically he said the best
outcome would be the Kavanagh gets
confirmed but then steps down and what
he meant was that wasn't saying the
Kavanagh did do anything or didn't do
anything but if there's any chance for a
little bit of healing where everyone
gets a little egg on their face but also
it gets a little bit of dignity to walk
away with and the country doesn't come
apart it seems that was what he tried to
do right in a tweet and in his blog post
he's acknowledged that trying to do that
in a tweet probably not the best thing
trying to do that in a tweet where the
people who are reading it are generally
all about politics and tearing each
other apart yeah bad idea that's why I
put I think because knowing Jordan the
little that I do yeah he's a deep
philosophical thinker so my my feeling
was and it turns out it was right that
he's looking at that and saying okay in
in a normal world in a good world where
we're all really trying to do the right
thing and if we really were all trying
to do the right thing I agree with him
it would have been the best thing to
have Jordan say or to have Kavanagh say
thank you thank you now let's bring the
country back together nominate somebody
else and let's go through it but the
other side would have gone through
exactly the same thing you would have
rewarded them in the end they got it
because we're talking about the machines
of destruction so reality doesn't play a
role at some point this 70 percent of
America is going to stand up and say
shut up both of you are you shocked how
many people in that 70 percent are just
afraid to do that because when we do
these meet and greets after the the
Petersons event I think the number one
question I get
asked is what can I do I'm afraid to
speak and I cannot I mean I see this you
know from people that I'm sitting this
close to and I see this look in their
eyes of fear and it's like I don't think
I'm that brave I don't know why I'm
doing this I don't I'm just doing it I
can't explain it I but I don't wake up
every morning and I'm like what am I
gonna do today to fight Google and fight
the political powers and I'm just like
I'm just doing what I think is right
that's it that so that goes - I brought
my family 2011 to Auschwitz and I did it
again because I see over the horizon I
think and we stood outside of the gates
and we had a prayer and then I said okay
we are here because we have to look at
the ugliest thing man has done and we
have to decide who we are who were going
to be because if you weren't prepared
and I don't mean prepare for that kind
of stuff I mean really know who you are
you will not stand when the jackbooted
thugs come down the street you have to
know who you are and what you believe so
I had them read a story of the righteous
of the nation they could pick any one
who saved Jews and to really try to get
into their head I lined up in a just a
family kind of conversation with this
sweet woman she just died I think last
week 90 years old she was a Christian
she was 16 years old when she saved the
first Jew her whole family did it it was
remarkable and we we talked about it two
things I learned on that trip one as we
were leaving I said to her look I have a
responsibility that's different than
most because I speak to so many people
and I said I believe that people have
that tree of righteousness in them I
think they have that goodness they want
to do the right thing how do I water it
she told me something so profound it's
so game-changing
she she looked at me so puzzled and she
said you misunderstand the righteous
didn't suddenly become righteous they
just refused to go over the cliff with
the rest of humanity mm-hmm all you have
to do is remember what you've always
believed was true and they just stand
and just go mmm no you guys are crazy
you don't have to be a hero you're not a
hero she was looking at me she wouldn't
let me film her she only let me take one
picture of her she wanted nothing
because she was like I'm not a hero
I just remembered what was right that's
remarkable do you think that the default
position of humanity is to cower that in
that in these moments it seems like it's
a lot easier to cower right I mean even
now like that's the thing when people
say this to me about we're how do I get
braver or whatever it's like we live in
the freest place in the history of the
world need bravery and if you're if
you're afraid now imagine the second
that thing gets turned a little bit how
afraid you're gonna be so it seems like
like fear and I'm sure there's a
psychological component to this that
fear does something in the brain that
maybe bravery or or maybe it really is
about just knowing what you are and what
you're made let me tell you two stories
first fear shuts your brain down okay it
shuts reason down you're in
fight-or-flight and that's a good thing
because you don't want to be going well
I don't know should I hit him a little
harder swinging so fear and anger really
bad and that's why we're addicted
outrage we will swing you got to get
shake that or your won't think it's
biological two stories the other person
we met with in Poland was the chief
rabbi and he said I think it was 7,000
there were 7,000 people that stood and I
was I mean when have you been Auschwitz
no I haven't when you go there's
churches I mean a block away
so I think I the first time we we sat
down I think I asked you this so this
seems like the right segue for it so for
everything that we've talked about here
and and the addiction to outrage and all
that there's gonna be a certain amount
of people that are watching this and
going wait a minute glenn beck was one
of the people that was peddling this
stuff mm-hmm
I as well I I think I know you pretty
well right now and I feel like you are
honest in your beliefs and you've you've
had some maiya culpas about some of the
things you've said even just you got
into something on twitter with my friend
Majnu Oz and you fully he sent you a
clip of something that you did about him
a couple of years back and you fully you
apologized immediately you said I'd love
to talk to you and learn more and all of
those things I just asked him today what
he said was he coming in yeah and I know
and I love you guys in an email right so
is there anything you can add to that
about just sort of how you've changed
like do you remember a moment was there
something about that because maybe there
are people that are going down that road
right now that still want more the
outrage and still or still or you know
as they call it posting on Twitter
and the rest of it if you were trying to
get somebody to turn back no cuz there
were really personal experiences I went
from the you know that that global poll
that comes out around Christmas time you
know most admired man of the world yeah
I was tied with the Pope
just behind Nelson Mandela okay that's
insane that's insane twelve months later
I'm no longer on that list
yeah I'm hated yeah I was saying the
same things on CNN but I was saying on
Fox hey
so that was confusing and it was you
know you can't be hated by half of the
country I mean unless you're just a you
know maniacal you know
egomaniac that is just beyond any kind
of redemption you cannot be hated by
half of the country you know a false
hero for the other half of the country
and not go I'm not that
I don't think I'm that so Who am I what
part of it most people will go well they
spent millions of dollars to destroy my
reputation to take things out of context
and they did but I also did things
because my philosophy at the time was if
I can get enough eyeballs I can get
people to watch which puts me in
lederhosen you know singing a device I
can get people to watch yeah
then I present them with facts and my
opinion of where it's going forget about
everything else they'll hang on to the
facts and someone in the press will go I
hate that so I'm gonna prove him wrong
they never did mm-hmm
they never would look at the facts so
this is always where they just want to
belittle you and change the street
violence and and I and I helped them
okay I added to that so I'm not saying
it's somebody else I am taking my my
responsibility but the biggest thing is
now on the other side I can look and say
wait all of you in the press you said I
was the worst let me go get the
transcripts see what I just said that's
what you said to the 10th power right
here it's they won't work it's wrong and
it won't work but nobody wants to do
that nobody wants to look they everyone
wants to point to the other person
nobody's willing to go said me but you
think that 70% that you mentioned before
maybe is starting to do that a little
bit I mean again I'm trying if I'm
trying to find how to get out of this
okay and and I think that 70% where I'm
meeting that I know it's a select group
because they're coming they're coming to
see me and yours and take 70% yeah take
17 yeah 10 committed 10 percent
committed changes the world 17 is your
tipping point so it doesn't take all of
us Revolution was fought by about 20% of
America okay those were the ones who
said I believe in this
okay we have to we have to understand it
a lot of the book is about
post-modernism and how that works and
what its goals are what does postmodern
even mean what is what's the modern
world it's not about a machine it's
about the scientific process it's about
exploration and empirical data and
testing a and B and living with the
results that's what the modern world is
so when you realize so you would say
postmodern really is anti modern an
asset because it'sit's going against the
ways that we've been able to measure
anything the way we've been able to look
at it only you can when you don't
understand post-modernism and you read
the headline which I did math is racist
you either go these people are out of
there in minds and I can't take it
anymore or you can say how how did they
get there when you ask that question you
start to go and peel the layers down and
you see the core of this idea good or
bad that what came out of the modern era
the Enlightenment was this and they say
this is bad they say this is bad that
really is it yeah and anything that
holds this up must be destroyed
if that's math if that's you doesn't
matter if you understand that it's all
about deconstruction and deconstruction
is all about chaos you must not do
anything to hasten the chaos it you have
to restrain yourself the best way to
fight this isn't about Gandhi oh I want
to be just like Jesus no I want to win
mm-hmm and the best way to win is to
restrain yourself from adding any of the
chaos be clear be stuff spoken be the
person that everybody in the room when
everybody is arguing they kind of look
around the room and there's maybe three
people over there that are just laughing
and having fun and just because you will
be the
that will control the room in the end
everybody else will kill themselves but
the the majority of people will go oh I
hate this and they'll make their way
over to you that's what we have to do we
have to stop fighting on the stupid
stuff the stupid stuff gay wedding cakes
good god man yeah feeling homosexuals
right now today in parts of the country
what do you say we start there what do
you say we talk about something that
really makes a difference really makes a
difference
we'll get to the gay wedding cakes yeah
let's be good people first yeah it's so
interesting how people just don't want
to do the intellectual work and now it's
like we have these we have these phones
we have endless distractions to the
point that perhaps 20 years ago you
might have a moment standing on a corner
waiting for a friend to go to dinner
where you'd have to think but we can
distract ourselves to the point where we
actually never have to think anymore
when was the last time you just stood
somewhere I mean I know you're aware of
all of this stuff but where was let's
have you Glenn Beck just stood somewhere
on the corner waiting for your wife to
meet you and you weren't looking at your
phone or you weren't you know I tried to
do what you did but I can't do it for
months
I'm too many employees that I only have
like five I I I tried to do it once a
week don't make it every time but just
I'm not going to be online do not pick
up your device go out on a date with
your wife and do not carry a device
doesn't have it with you that's
important and it's important Dave
because I learned something with my
alcoholism I was struggling with so many
things when I was younger that I didn't
want to think about I didn't want to
think about I didn't want to think about
the things that I had done in my life
the things that I was oh poor me about I
just don't want to think about it and I
would turn on the radio and I
and up loud and I'd be driving my car
and I never really consciously connected
the two it got to the point where is so
bad that if I didn't have something to
distract I would literally be by myself
and I go just to block out my thoughts
okay that's a problem and I realized
when I was finally no longer I was sober
and not and not just not drinking was
the time that I was driving someplace
and I must've been driving for about an
hour and I hadn't turned anything on and
I realized at one point I'm just driving
and I kind of come to you know kind of
come to thinking you know about what's
in the car what's happening and I'm like
oh wonder it's on the rate oh my gosh
I've been alone with myself and my
thoughts for an hour that's a sign of
mental health yeah we're sick we're sick
so in the in the book in the in the
foreword you very graciously and I'm
humbled that you did it you included me
and a list of names of people that you
that you put in there and you know Ben
had this and I wrote I even wrote to Ben
I wrote an inscription on this page yeah
like two days later he calls me oh my
gosh we were with each other for two
days yeah and he was like hey thanks
very much and then like at midnight one
night I get this text he's a busy guy I
know to those who are willing to step
out in front of the crowd to question
reason and have dangerous conversations
men with whom I'm a strongly would
disagree with at times but we'll all I
will always consider refound errs of
reason and contemporary heroes Ben
Shapiro Dave Rubin Jordan Peterson brett
weinstein sam harris Jonathan Sacks Penn
Jillette Joe Rogan so I thought I don't
want to make this about me so the one
that I thought was most interesting
there actually was sam Harris because I
suspect you guys probably if he
disagrees with Jordan Peterson on
everything pretty much everything policy
existentialism mean
life the whole damn thing you guys
probably disagree on everything plus one
I don't know if we went to know and I
thought well this is what it's all about
this is what it's all about so but would
you have ever I mean 20 years ago if you
were writing a book you wouldn't you we
still would've done that when I often
joked that my library is a library of a
serial killer because I was too broke to
actually go get a formal education so I
would go to Barnes & Noble or the
library and it go who hates each other
this opinion who hates this opinion that
person and I would read them both and I
would look at them and say is there
anything where they intersect because
that I know is true if both these people
are from opposite ends of the spectrum
and they both say this is true I know
that one line in both books is true okay
so start small and build the basis of
truth and what motivated me was a line
from Thomas Jefferson that he wrote to
his nephew Peter Carr Peters parents had
both died when his dad was ill he said
can you please educate my son when he
comes of age so Thomas writes this
unbelievable letter you know in
mathematics you have to do this some
literature you have to do this the last
thing is religion I love it it's changed
my life when it comes to religion above
all things fix reason firmly in her seat
and question with boldness even the very
existence of God for if there be a god
he must surely rather honest questioning
over blindfolded fear we break down on
the word honest hmm honest questioning
you and I like each other and get along
because you haven't asked me a set up
question and I've never asked you a set
up question it's an honest question hang
on just a second yeah but but that right
but that that isn't as good yeah that
keeps you young that keeps you alive
the minute you stir I knew my father was
gonna die my father was the kind of guy
who always had a book in his back pocket
okay self educated man and he's always
exploring and questioning and he was so
granola fruitloop be one with the
universe kind of guy huh and I called
him up we were best friends for a long
time and I'd call him sometimes two
three times a day and we just talked
about books were reading and things and
did you hear this opinion what do you
think of this we talked about the future
the past all of it and I said dad I just
read this fantastic book you have to
read this I'm gonna send it to you and
he said mm-hmm that's okay and I said
what and he said I'm tired I'm tired I
think I've learned enough huh three
years later he was he was gone when you
when you are not we're built to explore
and when you're not exploring let's left
what would you be doing if you weren't
doing this I told my wife when she
married me is one reason I've lucked out
so much my wife hates Fame
she hates wealth she hates red carpet
she hates all of it because she married
me and her family was like you know
marry him he is a loser
he's not going to a match he's not going
to amount to anything when she married
me because I'm the first out of every
generation that we can find going back
I'm the first male that has not become a
baker and so I would probably probably
be a chef in some place or I'm not good
at baking it but I was just gonna say
would you bake me a cake that's the no
I'm not good at baking I'm good my
father said baking Sun is about formulas
cooking is yeah winging it yeah and I'm
not
formulas yeah impatient you're
definitely a winging it kind of guy so
generally speaking do you feel it's
funny the first half of what we've done
here was sort of fire and brimstone sort
of or laying out you know this is this
thing could really go off the rails I
think the last 20 minutes or so it's
been a little more hopeful I'm an
optimistic catastrophist
you do not want me you do not want to be
anywhere near me on the Titanic until we
get to the iceberg
as we're going to the iceberg I'm saying
are you kidding me have you counted the
lifeboat there's not enough light folks
we're headed into cold area if there is
if these people they're gonna be
irresponsible they're not gonna pay
attention to the ice but they're
arrogant they're gonna hit the iceberg
and you're all gonna die okay as soon as
we hit that iceberg I'm there we're
gonna make it we're gonna make it
because I believe that when people are
awake they will awaken to who they truly
are and I think Americans are different
we have this spirit in us of exploration
we're the people who cross the oceans
we're the people that cross the Rockies
I have to tell you if I were alive
during the you know the time when we
were exploring I don't even think I
would have made it past the Missouri but
definitely I would have gotten to Denver
in a way okay guys I am NOT going
anywhere I'm crossing this okay I always
think every time I'm on the what is it
the five that goes by the the Getty
Museum with which is that the 405 yeah
yeah
the 405 we bumped to LA yeah I see the
Getty Museum up there and I think if I
were a pioneer and I made it this far I
would have built my house in this valley
and people would have been on the top of
the hill going you should see what saw
like I am done but generally people are
explorers and they're good and they're
they're hearty and they want to live I
think they do want to live and they want
to live in peace and her
I think that about the Palestinians and
the Israelis when if you could and I've
done it I've done it when you don't have
a camera in somebody's face and nobody
knows you're talking you sit down in a
house of a Palestinian and most likely
average person they're like I don't
really care I mean I just I want to
raise my family I just want to be left
alone I want to be able to eat I will
maybe a little extra money soul wife and
I can go off for a nice weekend that's
people it's when everybody starts
telling them it's then you know that's
keeping you down that's when there's
trouble do you find it weird in a way
that we're thought of as political
beasts because in a certain way we
really haven't talked about politics
here and I find now I'm probably less
interested in politics now today then
I've ever been in my adult life in a
bizarre way you know you mean like I
said I still love it at some level but
like what we're doing here and what I
think the real conversation happening in
the world right now is is not political
there's a class of people that are
trying to make everything political and
keep you confused and controlled looting
the Russians you see the latest the
Russians believe it or not the Russians
one of their one of their campaigns
happened when I don't remember which was
that the last the last Star Wars movie I
think I did see this day they said that
the last Jedi that is Russian BOTS right
but well that's what Rian Johnson I
guess what it was there is evidence that
they were they were politicizing the
movie that they were they were putting
out oh you're not going to like that
robot because that robot it's all about
social justice we're seeing it the movie
did suck and we you know I'm with you
what but what I'm saying is we have
outside influences that are trying to
make everything about politics read the
book defying Hitler the best best
explanation of what happened in Germany
ever written by a guy
at the time as a warning to the West
cone you don't know what you don't know
where we've been you don't know what's
happening here
warning and so he really gives you a
look at what was happening prior to and
you can see you're like oh my gosh
that's the World Trade Center going down
oh my gosh that's this you can see it
we're repeating it and he says right
right around 1933 nothing is not
political there is not one topic that is
political when did this happen to us
it's incredible I mean just you know I
never watch cable news anymore and I
don't even watch sports channels anymore
because it's all political but when I'm
not doing cardio I'll just flip channels
and everything you go to his political
the view is now always political if
you're watching women's you know
basically women's television in the
morning the the ESPN now is political
all the time I mean every channel you
probably turn on the Food Channel and
there's some political situation
happened let me tell you something that
I've never said how loud only person I
think that even knows it in my own
company
oh it's do my executive producer I
couldn't tell you any of the names of
the people that are running for House
and Senate I'm on talk radio I don't I
don't care I pay somebody to look at
that tell me what's the balance of the
house for the audience
it does not affect me one iota except in
the big picture which movement is moving
I just it it's a waste of our time
think of how many man-hours America has
lost in the last 15 years think of what
we could have done with all of this time
forget about the money is that the best
argument for basically sort of classical
liberalism or libertarianism that if we
could just rein this thing in that not
only could you live however you wanted
to live basically if the government was
just pretend protecting your your life
and your property rights your rights
right that not only would that be good
because you could do what you want but
it would actually it won't save you
money and so but yeah you could heal
yeah you'd still have it you'd have it
still on the the local side which would
be great that right you know I you what
I mean is you'd still have people who
tried to take the local area and they'd
be the big boss of the area so you'd
all right we are on location
at the blaze studios here in dallas
texas
and i'm sitting across from mr blaze
glenn beck
aye sir how's it going my man good to
see you thank you for letting us do an
on location shoot i feel
not a problem i know you're here for
about 10 minutes and then you're
i think you're gonna probably be on the
moon and then a stop at the mars
and you know a little bit about
traveling a lot i do
yeah so i'm in between a thousand things
here uh great
yeah it's it's pretty cool uh i wanna
spend a lot of time talking about
this book here addicted to outrage um
but let's just
do everything so right now we're about
two and a half weeks away from this
midterm election
i suspect something completely bananas
over the next two and a half weeks i
mean you can already just see between
between the kavanaugh stuff that we've
been dealing with the general outrage
and all the things you're writing about
here so here we i just said this to a
group of friends the other day
i think at this point a spaceship
could appear okay and and hover over new
york city and
be like huh i mean i don't know what
would surprise me now
well we'd be arguing about the gender
pronouns of the aliens you know i know i
know
it's it's absolutely insane
how everything is everything is upside
down
everything is upside down do you think
do you think we're in a unique time
because that's one of the questions when
i'm out there with peterson often people
say okay it's you know everyone says
we're we've never been more partisan
and we're angrier than ever and all of
these things but does something about
this
seem unique yeah i i'm uh i'm a
glutton for history yes yes and uh it
we have been in perilous times before
i don't think we've hit the civil war uh
confrontations yet
but we are approaching it do you think
we really are because i do
because i'm actually worried about the
amount of people you see this on twitter
all the time people saying oh
civil war is coming you know like
there's like murmur about
what would be the most horrific possible
outcome of all of this
remind me to talk about the window
because i think we have a window right
now
but we have been uh we've been worse
i mean if you look at jefferson and
adams
you know adam's adams was called a
hermaphrodite
by jefferson jefferson jefferson
his campaign
called him a hermaphrodite adams said
back that
if you elect thomas jefferson there will
be
blood in the streets and the heads of
our
children and your daughters will be on
pikes
into every town so we've had rhetoric
like
this before ironically i'd be thrilled
to vote for either one of these guys
if that would be like i'll take either i
don't care heads on pikes that would be
fine but
but it all does go to just in the last
couple weeks you know there was this
hillary clinton line on cnn talking to
christiana christiane amanpour
about how we can't be civil because
these these people meaning the
conservatives or republicans
are so against our values i mean this is
dangerous stuff
here's the difference
we have been in these places before but
we knew our founding documents we
knew who we served or who our god was
and i don't know who our god is now i
mean is it money
is it fame is it anger i don't know what
our god is now
um we knew wait can you let me pause you
there for a sec so when you when you say
that about what the founders believed
now they were also saying separation of
church and state the whole time so
if you were just laying out what they
believed when you say
we knew who our god was um so
george washington they did believe in
the division of
church and state clearly i do too
yeah um that just means if you're an
atheist
you're an atheist we're friends we're
cool let's get along
but if you're a god person you do your
god thing you do your atheist thing
right
do we have what adam smith called moral
sentiment
in common yes capitalism
uh has lost the first volume of adam
smith
the second volume is wealth of nations
the first volume is moral sentiments
and that says look this is an invisible
hand
and the market is powerful and it will
create whatever you want
be careful what you ask for
make sure you are always tempering the
moral sentiment make sure that you're
good decent fair-minded people
we've lost that we're losing it i should
say
and i'm concerned and i
talk about this a bit in the book
i've seen this coming for almost two
decades
and i have been warning against it and
for the very first time i'm at the place
where i'm on the air now saying
this is the time this is the time that i
said would come
yeah and now is the time for you to
remember
who you are um and our outrage is
taking us away from it so as i've looked
at this
for so long i have i have
studied revolutions i have i've studied
giant
movements of chaos i i can tell you
about you know
uh the um i think it was the red
month uh in the 1930s like i can
show you what's happened but there are
three people
in four people in grand movements that
have
gotten it right there was abraham
lincoln
there was martin luther king there was
gandhi
then there's bonhoeffer bonhoeffer do
you know who dietrich bonhoeffer was i
don't think so okay
bonhoeffer lost okay bonhoeffer was
a um a
pastor i think lutheran in germany
he uh was on the air when the fuhrer
declared he was
fewer he was taken his broadcast was cut
and short because he was doing a
broadcast called the fuhrer principle
this is wrong don't go this way
he on kristallnacht the very next
morning he was shopping in those stores
those jewish
stores pacifist
he tried to turn the germans back and
say
stop it stop stop you're going the wrong
way
he couldn't do it he eventually escaped
from
germany was in new york not here very
long because he felt
guilty how can i leave my country when
it's in this much trouble
he went back he realized there's no
there's no reason to stop this guy
maybe violence is the answer he was
involved in
um one of the attempts to kill um hitler
he went to a concentration camp he died
he was executed like five days before
hitler died
here's the thing if you read his
writings
he's gandhi he's jesus he's martin
luther king he's he's he's got it
and i i've read him and read him and
read him how why did he fail
silence in the face of evil is evil
itself
not to stand is to stand he's got it
love one another don't stop playing the
organs so you can hear
the the train going to auschwitz okay
he failed because germans had already
gone over the cliff
they had because of world war one then
the treaty of versailles then the 1920s
they had already lost their
judeo-christian principles they had
lost their center remember if it wasn't
for
england gandhi would have failed
people think of gandhi as starving
himself to get the british to comply
no he starved himself to say
to his own people do not rise up in
anger
they were this close to losing
and he knew it he was appealing to the
sense of decency and
fairness of the british culture
so he knew the people because of their
judeo-christian worldview
would see this oppression and go that's
wrong
if we we have a window and it's closing
if we
give in to our anger our outrage and we
say
you know what i can't take it anymore
we will lose and that window of the
judeo-christian values will close
and then we're done yeah it's so
interesting because one of the themes
that keeps coming up as i'm on this tour
is people keep asking me about this how
much worse is it going to get before
there's some sort of reset
and all of these things and it's like
man i don't want
two months from now or four years from
now to look back at right before the
2018 elections and go boy weren't those
the good old days
because we've gone on on the train to
hell so do you think there's actually no
way to stop it at this point do you
think that no i think there is a way
behind it so
here's here's the scenarios that i'm
looking at
right now if i'm war gaming okay none of
these i know the prediction business
always works out so let's see where you
got here so
if you're wargaming yeah let's look at
the next election
what happens well the democrats probably
gonna win the house
okay they win the house you know they're
going to at least subpoena his tax
records
he's not going to give up tax records
that'll be brought to the supreme court
remember that marker number one that's
day number one day number two
they don't have any place they can go on
impeachment they have to impeach them
even if they don't have anything right
they've already said it they have to do
they have to do it
it'll be the senate that will throw
they'll throw it to the senate that's
where the trial happens
so impeachment just means we're taking
you to court okay
so that's day number two day number
three
uh trump has already filed with the
supreme court saying i'm not
i'm not testifying i'm not turning over
my tax records
i'm not doing this okay well kavanaugh
has already said
he's already seen that that's a
distraction the president shouldn't have
to so
day number three when trump has brought
it to the supreme court
then the house says wait a minute
kavanaugh should
recuse himself we're looking at a year
yeah where uh the three branches of
government
the administration plus the house
and the senate both of them will be
fighting with each other
they'll be fighting with this branch and
they'll be fighting with the supreme
court
when kavanaugh doesn't recuse himself
they will file
articles of impeachment for him and
they're they're leading all of these
ideas already i mean these ideas are
trickling out
this is gonna happen yeah so now you
have the press
the fourth branch already in chaos has
has absolutely no credibility at all
it's deranged and that pushes
what you would call the fifth branch or
the first branch the people
into the streets how do you solve that
right so before we get to the streets
can i give you the one
option that i think maybe saves us from
all that which is that the republicans
win or at least hold in the midterms
thus
finally as long shot as this is finally
the democrats go
okay we've got to drop identity politics
we've got to get away from this
socialist democrat democrat socialist
nonsense there's no evidence that they
would ever look in the mirror if
anything they've only doubled down every
time
yeah but i see that as the only out to
where you're going
so i think if you have if they don't win
the house
if you win the house god forbid if they
win the house and the senate then it's
chaos
but if you win if they win the house the
democrats
that scenario is going to play out in
some form or another
so that just gets worse and worse or
worse i was talking to a friend of mine
just last night about this
and he said you know just exactly what
you said and i
followed it up with what you said show
me the i know there's no evidence
i am spartacus is all of a sudden going
to say
okay i'm not spartacus yeah you know i'm
the
carpenter from you know from nazareth no
wasn't that the danger all along and
this this is directly linked to your
book i mean i remember before the
election i kept saying
and this is when i still considered
myself on the left and and someone that
had basically only voted democrat my
entire life i think the one time i voted
republican was
uh bloomberg's third term in new york
city after he had flipped
like 87 times over something i'm not
even sure if he was republican at that
point
um but that i kept saying before the
election
if you keep calling trump hitler
then no matter what he does and no
matter what reality is
you'll never be able to get yourself out
of that little thing place you've
painted yourself and that's where we are
so you know what's crazy i lived this
i lived this i said
i'm the guy who got in so much trouble
saying i think barack obama may be a
racist
now i immediately corrected it in that
on the spot and said that's not quite
right i now understand i explain it in
the book
i now understand how to express that
i wasn't up on anti-colonialism i
certainly wasn't up on post-modernism
so i'm hearing all these terms that mean
nothing to me
and yet they're always attacking groups
to me and to a lot of people in the
country that's the definition of racism
yeah okay
but i didn't understand the difference
the other part other part of it okay
it's now
social justice okay well social justice
seems wrong to me
that's how i defined it then that was so
divisive
when i said that and i was really at the
time struggling to figure out what is
happening how
who is this guy um and i
got more and more strident uh
and didn't make a lot of friends on the
left
okay yeah it didn't work
it didn't work my base got stronger
my base learned things but my base also
as things went on got more and more
angry as did i
why isn't this working well because you
cannot call
people names and expect them to come
over
we have i just saw a new poll today that
shows
i think it's eight percent of the
american public eight thousand people
interviewed
eight percent of the american public is
the die-hard progressive
radical okay um
the uh the never give up
conservative traditional conservative
is about 29 okay they're both
on the edges 27 29 somewhere in that
area
still on the edges the vast majority
is now being called the exhausted class
and it's the class of people and i'm in
this
guys it doesn't have to be this way i
don't i'm tired of this
i don't i not everybody is a racist not
everybody is a homophobe
stop it stop it the kavanaugh jordan
peterson
got into trouble and i i tweeted he did
tweeted back to him
i think this might be the first time i
disagree but i put i think
because well for people that didn't see
it basically he said
that what would probably be best and he
did this in a tweet which is never the
best way to do it
and he's already he's already had his
media on that and released a correct
nut correction a clarification in a blog
form
uh but basically he said the best
outcome would be that kavanaugh gets
confirmed but then steps down
and what he meant was that wasn't saying
that kavanaugh did do anything or didn't
do anything but if there's any chance
for a little bit of healing
where everyone gets a little egg on
their face but also gets a little bit of
dignity to walk away with
and the country doesn't come apart at
the seams that was what he tried to do
right in a tweet and
in his blog post he's acknowledged that
trying to do that in a tweet
probably not the best thing trying to do
that in a tweet
um where the people who are reading it
are generally
all about politics and tearing each
other apart yeah bad idea that's why i
put
i think because knowing jordan
the little that i do he's a deep
philosophical thinker so my
my feeling was and it turns out it was
right that he's looking at that and
saying
okay in in a normal world in a good
world where we're all really trying to
do the right thing
and if we really were all trying to do
the right thing i agree with him
it would have been the best thing to
have
joining me today is the author of the
orphan X novels a comic book writer
whose work includes Batman Wolverine and
The Punisher and a guy trying to save
the Democrats Greg Hurwitz how's it
going it's good to see you oh that's the
scariest one you can write all the
thriller novels you watch worse than the
rogues gallery it's worse than any
Batman villain or evil fury I've ever
heard trying to save the Democrats but
you're trying we're gonna get to that in
a little bit so there's a lot I want to
do here with you
let's talk orphan X first I'm a little
bit just about your work what got you
into rulers you know the only thing I
ever wanted to do is write thrillers and
my parents did not let me watch TV when
I was growing up unless there was Alfred
Hitchcock movie on or the Red Sox were
all my dad's from Boston so that was
religion and so all that I did was read
and so I was like climbing the
bookshelves to get to you know jaws on
the top shelf and Stephen King I mean I
was just into all that stuff by by fifth
grade and I was obsessed with it and I
still remember reading Salem's Lot like
under my bed with a flashlight I was 25
years old yeah but my parents were out
and I remember just being terrified and
just thinking it's it's insane to me
that this guy Stephen King can take a
combination of familiar words and put
them together in an unfamiliar way and
elicit this much emotion in me yeah this
is the only thing I wanted to do so I
started to write these mysteries with
like crayon illustrations at that age
and I went to college studied English
and psychology that's where I met Jordan
because I thought that'd be the best
combination of majors and I started my
first novel when I was when I went to
Harvard yeah
hey College you could say this place in
Cambridge yeah and so basically I
started my first book when I was 19 and
then I got supremely lucky and sold it
you know and kind of never had to have a
real job yeah does that is that how it
feels to you still like a job like when
I was just looking through your
Wikipedia today and all the cool things
that you've done and all the comic books
that I've grown up you know reading
the characters that everybody cares
about it doesn't it doesn't feel real it
so I can't believe I get paid to do it
like I love it so much I sort of wake up
and float down the hall to my office on
a you know barge of gratitude I just
it's so great and the comics were blast
I mean the comics are like when you get
into Marvel in DC it's like that super
rich kid who used to live up the street
from you had all the best toys and you
could go to their house and play with
their toys
yeah that's Marvel and DC yes like do
you wanna I still remember my first call
for more of all the editor-in-chief was
a very good friend axel Alonso was a fan
of some of my books and called and said
you can have sort of any character from
the Marvel vaults oh man and I had to be
super calm and cool and collected but my
inner geek boys do the cartwheels I know
you love this stuff and it's like it's
in our cells and so I said you know I
want to do the Punisher because the
Punisher was the end-all be-all there's
a lot of Punisher in orphan ax2 I mean
you can a lot of Batman you can see this
and basically I wound up writing that
they wanted someone from outside of
comics because Garth Ennis had completed
his legendary run and they wanted to
kind of reboot it and I still remember I
have this totally surreal experience
where I went to the bookstore right here
in Ventura I'm sorry the comic book shop
and I could no longer buy my favorite
comic because I was writing it like I
already knew what what happened and it
was completely wow that's real comic
book in there somewhere I was wild yeah
so are you more of a Marvel guy or a DC
guy I'm to ask I don't know that you
legally can answer that
you're more Marvel yeah I'm more of a
mark yeah I am more Marvel with the
exception of Batman I mean I love Hulk
Spider I was a hardcore spider-man like
you know and I had every Punisher
appearance what I make of sort of the
way the movies have gone down because
it's so clear that Marvel has just
figured out how to do these movies
correctly and at least from my opinion
DC all the Wonder Woman the standalone
it was good like they just can't quite
practice right although the original
Batman yeah the Christian Bale that
means well yeah well those Batman's so I
wrote Batman The Dark Knight that you
have here so I my Batman series it was
very much it has an homage to those
films it wasn't the mean Batman title
just Batman who's Batman The Dark Knight
and I was very focused on reinventing
the villains I love villains and I love
dealing with darkness and giving them a
very legitimate viewpoint which is
probably part of the perspective
shifting that I think that I'm capable
of doing in politics I can see a lot of
other sides and a lot of valid reasons
for it well I can also see this is why
you can you know do some things with
Jordan because he always talks about you
have to give the devil his due and I
guess you really have to do that if
you're gonna write a good villain right
oh yeah I mean the bad guy never thinks
he's the bad guy right so it's like the
more I think younger writers and me
included you know my early stuff it's
like the worst possible serial killer
villain you think that makes your guy a
better force for good and what you
realize is if you can actually build a
steel man instead of a straw man like
someone who has a reason rationale and
worldview that we almost start to relate
to as a villain like it's right there
mm-hmm and then your guide defeats him
even through that chaos and ambiguity
that actually accrues way more
positively to your protagonist than if
he's just you know tracking serial
killers all day yeah serial killers
inherently aren't that interesting from
a narrative perspective because it's
like why did he do it oh he's insane you
know if you can find people with a real
rationale which is what I do for it's
what I really do in the orphan axis but
I did that with penguin with scarecrow
with you know the Mad Hatter I tried to
give them an inner life that shows the
reflection mm-hmm of Batman it's sort of
like that Buffalo Bill wasn't really the
interesting bad guy in Silence of the
Lambs
it was Hannibal Lecter right like the
psychopath yeah there were the
straight-up murdering psychopath oh yeah
it was more about the the intricacies of
the psychological piece well in that
structured like a love story right
that's a love story between Hannibal
Lecter and Clarice Starling mm-hmm
right didn't end that well for well well
for them it did for them it did I didn't
end that well for the guy I mean yeah
there's a dance and there's a flirtation
and so it's very much about them you
know it's this very weird twisted foray
into intimacy between two opposite
parties and so it's structured out like
a romance
we should recut that as a rom-com
I'm sure somebody's done that dude
somewhere so for somebody that's
interested in stories and these
archetypal characters and as you know
I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson right
now how much truth do you think people
can get out of these stories because
Jordan's always talking about you know
the truth that you can extrapolate from
religious stories but then also does
relate it that you can get truth from
well-written fiction like you know he
talks about Harry Potter a lot or the
story of Pinocchio or just different
things when you're writing these things
are you really keeping that in mind yeah
you know that's a really interesting
question I mean I I believe I'm a
hardcore young yet I mean I first
studied young under Jordan my my thesis
if anybody like if ambien doesn't work
my thesis was 14 and Jungian analysis
from Shakespearean tragedy I mean I
posit that Shakespeare was his tragedies
are like perfect thrillers right they're
highly structured convention boundary
interpretations of past themes that are
narrative ly driven of lust intrigue and
murder designed to appeal the broadest
possible cross-section of people but I'm
a hardcore Jungian in that I do believe
that the hero myth is as essential and
evolutionarily selected as opposable
thumbs and eyelids like you can find a
tribe cut off from all human contact
buried deep in the Amazon and you know
they're gonna have opposable thumbs you
know they're gonna have eyelids and you
know that they're gonna have a hero myth
with all the constituent parts so then
the question is well why and so what I
believe is that I mean what I believe
what what Jung believes what Jordan
talks about a lot is that there's
essential wisdom that's embedded then in
my mind is more is a more real truth
than the kind of truths that we deal
with on the surface in a lot of ways of
how to contend with the unknown both
internally and externally so you buy in
if we were looking at this sort of Sam
Harris Jordan debate on this you buy
Jordans version of that that it's beyond
just fact that can give us truth it's
that there has to be some other sort of
story on top of that yes I think we're
story processing and story making
machines yeah that you can't get value
out of just fact alone basically yeah I
mean you need to you need to embed
something
in some archetypal structure so I always
think of it like we're preconditioned to
have and you know it's complicated
because people think when you talk about
the Jungian collective unconscious
people think that like somewhere
floating in our prefrontal cortex is the
notion of a wizened old woman as
representing wisdom but I don't think
it's that I think that there's a story
engine that is selected that drives
people to say okay I need a
representation for wisdom so if you look
around your village or your city or your
community that will tend to land on
somebody who's older like it's ingrained
in them so you there's different choices
that happen I don't believe that that
there's sort of essential specifics that
are floating in our head but the
mechanism to make to make meaning is in
there and the mechanism to look at
different things that are in the world
around us and to plug in symbols and to
make them construct a certain way and
that's why if you look at like the Epic
of Gilgamesh it's a direct overlay for
The Terminator
right I mean so there's all these
overlaps and nuance between the ways
that we're used to processing story yeah
what do you make of the fact that it
seems like the only thing we can
seemingly do right in Hollywood these
days is make superhero movies is there
some like extra meaning to that right
now like we're making blockbuster after
blockbuster or at least Marvel is just
blowing it out of the water with all
these things and we don't seem to be
making a lot of new original stories
anymore well I'm a little I'm divided on
that I mean my favorite movie last year
was Wind River I don't know if you saw I
didn't say that I think I heard of it
Taylor Sheridan is the writer director
he also wrote hell or high water and he
wrote Sicario okay he's amazing
so there's interesting work that's being
done I mean I think there's a
preponderance of superhero stuff because
as we are sort of laying waste to some
of the structures that have protected us
in a lot of ways it's sort of the new
gods in the new mythology I mean in the
case of Thor literally right and so I
think that it's there it's this overlay
for us to contend with and make meaning
with with bigger symbols in our life I
mean it's so weird I love Batman right
you're a Batman guy too yes by being a
Marvel guy yeah but it was so funny cuz
out the other day and there was a guy
with like a Batman wallet and a Batman
tattoo and a Batman shirt and I was like
we're
grown man what are we doing what does
mean right mean you have a wallet it's
sort of like is it that different than
having a cross around your neck like why
are we if you like it if you like a
comic if you like a movie why are we
necessarily like in graining that in our
skin right and having that be in our on
our clothes like why would we wear this
with a shield and I think there's a lot
of a sort of religious overlay to what
these represent yeah well the stories
write these stories of good and evil in
the way Star Wars at least the originals
affected me or the way now I mean you
can get so much truth and interesting
deep profound psychological thought out
of the the original Batman trilogy it's
incredible yeah well good and evil and
laying waste to the world I mean that
Heath Ledger Joker is just a
manufacturing yeah well so it's funny so
you look at there's sort of we have a
direct line with Star Wars in some ways
because you have a young who has a
fairly impenetrable cannon like he's not
breathing reading you know you can read
Freud and the case studies read like
short stories I mean so it's obvious for
me in hindsight why studied it but
things never make sense when you're just
following things that you love and I was
super interested in psychoanalysis and
in hindsight it's like of course all
young wrote about was narrative mmm-hmm
and all Freud wrote about was you know
interesting psychological case studies
which are also narrative based and they
read like short stories but so you have
a young who's very tough to penetrate so
you have Joseph Campbell who came along
I think of Campbell is like the
cliffnotes for young I don't think
Campbell has a lot of stuff that if you
you know like Jung's tricky you know
he's like reading young it takes a lot
of work and focus so Campbell makes that
more accessible and then Campbell had
you know that's where Bill Moyer that
famous interview right and Lucas then
specifies that makes it specific in a
way and when you're talking about
meaning in stories that sort of thing
it's like no one will deny you can find
meaning from Freud and Jung right but
when that's distilled down to something
that's specific that embodies those
principles that's the thing that sort of
tattooed on our spinal cords in this
culture like who didn't have that
experience with Star Wars yeah right who
doesn't show up with that and that's
because it's taking these things that
are litter
philosophical psychological meaning
making human beings in these bodies in
these cannons and distilling it down to
something that everybody can plug into
whether you get it at whatever level you
get it out you get it out seeing those
that seven is different than us seeing
them at 30 or 40 yeah so when Jordan
takes that to the religious place do you
follow that thinking there
yeah and I'm from like an atheist Jewish
you know semi socialist background you
know like I'm not conventionally
religiously raised you know it's like to
deny that a story isn't that successful
so here's a weird thing that's always an
issue that I have with with Democrats I
know you get very defensive when people
have problems with Democrats oh yes
there's this funny thing where Democrats
tend to view other cultures with like
great reverence especially the more
exotic they are even if there's some
fundamental issues in the other cultures
that should be relevant right like you
have hardcore feminists who are
supporting certain regimes that treat
women terribly and you're like we should
jar out of that like that appreciation
for the exotic and the one thing I find
frustrating is we have such a collection
of different cultures in the United
States and it's like why can't you go to
Alabama or the deep south I love the
deep south like when I saw my first book
I drove through the deep south to go to
the bourbon distilleries and to see
Faulkner's home and why don't you look
at that and people's relationship with
the Second Amendment and their
relationship with each other and their
relationship with their value system as
also being a culture that is different
that should be appreciated right we
don't it's it's a weird thing and so so
we do it for the outward world but sort
of not just right enough to be safely
exotic yeah right but if someone
disagrees with you and looked this is
true both ways I mean I'm not I'm not
merely beating up Democrats but it's a
frustration that I've had to say people
think differently so if you want to
pretend that you're gonna jump into
their brain and make a moral judgment on
why they hold their opinions that's not
good for anybody
but the same thing holds true for
stories it's like going to any
university and it's super cool and hip
to talk about to analyze the Marvel
stories or to analyze Star Wars and it's
like why wouldn't you do the same with a
story that is so successful that it
Dwarfs all of those over centuries and
centuries that his you know given rise
- you know cathedrals and and and and
Wars and like this is stuff that is
moved right right right so it's like if
you're into those stories it's like yeah
that was that was yesterday you know
that's we are like you know Jesus Freak
yeah wait a minute like write a story
somebody that guys at the Star Wars
convention yeah exactly yeah and it's
like most of what's the story of Jesus
like if you if you shoulder your own
burden if you bear your own cross and
accept your own suffering that's only
means toward to transforming it or to
transcending it I should say and so it's
like oh is that relevant in
relationships or psychology like what's
the best approach if someone's really
screwed up and complaining and as a
murder in the whole world like you go
yeah honey the world's awful like is
that the parenting that you want or to
say what it what are the things you're
doing where are the faults as they exist
in you one thing the Jews are great on
the Old Testament the gods angry we
screwed up right Jordan Jordan says that
alive yeah it's like where is it
centered in you and what is the way that
you can accept the conditions and the
inherent tragedy of life in a way that
allows you to transcend this and it's
like that's played again and again and
again I mean you look at Tony Scott
Denzel Washington's man on fire mm-hmm
and it's like you look at how
beautifully that takes an hour in the
first act just the relationship between
him and the girl and it's basically a
classic like you need to become a
monster to hunt monsters but it's the
story of his salvation and sacrifice for
something innocent it's just it's that's
my favorite modern memory problem what
do you make of the fact that people
actually care about this stuff right now
like this type of conversation and being
able to relate it to either comic books
or movies and still talk about religion
or talk about it from an atheist
perspective that people actually care
about this we're I think four years ago
if a whole bunch of us had been talking
about this people would be like what the
hell like I like this relevant what what
you guys live in your mom's base right
well that's what they'd be saying
covered would snack crumbs yeah that may
well be true but I cleaned up before I
joining me today is a writer and
columnist at Colette magazine as well as
a philosophy major at Columbia
University
call me news welcome to the Rubin report
thanks for having me on dude I had to
change my shirt because your shirt
looked so pressed and starched and
professional sigh Ronnie cuz I normally
dress like a complete slob we're the
same black hoodie every single day yeah
but I thought Reuben report you have to
bring a game let's do it I should have
worn a tie but here we are
alright there's a lot of reasons that I
want to talk to you you were sort of I
think put on put on my map and put on
sort of the the IDW map and the map of
all of the people that that care about
the issues that we talk about here about
what was about five or six months ago
something like that something like that
your piece I want to get the exact title
right was the high price of stale
grievances and that was in kulit and you
know I just had Clara on the show last
week so we're gonna talk about a lot of
things you've been writing that I want
to talk a little bit about what it's
like to be a student at at a university
these days especially one that leans
pretty far left and all sorts of stuff
first just tell me a little bit about
yourself where you're from how you grew
up well that kind of stuff from
Montclair New Jersey just 30 minutes
outside New York City nice suburb you
know I had a pretty typical middle upper
middle class upbringing and great
parents and out of out of high school I
I was going to a music school actually I
was dead set on being a jazz musician
and I still played Josh trombone nice
but along the line I ended up shifting
paths and going into philosophy and
enrolling at Columbia where I have two
more years how do you go from jazz to
philosophy there's probably some
through-line there right I don't know
that there is honestly I think I think I
just loved both of them and realized at
a certain point that just going to
school for music was limiting so yeah
yeah so you said middle class or upper
middle class yeah you have did your
family have any particular political
beliefs where you guys
political at home any of that my my
mother was nearly a Marxist um she I
remember her talking to me about marks
and Durkheim when I was three and four
years old well she came from the South
Bronx immigrant Porto Rican family very
very poor in the 70s when the South
Bronx was the picture of crime and just
decay and she she was very smart woman
ended up getting a trying to get an
anthropology degree but she passed away
of cancer well while she was getting it
but no sheshe I was I was exposed to two
marks and Durkheim and some other other
Marxist thinkers when I was I could have
told you their names when I was five
years old Wow
my dad is bit of a libertarian but I got
less of his his he was working much at
the time so yeah so that's a real mixed
yeah household of politics no did you
sort of lean one way or the other
yeah I always leaned heavily left if I
if I leaned anywhere at all yeah I mean
as early you know my the beginning of my
political identity was definitely
anchored around identity politics and
especially black identity politics yeah
I was you know 24 it was at 2013-2014
when black lives matter started cropping
up I was at that point very much
enthusiastic about that movement I was
posting on Facebook having seen a police
shooting to the effect that this is this
is proof that the system is rigged
against black people so that that's more
or less what I was politically as of
maybe five years ago so yeah that was
very much in my upbringing it was in the
water in my and my social environment
and intellectual environment growing up
how much of that is part of the whole
thing of just being around a certain set
of young people that believe a certain
thing so that you all sort of believe it
together whether it's ultimately true or
not yeah I think I think we're social
animals and and we're heavily
incentivized psychologically to not
break ranks with the norms of our social
group so if if those norms are that you
have to believe in the god vishnu shiva
then most people are gonna grow up
believing those things and it takes a
kind of a rare personality to be a
contrarian in that context and if the
norms are you have to believe in
systemic racism you have to believe that
america is a unique evil then people
will grow up believing those things and
and likewise if the norm is you know a
abortion is murder and there is only one
God and it's the Christian God and
homosexuality is a sin then most people
in that context will will end up
believing those things so yeah I mean my
as far as my upbringing I think I can
remember meeting precisely one
Republican and he was my fifth grade
history teacher and he was such a good
history teacher that you know in this
public school that it kind of made up
for the fact that he was a Republican
because all the parents who want their
kids to get ahead wanted them in his
class right huh so you know there's
something there there yeah yes yes but I
guess yeah long story short it was very
much of an echoed very much an echo
chamber very ideologically siloed yeah
okay so so far your story I think sounds
pretty consistent with a lot of what's
going on with with young people how well
how old do you know 22 22 okay so you
said in 2013 so only about five years
ago you're 17 you're sort of in this
thing this is the beginning of black
lives matter
when did you start realizing that
perhaps it wasn't as much of a positive
as it had sort of been laid out to be
well I think it's it's hard to
reconstruct one's own narrative after
the fact but I remember one thing being
significant which was when Michael Brown
was killed in Ferguson I remember being
in my first year of college taking
taking a class at Julliard and we were
talking about this killing and it was
just obvious from the point of view of
most in the class including the
professor that this was just another
in a long line of examples of black men
being brutalized in the country that
fundamentally does not want them to
cease to succeed and I don't know what
like what it was it may have been
because you know either out of roommate
who was from from Arizona from a very
different kind of political climate who
was skeptical of this and I didn't even
know how one could be skeptical of this
it was so jarring to meet a person I
liked that or many people I liked that
were skeptical of the things I took for
granted yeah were you guys able to get
into it because that's always one of the
big problems that people can't do this
stuff with their friends anyway yeah
well the thing is I think we were such
good friends at that point for a
political reasons that you know no
amount of politics was gonna was gonna
destroy that but I think I just spent
one night reading the complete testimony
from from from Michael Browns friend and
from the police officer and I came away
thinking well if the police officer is
telling the truth then that was a
justified shooting if his friend is
telling the truth then it was
unjustified but I don't know who was
telling the truth and no one in my class
knew either but everyone had the same
opinion so that I mean I remember that
being significant I remember remember
speaking up about that like when was the
moment that you were kind of going right
I gotta say something about this I'm not
sure I'm not sure that I spoke up about
it I'm not sure I would have had the
confidence yeah to speak up about it
yeah
were there are a couple other things
after that because I find it to be one
of these things that once you see this
thing for what it is that then it sort
of happens very quickly I think a lot of
people that watch this show and
acknowledge that because I think it's a
lot of former former lefties or whatever
you want to call it that kind of see one
moment like you just laid out and then
they start looking at other things and
going wait a minute maybe that's not how
it is maybe that person's not racist
just because I disagree with them on
this or whatever the yeah I guess I
could I can point to two other quick
moments one was once I once I arrived at
Columbia I heard of this guy John
McWhorter who I had no reason to believe
anything about at the time
but I just went I don't know on a whim I
went to the library and just searched
his name and pick the first book I could
find and it was called authentically
black and it's a series of essays he
wrote in the early 2000s about the fact
that it's viewed as authentically black
to can constantly point the finger at
white people for any given problem in
the black community whether or not the
evidence bears that out and because it's
viewed as authentically black there's
this incredible taboo on anyone who
thinks differently
and I was reading these essays and I
remember thinking oh my god this is this
is right and I've never heard a black
person say this out loud but it's it's
obviously right and I didn't know you
could say that I remember that that
moment being significant but still the I
mean these subjects are so hard to talk
about I do remember doing at some point
doing MDMA and this is where the most
people have their break yes I guess this
maybe makes the the red pill analogy a
little too literal there you go
but I do remember I mean because you
know I I don't I don't enjoy being the
black person at odds with most black
people around me are getting accused as
I sometimes do of being self-hating or
an Uncle Tom
like I don't enjoy that that's that's
very much a cost of what I'm doing
psychologically but I remember remember
doing MDMA and I was talking to a black
friend of mine about race issues and you
know if you've ever done MDMA you know
it just puts you in this totally clear
headspace where you love everyone around
you so much and you love yourself and I
remember we were talking about race
issues and I was articulating more of
the kind of points of view that I
articulate
now and I felt so silly that I had ever
had a hang-up talking about these things
in any other context and you know after
that I just I felt like like there's
no reason I can't try to approximate
that more and more often
of course it's it's much harder when
you're sober
but yeah the analogy though or the
metaphor of the red pill really has some
value here how did that conversation end
up I mean an MDMA laced conversation at
all I feel like ace all MDMA laced
conversations go well yeah I mean
something has to be yeah it is I just
yeah I think I think if we had more and
more enter conversations with a mindset
of the person I'm talking to has reasons
to believe what they believe and they're
coming from a good place then a lot of
conversations can go well that said I've
had a lot of conversations with people
since then that have gone extremely well
I sorry extremely poorly yeah and have
ended quite bitterly yeah and I want to
get to some of that and some of the
things that people call you and all that
so you have these you know a couple of
successive moments of waking up when did
you finally start talking about this
stuff you know I think I had talked
about it here and there with with
friends and family but and I had been
trying to write about it a bit for the
school newspaper and just writing on my
own but not publishing over the past
year but I think what what what did it
was when Kanye tweeted I like the way I
love the way Candice Owen thinks mhm
when he tweeted that something about
that moment was so inspiring to me to
see someone who nobody on earth would
question their quote blackness because
in many ways Kanye is viewed as as the
picture of blackness
however one cashes out that term - just
to see him bring cranks to see him break
break the taboo even though he did it in
a way that even though he's not an
intellectual he said crazy things about
slavery that that aren't true and
endorse someone who I don't I don't see
myself as having very much in common
with namely namely Candace just the fact
that he was willing to
the taboo at all someone of his platform
was so inspiring to me that that that's
when I started writing for Colette yeah
so what was was this the first piece you
put out for Claude I think that was the
very first it was a very first piece
okay so the the title of the piece as I
said was high price of steel well yeah
this one was different this one was on
this one was about Kanye and Candice
this was oh right right so thank then
this one got more traction the one
you're sorry okay so I think this is so
I don't think I was you were on my radar
from that one although that probably
that whole thing the whole Kanye thing
just sort of broke in such a crazy way
yeah there were so many pieces written
okay but so let's back up then so then
when you write this piece about Kanye
and Candice now you know Candice is a
friend of mine yeah she's been on the
show I like her she has some tactics
that are that are not my thing but that
that's her thing and I can disagree with
people and all that your basic feeling
though this was a net good no matter
what are there risks though in you know
taking somebody like a Kanye and having
that be the moment that wakes up people
because you don't know where he's ever
gonna go with things or was just the
action itself enough I guess time will
tell I think it is inconvenient that
Kanye I love his music and I've been a
fan for a long time but he clearly has
some narcissistic elements to his
personality he's clearly not someone who
deeply researches the subjects that that
he sometimes talks about so he kind of
took a very blunt sledgehammer to a
taboo which I appreciated but there are
there are serious downsides to that
namely when he says that slavery was
slavery was a choice something that
ignorant seems to discredit his taking
the sledgehammer to the taboo when I do
think they're separable in principle I
also think when he said you're talking
about when he said that on TMZ right yes
and his counter-argument to that was
that he means that it's it was sort of a
mindset yeah I think was his counter
right yeah right yeah so just that that
soundbite reads so awfully because it
seems so uninformed regardless of what
his his intent was there that it can it
can seem
discredit that he did a good thing on
the net on net balance yeah and yeah I I
also I you know I have reservations
about Kent Candace Ellis as well I've
seen her reason in ways that I think
don't make much sense although I have
some points of agreement with her too
but like I said I think I think there's
a taboo that is incredibly strong right
there there are lots of black people who
agree with some version of my takes on
race and are absolutely mortified to say
so because there's this massive taboo
yeah and that's also why for again
whatever my disagreements are with
Candace it's like I see her as someone
that's trying so desperately to break
something the very thing that you're
talking about so it's like if she's
using tactics that maybe I wouldn't use
or you know tweets in a more hostile way
of people or whatever that I wouldn't do
it's like I don't know that I I'm the
one that should be telling you how to
behave
in that regard yeah does that make sense
to you
not so much only because I feel like
there are a lot of people who might like
what Candace says on race for example so
when Candace says you know to go goes to
a college and says and sees all of all
of these black students reminding her of
the history of Jim Crow which they
didn't even experience and using that as
as a rhetorical weapon and Candace says
listen you were born in 1990 right I
completely agree with that that is that
is a message that needs to be hammered
home which is that histories in the past
and we have to be getting past history
but you know when she says that you're
on the Democratic plantation mm-hmm I
think that is a kind of exaggeration
that is not useful because people with a
different set of intellectual priors
will just hear that and be immediately
closed off to whatever else she says and
you know I've also heard her just reason
in ways on Joe Rogan for example when he
pressed her on climate change kind of
appealing to a sort of feeling over
facts kind of way of thinking which is
actually quite characters
of the far-left but she I think she also
gets treated unfairly and she gets
assumed to be a sellout which i think is
is ridiculous ridiculous assumption to
make about people in general unless they
make it absolutely clear that they are
so I've you know she's she's someone I
would be happy to talk to at some point
but I'm happy to set that up if you'd
like to make it happen okay so you write
this piece now this is the first public
piece that you've written about this
stuff did you have any idea what kind of
reaction you were in store for no no II
threw that moment yeah I think it got
retweeted by christina hoff sommers and
jordan peterson and sam harris and and
some other people and it really really
blew up and yeah that was
psychologically distressing because you
know I'm a normal person so when I go
from having 50 Twitter followers to
10,000 and in a week or something like
that that is a pretty life deranging
moment and it was it was just kind of
physical stress a low-level physical
stress all day and not sleeping as much
but you you get I think you get you'd be
surprised what you can get used to so we
were you shocked where you were getting
defense from and where you were getting
outrage from or I assume you expected it
at least at some level yeah no I don't
think I was shocked by that I mean I
knew at this point I knew at this point
exactly who would be very pissed off by
by my my opinions and at this point I
had to resign myself to being it to
those people being pissed off at me and
no I'm not I mean I'm not surprised that
the quote IDW types liked my work
because I like a lot of their work so no
I guess that wasn't that wasn't so
surprising yeah so when you then wrote
the piece the high price of state the
high price of stale grievances which was
also Inquilab you started with a quote
from felonious monk that I thought it
was was sort of worth diving into here
they tried to get me to hate white
people but someone would always come
along and spoil it
there's something about that quote that
strikes me as so relevant to what's
going on right now that we are not
looking at people as individuals and
that every time you do you will be
pleasantly surprised because most people
are not walking around in this state of
hate yeah yeah no I think it's striking
I mean and I I I'm juxtaposed that quote
with another from the New York Times
from a New York Times op-ed published
last year which argued that black
children should be taught to fear white
children based on the history of racism
in this country and the quote was as
alright let's talk about systemic racism
or at least the idea of systemic racism
so I think you've seen the video of me
about two or two and a half years ago
with Larry elder and I brought up
systemic racism larry elder proceeded to
commit a hate crime on me a white man he
beat me senseless with statistics yeah
and I came to a fight not ready to to
fight basically and that was definitely
one of my red pill moments so to speak I
was not prepared
I heard new information I did research
after that subsequently I've had many
people on this show and many
conversations that have led me to more
of Larry's original premise so I guess
first when you when you saw that moment
was that the first time you had ever
seen me do anything because that's a
little tell me and I'm like oh I don't
think it was the first time but I think
I mean I don't and envied anyone who is
debating Larry elder on anything
he's pretty devastating but I've been
kind of refreshing though when you saw
this moment where he laid it out yeah
you know there was no counter because
there is no counter right well yeah he
he what he did with you there is he he
went through each specific venue in
which supposedly there is this big
systemic racism problem where the system
is rigged in such a way that it doesn't
require any individual in the system to
be racist in order for the system to
spit out racist outcomes that's
essentially the idea of systemic racism
so he went he went with you through he
said just name name a place in society
where you think systemic racism exists
and he just did basically destroyed each
one with the specifics of of the case
and I'm not gonna do a better job than
he did there yeah he's capable of doing
but there there's a bigger picture way
to test the systemic racism hypothesis
which is to take to populations where
it's it's a very messy crude science
experiment but to take to populations
where you're holding systemic race
constant namely black Americans like
myself and black immigrants especially
black immigrants from the West Indies
and their children we're talking about
immigrants from Jamaica Barbados other
places in the West Indies and
specifically their children their
american-born children so these are
people you could not tell apart from
black like you couldn't tell if I didn't
tell you that I wasn't the child of a
Jamaican immigrant or something right
and you find that the thing about these
is that these two populations differ in
many ways some some some ways are very
hard to quantify but they differ
culturally they differ for all kinds of
reasons because partially because the
kind of immigrant who gets out of a
Jamaica differs systematically is going
to be disproportionately intelligent
disproportionately hard-working whatever
the traits are that get you from Jamaica
to New York say that's a cluster of
attributes that that makes that
population differ but there's there's
one thing that is not different which is
they are subjected to whatever level of
systemic racism exists so Thomas ol has
done good work on it back in the 70s he
showed that second-generation West in
the West Indians living in the same city
as black Americans were earning 58% more
right so they're they're both being
treated to whatever degree badly by
white people they're whatever this
whatever system you want to suppose is
holding black people back is equally
affecting both of them the Columbia
sociologist van tranh has a great essay
in which the this this difference is
brought out you find neighborhoods of of
black Americans right next to
neighborhoods of black West Indians in
New York they're equally segregated from
white people so it gets rid of you know
this the idea that being segregated by a
cell or living around people who only
look like you is inherently a
disadvantage it gets around the policing
issue because these populations are
being polluted the police can't tell the
difference between a second-generation
white
and a black person it gets around
whatever level of systemic racism is or
isn't in the pipeline with regard to
schools and you find wildly different
outcomes you find you know rate of high
school graduation much higher for black
West Indians a rate of enrollment in
college much higher i'm a rate of
professional occupations much higher
crime lower right so this suggests to me
that there are that the role of systemic
racism tool to whatever degree it exists
is is minimal at this point and the the
the there's a whole narrative built
around the idea that this is the primary
obstacle facing black people and it's
worth noting I don't I don't think most
black people actually believe this
because I mean they're they're various
polls to cite here but there's there's
one from Pew that that asked black
people without without college education
has has race has your race held you back
at all in life 60 percent said no it's a
recent Pew poll another Gallup poll
asked is bias the main issue facing you
in jobs and housing sixty percent again
said no the the Harvard sociologist
Ethan Fawcett polling of the black
community and found that disconnected
black youth which would be a black youth
without who aren't in schools and don't
have a jobs the people on the lowest
rung of society something something
around thirty percent of them think the
system is rigged and seventy percent
don't so what we're getting is we're
getting the voices of black people who
believe the systemic racism narrative
promoted to the to the most powerful
media positions in our country so we're
getting the impression right this is a
uniform view and it's not right so this
is sort of the Jesse Jackson South sharp
as they get moved up because they're
given sort of simple answers right so I
guess it harkens the question that I
could ask this either way what is it
that the West Indian
are doing right or what is it that the
other folks are doing wrong yeah yeah I
mean you can answer that in either
directions I'll show first well part of
it is just immigration selection factors
that I mentioned right so the the kind
of Jamaican or Barbadian who makes it
off the island to New York did likely to
be disproportionately hard-working disp
report will disproportionately x4
whatever X Factor is and so in that
sense the direct comparison can be
misleading but just analyzing why these
two populations differ you find West
Indian immigrants more likely to come
from a two-parent home you know more
likely to have had a more classically
socially conservative upbringing which
is you know you don't talk back to your
parents parents are rather strict there
are downsides of course to that style of
parenting but basically what I'm saying
is that there are cultural factors that
are important that differ between these
two groups right you find if they're
armed there are many I mean this is this
is where the conversation for many
people gets especially uncommon yeah
right it's the idea that every culture
every subculture is identical in the
behavioral patterns that are inculcated
and wherever there is some wherever
there is a disparity in some outcome
it's not possible that culture accounts
for some or most of that disparity which
i think is a very silly idea well
completely nonsensical jurors are
different different people and different
groups put different emphasis on certain
things so more on family simple more on
Education simple more on sports or
whatever the hell whatever the hell it
is so when you hear larry elder make the
argument you know something around until
1972 the black family had a higher rate
of staying in marriages and then he lays
out the reasons that he believes
policies of the democrats destroyed all
that that that obviously resonates with
you right because you're you're giving
me some piece of this both answers I
think resonated or went back to family
of marriage and some sort of
conservative ideals right well yeah I
mean that that's a very complex people
hate when you talk when everyone talks
about
yes about family people just absolutely
hate it it is a fact that black that the
rate of two-parent homes and marriages
was pretty similar to the white rate
until the 60s it is it is a it's a
matter of scholarly dispute as to what
was the cause that it I think it's
certain at this point there was no one
cause well first date may have had
something to do with it but I think it
may have just been changing norms in the
culture what because we're seeing the
same thing happen in in in the white
working-class as well now with the
decline of of two-parent homes to a
lesser extent than has happened in the
black community
yes so so I guess what yeah so I mean we
could talk about some of the the most
important behavioral patterns that are
different between black families and and
white families and Asian families I mean
there there are some statistics that I I
just I don't see any way in which this
could possibly be explained by systemic
racism for example one is that if you
ask thirteen year olds if they've had
their first sexual experience yet you
get nine percent of whites saying yes
you get twenty one percent of black
people saying yes right so it's more
than a two-fold difference there and
that has everything to do with family
dynamics with with their not being -
parents in the home it is a development
issue more than it is an issue of
treatment by white people right I have
another piece in Collette called black
American culture and the racial wealth
gap where I talk about spending
differences and you you you know Nielsen
the the marketing firm has done done
research on this found that the average
black woman is more likely to own a
luxury vehicle than the average white
woman despite the fact that the average
black family has one-tenth the wealth of
the average average white family
spending patterns on on jewelry and an
expensive clothes are very different in
the black community whatever you want to
say about these
ethically this is not I mean I'm not
ready when I make an ethical judgment
right I mean I'm not finger-wagging of
people saying do X don't do y I'm saying
there are there are entire books written
by respected left-wing scholars about
issues like wealth or income or that
just don't mention a single one of these
facts as if it's not relevant right so
what's what's the through line then or
the connection between all of this and
the welfare state because the more that
I've explored these ideas the more that
I am starting to buy that that almost is
the the real problem here that we've
given a certain amount and then it's
just human nature people don't want to
stop being on the dole that has nothing
to do with race you could give it to
anyone but in this case we happen to be
talking about black Americans but I can
give you just one simple example which
is my sister lives in in Manhattan not
that far from you actually and she's in
a building that's part subsidized so
there's a lot of black people in the
building that have been there for
generations now that are they're
subsidized my sister and her husband two
kids they're not rolling in dough
they're paying full market price but the
people that are in the subsidized
housing it's almost impossible for them
to leave I don't even blame them because
they're paying next to nothing and if
they wanted to work more they'd probably
and then get off the subsidy the
subsidies they probably have to leave
the building in the first place I think
I live somewhere worse so we end up with
this horrific catch-22 then again I
don't believe I don't put this on race
it just seems to be affecting people of
a certain race more yes I think I mean I
think it's clear that there was a point
in in in the late 60s and 70s where the
welfare state was clearly incentivizing
counterproductive behavior
disproportionately among black people I
mean the reason I yeah I I don't I think
we need a welfare state I think there's
there's really no free market there's no
capitalist economy in the world that
doesn't have one because they're just
and and you know people's jobs are being
taken by automation
and that's only going in one direction
and we clearly need a welfare state and
we need one that doesn't incentivize you
know counterproductive behavior and we
haven't always had that and when you say
welfare say you mean some sort of social
safety net that's what I yes okay
because I think people would you say
welfare state I think people have a
different sort of connotation traps yeah
I mean as social I mean something that
catches people who can't really can't
help themselves who can't trade their
skills for money in the market yeah yeah
I'm with you so so then how do we
untether
the issue of people that are now stuck
in that machine where every time you
talk about it you're called a racist no
I mean this is it is extremely precious
because I think it's clear that the
welfare state the way it was rolled out
in the 60s and 70s had bad effects for
black people right it's it's it's hard
to fully explain the decline in
two-parent homes without noticing that a
black mother in the early 70s stood to
lose money by getting married to a guy
right because of the perverse incentives
of the welfare state that said it's not
just because the welfare state was one
of the causes of the decline of the
black family doesn't imply that taking
it away would repair it
mmm-hmm so I think I think that is
something I charles murray for example
groped the big book in the 80s that made
him big losing ground which criticized
the welfare state very much along these
grounds but I think even he has
acknowledged that at this point removing
it once you set it all into motion it's
not obvious that removing it is a cure
which is which is tragic but true yeah
it's it's a real tragedy because then
it's like I mean this is where you would
definitely have a difference of opinion
with Candace where her argument is rip
the band-aid rip the band-aid let the
pieces fall where they may
I don't know what her policy is on then
helping like the poorest of the poor
whatever like are you literally gonna be
kicking people out of their houses right
I don't know what the answer to that is
yeah but I think there's there's a
growing feeling I think at least a
certain set of people that it's not
working you're acknowledging why it's
not working
these little band-aid fixes seemingly
only make it worse yeah it's I think
it's a very complex issue because there
there are some there are some elements
of the social safety net that I think
economists agree are working like the
Earned Income Tax Credit which actually
incentivizes you to work it helps the
worst off people in society without it
basically corrects the the massive
mistake of welfare in the Lyndon Johnson
era but ya know it's it's a complex
issue yeah sure so I hate to talk about
race this whole time it's like kind of
annoying I know it's what you mostly
write about what what else is kind of on
your mind like what are the other issues
that you care about I mean we can keep
going on that but I always feel like
it's like it's that's also a sort of
tragedy of all of this it's like your
whole worldview is to move past all this
yes and yet because of that you get
thrust into the conversation it's a
weird weird psychological condition I
suppose yes it is does that just drive
you crazy in general yeah I mean I don't
before we move on the race is not
something I find inherently interesting
yeah I think it is like when I have when
I have a free moment to to read a book
I'm not ordering the race book because
but but at the same time it is a topic
that's loomed so large in our politics
and so much of what is said makes so
little sense that I it it just gets to
me so I have to say something but it's
not something I enjoy I mean what I
really enjoy is philosophy and science
so so when I have free moments I tend to
read things and those in those genres
yeah well you're working for the right
lady Claire oh yeah collect yeah that's
what she cares about too so actually we
can shift a little bit so you attended
an event that there's an IDW group in
New York put together I was put together
in like two or three days it was me and
Eric Weinstein and Faizal Matar and and
Melissa Chen and we're just kind of
doing like IDW 101 stuff and you you
asked me an interesting question during
the Q&A so I'll let you present the
question and then I want to hear your
answer actually before I repeat my
answer yeah so my
question was essentially there are a lot
of people who really don't like the
intellectual dark web I think it's just
a bunch of cranks who are you know
playing footsie with the alt-right in
this objectionable way and totally
dismiss the whole thing but then there
there are there are many other people
who think well you know I I like I like
half of the people in the in the
intellectual dark web you know I don't
maybe like the other half but I think
it's they have it was kind of nuanced
take on it but they're really what where
one loses them is the fact that you know
you've had Stefan Mullen no
I don't know how to do Molyneux right so
this is this character that people view
as objectionable to whatever degree aI
don't know
I don't follow him so I don't know
whether they should or shouldn't view
him that way yeah but you know or sam
harris has had charles murray on the
podcast which you know many he just has
a terrible reputation on the left
largely undeserved yeah or Joe Rogan had
Alex Jones I think we can do endless
infinitum yeah and it seems like that is
is the last place where people who might
otherwise see this phenomenon as good
get off the ship
yeah or I've had I think I've had
conversations with people where that was
kind of the last trench to die in in
terms of criticizing the phenomenon so
my question was what do you like what do
you think about this do you think I mean
this is also a criticism that Barry
Weiss raised in her and her piece about
it so I mean I guess my answer to that
would be I'm I mean well do you know
this guy Darrell Davis he's a black guy
who did a documentary don't remember the
name of it where he met with the white
super he met with Ku Klux Klan members
yeah as a black person yeah and just
hung out with them talk to them about
various issues became friends with them
right so imagine the psychological
courage this takes to sit across from
someone who literally thinks you are an
inferior kind of human being and to put
that aside and
just expand your circle of empathy to
include them preemptively incredibly
inspirational so and he ends up getting
over 200 Ku Klux Klan members to
renounce their membership and he keeps
their robes in his closet as a kind of
trophy of having D radicalized them okay
and then he gets harshly criticized from
blacks black lives matter for having
having done this which is which I found
I find to be the most galling irony in
joining me today is a writer and
columnist at Colette magazine as well as
a philosophy major at Columbia
University
call me news welcome to the Rubin report
thanks for having me on dude I had to
change my shirt because your shirt
looked so pressed and starched and
professional sigh Ronnie cuz I normally
dress like a complete slob we're the
same black hoodie every single day yeah
but I thought Reuben report you have to
bring a game let's do it I should have
worn a tie but here we are
alright there's a lot of reasons that I
want to talk to you you were sort of I
think put on put on my map and put on
sort of the the IDW map and the map of
all of the people that that care about
the issues that we talk about here about
what was about five or six months ago
something like that something like that
your piece I want to get the exact title
right was the high price of stale
grievances and that was in kulit and you
know I just had Clara on the show last
week so we're gonna talk about a lot of
things you've been writing that I want
to talk a little bit about what it's
like to be a student at at a university
these days especially one that leans
pretty far left and all sorts of stuff
first just tell me a little bit about
yourself where you're from how you grew
up well that kind of stuff from
Montclair New Jersey just 30 minutes
outside New York City nice suburb you
know I had a pretty typical middle upper
middle class upbringing and great
parents and out of out of high school I
I was going to a music school actually I
was dead set on being a jazz musician
and I still played Josh trombone nice
but along the line I ended up shifting
paths and going into philosophy and
enrolling at Columbia where I have two
more years how do you go from jazz to
philosophy there's probably some
through-line there right I don't know
that there is honestly I think I think I
just loved both of them and realized at
a certain point that just going to
school for music was limiting so yeah
yeah so you said middle class or upper
middle class yeah you have did your
family have any particular political
beliefs where you guys
political at home any of that my my
mother was nearly a Marxist um she I
remember her talking to me about marks
and Durkheim when I was three and four
years old well she came from the South
Bronx immigrant Porto Rican family very
very poor in the 70s when the South
Bronx was the picture of crime and just
decay and she she was very smart woman
ended up getting a trying to get an
anthropology degree but she passed away
of cancer well while she was getting it
but no sheshe I was I was exposed to two
marks and Durkheim and some other other
Marxist thinkers when I was I could have
told you their names when I was five
years old Wow
my dad is bit of a libertarian but I got
less of his his he was working much at
the time so yeah so that's a real mixed
yeah household of politics no did you
sort of lean one way or the other
yeah I always leaned heavily left if I
if I leaned anywhere at all yeah I mean
as early you know my the beginning of my
political identity was definitely
anchored around identity politics and
especially black identity politics yeah
I was you know 24 it was at 2013-2014
when black lives matter started cropping
up I was at that point very much
enthusiastic about that movement I was
posting on Facebook having seen a police
shooting to the effect that this is this
is proof that the system is rigged
against black people so that that's more
or less what I was politically as of
maybe five years ago so yeah that was
very much in my upbringing it was in the
water in my and my social environment
and intellectual environment growing up
how much of that is part of the whole
thing of just being around a certain set
of young people that believe a certain
thing so that you all sort of believe it
together whether it's ultimately true or
not yeah I think I think we're social
animals and and we're heavily
incentivized psychologically to not
break ranks with the norms of our social
group so if if those norms are that you
have to believe in the god vishnu shiva
then most people are gonna grow up
believing those things and it takes a
kind of a rare personality to be a
contrarian in that context and if the
norms are you have to believe in
systemic racism you have to believe that
america is a unique evil then people
will grow up believing those things and
and likewise if the norm is you know a
abortion is murder and there is only one
God and it's the Christian God and
homosexuality is a sin then most people
in that context will will end up
believing those things so yeah I mean my
as far as my upbringing I think I can
remember meeting precisely one
Republican and he was my fifth grade
history teacher and he was such a good
history teacher that you know in this
public school that it kind of made up
for the fact that he was a Republican
because all the parents who want their
kids to get ahead wanted them in his
class right huh so you know there's
something there there yeah yes yes but I
guess yeah long story short it was very
much of an echoed very much an echo
chamber very ideologically siloed yeah
okay so so far your story I think sounds
pretty consistent with a lot of what's
going on with with young people how well
how old do you know 22 22 okay so you
said in 2013 so only about five years
ago you're 17 you're sort of in this
thing this is the beginning of black
lives matter
when did you start realizing that
perhaps it wasn't as much of a positive
as it had sort of been laid out to be
well I think it's it's hard to
reconstruct one's own narrative after
the fact but I remember one thing being
significant which was when Michael Brown
was killed in Ferguson I remember being
in my first year of college taking
taking a class at Julliard and we were
talking about this killing and it was
just obvious from the point of view of
most in the class including the
professor that this was just another
in a long line of examples of black men
being brutalized in the country that
fundamentally does not want them to
cease to succeed and I don't know what
like what it was it may have been
because you know either out of roommate
who was from from Arizona from a very
different kind of political climate who
was skeptical of this and I didn't even
know how one could be skeptical of this
it was so jarring to meet a person I
liked that or many people I liked that
were skeptical of the things I took for
granted yeah were you guys able to get
into it because that's always one of the
big problems that people can't do this
stuff with their friends anyway yeah
well the thing is I think we were such
good friends at that point for a
political reasons that you know no
amount of politics was gonna was gonna
destroy that but I think I just spent
one night reading the complete testimony
from from from Michael Browns friend and
from the police officer and I came away
thinking well if the police officer is
telling the truth then that was a
justified shooting if his friend is
telling the truth then it was
unjustified but I don't know who was
telling the truth and no one in my class
knew either but everyone had the same
opinion so that I mean I remember that
being significant I remember remember
speaking up about that like when was the
moment that you were kind of going right
I gotta say something about this I'm not
sure I'm not sure that I spoke up about
it I'm not sure I would have had the
confidence yeah to speak up about it
yeah
were there are a couple other things
after that because I find it to be one
of these things that once you see this
thing for what it is that then it sort
of happens very quickly I think a lot of
people that watch this show and
acknowledge that because I think it's a
lot of former former lefties or whatever
you want to call it that kind of see one
moment like you just laid out and then
they start looking at other things and
going wait a minute maybe that's not how
it is maybe that person's not racist
just because I disagree with them on
this or whatever the yeah I guess I
could I can point to two other quick
moments one was once I once I arrived at
Columbia I heard of this guy John
McWhorter who I had no reason to believe
anything about at the time
but I just went I don't know on a whim I
went to the library and just searched
his name and pick the first book I could
find and it was called authentically
black and it's a series of essays he
wrote in the early 2000s about the fact
that it's viewed as authentically black
to can constantly point the finger at
white people for any given problem in
the black community whether or not the
evidence bears that out and because it's
viewed as authentically black there's
this incredible taboo on anyone who
thinks differently
and I was reading these essays and I
remember thinking oh my god this is this
is right and I've never heard a black
person say this out loud but it's it's
obviously right and I didn't know you
could say that I remember that that
moment being significant but still the I
mean these subjects are so hard to talk
about I do remember doing at some point
doing MDMA and this is where the most
people have their break yes I guess this
maybe makes the the red pill analogy a
little too literal there you go
but I do remember I mean because you
know I I don't I don't enjoy being the
black person at odds with most black
people around me are getting accused as
I sometimes do of being self-hating or
an Uncle Tom
like I don't enjoy that that's that's
very much a cost of what I'm doing
psychologically but I remember remember
doing MDMA and I was talking to a black
friend of mine about race issues and you
know if you've ever done MDMA you know
it just puts you in this totally clear
headspace where you love everyone around
you so much and you love yourself and I
remember we were talking about race
issues and I was articulating more of
the kind of points of view that I
articulate
now and I felt so silly that I had ever
had a hang-up talking about these things
in any other context and you know after
that I just I felt like like there's
no reason I can't try to approximate
that more and more often
of course it's it's much harder when
you're sober
but yeah the analogy though or the
metaphor of the red pill really has some
value here how did that conversation end
up I mean an MDMA laced conversation at
all I feel like ace all MDMA laced
conversations go well yeah I mean
something has to be yeah it is I just
yeah I think I think if we had more and
more enter conversations with a mindset
of the person I'm talking to has reasons
to believe what they believe and they're
coming from a good place then a lot of
conversations can go well that said I've
had a lot of conversations with people
since then that have gone extremely well
I sorry extremely poorly yeah and have
ended quite bitterly yeah and I want to
get to some of that and some of the
things that people call you and all that
so you have these you know a couple of
successive moments of waking up when did
you finally start talking about this
stuff you know I think I had talked
about it here and there with with
friends and family but and I had been
trying to write about it a bit for the
school newspaper and just writing on my
own but not publishing over the past
year but I think what what what did it
was when Kanye tweeted I like the way I
love the way Candice Owen thinks mhm
when he tweeted that something about
that moment was so inspiring to me to
see someone who nobody on earth would
question their quote blackness because
in many ways Kanye is viewed as as the
picture of blackness
however one cashes out that term - just
to see him bring cranks to see him break
break the taboo even though he did it in
a way that even though he's not an
intellectual he said crazy things about
slavery that that aren't true and
endorse someone who I don't I don't see
myself as having very much in common
with namely namely Candace just the fact
that he was willing to
the taboo at all someone of his platform
was so inspiring to me that that that's
when I started writing for Colette yeah
so what was was this the first piece you
put out for Claude I think that was the
very first it was a very first piece
okay so the the title of the piece as I
said was high price of steel well yeah
this one was different this one was on
this one was about Kanye and Candice
this was oh right right so thank then
this one got more traction the one
you're sorry okay so I think this is so
I don't think I was you were on my radar
from that one although that probably
that whole thing the whole Kanye thing
just sort of broke in such a crazy way
yeah there were so many pieces written
okay but so let's back up then so then
when you write this piece about Kanye
and Candice now you know Candice is a
friend of mine yeah she's been on the
show I like her she has some tactics
that are that are not my thing but that
that's her thing and I can disagree with
people and all that your basic feeling
though this was a net good no matter
what are there risks though in you know
taking somebody like a Kanye and having
that be the moment that wakes up people
because you don't know where he's ever
gonna go with things or was just the
action itself enough I guess time will
tell I think it is inconvenient that
Kanye I love his music and I've been a
fan for a long time but he clearly has
some narcissistic elements to his
personality he's clearly not someone who
deeply researches the subjects that that
he sometimes talks about so he kind of
took a very blunt sledgehammer to a
taboo which I appreciated but there are
there are serious downsides to that
namely when he says that slavery was
slavery was a choice something that
ignorant seems to discredit his taking
the sledgehammer to the taboo when I do
think they're separable in principle I
also think when he said you're talking
about when he said that on TMZ right yes
and his counter-argument to that was
that he means that it's it was sort of a
mindset yeah I think was his counter
right yeah right yeah so just that that
soundbite reads so awfully because it
seems so uninformed regardless of what
his his intent was there that it can it
can seem
discredit that he did a good thing on
the net on net balance yeah and yeah I I
also I you know I have reservations
about Kent Candace Ellis as well I've
seen her reason in ways that I think
don't make much sense although I have
some points of agreement with her too
but like I said I think I think there's
a taboo that is incredibly strong right
there there are lots of black people who
agree with some version of my takes on
race and are absolutely mortified to say
so because there's this massive taboo
yeah and that's also why for again
whatever my disagreements are with
Candace it's like I see her as someone
that's trying so desperately to break
something the very thing that you're
talking about so it's like if she's
using tactics that maybe I wouldn't use
or you know tweets in a more hostile way
of people or whatever that I wouldn't do
it's like I don't know that I I'm the
one that should be telling you how to
behave
in that regard yeah does that make sense
to you
not so much only because I feel like
there are a lot of people who might like
what Candace says on race for example so
when Candace says you know to go goes to
a college and says and sees all of all
of these black students reminding her of
the history of Jim Crow which they
didn't even experience and using that as
as a rhetorical weapon and Candace says
listen you were born in 1990 right I
completely agree with that that is that
is a message that needs to be hammered
home which is that histories in the past
and we have to be getting past history
but you know when she says that you're
on the Democratic plantation mm-hmm I
think that is a kind of exaggeration
that is not useful because people with a
different set of intellectual priors
will just hear that and be immediately
closed off to whatever else she says and
you know I've also heard her just reason
in ways on Joe Rogan for example when he
pressed her on climate change kind of
appealing to a sort of feeling over
facts kind of way of thinking which is
actually quite characters
of the far-left but she I think she also
gets treated unfairly and she gets
assumed to be a sellout which i think is
is ridiculous ridiculous assumption to
make about people in general unless they
make it absolutely clear that they are
so I've you know she's she's someone I
would be happy to talk to at some point
but I'm happy to set that up if you'd
like to make it happen okay so you write
this piece now this is the first public
piece that you've written about this
stuff did you have any idea what kind of
reaction you were in store for no no II
threw that moment yeah I think it got
retweeted by christina hoff sommers and
jordan peterson and sam harris and and
some other people and it really really
blew up and yeah that was
psychologically distressing because you
know I'm a normal person so when I go
from having 50 Twitter followers to
10,000 and in a week or something like
that that is a pretty life deranging
moment and it was it was just kind of
physical stress a low-level physical
stress all day and not sleeping as much
but you you get I think you get you'd be
surprised what you can get used to so we
were you shocked where you were getting
defense from and where you were getting
outrage from or I assume you expected it
at least at some level yeah no I don't
think I was shocked by that I mean I
knew at this point I knew at this point
exactly who would be very pissed off by
by my my opinions and at this point I
had to resign myself to being it to
those people being pissed off at me and
no I'm not I mean I'm not surprised that
the quote IDW types liked my work
because I like a lot of their work so no
I guess that wasn't that wasn't so
surprising yeah so when you then wrote
the piece the high price of state the
high price of stale grievances which was
also Inquilab you started with a quote
from felonious monk that I thought it
was was sort of worth diving into here
they tried to get me to hate white
people but someone would always come
along and spoil it
there's something about that quote that
strikes me as so relevant to what's
going on right now that we are not
looking at people as individuals and
that every time you do you will be
pleasantly surprised because most people
are not walking around in this state of
hate yeah yeah no I think it's striking
I mean and I I I'm juxtaposed that quote
with another from the New York Times
from a New York Times op-ed published
last year which argued that black
children should be taught to fear white
children based on the history of racism
in this country and the quote was as
joining me today is the original king of
interviewing a friend a mentor a living
legend and a man who loves a good
Brooklyn water bagel Larry King
welcome to the Reuben report know
whenever I hear legend I think one thing
old well every time we've sat down I oh
I feel that I have to say living legend
at the beginning because well are you
are one of the best compliments I ever
thought was Derek Jeter great Yankee now
owner of the Marlins came over to me at
the all-star game some years ago and
said you he said there are a lot of
phony legends you're a true legend
wow that's pretty good yeah that warms
my heart and that's coming from a legend
because that guy knocked out guys the
true baseball attitude did you ever
think that after all your years in radio
in cable news now doing the digital
thing that you'd be sitting in a garage
being interviewed like this going out to
hundreds of thousands and millions of
people let me tell you the truth
whooping this is the pinnacle of my
career if you'da told me 61 years ago
when I started sixty-one years from
today you'll be known around the world
you'll be called an icon a living legend
and at the height of your career you'll
be in a garage with David Rubin it's
come full circle it's killing me Larry
David but what is that what does that
say about just how everything has
changed I mean the only thing sure is
change the only thing constant is change
when I started in radio we had landlines
went through a phone line I did a
starting rear did local television one
year after I started already always did
both always regarded both equally
I always thought of television as radio
with pictures you could be on a radio
now yeah well we released this as an
audio I know but they don't have to see
it
we could imagine any radio stater of the
mind
but I always took that it as just
communicating so I started radio then
did local television
then the national radio and satellites I
was there when satellites were
introduced I never forgot it
I'm in Washington the guest is in LA and
it feels like he's right there
Yeah right there was amazing
settle and I said satellites that's the
end that completes and then Ted Turner
hired me for CNN and I'm seen around the
world we go up 23,000 miles to go next
door and to Moscow try to explain that
to Jefferson doing that and now after 20
songs 26 years at CNN 61 years in the
business I thought I could retire follow
Slim came along so we gotta do something
so the internet or a TV Hulu who knew
fulness yes and when you tell me about
the Internet what bugs me is where the
hell is it where is the Internet people
talk about the Internet and I even
though just have to accept it correct
I'm a product of all these things but
basically David yeah I am doing exactly
what I did sixty-one years ago what this
what we're doing right now is no
different yeah we're being delivered
differently but what we're doing is no
different
what does that say about this the
ability to sit across from somebody look
them in the eye and actually try to
understand the human experience because
I was saying you in the green room right
before there is a massive Renaissance
right now because of podcasts about
long-form conversation the thing that
you've been doing for 60-some idea
that's where it's happening in podcast
yeah it's not happening on television
not even on cable tow they used to call
you know MSNBC CNN and fox news channels
they're not news channels they have
Trump channels ones pro-trump
ones anti-trump ones sometimes hate from
and as pundits yeah it's 24 hours a day
a pundit
they do not cover the news when the
hurricane was hit in Carolina it was in
a box on the corner of the screen while
they were talking about Trump you saw
where the hurricane was that's not news
do you remember seeing a change on that
because you were at CNN do you remember
what year you started I started pushing
will 1985 and left in 2010 yeah do you
remember seeing something changing in
the way Chloe News reported and the way
I saw it when the other side started you
know we owned it for awhile CNN yeah and
then it was MSNBC and then Fox and we
thought they were little invaders Ted
Turner was a genius and off this pants
genius of the seat of the pants he was
driving in a car one day and the guy
said all news all the time he said why
could not work on toes then he puts it
up on the big bird look what he he is
the revolutionary leader of the second
half of the 20th century changes the
world and look what's come tada the
internet dire everywhere you know the
different side there's good and bad to
it if something happened in the world
right now David everyone knows it in a
minute in a minute yeah the world knows
it Wow what do we do with this stand
with technology is always ahead of the
human advance
so when technologies ahead it's how do
we grasp using this it's a great power
you did Steve Jobs when he started Apple
mm-hmm and I'm wondering if he were here
today if he would know what an impact
that's had in the world because I've had
experts tell me that your iPhone will
control your life
it basically is controlling our lives
right now this is now it's a perfect
Segway my friend can you bust out your
phone I do not have what I found because
I don't want to be I was addicted to
tobacco form age 17 to age 53 when I had
a heart attack I know what addiction is
I would wake up in the morning and grab
the cigarette before I put my glasses on
anything
I see people my wife friends with their
cell phones I have dinner with a friend
I'd ever talked to we sit at then and I
mean and he's yeah I think they get fun
cancer so I have old-school a flip phone
see this phone yeah it's a phone put it
to your ear you hear the other side I
don't text I hear people they call me I
call them normal you're the only person
that I actually call you do realize that
I don't call anybody I just take that
why are you why you is see this & purtz
me yeah you as a broadcaster as a
communicator yeah why do you text well I
can see an emergency I'm stuck I'll be
late yeah but come on sometimes speaking
people eat well look you know this is
what I love to do but sometimes just for
the sake of ease of just you know I'm
gonna be here then or I'll see you there
you know a lot of that I try not to have
long-form discussions about political
news or but yeah people are fighting
over personal things on there and all of
that but wait I want I want to back up
this thing you said before because so
when the satellites started and then you
suddenly were doing interviews with
people where you weren't in the same
room do you remember that affecting the
interviewee because I always like this I
don't know if nothing like other nothing
beats this yeah nothing however I always
try to treat it as this they just
weren't there so I try to make eye
contact via the satellite I try to treat
it as if they were there and what I got
used to handling well and enjoyed was
when I'd have five different guests in
five different places yeah and
controlling that yeah and then I did
diplomacy I had a night where we had
Arafat Rob Dean and king - the king of
Jordan yeah
now I bet his father okay
all three Kissinger told me you're doing
diplomacy yeah I had arafat king of
Jordan and the Prime Minister of Israel
together me a little Jewish kid from
Brooklyn sitting there by satellite but
I felt I was with them yeah I I didn't
treat it as them being there I treat it
as like this
yeah did you in in some of the bigger
interviews that you did over the years I
mean you've interviewed you've truly
interviewed everybody is there anyone
that you felt like you didn't you didn't
get to Castro I went down to Cuba in 19
in 2009 200 9 I was treated regally they
all wonderful to me but I couldn't nail
it I couldn't get him to do I was
fascinated by him because he led his
country longer than any leader in memory
hmm somebody had a local right even if
it was only one person and then when I
went to Havana I never saw a happier
country I was amazed the people smiling
musical hotels mobbed you know from the
Canadians and Germans and beautiful
weather a beautiful city water Havana
ought to be open to everybody it's
beautiful the waters are gorgeous it's a
great city however where were you when
you're interviewing Big Tymers the real
movers and shakers that the ravines and
Arafat's that you mentioned that
something that you asked them could
actually turn the course of history you
know I'm not a well I know a lot of it
did I know the Pearl Gore debate changed
after we Clinton called me up the next
day and said you pass and after yeah
that was way behind until the gold or
Pearl debate you try not to realize it
but once once the light goes on that's
just the moment on in noise high if I'm
sitting with Jimmy Carter or a ballet
dancer once the light goes on I'm in
that moment I don't think about
yesterday can't do anything about it
don't think about tomorrow
tomorrow so I'm in the now so bright in
this now you should be in this now so if
you've got Trump coming tomorrow and
you're thinking about that then you're
losing this moment I'm here I always
treat and I'm here I focused do you
think that your curiosity do you think
you sort of made that for yourself or
was it built into you because I've been
out with you to lunch or dinner
breakfast whatever it is and I can see
you're as curious about the waiter
busboy or sometimes when we were at aura
together and you'd be chatting with you
know the guy doing the lights or
whatever that you were actually as
interested in them as if they was that
and always have that David IgE I
remember as a kid getting on a bus kid
and asking the bus driver why do you
want to drive a bus I remember we go to
ball games hidden Brooklyn go to Dodger
games go with my friends we'd wait
outside for the players they wanted
autographs I never want them to
autograph wanted ask questions I would
run along with a player going to his car
why did why did you bunt why did you do
that I was always a wide person yeah I'm
the kind of person you don't want to sit
next to on an airplane I I'm in sand I
don't know where that came from
but it's the best gift I got was
securely out the gift of curiosity
Anthony Quinn told me that you have the
greatest gift ever curiosity my friend
I'd be calling a roll you can negotiate
anything says to me the secret of my
success is being stupid you doesn't mean
that demeaning basically what you're
doing is saying help me help me with
this why did you do that someone asked
me if you were interviewed Osama bin
Laden
Oh your first question had been well it
would not have been why did you bomb the
World Trade Center it would have been
you grew up in one of the richest
families in Saudi Arabia why'd you leave
now he probably hadn't thought of that
since he left yeah but it forces you to
think and then I'm gonna learn more
about him before I learn about the
bombing and also you have to understand
that nobody nobody thinks they're evil
Hitler did not comb his hair in the
morning and say I am a bad person they
may be crazy but they believe nobody
thinks for I'm really terrible and
everyone has an excuse for what they do
the bank robber that Bank boy my father
they charge his checking account to
screw them yeah and the public funny
enough admirers
the renegade Dillinger was very popular
in America very popular he robbed from
banks who likes banks right so how do
you then interview a bad dude someone
that's got you here you're curious about
a bad dude yeah I not - it's hard
sometimes racists especially yeah I had
a tough time doing the early George
Wallace the later George Wallace was
terrific the early George was not a
tough time because I don't understand
racism I've never understood it yeah I
don't have no understanding of why
someone with a different pigment that's
all it is should be treated differently
you think that comes from just growing
up in Brooklyn in arrogance when it was
such a mess can you just talk about that
a little bit like what that was like
rode up oh I grew up in a neighborhood
of mixed you know we Jews Protestants
Catholics that's it with some blocks not
a lot the blacks went to school with us
when I went down to Miami to break into
radio I was 23 and I got off the train
and the first thing I saw with two water
fountains colored white I drank out of
the college yeah I never seen anything
like that you wrote in Brooklyn that was
beyond me then I got on a bus to go over
Miami Beach to stay with my uncle and
the bus driver stops the bus and
we to move forward because the back is
for blacks and I said to him my father's
black I'll stay in the back so I know I
never understood it I've asked this a
racist I have never understood why a
white feels superior to a black Lenny
Bruce who was a great friend of mine
used to tell me that the human being has
to have something they hate that drives
him because they have an inferiority
complex
so they have to feel superior with
something and he told me four years ago
some day blacks will get equal rights
and we'll have to hate something I'll
tell you what will hate Eskimos
there's always another right in other
words you know you used to check in a
hotel and underneath the chair would be
a sign will move under penalty of law
you know who removes them Eskimos you
know any Eskimo war heroes yeah you
don't know name one I'm gonna Google
that an Eskimo doctor right they were
just trying to find some and racism
always befuddle i interviewed dean rusk
Secretary of State Kennedy years and he
was a very progressive southerner from
Georgia his daughter married a black man
he has he said I have no prejudice Dimas
they taught me a little about pressures
so did not the next Dean Rusk said to me
my daughter married a black man I have
black grandchildren I have no practice I
got on a commercial plane the pilot was
black
and for a minute I was nervous that
shows you how inbred it can be yeah can
he fly the plane but I've never it
boggles me when over the years when
you've talked to some of these people
you know a white supremacist or just
some of these people that come from that
truly racist place did you ever hear
them say anything was it almost like
therapy in a way that you felt if you
talked to them long enough maybe they
could get out of it
ever since why do you try you to try the
best you can now there's some books out
by former white supremacist yeah come
full circle of course they're raised a
lot to do with raising is the major
inferiority complex you got a deal with
that although someone says it's not a
complex they're inferior who were some
of the people that you interviewed that
that you think either it went the wrong
way or any regrets and never sitting
down with someone to go oh man I missed
that more I could tell you one it's the
one try remembers name now it's the guy
who succeeded Steve Jobs they want
immediate well Tim Cook now but it's not
a decision yeah Steve Jobs hired
him no what was his name
bright guy came from PepsiCo low I think
I'll have my guys google it well then he
ran he ran and I had him on for two
hours
yeah great guest now why was it wisely
out what was known why is he a question
this is partner okay well this guy will
play joined the corporation Steve left
out and came back later
okay well we'll grant it so I spend two
hours interviewing this guy who's great
all about it previous jobs and and then
I finish and now I go to calls I used to
do this on my old lady Oh show to our
interviewer Lauer calls in an open phone
America I go to close the first call
Larry Steve Jobs fired him he will place
Steve Jobs and then Steve Jobs fired him
you didn't even ask about that shoulda
known yeah it stopped when one gets by
you right and it haunts you look at out
those years ago is still haunting you
try to know everything you can't there's
no perfect interview you can't know
everything you do the best she can I had
a tough time with Ahmadinejad of Iran
because he would I remember he was
talking me on Scully I think it does it
John Sculley see we've got a crack team
oh yeah you got he's still around
motherly
when I interviewed Ahmadinejad and we're
talking about various things and we're
talking about the Holocaust and he says
to me that's why I always have to listen
when you're doing an interview he said
if there was a Holocaust
why isn't Israel in Poland that's where
the crime have hurt why is the State of
Israel 2,000 miles away there was no
crime in Palestine the crime was in
Poland to Germany why didn't they take
that area and give it to Israel right it
made some sense you could argue with
logically yeah I said to him did you say
if there was a Holocaust and we went
right yes right there
are you saying if you know where we got
contentious you did know it was those
are interesting but look I've had so
many years doing this Dave and I can't
explain how I still love it I love the
interplay yeah
you should love what you do yeah not you
know why you learn something every day
every day you learn so I can't be
closed-minded like I'm a liberal
politically certainly in social issues
but I'm not close-minded enough to think
that you can't have an opposing view I
like the argument I like the discussion
but in interviewing I never I leave my
ego at the door I try not to use the
word I it's irrelevant and I tried to
get in to walk any other you know Edward
Bennett Williams the great lawyer told
me once I said what is the role of the
criminal defense lawyer he said to get
one person on the jury to walk in your
clients shoes if you can get one person
to walking in clients Jews got a hung
jury all he has to do is say I would
have done that
yeah when you were doing five nights a
week and on any gear I used this example
a lot because people will say Oh Dave
you had this you know this bad person on
or this that the other thing I'll say
you know in Larry King's heyday let's go
1990 to CNN you'd have the cast of
friends on Monday you'd have a no Jay
Simpson lawyer on Tuesday you'd have you
know an animal guy on Wednesday you'd
have you know a doctor on on Thursday
and then you know former Secretary of
State on Friday was that crazy for you
know you just loved the bounce or
thought about curiosity most of the
times most of the times driving in I
didn't know I had on that night really I
still don't know Laura I Drive in I
don't know who's on unless it were
really someone famous yeah like we might
have the animal guy I didn't know it
well until I walked in to see all the
animals and because my curiosity comes
from pure curiosity so were your guys
handing you notes right no I get a blue
alright first off King we just did
something that we've never done on it
what is uh we stopped for a moment so
that Alexis could bring you a chocolate
shake normally normally someone with
diabetes and heart condition I have a
choc the mukla however I've lost weight
and I don't know why they say it comes
with aging I have I try to have a daily
milkshake they're not lose anymore
yeah that's a that's a little call back
to Brooklyn right oh yeah we had
Moulton's to where they put malt in yeah
the candy store there's no candy stores
anymore
there's no case well now they've got
like you know Beverly Hills Super Deluxe
butter you can know I get that candy
yeah put a jukebox and you sit in you
have egg creams yeah let's talk a little
bit about age I guess it's a little
weird to talk about at some level you
are 80 I'll be 85 in November okay so
you can't believe it my father died at
46 I've had every known disease I can't
believe it I can't believe I'm this age
what is it what does it feel like
I mean you you've had a couple heart
attacks in the diabetes a couple of
things and you're still here you're
doing your thing you're out and about
every morning I bump into you half the
time I think that it's the reason I'm
around is that I have a purpose I am
amazed at people who retire as Milton
Berle told me once when I asked somebody
gonna retire and he said to what what
would I do if I get up in the morning
had nothing to do that's terrible so I
have a place to go to follow my
profession that's wonderful if you can
keep that going I'll probably die on the
air
someone asks what would you like you
really want to increase my YouTube views
right now came from yeah what would you
like your obituary to read and I said
oldest man who ever lived
passed away today in his sleep with a
smile on his face but you still get a
kick out of everything I know it so just
real quick tell tell everybody a little
bit about you have these breakfasts with
your old crew well some of them have
passed away the guys are broken but we
have a crew of about five or six we meet
every day at different places and we are
tater tooth David we solve the problems
of the world today we solved Iraq
audience no worries about Iraq the table
solved but mostly through jokes we go
over jokes and we talk about people get
in arguments we talk about Israel we
talk about
hearings who's this what's the senator
doing what's he doing and then we also
discussed Sinatra and old-time musicians
and who's doing what and what in barbra
streisand make our last tour and so we
never know where the discussion is going
and that's the one for him and when you
were gonna have friends from childhood
so a miner passed away but I still have
two others the best thing about it is
I'm not Larry King I'm Larry soccer that
was my birth name and they're very happy
for me but I'm still a but your button
on your shirt no I mean they they don't
treat you like anything different what's
it like as somebody of a certain age now
where you know you just mentioned you've
lost some childhood friends your brother
passed away just last year so months ago
yeah just watching life turned in that
way
that's the Sinatra told me once the
saddest thing about aging is your
friends go before you I didn't want my
brother to die before me he was your
younger brother right yeah
he was 80 I'm yeah he was 80 yeah loss
is hard it's because I don't believe in
afterlife I'm not religious you think
this is it baby that's it
I have never I've interviewed thousands
of people people who said they've seen
death and all this I don't buy it I may
be a little I don't buy it
I just it just makes no sense to me that
Lincoln is up there or that there's
someone up there looking down on me I
went to my grandchildren's their twins a
boy and a girl so they had a bot and a
Bar Mitzvah
and for the first time in ages I read
from the Old Testament that God he's a
worker son of a Jesus did he hate
it what my enemies rule out show me one
good penny my god believe in me above he
was vain in credit he was a Donald Trump
before there was a Donald Trump believe
in me above all of us I am the I can't
believe so when I read that Michael Mele
so I can't buy it
I've interviewed all the great religious
leaders except Pope yeah I've never been
convinced so when you when you sat down
I mean you've sat down with everybody
from the Dalai Lama across the board
with Marie Graham was a friend yeah so
when you've sat down with him even if
you don't believe it did you feel that
some of them were able to get something
out of belief
I believe they believe yeah unless there
are some phonies you know send in $10
and I'll send you a little cross yeah
don't buy any of that
no she's that down with some of those
guys do Oh Jerry Falls as George Burns
once said when he played God it's a
great more great movie great and he
gathers all the religious leaders and he
calls in a Jerry Falwell type and
they've all top Cosi called me in first
goes up to his room sits down and God
says to him why aren't you so shoes so I
never I never bought that part but I
like Billy Graham risk
I'm Billy Graham thought I was very
spiritual and do I believe Billy is with
Jesus no no but Billy believed though he
believed he was going as he had not then
I've feared death he had a fear of being
in a plane that's going down the crash
but he didn't fear death
I feared I'd item on Mike Woody Allen I
don't fear it I just don't want to be
there
I can't bless my wife believes I respect
believers see when I approach an
interview with Billy Graham I respect
him I asked him the best questions I
could ask like why do you need to stay
at the Fontainebleau or Isley I've
called it Lenny Bruce Timm any person
who's got a calling from the Lord to
lead the flock who has more than one
suit while someone has no clothes is a
cop-out and Billy Graham said in today's
world you have to have more than one
soon
you have to travel I I asked him if
Christ right Jesus probably had one pair
of lip balm that crease would work with
Christ would he buy suits and he said
yes and he would go on television that
was the means of communication I mean
that's their answer if he believed it I
respected his belief but I'm not afraid
to ask him any question if when you die
if you believe in Jesus Christ you will
live forever what happens to Jews and he
said well I I don't go into them but
maybe at the moment of their death they
accept Christ that's kind of a cop-out
right there's always sort of another
answer did you ever talk to anybody
either religious or otherwise that you
felt had some sort of special insight
into something well I have this doctor
on who was convinced that he had died
visited what the world of afterlife was
and then his life for Savior he was a
recognized doctor you know what disease
he had I threw it up to a vivid
imagination and he got a best-selling
book out of it people want to believe
you know I wished
that I had faith that I could make it's
called a leap of faith you can't prove
it so it's a leap of faith now we have
faith in a lot of things you get on an
airplane you have the faith that that
airplane company hired a licensed pilot
I but you have some core of beliefs that
you think if you jump out of the 10th
floor of a building you're not gonna
make it so you don't jump the people who
have that faith who go beyond I just
think they've got a great crutch a great
clutch to know you're going somewhere
yeah but at the end do you think it
matters if they if they live a good life
and you live a good life first of all
they're never gonna know yeah if they go
somewhere they were right if they don't
they don't know because they're dead
yeah so they got a good deal going they
really have a good deal I don't have a
I'll be if I've got an afterlife I'll be
shocked yeah or you'll be doing this oh
absolutely
or maybe you'll be playing baseball up
there I'm not that good you know that
good let's talk a little bit about
politics
you mentioned Trump we did about 40
minutes his name didn't even come up
once first time in American conversation
82 people had a conversation for 40
minutes in the name Trump they're not
that's one thing he's done I'll bet you
everyone in America and one time today
said the name Trump everybody everybody
is there anyone else that in the years
that you've been doing this that you saw
just that effect he's the only president
that I've known for 40 years I met the
other presidents some before they became
President Barak Obama George Bush Bill
Clinton but they were in the political
sphere but Trump is the only one that
was my friend before you Trump and I
went to the Super Bowl together yeah can
you talk about our fathers of the year
together that are 1995 yet his kids and
my kids as all of that story we got
trophies I went to see
Marla maples in her Broadway show I went
with Trump I stated his hotels when I
had some minor surgery in New York he
took my wife out to dinner the night
before he caught me at every hotel he
owned put me in a suite at the Plaza
when he owned the plaza but one thing we
always knew about Trump he was a
character and he lied now he he almost
lined by it's snowing out when it wasn't
you know he'd be on my show and say hi
is reading it and it was all about him
but he was a character and it was fun
yeah and he could be very nice and
generous okay
not all those qualities but he was a
character I mean he would call up the
New York Post with a different name and
tell him stories about Donald Trump so
he can get on page six that was his goal
but president pressure are you kidding
anybody any of us who knew him years ago
first he was a moderate it's a central
Democrat supported Hillary Clinton loved
Hillary Clinton thought she was a great
senator he wanted single-payer health
care he didn't care about abortion come
on
evangelicals I don't think Donald ever
read a book but he's but he was a
friendly character to be around a
wonderful guest a lot of fun fly off the
top but President President so what do
you make about what happened like I have
no idea where Hillary was a bad
candidate a wonderful person I know
Hillary very well great sense of humor
sad I don't know what if she didn't go
to Wisconsin did you get a different
Hillary when you went into her interview
her publicly this is what a lot of her
is is that she's very friendly and open
one-on-one she's good yeah front of an
audience she's not she's not a good if
she's running for something now if I
went to Yom Kippur service where she was
the speaker she was terrific she wasn't
running for anything she was a senator
from New York damn good senator she ran
a horrendous campaign and she was not a
good
I thought she won the debates but it
almost didn't matter Trump became well
Trump got elected with that first
question in the first Republican debate
when he was asked about women and did he
ever called women pigs that he said only
Rosie O'Donnell and he sat in the middle
of all the Republicans why did they seat
him in the middle
he was just for on one side for Nia did
you really think of them from that
moment that I thought he would ignite
something but I thought he was dead when
he said that thing about McCain isn't a
hero
certainly when he got off the bus with
Billy Bush I thought that was over
but his base doesn't care if
evangelicals can put aside his personal
life he'll never lose them he'll never
say it's always I never lived in weird
at times I mean this is the weirdest
time to know every day yeah there's a
story does this truly enjoy yours does
this right now feel like a truly truly
unique time because people ask me that
all the club events I do and I think the
answer is yes although you always think
it when you're living it but of course
these respective do you believe that
somebody said one day to see what
Lincoln said yesterday to hear what
Roosevelt did last night
did you see the speech that Quartermaine
today you win was that weird no they
didn't do weird things
they were president yeah I remember I
was in the White House interviewing
George Bush from Barbara Bush said to me
Larry suspenders in the White House if
she was in the White House's this place
is now I wonder what it's like in there
Kerry the guy writes the op-ed piece in
The New York Times my god the wood wood
book fascinating book we're living in
those times and wouldn't believe it but
I can see as you talk about it there's a
glimmer in your eye like there's
something exciting about this do you
think that that's in a weird way the
good part of this even if it's kind of
helter skelter now and I'm glad I'm not
on
you know I wouldn't want to be doing
panels every day and Trump all the time
I don't want to do it
yeah that's not the whole world Trump's
not the whole world he thinks he's the
huh how important do you think politics
actually is because I think now there's
maybe what I'm realizing now is that
this is really about culture what we're
fighting right now this this battle that
seems to be in points about culture it's
about what do we really care about what
do we like not just about the ins and
outs and machinations no I think too
much of America is still prejudiced
against Latinos blacks that still runs
through a lot of us in my opinion people
voting against their own self-interest
you know let's I want to face it with
something Obamacare is working for a lot
of people you don't hear many complaints
about people who are under it and
getting good medical care I'm not sure
that I'll ever do away with it no no
it's just those those kind of facts are
so it bothers me when I see that why we
still have prejudice in America and
appeal to it I mean Trump even his
defendant would say he appeals to it
what do we need we need a war do you
think do you think that's a play by him
I mean for all the years you knew him
did you think he was racist or that this
is I never thought he was racist I think
he was opportunity he was he took
advantage of a situation so we used to
say he wasn't smart
he wasn't book smart I bet at school he
got a gentleman see the big influences
in his life were Roy Cohn who I knew
very well yeah and his father and they
were bad influences I mean Roy Cohn was
I I liked them causing this peculiar
yeah but he was waiting for the people
that don't know who rikon is he was a
bad guy he was part of the McCarthy era
Angels in America had he played a part
in that play
and he was affected by that so I never I
never thought he was a racist but his
narcissism was beyond belief I in every
other sentence I did this I did that I'm
the greatest president we've ever had
coffee just save it how could you say
that so if you were sitting down with
him I would say Donald why I spoke to
him every day during the camp and not
every day once a week during the
campaign he knew I was voting for
Hillary but we were friends and he would
call me what do you think it is I'm
doing is what you think about I got this
what do you think it is something I'm
gonna do an interview with the New York
Times you know the guy should I do this
and then when he was elected I never
heard from him again
I would heard do you think we can get
out of this polarization that we seem to
be in so if we're in this unique time
right now in crazy time how's it gonna
change you know we don't have a
forcefully - it might be Bloomberg to
lead us we need someone to lead us all
we need Gary Cooper maybe George Clooney
in the modern society I'm not kidding
George Clooney a bright and he is bright
George Clooney will be very popular
women's vote smart as a whip
what does that tell you though if we
need to go to celebrities you think
maybe we're just in there in this real
news this is that's the Internet
that's the world we live in yeah yeah I
like George oh uh I vote for ya what do
you think we can get out of this this
well they say America always comes
through everything George will who's
become very anti Trump believes we can
find a way again America's a way of
finding a way
I hope so I hope I'm around to see it
but right now you know when ah in my
early I could name every senator 10 10
20 years ago every sound yeah and guy
Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy were great
friends sponsored bills together hatch
did his eulogy
mmm-hmm that that wouldn't exist today
that would today the the thing is so bad
when Obama nominated his guy for the
Supreme Court I shouldn't forget his
name and they never brought it up now
course it's Nick will get it will get it
or not when it when when we nominate
people like that who was pretty much
middle of the road
Oh Garland America Merrick garland yeah
if I woulda Democrats now and they take
the Senate I will hold up any
appointment yeah until they can have a
president and first person out a point
would be Merrick garland who deserved to
be on that Court yeah so this is just
both of them playing politics to dance
but will we have a chance i I don't see
it coming you know when Merrick garland
was nominated for excel orrin hatch
before he knew they would delay it said
he's a great man mm-hmm and then it
becomes party over country party over
country said well I you think it's gonna
change I think that the outrage machine
that we're running on right now I think
it can only last for so long so I think
it could you know either blow up into
something much worse and I don't even
know what I mean by that but I think
things would actually get much worse and
some of this would actually spill over
into violence or what my hope is and I
think this is the more realistic option
is that the outrage will start running
out of steam like a car running out of
gas and that from that somebody whether
maybe it's your Cloney or its whoever
else it is that just saw a decent human
being
a Bloomberg or something else will come
back and decency will be appreciated
because I don't think this outrage thing
can run forever it's too it's too
mentally exhausting it's too it's
physically there's a decent man I've
known for years is Joe Biden nobody
dislikes some wonderful father that
there was a great senator great vice
president if he were a little younger
can you imagine he'd be what 82 or
something because she can't dislike him
you want to be VP no I couldn't take the
cut and pay alright let's let's finish
up with some some big picture it's a big
picture stuff looking back is there
anything you would have done differently
career when I got married as much I
would have gone national sooner I had
joining me today is the original king of
interviewing a friend a mentor a living
legend and a man who loves a good
Brooklyn water bagel Larry King
welcome to the Reuben report know
whenever I hear legend I think one thing
old well every time we've sat down I oh
I feel that I have to say living legend
at the beginning because well are you
are one of the best compliments I ever
thought was Derek Jeter great Yankee now
all over the Marlins came over to me at
the all-star game some years ago and
said you he said there are a lot of
phony legends you're a true legend
wow that's pretty good yeah that warms
my heart and that's coming from a legend
because that guy knocked out guys the
true baseball attitude did you ever
think that after all your years in radio
in cable news now doing the digital
thing that you'd be sitting in a garage
being interviewed like this going out to
hundreds of thousands and millions of
people let me tell you the truth
whooping this is the pinnacle of my
career if you'da told me 61 years ago
when I started sixty-one years from
today you'll be known around the world
you'll be called an icon a living legend
and at the height of your career you'll
be in a garage with David Rubin it's
come full circle it's killing me Larry
David but what is that what does that
say about just how everything has
changed I mean whoa
the only thing sure has change the only
thing constant is change when I started
in radio we had landlines went through a
phone line I did a starting rear did
local television one year after I
started already always did both always
regarded both equally
I always thought of television as radio
with pictures yeah it could be on a
radio now yeah well we released this as
an audio I know but they don't have to
see it
we could imagine any radio stater of the
mind
but I always took that it as just
communicating so I started radio then
did local television then the national
radio and satellites I was there when
satellites were introduced I never
forgot it
I'm in Washington the guest is in LA and
it feels like he's right there
Yeah right there was amazing
settle and I said satellites that's the
end that completes and then Ted Turner
hired me for CNN and I'm seen around the
world we go up 23,000 miles to go next
door and to Moscow try to explain that
to Jefferson doing that and now after 20
songs 26 years at CNN 61 years in the
business I thought I could retire follow
Slim came along so we gotta do something
so the internet or a TV Hulu who knew
from this yes and when you tell me about
the internet what bugs me is where the
hell is it where is the internet people
talk about the Internet and I even
though just have to accept it correct
I'm a product of all these things but
basically David yeah I am doing exactly
what I did sixty-one years ago what this
what we're doing right now is no
different
yeah we're being delivered differently
but what we're doing is no different
what does that say about this the
ability to sit across from somebody look
them in the eye and actually try to
understand the human experience because
I was saying you in the green room right
before there is a massive renaissance
right now because of podcasts about
long-form conversation the thing that
you've been doing for 60-some idea
that's where it's happening in podcast
yeah it's not happening on television
not even on cable tow they used to call
you know MSNBC CNN and fox news channels
they're not news channels they have
Trump channels ones pro-trump ones
anti-trump ones sometimes hate from and
as pundits yeah it's 24 hours a day of
pundit
they do not cover the news when the
hurricane was hit in Carolina it was in
a box on the corner of the screen while
I were talking about Trump he saw where
the hurricane was that's not news do you
remember seeing a change on that because
you were at CNN do you remember what
year you started it started pushing will
1985 and left in 2010 yeah do you
remember seeing something changing in
the wake of news reported in the way I
saw it when the other side started you
know we owned it for a while CNN yeah
and then it was MSNBC and then Fox and
we thought they were little invaders Ted
Turner was a genius and off this pants
genius of the steel defense he was
driving in a car one day and the guy
said all news all the time he said why
could not work on toes then he puts it
up on the big bird look what he he is
the revolutionary leader of the second
half of the 20th century changes the
world and look what's come to LA the
Internet they are everywhere you know
the different side there's good and bad
to it if something happened in the world
right now David everyone knows that in a
minute in a minute yeah the world knows
it
Wow what do we do with this stand with
technology is always ahead of the human
advance
so when technologies ahead it's how do
we grasp using this it's a great pie did
Steve Jobs when he started Apple mm-hmm
and I'm wondering if he were here today
if he would know what an impact that's
had in the world because I've had
experts tell me that your iPhone will
control your life
it basically is controlling our lives
right now this is now it's a perfect
segue my friend can you bust out your
phone I do not have an iPhone because I
don't want to be I was addicted to
tobacco from age 17 to age 53 when I had
a heart attack I know what addiction is
I would wake up in the morning and grab
the cigarette before I put my glasses on
anything
I see people my wife friends with their
cell phones I have dinner with a friend
I'd ever talked to we sit at then and I
mean and he's yeah I think they get fun
cancer so I have old-school a flip phone
see this phone yeah it's a phone put it
to your ear you hear the other side I
don't text
I hear people they call me I call them
normal you're the only person that I
actually call you do realize that I
don't call anybody I just take that why
are you why you is see this and hurts me
yeah
you as a broadcaster as a communicator
yeah why do you text well I can see an
emergency I'm stuck I'll be late yeah
but come on sometimes speaking people
eat well look you know this is what I
love to do but sometimes just for the
sake of ease of just you know I'm gonna
be here then or I'll see you there
you know a lot of that I try not to have
long-form discussions about political
news or but yeah people are fighting
over personal things on there and all of
that but wait I want I want to back up
this thing you said before because so
when the satellite started and then you
suddenly were doing interviews with
people where you weren't in the same
room do you remember that affecting the
interviewee because I always like this I
don't know if nothing like other nothing
beats this yeah nothing however I always
tried to treat it as this they just
weren't there so I try to make eye
contact via the satellite I try to treat
it as if they were there and what I got
used to handling well and enjoyed was
when I'd have five different guests in
five different places yeah and
controlling that yeah and then I did
diplomacy I had a night where we had
Arafat Rob Dean and king - the king of
Jordan yeah now I better his father okay
all three Kissinger told me you're doing
diplomacy
I had arafat king of Jordan and the
Prime Minister of Israel together me a
little Jewish kid from Brooklyn sitting
there by satellite but I felt I was with
them yeah I I didn't treat it as them
being there I treat it as like this yeah
did you in in some of the bigger
interviews that you did over the years I
mean you've interviewed you've truly
interviewed everybody is there anyone
that you felt like you didn't you didn't
get to yeah Castro I went down to Cuba
in nineteen in 2009 200 nine I was
treated regally they all wonderful to me
but I couldn't nail it I couldn't get
him to I was fascinated by him because
he led his country longer than any
leader in memory hmm
somebody had a local right even if it
was only one person and then when I went
to Havana I never saw a happier country
I was amazed the people smiling musical
hotels mobbed you know from the
Canadians and Germans and beautiful
weather a beautiful city water Havana
ought to be open to everybody it's
beautiful the waters are gorgeous
it's a great city how where were you
when you're interviewing Big Tymers the
real movers and shakers that the ravines
and Arafat's that you mentioned that
something that you asked them could
actually turn the course of history you
know I'm not a well I know a lot of it
did I know the Pearl Gore debate changed
after we Clinton called me up the next
day and said you pass and after yeah
that was way behind until the gold or
Pearl debate you try not to realize it
but once once the light goes on that's
just the moment on in noise I if I'm
sitting with Jimmy Carter or a ballet
dancer once the light goes on I'm in
that moment I don't think about
yesterday can't do anything about it
don't think about tomorrow that's
tomorrow so I'm in the now
so I'm right in this now you should be
in this now so if you've got Trump
coming tomorrow and you're thinking
about that then you're losing this
moment I'm here I always treat and I'm
here I focused do you think that your
curiosity do you think you sort of made
that for yourself or was it built into
you because I've been out with you to
lunch or dinner breakfast whatever it is
and I can see you're as curious about
the waiter busboy
or sometimes when we were at aura
together and you'd be chatting with you
know the guy doing the lights or
whatever that you were actually as
interested in them as if they was that
and always have that David IgE I
remember as a kid getting on a bus kid
and asking the bus driver why do you
want to drive a bus I remember we'd go
to ball games hidden Brooklyn and go to
Dodger games go with my friends we'd
wait outside for the players they wanted
autographs I never want them to
autograph one that asked questions I
would run along with a player going to
his car why did why did you bunt why did
you do that I was always a wide person
yeah I'm the kind of person you don't
want to sit next to on an airplane I I'm
in sand I don't know where that came
from but it's the best gift I got was
curia the gift of curiosity Anthony
Quinn told me that you have the greatest
gift ever
curiosity my friend I'd be calling a
roll you can negotiate anything says to
me the secret of my success is being
stupid you doesn't mean that demeaning
basically what you're doing is saying
help me help me with this why did you do
that someone asked me if you were
interviewed Osama bin Laden who were
your first question have been well it
would not have been why did you bomb the
World Trade Center it would have been
you grew up in one of the richest
families in Saudi Arabia why'd you leave
hmm
now he
probably hadn't bottled out since he
left but it forces you to think and then
I'm gonna learn more about him before I
learn about the bombing and also you
have to understand that nobody nobody
thinks they're evil Hitler did not comb
his hair in the morning and say I am a
bad person they may be crazy but they
believed nobody thinks for I'm really
terrible and everyone has an excuse for
what they do the bank robber that Bank
boy my father they charged his checking
account to screw them yeah and the
public funny enough admires the renegade
Dillinger was very popular in America
very popular he robbed from banks who
likes banks right so how do you then
interview a bad dude someone that's got
you here you're curious about a bad dude
yeah I not - it's hard sometimes racists
especially yeah I had a tough time doing
the early George Wallace the later
George Wallace was terrific the early
George was had a tough time because I
don't understand racism I've never
understood it
yeah I don't have no understanding of
why someone with a different pigment
that's all it is should be treated
differently you think that comes from
just growing up in Brooklyn in there it
is when it was such a mess can you just
talk about that a little bit like what
that was like rhoda oh I grew up in a
neighborhood of mixed you know we Jews
Protestants Catholics that's a good some
blocks not a lot but blacks went to
school with us when I went down to Miami
to break into radio that's 23 and I got
off the train and the first thing I saw
with two water thumbs solid white I
drank out of the colored yeah I never
seen anything like that you wrote in
Brooklyn that was beyond me then I got
on a bus to go over a Miami Beach to
stay with my uncle and the bus driver
stops the bus and asked me to move
forward
because the back is for blacks and I
said to him my father's black I'll stay
in the back so I know I never understood
it I've asked this a racist I have never
understood why a white feels superior to
a black Lenny Bruce was a great friend
of mine used to tell me that the human
being has to have something they hate
that drives him because they have an
inferiority complex so they have to feel
superior with something and he told me
four years ago someday
blacks will get equal rights and we'll
have to hate something I'll tell you
what will hate Eskimos
there's always another right in other
words you know you used to check in a
hotel and underneath the chair would be
a sign we'll move under penalty of law
you know who removes them Eskimos you
know any Eskimo war heroes
yeah you don't know name one I'm gonna
Google that an Eskimo dr. right they
were just trying to find some and racism
always befuddle I interviewed Dean Rusk
Secretary of State Kennedy years and he
was a very progressive southerner from
Georgia his daughter married a black man
he has he said I have no prejudice Dimas
they taught me a little about pressures
so did not the next Dean Rusk said to me
my daughter married a black man I have
black grandchildren I have no practice I
got on a commercial plane the pilot was
black and for a minute I was nervous
that shows you how inbred it can be yeah
can he fly the plane but I've never it
boggles me when over the years when
you've talked to some of these people
you know a white supremacist or just
some of these people that come from that
truly racist place did you ever hear
them say anything was it almost like
therapy in a way that you felt if you
talked to them long enough maybe they
could get out of it did you ever sense
the time sure you try
try the best you can now there's some
books out by former white supremacist
yeah come full circle yeah of course
they raise a lot to do with raising is
their major inferiority complex you got
a deal with that although someone says
it's not a complex they're inferior who
are some of the people that you
interviewed that that you think either
it went the wrong way or any regrets and
never sitting down with someone to go oh
man I missed that mall I could tell you
one it's the one try remembers name no
it's the guy who succeeded Steve Jobs
they want immediate well Tim Cook now
but it's no no this is yeah Steve Jobs
hired him know what was his name
bright guy came from Pepsi Cola oh I
think I'll have my guys google it well
then he ran he ran and I had him on for
two hours
yeah great guest now and why was it
wisely act what was known why is the egg
was his partner okay well this guy will
play joined the corporation Steve left
out and came back later okay well
granite so I spend two hours
interviewing this guy who's great all
about it previous jobs and then I finish
and now I go to calls I used to do this
on my old lady you are interviewing our
calls and then open phone America I go
to close the first call Larry Steve Jobs
fired him he will place Steve Jobs and
then Steve Jobs fired him you didn't
even ask about that she don't know yeah
it's tough when one gets by you right
and it haunts you look at out those
years ago is still haunting you try to
know everything you can't there's no
perfect interview you can't know
everything you do the best she can
I had a tough time with on the Disney
job other ran because he would I
remember he was talking me on Scully I
think is because it John Sculley see
we've got a crack team oh yeah you got
he's still around by the way
when I interviewed Ahmadinejad and we're
talking about various things and we're
talking about the Holocaust and he says
to me that's why I always have to listen
when you're doing an interview he said
if there was a Holocaust
why isn't Israel in Poland that's where
the crime occurred
why is the State of Israel 2,000 miles
away there was no crime in Palestine the
crime was in Poland to Germany why
didn't they take that area and give it
to Israel right it made some sense you
could argue with logically yeah I said
to him did you say if there was a
Holocaust and we went right yes right
there are you saying if you know where
we got contentious you did know it was
there those are interesting but look
I've had so many years doing this Dave
and I can't explain how I still love it
I love the interplay yeah you should
love what you do yeah not you know why
you'll learn something every day every
day you learn so I can't be
closed-minded
like I'm a liberal politically certainly
in social issues but I'm not
close-minded enough to think that you
can't have an opposing view I like the
argument
I like the discussion but in
interviewing I never I leave my ego at
the door I try not to use the word I
it's irrelevant and I tried to get in to
walk any other you know every Bennett
Williams the great lawyer told me once I
said what is the role of the criminal
defense lawyer he said to get one person
on the jury to walk in your clients
shoes if you can get one person for
walking in clients Jews got a hung jury
all he has to do is say I would have
done that yeah when you were doing five
nights
and on any gear I use this example a lot
because people will say Oh Dave you had
this you know this bad person on or this
that the other thing I'll say you know
in Larry King's heyday
let's go 1990 to CNN you'd have the cast
of friends on Monday you'd have a no Jay
Simpson lawyer on Tuesday you'd have you
know an animal guy on Wednesday you'd
have you know a doctor on on Thursday
and then you know former Secretary of
State on Friday was that crazy for you
know you just love the bounce or thought
about curiosity most of the times most
of the times driving in I didn't know I
had on that night really I still don't
joining me today is the founding editor
of Colette Claire Lehman welcome to the
Rubin report thanks Dave thanks for
having me I am thrilled to finally have
you here this has been like what 87
years in the making
yeah well I leave a very long way away
so it's difficult for me to get here
yeah well you made it you made it
thousands of miles you are part of what
I would say is IDW Australia oh yeah the
Diaspora
yeah exactly okay so there's a ton I
want to talk to you bout obviously I
want to focus on Colette and the work
that you're doing and we obviously have
a lot in common on the issues that we
care about and things of that nature but
first off you are from Australia I've
only had I think two other guests that
are Australian natives on the show yeah
what's going on in Australia these days
what does the rest of the world need to
know about Australia I would say that in
Australia we're pretty chilled out at
the moment at least politically and
culturally compared to America and even
Europe to a large extent we have a we've
had 25 years or more of economic growth
so people are pretty relaxed people are
doing well the middle class is doing
well there's not so much of a feeling
that there's a zero-sum competition
going on like people are fighting over
scarce resources and you know we
obviously have political correctness and
identity politics a lot of that's being
imported from America yeah how does that
get imported because I was mentioning to
you right before we started that a
disproportionate amount of our patrons
the people who support this show are
Australian even if things are going
pretty well there's definitely a segment
of people that are going something's
either not right or or we're seeing the
signs that something yeah it's true I
mean it's difficult to identify exactly
how these cultural trends get imported
but for example through universities
through social media through traditional
media so similar narratives get picked
up by journalists like the oppression
narratives and and we're seeing with the
with the young younger generations how
their
how they pick up ideology through social
media and through the echo chambers and
the filter bubbles that are so easily
accessible yeah yeah do you think that
there's a geographic reason that some of
this stuff hasn't fully hit Australia
yet I mean being surrounded by water
very far off place from the rest of us
there's probably a little bit of safety
in that I would imagine although borders
are changing just because of Technology
yeah it's um yes so we're more isolated
that's for sure we're smaller so we
don't have the same we're not as diverse
as other places like Europe and the
United States we have less income
inequality in Australia which makes a
difference and where we're actually kind
of Pro cool as well I mean we do pick up
cultural trends from America but at the
same time we just focus on cooking shows
and reality TV football games yeah yeah
so when the article came out back in was
it may or so the the Renegades of the
intellectual dark web you you were
included in there and many of us had not
even met you
yeah this is actually our first time
being in person yeah even though we
we've been chatting online for a while
were you shocked about the reaction to
that article because it really did sort
of level up all of the issues that we've
been all talking about no I wasn't
shocked at all I think that the general
movement this ideas movement and this
pushback of the the sort of moral
orthodoxy that the politically correct
left have at the moment it's been
brewing for some time and someone just
had to put a label on it someone just
had to name it and I wasn't shocked by
the groundswell of reaction to it
because I've been seeing it through my
work with Colette there are just so many
people who write to me every day who say
I love what you're doing I can't write a
blog myself account put my name on it
because I would get in trouble at work
or in my university but there are so
many P
or who want to participate in these
discussions but can't for whatever
reason and you know they liked it to be
now be able to put a label on this
general movement yeah so tell me a
little bit about your personal
background what led you to be one of the
people that is okay putting your name on
this stuff because I do think that's one
of the huge issues here yeah we get all
this support from academics even people
in politics and and regular folks who
are like yeah I'm with you and I see the
dangers but I don't want to put my name
on in this so how did claire lehman end
up here willing to put your name and
face to all this stuff you know i think
i have a bit more of a risk-taking
streak in my nature and i don't feel the
same fear around social disapproval as a
lot of other people so i was a
psychology graduate student and I left
my grad program and before I left I sort
of took a few risks during during my
program and was sort of hung out to dry
by the university so to speak yeah you
want to give me an example of one of
those you sort of lit up when you said
it well I I complained about the amount
of unpaid work that psychology students
had to do in a clinic that was
associated with the University and they
weren't happy with that and I sort of
received a bit of retaliation for sort
of almost whistleblowing on the amount
of exploitation this clinic wasn't
involved in so I I've always said the
first time I took a risk I've always
taken risks when I have felt that my
conscience demands that I I do so and
what led me to create Collette was when
I was a graduate student I was involved
in a lot of online discussions with
academics in psychology and we had such
fascinating interesting discussions that
were completely unlike anything that you
would see in mainstream media and I
thought firstly there's a business
opportunity here if I can bring some of
these
sessions to a market and secondly you
know people need to know that there are
there is scientific evidence and some of
these topics and mainstream journalists
and neglecting to inform readers about
some of these issues or some of some of
this evidence yeah so I want to read the
mission statement from Colette because
it'sit's pretty freakin perfect Colette
is a platform for free thought we
respect
ideas even dangerous ones we also
believe that free expression and the
free exchange of ideas help human
societies flourish and progress Colette
aims to provide a platform for this
exchange everybody seems to be afraid of
dangerous ideas right now right I mean
that's why this little crew of people
are together for whatever our
differences are yeah I think that
there's a there's been a conflation
between giving a platform or exploring
ideas and endorsing ideas and they're
not the same thing so I will publish
stuff on Colette that I don't
necessarily agree with politically I
don't see the the fact of publishing and
in necessarily as an endorsement I also
am very clear that I'm going to make
mistakes as an editor Colette
we don't want to make mistakes about
accuracy and if were ever called out for
publishing something that's not
factually correct we will own up to that
mistake but you know we're living in a
time of intense ideological flux and to
work out where we're all going we need
to be able to talk about things freely
and we need to be able to make mistakes
and I think make being able to make
mistakes is a sign of a healthy
environment and it's a sign of you know
it's part of the creative process yeah
so the the the the warriors who want to
shut down debate who want to shut down
free speech and argue that giving a
platform for exploring dangerous ideas
is equivalent to endorsing
they're basically saying that you can't
make a mistake and that's that's really
scary because the only way we move
forward is to experiment test new ideas
see see what works and pick the best
ones out of the experimentation process
and move forward that way yeah so I want
to discuss some of the dangerous ideas
yeah or that you're platforming but it's
interesting that you said this thing
about you don't mind making mistakes
because I feel very much the same I will
sit down with all sorts of people I've
done it before people I agree with and
disagree with some people who I really
don't like what they're talking about
but I try to give everybody a fair shake
and what I'm noticing is there's a
tremendous amount of pushback just on
that that's what you're getting to like
the idea that a you can sit down with
someone and separate a human being from
their ideas but also that there's this
sort of secondary thing that I'm
noticing and I think you you get it too
just from the articles you guys put out
which is that if I don't ask the exact
question that someone wants me to ask or
I miss this or I word this this way but
just this this army that doesn't feel
that organic to me is ready to pounce
and I'm really trying to work through
that like I don't spend too much time
thinking about it but it is a conscious
thing like oh there's gonna be this
group of people that no matter what I do
and really what they're trying to do is
chill everybody out so that you'll only
talk about what they're comfortable with
yeah well there are there are people at
the moment who feel that all of the
important questions have been answered
all of the important moral and ethical
dilemmas have an answer and that at this
point in history
everything's been worked out and anyone
who's exploring different ideas or is
doubtful about these moral issues is
evil your party argue you're racist yeah
yes so I come I come from a different
approach where like I don't know what's
going on like I I'm trying to work it
out with other people and I want the
freedom to be able to explore in a weird
way does that get you the most hate
because I think I really believe that's
where most people are I think that's why
people
and what I do here I'm just being open
about my journey and listening to people
and learning yeah yeah you know and that
but that opens you up from hate from the
both sides it's a lot easier to just
stake out a position and then you only
get hate one way but when you're like I
am gonna hear both sides you know it's
why I love listening to to Sam Harris
and George Henderson to ban you know the
biggest existential questions that there
are it's like yeah it's like if I've
completely settled my mind on this I
don't know I wouldn't be that impressed
yeah my thought process or something
yeah well you know I don't get a lot of
hate um I certainly have Twitter trolls
but well I wait till we I sort of don't
really notice it yeah okay yeah that's
probably the most simple way to deal
with this all right so let's talk about
some of those dangerous ideas what are
some dangerous ideas that have bubbled
up from your writers that you've had to
think about or that you're you're
focused on these days yeah so because my
background is in psychology we tackle
issues that come from the behavioral
sciences so we've looked at sex
differences psychological sex
differences between men and women
differences in interests in occupations
so we've published some articles on why
there are fewer women in computer
science for example and we published a
analysis of James d'amours Google memo
written by four different scientists who
have some expertise in that area we've
published on intelligence research what
were some of the results yeah well they
you know they basically said that
something pretty similar that he was in
the ballpark in terms of getting the
science right and his position is valid
in terms of regular scientific debate
there are observable sex differences
between men and women the differences in
interest in occupations is very robust
and reliable so women are overwhelmingly
interested in
occupations which have something to do
with people so caring professions
medicine even law whereas men have more
interest in occupations that are to do
with systems and things so anything
mechanical computer science and there's
no there's no difference between the
average intelligent scores between men
and women and the evidence around
differences in verbal and mathematical
ability is somewhat mixed I mean you can
you can have debates backwards and
forwards over the strengths of those
differences but the difference in
interest is very robust so why are
people so afraid of that why is it that
there is a set of people out there right
now that want us to act to be all equal
in their minds but it yeah actually
force us to go against nature I mean
that's what yeah that's what this really
is well there is a fear that if you
acknowledge that there are differences
between individuals or groups that
you're saying that one group is inferior
so there's been a like the idea that we
have to be the same to be equal has been
a very prevalent and strong idea I don't
know who came where the idea comes from
but it's it's um it's dangerous because
if you if you argue that no true
equality can be achieved unless we're
all the same then no true then we can't
have equality so however if you argue
that no we are all morally equal and
that we deserve equal opportunity and
the equal we deserve equal opportunities
to live a happy flourishing life however
there are differences between us yeah
and you can preserve that ethical
principle so it's very problematic for
people who think that there can be no
equality between men and women unless
we're proven to be the same
tentacle because the evidence doesn't
support the idea that way the same yeah
what are what are some of the other
dangerous ideas okay so we've probably
we're doing the dangerous roll yeah yeah
we've published work on intelligence
research which is controversial we've
published articles about the hairy
intelligence are you talking about
intelligence and race this seems to be
one that people seem to be all that's
yeah that's a hugely controversial issue
and we've published we published a
defense of the Charles Maurice the bell
curve because after he had his
conversation with Sam Harris Vox came
out and wrote a hit piece or wrote some
some kind of article that misrepresented
what they talked about and the bell
curve and so we published a response
from Professor Richard hire who's the
editor of the intelligence journal so
he's a preeminent expert in this area
and he defended Charles Murray's book
and defended the conversation that they
had and said this is an important issue
it's scientifically valid and has merit
to talk about these issues and they got
they work they got the science right so
we we don't aim to be provocative for
the sake of just being inflammatory
right we we have an objective where we
want to protect the scientists who have
who are doing this work or who are
having these comfortable conversations
we want to we want to protect the
individuals who are doing the knowledge
production or the research we want to
protect them from the boxes and the
journalists who just want to write hate
pieces just to get the clicks so we have
a sort of a commitment to those people
who are doing risky work and leave that
kind of protection you're going to my
soft spot today because as as we're
taking this only as we're taping there's
only like an hour
Vox did a piece about me about how I'm
part of the reactionary right yeah it's
just like you guys yes
so in a weird way your your job in some
respect has become sort of like a force
field to just allow people to do the
work yes that they're supposed to be
doing yeah that's right because
universities for all sorts of different
reasons are neglecting their duty to
academic freedom right and academic
freedom is meant to exist to protect
scientists in particular who are doing
work which contradicts the religious
orthodoxy of the time or the moral
orthodoxy and it's quite clear to me
that there are scientists doing work
which challenges politically correct
dogmas and I don't see universities
doing a very good job at protecting
those scientists and so we feel like we
can fill the gap where do you think the
the Gender Studies stuff fits into all
this because in a weird way it seems
like it's all being whittled down to
that somehow that now especially related
to trans issues I was just talking to a
fairly well-known public professor
yesterday off-the-record
yeah about how he's going into his old
even though he's factually correct that
it's calm you know confident about his
research he's going into old lesson
plans to change wording just because he
doesn't want to deal with the mob so
things that were completely acceptable
three four years ago yes now having to
edit out I mean that's that's truly
dangerous so what is going on with the
Gender Studies departments in the rest
of this ah it's all moving so fast it's
hard to really to analyze what's going
on when it's shifting so fast but
certainly many of the humanities
departments took a turn back in the
1970s and they took they took on these
fashionable theories such as post
structuralism and they they rejected
empirical methods and so when the
argument if we were trying to give them
all the credit yeah
that they're due at least in the
argument if you're if you're rejecting
empirical science or herbal facts what
is your argument that leads you there
because I know people are watching us
going that's just so it's crazy yeah but
they obviously believe it so let's try
to give the devil his due
yes so post modernists have a good point
and that is that we are all biased and a
scientist looking at an issue such as
sexuality has his or her own biases
right and so the questions that the
scientist asks when he or he or she is
designing a survey or designing a lab
experiment are going to have some bias
embedded within them but so that's true
and the post modernist had that insight
however the mistake they make is getting
rid of empirical and objective methods
all together and just saying because
we're biased what's the point right so
they're doing like a massive over
correction yes yes yeah when when what
should be done is acknowledging yes we
all have our bias and if I'm a scientist
designing a study I'm going to have my
bias and it might get embedded into the
work that I'm doing however there are
ways to correct that and we want to
improve our quantitative methodologies
in order to correct for our own biases
the the problem that the post modernists
have is that they say well the bias is
there so let's put it all in the bin and
we're just going to double down on the
bias and just talk about lived
experience I mean that is that's just
taking the completely the wrong
direction right I mean it's quite
literally the reverse of a scientific
yeah so basically they're they're saying
that that bias is truth right I mean if
you're saying bias that the lived
all right so we've been talking a bit
about the tech component this grand
cultural war that's going on I you guys
quill that you're you're a small company
or you're funded on patreon which we're
funded on patreon it's pretty awesome
you have people that voluntarily pay you
to support your content yes you grow I
know how validating and rewarding it is
and all that stuff but you find yourself
often up against the big boys right like
that's funded to hundreds of millions of
dollars by different things and you're
being critical of them here yeah so it
does get me back to something that I
started with before about where does it
come from for you to just be brave I
don't want to I don't want to belittle
that part of it that there's a new
internet developing and I think it is
people that are doing this sort of thing
it's not these well-funded well-oiled
machines that were watching them crumble
you know I just you sent me this morning
this thing about boxes a drive is off by
15% or something and it's like we've got
slim trim companies and I think I really
believe that's the future economically
of this yep as well as in terms of
protecting the ideas yeah so we a pretty
we have a pretty amazing story we I
started by myself and I ran the website
for maybe a year or even a year and a
half before I got my assistant editor on
board who's now sort of the managing
editor and he's extraordinarily talented
extremely hard-working so I'm very
indebted to him for all that Jonathan
Jonathan hey and my other editor jaimé
okay jaimé more yeah okay yeah let's
give credit where credit yeah yeah and
um and my contributors are also amazing
but we are hit now as of 2020 18
September we're getting up to 1 million
unique visitors a month with a staff of
all part-time staff of 6 or 6 or 7
people and we're getting almost a
million uniques a month I am aware of
magazines that have a budget of millions
of dollars
that cannot compete with our traffic and
who have staffs of stuff like staffing
capacity of 30 40 50 people so we're
extremely lean but we're hard-working
and we're nimble and innovative like I'm
very I'm always thinking about
innovations to the business model what
can we do that's different I think just
following in the footsteps of the old
model is probably a recipe for failure
and I truly believe that advertising is
on the way out I know people can still
make some money through advertising but
I think out of it advertising gives you
a vulnerability because now you see
these activists trying to like target
brands if their brand is next to some
content that activists don't like so I
think advertising is just I think it's
Vaughn there's a vulnerability
associated with it and is it almost a
fake vulnerability though because I
always think when you know they always
try to boycott Hannity for example and
it's like all of the people trying to
boycott him and putting aside whatever
he said on that given instance they
don't watch him in the first place and
yet the advertisers still feel that they
have to bow to the mob and I always find
that to be a strange thing like there's
very few people who like Hannity who are
so shocked by something he said that
they want a boycott it it's always
people who hate him in the first place
that don't watch so there's an odd piece
of this that's like slightly
disconnected from reality I think well
corporations and companies in general
are skittish and conservative and they
want to protect their reputations and
they've they're afraid of any kind of
controversy and I agree with you that
these activists on social media who are
targeting companies they're a tiny tiny
minority of the population most people
don't care or buy into this stuff but
corporations is it's probably some PR
person who's like whoa we don't want any
controversy let's detach ourselves but
you know it that kind of
timidity and lack of strength and lack
of spine is not something that is part
of Colette so we very much conscious of
if we ever get mobbed and we do get
mobbed sometimes we don't apologize we
don't we don't we don't give in to the
hecklers veto basically yeah and I
really think it's important for
corporations company leaders anyone in a
latest leadership position to grow a
spine in the era of social media and to
not take any of this outrage seriously
yeah yeah not take it seriously or not
take it I mean I think we've sort of we
have to take it seriously because it is
sort of infecting a lot of society but
maybe not take it as if it's necessarily
right just because it's outrage is that
fair yeah you can say the recent example
an editor of the New York Review of
Books in Burma was fired because he
published an article by Canadian radio
journalist who was credibly accused of
many cases of sexual assault and I think
the radio journalist was like he's a bad
dude but the editor was sacked for
publishing his article within like the
space of two days or something so there
was a social media outrage phenomenon
and it's all wrapped up with me too and
then he's just fired just like that and
it's like okay take some time out to
consider it like listen to the feedback
from your readers or from people on
social media but when did we start
making decisions so suddenly these
important decisions that affect people's
livelihoods that's what I find
astonishing that people in leadership
positions just sort of throw all caution
to the wind and just say okay we're
going to SAP someone because some people
on Twitter are unhappy yeah and also the
guilt by association part
right I mean it's it's possible for a
slim trim operation that you have you
might find out in 10 years you might
find out that one of the guys you're
working with now three years ago did
something awful and then they'll use
that to try to tar you and yeah the
danger in that or that you sat down with
somebody and now we can put out a chart
that links that person to this person to
that person we're in an age of the
internet within six steps you can link
anybody to Kevin Bacon or Barack Obama
it's like it's pretty ridiculous yeah
look guilt by association is manitto
fallacy but it is powerful and we we do
find ourselves tainted and it's tricky
and I think we have to every situation
we have to judge on a case-by-case basis
and and you're probably right it
probably is going to happen but I I
trust my readers and I feel like they
know who we are
they know they're aware of our values
and they can make the appropriate
judgments at the time yeah so all right
so even though we've spent most of the
time here and most of the things that
you guys are writing talking about
what's sort of going on with the modern
left yeah frustrations that everyone
knows that I have like these guys yeah
let's talk about the parts of the right
that that you actually find scary or
untoward or whatever you want to call it
what do you think the alt-right is at
this point like if someone says you give
me the definition of alright what does
that even mean to you at this point well
I consider them to be the white
nationalists that that one in if ethno
state and they're pretty morally
repugnant and they're pretty scary and
they're engaged in some in quite vicious
trolling they send death threats the
journalist Kathy young for example was
one of the first people to write an
article criticizing the bigotry of the
yatra and she had death threat called
into her home and they're they're pretty
scary but I think they're a small group
yeah how are we able to quantify
because that's one of the things that
like I think people are just very
confused that they're making it seem the
media makes it seem because they call
everyone alright or far right yeah
there's this massive group I can only
talk about this in an American lens but
maybe it's a little different but that
there's this massive group of white
nationalists who are coming for to turn
America into some sort of ethnos state
now I'm not saying there aren't racists
of course there are racists and of
course there are bad people and people
using these tactics but I believe it's
just a tiny sliver and then and then on
top of that you have all sort of the me
makers and the posters and the rest
yeah yeah those guys you may not like
what they do but they're not there
they're having fun in their eyes in ways
they're not just the evil racist yeah
yeah yeah
I think a mistake was made back when
Milo was around and I think he you
started using the term all right and he
might not have been aware of where that
term originated and actually originated
with the white nationalists and so you
think you think Milo was using it more
in the way that I just laid it out or
just sort of these posting memes
yeah yeah I'm thing look without
acknowledging the other piece I don't
know if he was aware of where the term
originated or not but it was a huge
error error for people who are adjusting
to shitposting it was a huge area of
error for them to use that label for
themselves because unless you're what in
my view unless you are a white
nationalist you're not on you not a
nought writer I mean they had they the
label I think came about in 2007 and
they I think it was Richard Spencer who
created the Albright journal or
something so it was a big mistake for
people who just want to have fun online
and who want to you know just like push
back against some of these PC
orthodoxies it was a huge mistake for
them to use the term for themselves and
that's given license now for critics to
apply the term on everybody who pushes
back against PC dogmas
and that's really unfortunate yeah but
you know we have to just say it over and
over again like these people are
repugnant and we don't want to have
anything to do with their ideology the
ideal is all ideologies authoritarian
it's racist
it's um and and they engage in very
scary vicious behaviors yeah so
absolutely I will cosign all of that yes
for the record of course this is a
repugnant ideology and these people are
racist yeah the things so I'm less
concerned about that because I do
believe it's a small sliver that doesn't
have real institutional power now maybe
that's going to gain some and I think
there's evidence that at least in
Eastern Europe but some of these ideas
partly as a pushback to the immigration
problems that maybe it is gaining some
power but are you concerned that it has
a bigger institutional power because I
think the stuff that we're often talking
about is because we're worried about
institutional power yeah and structural
power not just that there are mean and
bad people out there which yes there are
Mena bad people out there and there will
always be mean and bad people out there
yeah because my background is so
recently in academia I focused a lot on
universities and the ideologies that are
popular within university so that makes
me focus on left-wing ideologies such as
critical theory post structuralism and
and Marxism if I was in a different
context I might focus more on right-wing
ideologies and the effect that they have
on institutions and I'm sure so you're
given a little knowledge of the post
modernist there because you're showing
that your own bias is a little part of
how you look at things yeah yeah
absolutely yeah yeah I'm sure if I was
closer to institutions that have more of
a right-wing ideological influence I
would be criticizing that more
criticizing those influences more yeah
being Australian is
in Australia our our conservative or
right-wing ideologies are quite
different to America so you probably
already know this but we have universal
healthcare
we have gun control we have a welfare
state so if I lived in a country where
we didn't have those things I would
probably be advocating for those right
but you know a lot of this is context
specific and you criticize what you know
so a part of the reason why I criticize
the what Jordan Peterson calls
postmodern near Marxism is because I've
experienced it I see it all of the time
enacted in academic settings and I worry
about the impact that that ideology is
having on media the law and just the
broader culture yeah are you hopeful
that some of the good ideas that we've
talked about here are going to win out
that seems to be one of the biggest
questions I get at public events now
like I think there is a sense that we've
woken up a certain amount of people you
know this Petersen Tours selling out
every theater thousands and thousands of
people really all over the world will be
in February in Australia in February
yeah um but I think there's still a
concern of like how much worse can yeah
before it gets better
yeah and that's the question people ask
me as well and I the I mean I don't have
an Oracle I can't see the future and all
I can say is that I'm doing my very best
to counter these bad ideas and that it's
it's actually anybody who's concerned I
mean they have some responsibility and I
think everybody should think about
sharing the risk so you know when
Charlie you need these people truly yeah
you know when Charlie Hebdo happened and
the mainstream media in Europe and the
UK and America I think didn't want to
publish that cartoon of Mohammed which
got those men and women killed Douglas
Murray came out and
do it the Reis that's when I came
where yeah it's one of his best moments
it's incredible it's on YouTube yeah
that was a something that impacted me a
lot as well and you know I anyone who's
concerned about the way our culture
broader Western culture is headed needs
to think deeply about how they can make
a little bit of difference by sharing
the risk just speaking honestly in
conversations with friends speaking
honestly and openly in the workplace
normalizing conversations and yeah just
just taking on a little bit of risk yeah
what does that tell you about the slide
that has occurred in the West is this
just a is it an infection of success or
something that we could be so successful
that even taking a little risk seems
awful to people humans are very
conformist and most people are cowards
unfortunately and a lot of what we're
talking about these bad ideas that are
being promoted only promoted by a tiny
tiny minority of people but they're very
noisy loud and aggressive and the
problem is simply the silent majority
not being feeling too intimidated to
sort of push back and if we can
encourage those who are in the silent
majority to push back against ideologues
on both sides both the hard right and
the hard left I think will create a much
healthier civil society yeah but it's
about empowering the moderates to speak
freely speak openly and and and not feel
afraid
like ashamed of their moderate views
right they've also turned words like
civility and moderation are thought of
as bad now you're a fence sitter you you
don't want to murder half the people you
know you're not Thanos from Avengers you
look beautiful
yeah I mean the Larry's people the
people who argue that civility is easy
bad thing and we see a lot of this now
by the way that civility is a bad thing
a lot of think pieces about this well I
would argue that some unrepresentative
of the broader population I know that
media and certain parts of media and
universities have been captured by
cultists in a way and they have these
crazy ideas but I would be careful about
generalizing those ideas to the broader
population because I think most normal
people are pretty chill yeah I mean I've
been enough time in your country to - no
no I think you are right I mean I'm out
there going across the country realizing
that there are so many just decent yeah
people yeah the hysterics in the way
that I said earlier about how social
media has leaked into reality or
something yeah it's making everyone feel
crazy but I am meeting these incredible
people all over the country yeah they
just want to live and let live and yeah
maybe I don't know your feelings on
abortion for example maybe we agree
maybe we don't it just seems that
actually seems irrelevant not a moment
yeah that sort of says something we
touched on briefly right before we
started that politics I was saying how
I'm not that interested in politics per
se at the moment even though this is all
framed within a political lens and I'm
much more interested in culture yeah is
that how you feel about this and is that
always how you felt about this or has
something shifted definitely I've never
been particularly interested in partisan
politics
but I think that politics is downstream
of culture so the ideas that are popular
within a culture then get reflected in
your politics so if you want politics to
be a certain way and to be a bit
healthier and less dysfunctional you
want to impact the culture first because
culture is bigger than politics yeah is
there a danger that we're just in this
like locked culture war now so that our
politics can never get better like we
sort of have this affair authoritarian
leftism and now we've got Trump
these are the cultural fights that we're
having now there's a couple of us in
this spot right but like that if all
politics is going to come for
those two things at the moment that
politics sort of is almost irreparable
damaged yeah look I don't know what the
future holds for the United States from
an outsider looking in it it does look
quite scary
the theory level of tribalism that's
that seems apparent just the and the
amount of hate and distrust that each
side has for the other it's quite scary
I just hope that if the worst happens to
the United States we will always have we
will have outposts where Western
civilization through survives and
thrives New Zealand Australia so
basically going back to what I said at
the beginning it's good to be surrounded
by water yeah yeah we'll be we'll be an
outpost yeah yeah we're gonna need that
much yeah yeah yeah a lot of people are
going to New Zealand and buying houses
there in case the worst happens oh god I
don't want to end on this terrible over
here wait we've got to bring this back
but all right so there's concern about
that
of course like right if you want to go
down that rabbit hole you could look at
all of these ideas that I truly think
are the ideas that could unravel Western
society and free thought and all those
things that's why I talk about them so
much yeah
but there is a counter and then that's
what we got to keep doing so the brain
can bring me home on a positive note
please before people start buying real
estate and you doing or you were just
trying to help the market in Australia
there no no we don't need any help
in the housing market we I'm optimistic
because I see the amount the positive
reception that I get through Collette
our audience grows every month more and
more people are contributing to our
website feeling brave enough to write
their thoughts down and send it through
and the thing is every individual has
joining me today is the founding editor
of Colette Claire Lehmann welcome to the
Reuben report thanks Dave thanks for
having me I am thrilled to finally have
you here this has been like what 87
years in the making yeah well I leave a
very long way away so it's difficult for
me to get here yeah well you made it you
made it thousands of miles you are part
of what I would say is IDW Australia
yeah the diaspora yeah exactly
okay so there's a ton I want to talk to
you bout obviously I want to focus on
Colette and the work that you're doing
and we obviously have a lot in common on
the issues that we care about and things
of that nature but first off you are
from Australia I've only had I think two
other guests that are Australian natives
on the show yeah what's going on in
Australia these days what does the rest
of the world need to know about
Australia I would say that in Australia
we're pretty chilled out at the moment
at least politically and culturally
compared to America and even Europe to a
large extent we have a we've had 25
years or more of economic growth so
people are pretty relaxed people are
doing well the middle class is doing
well there's not so much of a feeling
that there's a zero-sum competition
going on like people are fighting over
scarce resources and you know we
obviously have political correctness and
identity politics a lot of that's being
imported from America yeah how does that
get imported because I was mentioning to
you right before we started that a
disproportionate amount of our patrons
the people who support this show are
Australia even if things are going
pretty well there's definitely a segment
of people that are going something's
either not right or we're seeing the
science
yeah it's true I mean it's difficult to
identify exactly how these cultural
trends get imported but for example
through universities through social
media through traditional media so
similar narratives get picked up by
journalists like the oppression
narratives and and we're seeing with the
with the young younger generations how
their
how they pick up ideology through social
media and through the echo chambers and
the filter bubbles that are so easily
accessible yeah yeah do you think that
there's a geographic reason that some of
this stuff hasn't fully hit Australia
I mean being surrounded by water yeah
far off place from the rest of us
there's probably a little bit of safety
in that I would imagine well although
borders are changing just because of
Technology yeah it's um yes so we're
more isolated that's for sure we're
smaller so we don't have the same we're
not as diverse as other places like
Europe and the United States we have
less income inequality in Australia
which makes a difference and where we're
actually kind of parochial as well I
mean we do pick up cultural trends from
America but at the same time we just
focus on cooking shows and reality TV
football games yeah yeah so when the
article came out back in was it may or
so the the renegades of the intellectual
dark web you you were included in there
and many of us had not even met you yeah
this is actually our first time being a
person yeah even though we've been
chatting online for a while
were you shocked about the reaction to
that article because it really did sort
of level up all of the issues that we've
been all talking about no I wasn't
shocked at all I think that the general
movement this ideas movement and this
pushback of the the sort of moral
orthodoxy that the politically correct
left have at the moment it's been
brewing for some time and someone just
had to put a label on it someone just
had to name it and I wasn't shocked by
the groundswell of reaction to it
because I've been seeing it through my
work with collect there are just so many
people who write to me every day who say
I love what you're doing I can't write a
blog myself a can't put my name on it
because I would get in trouble at work
or in my university but there are so
many P
or who want to participate in these
discussions but can't for whatever
reason and you know they like to be now
be able to put a label on this general
movement yeah so tell me a little bit
about your personal background what led
you to be one of the people that is okay
putting your name on this stuff because
I do think that's one of the huge issues
here yeah we get all the support from
academics even people in politics and
and regular folks who are like yeah I'm
with you and I see the dangers but I
don't want to put my name on in this so
how did claire lehman end up here
willing to put your name and face to all
this stuff you know i i think i have a
bit more of a risk-taking streak in my
nature and i don't feel the same fear
around social disapproval as a lot of
other people so i was a psychology
graduate student and I left my grad
program and before I left I sort of took
a few risks during during my program and
was sort of hung out to dry by the
university so to speak yeah you want to
give me an example of one of those you
sort of lit up when you said it well I I
complained about the amount of unpaid
work that psychology students had to do
in a clinic that was associated with the
university and they weren't happy with
that and I sort of received a bit of
retaliation for sort of almost
whistleblowing on the amount of
exploitation this clinic wasn't involved
in so I I've always said the first time
I took a risk I've always taken risks
when I've have felt that my conscience
demands that I I do so and what led me
to you create Collette was when I was a
graduate student I was involved in a lot
of online discussions with academics in
psychology and we had such fascinating
interesting discussions that were
completely unlike anything that you
would see in mainstream media and I
thought firstly there's a business
opportunity here if I can bring some of
these
conversations to a market and secondly
you know people need to know that there
are there is scientific evidence and
some of these topics and mainstream
journalists and I'm neglecting to inform
readers about some of these issues or
some of some of this evidence yeah so I
want to read the mission statement from
Colette cuz it's it's pretty freaking
perfect Colette is a platform for free
thought we respect ideas even dangerous
ones we also believe that free
expression and the free exchange of
ideas help human societies flourish and
progress quill attains to provide a
platform for this exchange everybody
seems to be afraid of dangerous ideas
right now right I mean that's why this
little crew of people are together for
whatever our differences are yeah I
think that there's a there's been a
conflation between giving a platform or
exploring ideas and endorsing ideas and
they're not the same thing
so I will publish stuff on Colette that
I don't necessarily agree with
politically I don't see the the fact of
publishing and in necessarily as an
endorsement I also am very clear that
I'm going to make mistakes
as an editor Colette
we don't want to make mistakes about
accuracy and if were ever called out for
publishing something that's not
factually correct we will own up to that
mistake but you know we're living in a
time of intense ideological flux and to
work out where we're all going we need
to be able to talk about things freely
and we need to be able to make mistakes
and I think make being able to make
mistakes is a sign of a healthy
environment and it's a sign of you know
it's part of the creative process yeah
so that the the warriors who want to
shut down debate who want to shut down
free speech and argue that giving a
platform for exploring dangerous ideas
is equivalent to endorsing
they're basically saying that you can't
make a mistake and that's that's really
scary because the only way we move
forward is to experiment test new ideas
see see what works and pick the best
ones out of the experimentation process
and move forward that way yeah so I want
to discuss some of the dangerous ideas
yeah or that you're platforming but it's
interesting that you said this thing
about you don't mind making mistakes
because I feel very much the same I will
sit down with all sorts of people I've
done it before people I agree with and
disagree with some people who I really
don't like what they're talking about
but I try to give everybody a fair shake
and what I'm noticing is there's a
tremendous amount of pushback just on
that that's what you're getting to like
the idea that a you can sit down with
someone and separate a human being from
their ideas but also that there's this
sort of secondary thing that I'm
noticing and I think you you get it too
just from the articles you guys put out
which is that if I don't ask the exact
question that someone wants me to ask or
I miss this or I word this this way but
just this this army that doesn't feel
that organic to me is ready to pounce
and I'm really trying to work through
that like I don't spend too much time
thinking about it but it is a conscious
thing like oh there's gonna be this
group of people that no matter what I do
and really what they're trying to do is
chill everybody out so that you'll only
talk about what they're comfortable with
yeah well there are there are people at
the moment who feel that all of the
important questions have been answered
all of the important moral and ethical
dilemmas have an answer and that at this
point in history
everything's been worked out and anyone
who's exploring different ideas or is
doubtful about these moral issues is
evil your party your races yeah yes so I
come I come from a different approach
where like I don't know what's going on
like I I'm trying to work it out with
other people and I want the freedom to
be able to explore in a weird way does
that get you the most hate because I
think I really believe that's where most
people are I think that
why people appreciate what I do here I'm
just being open about my journey and
listening to people and learning yeah
yeah you know and that but that opens
you up from hate from the both sides
it's a lot easier to just stake out a
position and then you only get hate one
way but when you're like I am gonna hear
both sides you know it's why I love
listening to to Sam Harris and George
Henderson to ban you know the biggest
existential questions that there are
it's like yeah it's like if I've
completely settled my mind on this I
don't know I wouldn't be that impressed
yeah my thought process or something
yeah
well you know I don't get a lot of hate
um I certainly have Twitter trolls but
oh wait I sort of don't really notice it
yeah okay yeah that's probably the
simple way to deal with this all right
so let's let's talk about some of those
dangerous ideas what are some dangerous
ideas that have bubbled up from your
writers that you've had to think about
or that you're you're focused on these
days yeah so because my background is in
psychology we tackle issues that come
from the behavioral sciences so we've
looked at sex differences psychological
sex differences between men and women
differences in interests in occupations
so we've published some articles on why
there are fewer women in computer
science for example and we published a
analysis of James d'amours Google memo
written by four different scientists who
have some expertise in that area we've
published on intelligence research what
were some of the results yeah well they
you know they basically said that
something pretty similar that he was in
the ballpark in terms of getting the
science right and his position is valid
in terms of regular scientific debate
there are observable sex differences
between men and women the differences in
interest in occupations is very robust
and reliable so women are overwhelmingly
interested in
occupations which have something to do
with people so caring professions
medicine even law whereas men have more
interest in occupations that are to do
with systems and things so anything
mechanical computer science and there's
no there's no difference between the
average intelligent scores between men
and women and the evidence around
differences in verbal and mathematical
ability is somewhat mixed I mean you can
you can have debates backwards and
forwards over the strengths of those
differences but the difference in
interest is very robust so why are
people so afraid of that why is it that
there is a set of people out there right
now that want us to act to be all equal
in their minds but it actually force us
to go against nature I mean that's what
yeah that's what this really is well
there is a fear that if you acknowledge
that there are differences between
individuals or groups that you're saying
that one group is inferior
so there's being a the idea that we have
to be the same to be equal has been a
very prevalent and strong idea I don't
know who came where the idea comes from
but it's it's it's dangerous because if
you if you argue that no true equality
can be achieved unless we're all the
same then no true then we can't have
equality no however if you argue that no
we are all morally equal and that we
deserve equal opportunity and the equal
we deserve equal opportunities to live a
happy flourishing life however there are
differences between us yeah and you can
preserve that ethical principle so it's
very problematic for people who think
that there can be no equality between
men and women unless we're proven to be
same identical because the evidence
doesn't support this the idea that we're
the same yeah what are what are some of
the other dangerous ideas okay so we've
already we're doing the dangerous role
yeah yeah we've published work on
intelligence research which is
controversial we've published articles
about the her intelligence are you
talking about of intelligence and race
because this seems to be one that people
seem to be all that's yeah that's a
hugely controversial issue and we've
published we published a defense of the
Charles Maurice the bell curve because
after he had his conversation with Sam
Harris Vox came out and wrote a hit
piece or wrote some some kind of article
that misrepresented what they talked
about and the bell curve and so we
published a response from Professor
Richard hire who's the editor of the
intelligence journal so he's a
preeminent expert in this area and he
defended Charles Murray's book and
defended the conversation that they had
and said this is an important issue it's
scientifically valid and has merit to
talk about these issues and they got
they were they got the science right so
we we don't aim to be provocative for
the sake of just being inflammatory
right we we have an objective where we
want to protect the scientists who have
who are doing this work or who are
having these comfort conversations we
want to we want to protect the
individuals who are doing the knowledge
production or the research we want to
protect them from the boxes and the
journalists who just want to write hate
pieces just to get the clicks so we have
a sort of a commitment to those people
who are doing risky work and need that
kind of protection you're going to my
soft spot today because as as we're
taking this on
as we're taping there's only like an
hour ago Vox did a piece about me about
how I'm part of the reactionary right
yeah and it's just like you guys so in a
weird way your your job in some respect
has become sort of like a force field to
just allow people to do the work yeah
that they're supposed to be doing yeah
that's right because universities for
all sorts of different reasons are
neglecting their duty to academic
freedom right and academic freedom is
meant to exist to protect scientists in
particular who are doing work which
contradicts the religious orthodoxy of
the time or the moral orthodoxy and it's
quite clear to me that there are
scientists doing work which challenges
politically correct dogmas and I don't
see universities doing a very good job
at protecting those scientists and so we
feel like we can fill the gap where do
you think the the Gender Studies stuff
fits into all this because in a weird
way it seems like it's all being
whittled down to that somehow that now
especially related to trans issues I was
just talking to a fairly well-known
public professor yesterday off the
record yeah about how he's going into
his old even though he's factually
correct that his calm you know confident
about his research he's going into old
lesson plans to change wording just
because he doesn't want to deal with the
mob so things that were completely
acceptable three four years ago yes now
having to edit out I mean that's that's
truly dangerous so what is going on with
the Gender Studies departments in their
essays ah it's all moving so fast it's
hard to really to analyze what's going
on when it's shifting so fast but
certainly many of the humanities
departments took a turn back in the
1970s and they took they took on these
fashionable theories such as post
structuralism and they they rejected
empirical methods
so when the argument if we were trying
to give them all the credit yeah that
they're due at least in the argument if
you're if you're rejecting empirical
science or herbal facts what is your
argument that leads you there cuz I look
people watch us going that's just no
it's great yeah but they obviously
believe it so let's try to give the
devil his due right yes so post
modernists have a good point and that is
that we are all biased and a scientist
looking at an issue such as sexuality
has his or her own biases right and so
the questions that the scientist asks
when he or he or she is designing a
survey or designing a lab experiment are
going to have some bias embedded within
them but so that's true and the post
modernists had that insight however the
mistake they make is getting rid of a
per Imperial and objective methods all
together and just saying because we're
biased what's the point right so they're
doing like a massive over correction yes
yes yeah when when what should be done
is acknowledging yes we all have our
bias and if I'm a scientist designing a
study I'm going to have my bias and it
might get embedded into the work that
I'm doing however there are ways to
correct that and we want to improve our
quantitative methodologies in order to
correct for our own biases the the
problem that the post modernists have is
that they say well the bias is there so
let's put it all in the bin and we're
just going to double down on the bias
and just talk about lived experience I
mean that it's just taking the
completely the wrong direction right I
mean it's quite literally the reverse of
the scientific yeah so basically they're
they're saying that that bias is truth
right I mean if you're saying bias that
the lived experience is what truth is
then bias is truth you know I don't have
[Music]
[Music]
all right people we are live on the
YouTube this is an impromptu livestream
this came together yesterday because
there are so many forces in the world
that are moving so freaking fast right
now and the man sitting across from me
has been tracking these things like a
like a what how are you tracking these
things like a mathematician like a
mathematician Eric Weinstein everybody
knows you already all right we got a lot
to do here
real quick I'm gonna go back to the
camera over there for just a second so
I'm gonna do about an hour and a half
with Eric we're gonna chat about all
kinds of stuff and then no I'm gonna
keep talking you so we're gonna do about
an hour and a half together and then
we're gonna do patreon only Q&A so only
the Reubens select people are gonna get
in on that patreon.com slash Reuben
report and any people that join at any
level will be able to ask us questions
directly no no censoring around here
great you alright with that
I am okay so the reason I wanted to do
this and we've been we've been trading a
lot of calls the last couple days and
the reason I was like we got to just do
this tomorrow is that I feel like I'm
living in kind of two worlds at the
moment that I've been on this tour with
Peterson for the last you know four
months or so we've done about 50 cities
you've appeared at some of the shows
where I've brought you on and you play
the harmonica and get the crowd going
and 3,000 people cheering as you're
playing the harmonica which I assume is
your your biggest great your greatest
professional joy so far but I'm meeting
quite literally thousands of people
every night in different cities all over
this country and soon to be all over the
world we're about to do 18 stops and in
Europe that are coming together over
ideas that are putting political
differences aside getting rid of it hate
trying to figure out some answers they
dig what what we're doing what's going
on with the IDW all of that then you go
on on Twitter and everywhere else online
and just the hate fest seems to have
been ramped up and it's not just Twitter
I always talk about it in a Twitter
perspective but just everything the
articles of hating this one hating that
one all this stuff with Kavanagh
everyone these siloing of opinions has
just increased exponentially and it all
seems to be getting worse and that
brings me to why you're sitting here
because you came on this show about two
years ago for the first time we had just
met a little bit before that
and we started talking about fake news
just as it was bubbling up and I think
some of your predictions that you laid
out were kind of right and I suspect
that maybe you have a couple answers to
some of the theories that you that you
dropped back then how was that for an
intro well Einstein is it's a lot of
that matches my own experience and I do
think that these these parallel worlds
are very confusing if you've never seen
what I've termed the vampire effect so a
vampire is supposed to not reflect in a
looking-glass when it passes by and in a
in essence the shows that you're doing
with Jordan are vampiric that at some
level they don't really exist he can
produce people coming together
extraordinary impacts in people's lives
he can talk about his disdain for
reactionary movements and it doesn't
change the narrative at all and so it's
some level there are two jordan
Peterson's there are two Dave Reubens it
may even be two Eric Weinstein's but I'm
a smaller fish in this in this pond and
one of them is a fictional character
that is drawn using details of your
actual life and the other is your actual
life so one's just the media caricature
basically but but it's a very
interesting caricature in other words
it's as if somebody has affixed strings
to your hands into your feet and so
every time you make a motion your
character has to move so you have to
start doing these calculations if I say
something a little bit nuanced I have to
run the risk that it will be taken out
of context in my media character will
end up saying something that I I find
absolutely abhorrent and so the goal is
to get you to consider the consequences
of your actions if I tell you that every
action you could take would be mapped to
some consequence that I will write into
a story then you start thinking okay
it's not question of what I want to do
it's a question of what do I want to do
given the fact that you're going to
carry it
so do you think that these even if their
self-imposed constraints have now been
placed on many people about how they
speak and really how they think and how
they act
you think it's significantly worse now
than it was even two years ago well
because right before the election you
had all these people saying oh you know
the polls were off because all the Trump
people let's say didn't want to say what
they really thought it seems like those
screws have been tightened even more so
I'm not I don't mean it just in a
certain context in one one through one
lens things have gotten much worse but
I'm actually in a kind of a different
mood about all of this now which is I
would say that when I first came on I
was quite cautious and I said that this
fake news mean if you will
felt very inauthentic Trump had just won
the election in November of 2016 and my
interpretation at the time which hasn't
changed much was that the people who had
lost control of the major narratives
realized that they needed to buy time to
figure out how they were going to
re-establish narrative control and so
what they did was they created a shell
in my opinion that they were gonna have
to fill as they had meetings and figured
out what they wanted to do and that
shell was fake news so basically by
pushing the idea of all the Trump voters
we're paying attention to fake news
that's what caused them to vote for
Trump right well so you had this problem
which is that when you have to call 50%
of your electorate deplorable because
they're voting for someone beyond the
pale now keep in mind I think it's
absolutely essential that we unelect
Trump as soon as possible so I've called
him an existential risk from before the
election and I continue to do what
everything I can do honorably and
decently to figure out how to unelect
him you were a Bernie guy well I was a
Bernie guy in the sense that I voted for
Bernie and I definitely saw him as the
most survived survivable of the three
major options
hillary-bernie and and and Donald what I
what I felt then at the time and I said
so is that we should not have a choice
between three boomer candidates or older
candidates we need fresh new ideas and
none of these people's experience speaks
at all to me so it's not that I was
wildly supportive of Bernie and his
economics policies which made very
little sense to me it was that he was
struggling to be a decent human being
and he was an absolute maverick like
Trump but he was a maverick who had
managed to survive within the system so
there was a level of trust that I had
with him even though I thought he was
economically confused mm-hmm what what I
believe now is is that we've we've been
shown what got put into that container
called fake news or media manipulation
and rather than it being terrifying I
you know I'm sort of on the fence about
this but I I think I'm gonna go in the
direction of funny like this report that
just came out from Dayton Society yeah
on the alternative influence network had
you ever heard of these people before
this report by the well I'd heard of the
woman who founded it Dana Boyd and I've
actually Co runs sessions with an
adviser of theirs named Hilary Mason who
you know as a top notch data scientist
so I didn't have the most negative
impression of the roster of people
there's some people who I view as very
ideological over over there but I didn't
actually know about data in society it
sort of seemed to be an echo of things
that you see in the Tim O'Reilly Network
or what is it the Berkman Center at
Harvard so it's connected up through all
of the major institutions if you look at
the funders of data in society it's the
sloan Foundation it's the New York Times
it's you know I think it's open society
yeah so Bill and Melinda Gates so what's
going on let's pause for a second for
people that don't know what
this thing is that I think most people
watching probably do but basically they
issued this report the alternative
influencer network and it was sort of
how the reactionary right is monetizing
and extending their influence throughout
YouTube and it was heavily based on me
as one of the people I think I was
mentioned seventy seven times in this
report Joe Rogan of course was included
Jordan Peterson was included Tim Poole
who I've had on the show Dennis Prager
Prager was interesting that he was
included because they included his name
Dennis Prager even though this was about
youtubers but really they were going
after his channel Prager you I think
that's just an interesting distinction
that they went after the man not the
Channel then there was a series of other
people on there that I have no idea who
they are there were real white
nationalists I suppose on there from
what I understand one and but basically
they issued this insane graph linking us
all together that looked like a cap is
six degrees of Kevin Bacon on steroids
and there were there are errors I mean I
know there's errors even related to me
they didn't have me and Rogan connected
three times I mean you ruin the whole
okay go ahead wait everything that's
wrong okay please you know there's a lot
to say about I know well but the thing
is is that at first I thought it was
like the 80s and I forgotten that we had
these channels yeah you know greens
company was on there you couldn't leave
it well the the funny thing is is that
before there was no way to fight these
things like if you couldn't jack into
the network of newspapers and radio
stations there was no way to fight back
so all of these things were terrifying
but I noticed that I wasn't a part of
this graph and at first I had this like
sense of relief and then I thought well
I should just go on Dave Rubin show and
become part of the alternative
reactionary influence network as a
Bernie voter because this is gay
pro-choice pot-smoking against the death
penalty over there big right winger
right you know I mean as a fellow by the
way just as a fellow neo-nazi can I ask
how you spent Young Kippur oh it's
lovely I broke it with bagels yeah
exactly I mean they've got Ben Shapiro
on there saying
either way it's so completely insane
yeah and that it it it really doesn't
require refutation what it requires as a
middle schooler with an IQ of above
eighty and an assignment to say what's
wrong with the methodology of this
report because so far as I could tell
there is no methodology in the report
it's not just that it's got errors and
what's can you explain what in a report
like this what a proper methodology
would be because from what I could
understand in the 61 pages of this thing
they basically just tried to link us
together this person talked to this
person this person once interviewed this
person this person appeared somewhere
with this person for getting the error
is in those connections but that to me
doesn't strike me as a methodology it
strikes me as just it's just human
connections people cross peope with
people doesn't mean you're promoting
them it doesn't mean you're secretly
working with anywhere that you're in in
a network I mean that's what they were
really going for here and I think
there's a bigger reason for that that
we're gonna get doing a little bit well
okay so what could they have done yeah
if you were if you were doing it
properly right and you were trying to
show here's a small group of people that
have created this network to extend
these horrible ideas or alternative we
do have influence and there is a part of
us that is a network so in fact that's
not really where the problem right what
you would do normally is you would set
out some list of qualities
characteristics that didn't pick names
that you selectively wanted to feature
mm-hmm and you would say okay here's
what we did we we came up with the
following rule
somebody needs to appear on at least
three shows we've done this so that it's
exhaustive and and everybody who fits
these criteria is listed on this graph
and look what emerges or they at least
hold certain beliefs right could you do
it that way or is that straight so
you're asking me what just what I would
think would be a proper method okay so
you'd state something that was fairly
neutral that didn't name anyone and then
it would emerge that the network was the
solution to the
carefully stated problem and then you'd
say isn't this interesting that when I
looked for that those criteria it picks
out Dave Rubin and Richard Spencer and
it doesn't pick out
Ezra Klein and Sara John mm-hmm
unfortunately you know Ezra Klein does a
podcast with Sam Harris Sam Harris is
named in the appendix but he's not on
the graph I think yeah the you know Noam
Chomsky has appeared on stefan molyneux
so if you actually put all of the people
who would occur as part of a proper
method of methodological discovery of a
network there would be things that
didn't go your way and then there'd be a
section at the end that says we know
that the following anomalies are present
people who are clearly opposed to you
know you might have Linda Sarsour with a
note on the network right and you'd say
okay why is Linda Sarsour to two degrees
separated from Richard Spencer right and
then you'd have to say look these are
maybe some deficiencies maybe you know
here's some here's some ideas for
further research but the point is that
there was nothing like a methodology and
when you look at the author's
ideological commitments which she's very
comfortable sharing they fly in the face
of facts so that there's no she's not
trying to present herself so far as I
can tell as a dispassionate researcher
she's trying to present herself as an
activist she has tweets from August
since deleted because she uses that
tweet scrubber thing or whatever it is
talking about howdy platforming people
is the answer to these problems that she
proposes we have but pretty clear let's
go down there Dave I could understand
somebody saying look let's talk about
what deep platforming is and let's talk
about it in neutral terms so that it
it's not being used selectively to wipe
out reasonable ideas that I disagree
with there's no pretense there's no
semblance and that's why I think this is
that I have a different feeling about
this than I had expected which is
bringing this on give me more yeah cuz
if you show me who's willing to salute
this report you know is this going to be
featured by the Berkman Center at
Harvard yeah I went to Harvard you
couldn't turn something like this in
yeah into a Statistics Department or a
math department and be considered a
researcher you'd be considered a lunatic
and so if Harvard then salutes this
thing that's going to tell us I'm not an
ideological commitment does the New York
Times support this they're certainly
funding this they're finding the Center
for data in society so we know that the
Guardian liked it we know that Vox liked
it by BuzzFeed Wired I didn't see
BuzzFeed actually yeah BuzzFeed it I saw
New York I saw New York Times reporters
tweeting at NBC News reporters tweeting
it but but did it did it did it occur in
the New York Times because I'm seeing no
they so I haven't seen that I'm seeing
that even the publication's who probably
would like to find that this report is
reasonable no they got to be very
careful because if you embrace this
report you're telling it's so bad that
you're telling people what your
standards are for intellectual discourse
mm-hmm and that's what makes it
fascinating so so you want more of this
because you believe this will hasten the
destruction of the monster we've been
fighting basically I want to know how I
can help them to produce more reports
like this yeah you have to understand
what the purpose of a report like this
is and I think somewhere this is my
fifth appearance on your show sorry I'm
probably winning some whisky for the Q&A
how about that all right the I brought
up this gated institutional narrative
and this is where this report is
supposed to slot in in other words it's
not meant for individual consumption
it's meant to be a sizable report and so
it's got like high production graphics
and hey it's a PDF PDFs are hard to make
like it's not a word I'm glad you fix
the PDF it's logged in so the idea is
you're supposed to be able to hold a
conference let's say under the auspices
of the National Academy of Sciences or
Brookings or Berkman Center or whatever
it is and you're supposed to say well
earlier in the year we have this
fabulous report by Rebecca Lewis at the
Center for data and society and and and
they're doing some remarkable work about
how people are being radicalized and I
think this is very important impressive
and and so you have a big serious
conversation in a closed conference and
the release proceedings and then maybe
you'll allow the public in for the for
the final day and you say well thank you
all for joining the conversation of
course none of those people in the
audience has allowed the conversation
right and that's what the gated
institutional narrative is all about
that if you don't own a seat somewhere
on the institutional network you can't
get into that conversation so you
there's nobody who's going to be in a
position to say you realize that report
would not be acceptable at any
reasonable middle school as a as a data
project so that's what they're some
someone was hoping for this but I think
even for these institutions they're
going to be a little bit wary because
it's so naked Lee ideological and so
piss-poor on on the analytics okay so
when I saw this thing come out and I
called you and I was pissed and I was
like ah here we go again just another
one of these things and I was saying you
know this is just their way of inching
us closer to D platforming it maybe you
think but you think that's a secondary
issue here well one friend says and by
the way thank you for having my friend
Peter teal on oh yeah no problem that
was great yeah we can talk about that um
you know Peter has this this brilliant
way of analyzing things is that you have
something that a powerful entity could
do and then he says but the level of
violence needed to accomplish that goal
is probably not
something that that entity could stomach
well I have no doubt that people are
fantasizing about doing to all of these
people what was done to Alex Jones right
with Alex Jones there's so much
over-the-top stuff that a lot of people
who breathed a sigh of relief thank God
somebody rid us of that terrible Alex
Jones I'm not gonna get into whether
Alex Jones is good or bad
joining me today is an activist and
advocate who co-founded the student-led
gun control advocacy group never again
MSD he also helped organize the March
for our lives nationwide student
protests earlier this year cameron
Caskey welcome to the rubin report
thanks for having me I'm really happy
that you're here for for many reasons
mostly because you strike me suddenly as
someone that's trying to find some
common ground these days and we're gonna
get into that and a whole bunch more but
of course I have to mention up top you
are a survivor of the parkland shooting
in Florida before we go whole into that
and everything that you've been through
since just tell me a little bit about
life before because I assume you have a
life before and now a new life well you
know I spent most of my life as your
typical little shit-stirrer who just
said whatever you wanted to had a voice
I was always so convinced that I was
right about everything whether that was
nature or nurture is kind of up to
interpretation but I really grew up just
dead set on the fact that I knew
everything everything I said was right
and I was a genius I learned the hard
way recently little too recently that
I'm not and that was a crazy awakening
learning that you don't know everything
in the entire world is actually an
interesting experience but one of the
things that helped me a lot was doing
theater I was a big theater kid because
I had this voice I always wanted to
express myself I was you know I was
flippantly loud all the time and do I
didn't know what to do with it you know
I was knocking doors for Obama when I
was seven Wow yeah I was really
interested in you know being active with
all that I mean I knew nothing I thought
that John McCain was running with Tina
Fey not Sarah Palin because I really
only seen the news and I guess I got too
mixed up I was seven yeah I didn't
expect myself to be a policy expert but
you know again I think the point is I
was always really excited to to speak
and I got involved to drama and drama
said hey you have a voice here's a way
to use it and you learn a lot of lessons
from doing theater have you ever done
anything on stage that's cool not in
height
school I did spend 12 years doing
stand-up comedy in New York City which
is a whole other nightmare but I am I
always wanted to do stand-up and then I
tried it once when I was 7 years old I
was on a cruise with my family and there
was a kind of adults-only nightclub it
wasn't really the you were able to get
in if you were younger but I was the
only person there under maybe 40 and
they had an open mic and I kept on I
kept on raising my hand to get on him
but the host was saying know what that
was this kid doing good and finally he
just caved in I was like all right let's
let the kid get up here and and I walk
up there and I drop a 3-minute routine I
make a joke about my dad's penis which
was an interesting experience and the
thing is I did not know that while I was
sitting alone in the front row I snuck
out of my room my parents went to the
club and I didn't see them Wow so I'm
not there I'll say I'll send you the kid
the clip privately I'm out there and I'm
4 foot 3 and and everybody's drunk so
they think I'm a riot so I think I'm a
riot and I just kept going and going to
the point where though the guy who's
running the open mic was just looming
behind me waiting for me to be done but
I guess he just didn't want to grab the
mic from a small child without looking
kind of weird stand-up is probably best
done once at 7 years old and never again
so you're doing everybody's had their 15
minutes of fame when they were 7 on the
cruise yeah all right so so you were a
theater kid anything else we should know
about just like high school life like
high school life for a kid in 2017-2018
like what's it like I'm not that old but
I ain't 17 anymore well you know I high
school was really fun for me I really
enjoyed it on a social level I was a
shitty student my test scores were
always good but my grades were awful cuz
I never bothered to do homework I
thought I was too smart and cool for
that but um I liked high school a lot
because I I never really subscribed to
one social circle I kind of hung out
with a lot of people you know kids who
were the stereotypical popular kids you
know I was just the guy they knew that
was funny I would hang out with them
sometimes kids who were the
stereotypical Nerds we would talk about
movies and comic books which I want to
get into your comic book collection and
I'd say that my core group was the
theater kids okay I love my friends from
drama
and it's really fun having a group of
friends where you'll you'll be hanging
out in the weekend shooting the and
then you'll get to school and either be
falling in love with each other and
making out on stage or killing each
other on stage you know we just did
Fiddler on the Roof and I got to marry
one of my best friends I'm sure you're
familiar yeah yeah there I am familiar
with fiddler it's a classic yeah so all
right so it sounds like a pretty normal
childhood then so far I don't think
someone like me can be created by a
normal childhood but it was a great
childhood I'm very happy my parents
divorced when I was 10 and I'm lucky
enough to have four great parents you
know I've got two brothers and a
stepsister it's a great group well I'd
like to think that that I'm a pretty
moral guy and when I'm the shittiest
person in a family it's a great family
so I'm you have a stand-up comic in you
I can see it hopefully it doesn't come
out anytime soon all right so now bring
me to that day or later this year so on
February 14th there was a it was a
regular day it was actually a really
nice day and there was a period of time
during the day that I always remember
where I thought that he's going a little
too well hmm I was sitting reading John
Walsh's book tears of rage I believe a
familiar I don't remember the title
exactly but I was a big fan and um I was
planning out a Valentine's Day gift for
a girl that I really liked she had a she
had an endoscopy that day and she was up
she was on a lot of medicine and I was
going to give her cousin some gifts for
her and have her bring it to her and I
made her a card that said I would have
brought you this myself but I didn't
have the stomach for it right I predict
you are a crime I better hope sure of
her doctor and put it in the card and
everything and then I'm were in
rehearsal for a musical we were doing
Yale Vikings which I'm sure nobody's
ever heard of I don't know it and I was
we had just finished up a song and I was
doing and I realized wait a second I
have to go pick up my brother because
that stole my Douglas school lets out at
2:40 but the special-needs kids are out
at 2:10 so the parents can pick them up
before the buses come and my little
brother has autism and he's hanging out
there with all of his friends and the
ESC class and by the way the autistic
scene and Stoneman Douglas is awesome
those kids are the best and the school
specialized in that is it like a magnet
school for kids with autism or no but it
has a great program with great teachers
and I actually went back to parkland
this weekend to see them off to
homecoming and boy let me tell you that
squad is wild I love them and my little
brother I don't want to brag it's kind
of the ringleader over there and and I
went to go pick him up because on days
like that when my mom was at work I
would take him to drama and he would
just hang out and he really loved it
because all the girls would give him
attention yeah and you know he's he's a
bit of a cocky little bastard
and um and I realized it's maybe 220
let's say and I were halfway through the
song and I say I forgot to pick up
Holden so we finished the song and asked
my teacher if I could go run and pick
him up of course she said yes and I'm
picking up Holden and suddenly there's a
fire alarm and and I and that was a
little scary because we were close to
pickup and I was with the special-needs
kids some of whom were in wheelchairs
some of whom were not were you know a
little physically disabled and we had to
go to the parking lot where the buses
would come mm-hmm and I said oh no what
if this what if this is a real fire and
I have to sit out here and make sure
that nobody gets hit by a bus there were
teachers there of course but you know
it's a public school there may be two
teachers for 10-15 students who won't
need a lot of help sure
so we're out there sitting in the
parking lot and there were students out
there from other classes nearby who
because again this is a fire drill there
were students out there who were with us
and it was the ESC class it was a couple
of the nearby classes and one of the
kids jokingly said as a shooter I said
dude shut the up that's not cool
because how could that ever happen right
and suddenly I see everybody running
back inside and the teacher says get
inside get inside and I said okay it
wasn't a real fire and they want to get
all the kids inside before the buses
come and then we're told to go in a row
and we're told to hide get away from the
window and turn the lights off and I say
okay someone's going on and that
experience was was an interesting one
because I was in the leadership room
with a lot of the leadership students
which is a class that specializes in
leadership yeah and they planned problem
and everything sort of student
government and it was also the
special-needs kids because it was the
nearest room and some of the students
being nonverbal does not mean
can make noise and some of the students
were yelling and wailing fortunately
they had shadows and the special needs
teachers at Douglas are fantastic and we
were able to keep everybody calm but we
didn't know what was going on and we
were there for a couple hours and slowly
more details began to emerge now I
assume you're hearing gunfire and no no
Douglas is a huge school and I wasn't
now mind you I thought I heard gunfire
but when you're told being told your
school was getting shot up and you hear
anything you might think it's gunfire
yeah but I'm sitting there holding my
little brother has no idea what's going
on and and slowly I realize okay there's
a shooting I heard and people were
whispering around the room it was maybe
20 kids in the room people saying 50
people are dead two people are dead one
person is dead the there were
conflicting stories I heard conflicting
stories of who was the shooter was I
heard five different names one of whom
was somebody I knew somebody I knew
would not pick up a weapon to harm a
butterfly mm-hmm because that's hysteria
and that and that's natural and I
understand it then I saw something that
was a terrible exhibit of humanity if
you ask me which was there was a
snapchat video going around that was
that with the caption yo with multiple
O's my school getting shot up and it was
a video of a dead teacher look if you're
gonna film us shooting from inside a
room so you can have evidence to show
the police good on you if you're gonna
film a shooting in a room and say yo my
school getting shot up and send it to
everybody you know that's pretty awful
yeah and when you're sitting there in a
room not knowing what's going on and you
see videos of people you know and love
deceased and then the only video I saw
was of somebody who had I had cared
about for many years he was a mentor in
my life you start to realize that
nothing is ever gonna be the same again
yeah so well let's pause one sec because
that we shouldn't gloss over that part
where the social media component of this
is so important because you guys all
grew up on this and then you grow up
hearing about school shootings all the
time and I could own oh who this kid is
it doesn't matter I'm sure
Imperius a perfectly fine person or he
or she time but it's like you know doing
that it's like it just it almost feels
like oh that's the norm
thing to do like there's a shooting like
snapchat yeah you know several people I
knew we're just treating it like it was
normal I mean not the shooting but the
fact that there was a video and so I
understand how some people might like to
not like but you know understand having
to see that because they need to
understand what's going on but I saw and
I said how could you do that this is
somebody who is deceased and you're
filming them to show to send it to all
your friends and that's a reflection of
the social media era we're in where
everything that's going on you got to
show everyone so for how long were you
actually in that room not knowing if you
were gonna be okay not knowing what was
happening I think it was about two hours
I could look at interviews I did a days
after and have a much better gauge I for
dad yeah but I would call it around two
hours and you know when the SWAT team
broke the door down there was the big
issue that there are students who are
developmentally disabled in here who
might not be able to put their hands up
and fortunately one of the only good
things you'll see from Broward's
handling of the shooting was the SWAT
team was very understanding and was very
quick to help these students which was
good but when that glass broken the
first thing that walked into a room was
a was a rifle how are we supposed to
know that that wasn't you know us taking
our turn but and I everybody was texting
their parents everybody the phone lines
were kind of jammed because everybody in
Parkland was making a call I mean it was
Parkland it was a city with I don't even
know how many people but it was it's a
small town where there's one high school
it's there one high school there's
around one high school you know and we I
mean nobody should be equipped for this
but we weren't yeah have you guys been
taught at all like are they teaching in
high school like what to do if this
actually does happen if a shooter comes
to a school we had the discussion of
having a CodeRed drill we had had long
discussions about dealing with a shooter
but we had never participated in a
CodeRed drill at least not while I was
at school I used to skip school a lot
yeah
tell me a little bit more about the make
up of parkland because you mentioned
something interesting that it's kind of
like a little liberal parkland or some
pretty liberal area it's
you know homogenious when it comes to
being liberal you know there's a lot of
different perspectives but the majority
people in parkland are pretty liberal
and pretty classic liberal and and
that's why you'll see a lot of the
activism to come out of stoma Douglas
was less you know let's let's I don't
know it was very gun control related
yeah so let's we'll get to that in a
little bit because obviously so much has
happened in the spotlight that has been
you know put on you guys and everything
else and several of you have stepped
into it and I think there's there's
probably good parts of that and bad
parts of that I think that's probably
why you're here right now double-edged
sword yeah
okay so it ends now what you know they
tell you all right you can walk out of
this room I mean sure I can't imagine
there's so we branded like we ran with
her hands up we sat outside for a bit I
was able to go on a city bus with my
little brother's class to the Marriott
which is the hotel only hotel in
parkland and so they weren't letting
parents come no two parents were coming
to pick us up at the hotel okay but
there are a lot of different ways
students got out of the school a lot of
different places they went some kids I
know just ran which was understandable
yeah normally when there's a mass
shooting nearby you run and my brother
and I were at the Marriott hotel and our
father picked us up it took us over an
hour to get home because as I'm sure you
can understand the streets were very
jammed you know I mean after the
shooting parkland was a no-man's land
this wasn't Mad Max Anarchy where
everybody was wearing leather spikes but
it was a no-man's land there was it was
as if time and space had been suspended
the rules of physics and matter didn't
really exist it was eerie
it was seven two days at least for me
that was when that period of really
surreal fear would existed that that
nothing felt real and then that camp
news was there there was you know the
most we got was somebody at the
sun-sentinel talking about our
production of Fiddler on the Roof the
did you in that period and I'm sure it's
very hard to even remember it clearly
did you have a real chance to more
to figure out what happened I don't know
you can maybe let me know how close you
were to maybe some of the students
because it seems like and I think this
was part of the problem with the way we
deal with these things is that we go
from the incident to immediately a
special on social media just attacking
each other and destroying each other
then you guys all get thrust into the
spotlight and it's like whoa this would
be hard on on an adult you know
impossibly hard meanwhile you have these
kids who are now out there talking about
these things these kids need to mourn we
need to figure out what's going on with
life and find some reality and decency
so I I think that there's really no
formula for recovering for from a mass
shooting especially when at a school I
mean enough of happened that they're
starting to develop a precedence which
is a horrible thing but there's really
no where to look you can I could have
hidden away I could have locked myself
in my room for weeks and maybe that
would have been the right thing to do I
could have I didn't know what to do and
my way of coping has always been doing
something I had dealt with some tragic
loss this past year and I had there were
some really dark things that happened to
people that I loved and the way I always
handled them was by doing something I
never liked to have a clear head because
well I think it's important to process
your pain and deal with it I also think
that them if I if something like that
happens and I do nothing I'm never gonna
forget myself i I had survivor guilt why
should I have left that day yeah there
were fifteen-year-old girls that were
murdered and I made it out and if I
could have pressed a button to trade my
life for theirs it wouldn't have even
been hmm well maybe I should say goodbye
to people maybe I should think about
this no I would have broken my finger
pressing it to heart so what made me
deserve life when other people who did
nothing wrong if people more innocent
more kind than I am didn't get to make
it out and I realized while I'm alive
and one of my mentors wasn't Scott
beagle one of the nicest guys I've ever
met he's the reason that I'm a snarky
little I developed that from him
mm-hmm he didn't make it out there and
and he's somebody who changed young
people's lives by making them better
and making them more proud of themselves
so what makes me does what has me
deserving of this no I'm not a very
religious or spiritual person so I I
don't I didn't think there was some
great plan that got me out of school but
okay so after the March during the March
before the March this thing is just
becoming more and more political as you
said you guys are getting up there and
you want to you know sort of have your
moment but there are certain issues you
don't understand where politicians
reaching out to you I know that you know
Kyle cashew has talked to Marco Rubio a
couple of times
I mean how deep did this go in terms of
reaching every part of American society
sure we am we reached out to a lot of
people and a lot of people reached out
to us there were a lot of conservatives
that we were speaking to about the issue
I have a couple friends who went to gun
groups to talk about it sat down with
some very big gun advocates in their
areas not really in the country but
notable where they were to talk about
the issue and the I know that the rest
of my group was really interested in
opening up and talking about this again
I was the shady one in March for our
lives
I wanted to stir some you know I
wanted to cause trouble I wanted to make
I wanted to own the Conservatives the
same way a lot of conservatives want to
own the lives I mean that's what it's
about right now people people play games
where they're trying to one-up each
other and you know I just I was trying
to do that I was trying to make
politicians I didn't like look bad as
opposed to say what can we do yeah when
I went up there and I was we're focused
or anyone saying you know maybe he's up
on Twitter or like you know just just
because you're gonna get no matter what
even if everything you said was
factually right and came from the right
place and all that just the amount of
hate you're gonna get while you're still
young person warning so cannot be fun
my mom is her sole existence in the
world is to make everybody in the world
happy and love each other so she said to
me be nice and loving my dad who is a
bit of a political advocate himself
agrees with me on a lot of things and
sometimes he would tell me to ease up
sometimes he would tell me to you know
be a little bit rougher but he also said
and and this is why I think my parenting
from my mom stepdad dad stepmom was so
great was they said do what you think is
right and don't let people put their
hope
you and I did I let I let people
manipulate me a bit because I I thought
that they were kindred spirits
but you know my parent I'm lucky enough
to have parents who say believe what you
believe if I might you know my parents
are all liberal but if I came home and
said I'm if I came home with a Trump
2020 hat which I do not expect to do
unless some drastic change happens in my
life yeah although I know you're not
thrilled with the Democrats at the
moment I'm not thrilled the Democrats at
the moment but I'm not thrilled with
Democrats at the moment because they're
not being good Democrats not because
they're Democrats mm-hmm but we will get
to that I am but if I came home and I
told my parents that I would vote for
the opposite of what they would vote for
they would say if you're doing it
because you think it's right you're
gonna do it and I'm very grateful for
that
yeah so where do you stand on gun
control generally because I think what
happened was they at the event at March
for our lives there were a lot of people
getting up there and they were saying
things that implied and I think this is
the way a lot of people on the right
took it it's not about sensible gun
control this is ultimately about taking
away all the guns and that of course is
the fear of most of the people on the
right and there were a couple of the
students there was one young girl I
don't remember who said we're gonna
start with bump stocks but we're coming
for all the guns or something to that
effect and that that feeds right into
the people on the right who go alright
well now we're not gonna talk you got
gonna negotiate who like better laws you
guys are Mao Zedong exactly and then
because of that then the people on the
left and all you guys go well alright
see now they don't want to talk at all
so we're not going to talk and then you
end up sort of exactly where we're at at
the moment
it's and this is if somebody told me
this the other day it's a brilliant
point the left and the right attack each
other's worst arguments mmm-hmm and that
does nothing for us but when it comes to
my personal stance on guns there's so
there are some differing opinions
amongst my friends from ours for our
lives but we all we all agree with some
similar things personally I think that
as long as people who are responsible
can carry concealed firearms
particularly handguns in the country in
many situations the country's a safer
place I also think that there is not a
strong vetting process for people to
purchase these firearms and a lot of
people just get guns and a lot of these
people are not the good guy with the gun
because I think the good guy with the
gun argument is just a hasty
I understand it in some ways because I
intended to concealed-carry when I'm an
adult because I intend to have a family
and I intend to shoot anybody who tries
to kill my family and I assume the VAT
even that position right there probably
puts you on the outs with a lot of a lot
of your crew well the outer inception
team you know we all respect each others
opinions know somebody in March for our
lives and this is nobody in March for
our lives but if somebody said I want to
eliminate all guns I'd say okay well
let's talk about that mm-hmm so you know
my friends respect me for for what I
think and I respect them some it's
difficult it's a difficult thing to
respect people who disagree with you for
those things do you find that you know
guys and girls your age are able to have
these conversations without killing each
other there was a terrible choice of
words without shirt but about being at
each other's throats I think more than
adults are right now is that possible
because that seems to be a through line
with you that you're friends with a lot
of people of different opinions I think
we want to I think that a lot of people
who want to aren't taking the right
steps because they're saying yes we can
we can come to some common ground if you
agree with me and there's a there's a
want out there and that's something I'm
really interested in because I come from
a generation that I believe puts
principles and morals over money and
political victories and I think that
we've actually got a bright future now
people will call me an insane Bobby
Kennedy per se that we have a
bright future but I think we do I think
we need to distinct on verse a ssin I
have a lot of friends who who before
seven months ago I would have thought
were racist sexist bigoted homophobes
who want the country to explode and want
to destroy everybody who isn't exactly
like them and then I learned maybe
that's not the case mm-hmm and I have a
lot of friends who would have thought
that I was some leftist beta shill
who wanted who wanted the Communists to
take everybody's guns and kill him and
then they learn maybe that's not the
case I think our generation really is
moving in a good direction when it comes
to smart conversations I just think we
need a bit of a social revolution
they're not a huge social revolution I
love social revolutions this isn't that
a big revolutions cool it beetles you
don't think we're late Miz level yet
we're not I guess we're not hearing the
people sing the song of Angry Men yet
yeah but we we need some we need him we
need a movement towards respecting each
other because look before all this if I
could have gotten rid of the right I
would have and I know people who would
have gone rid of the left if they could
have but it's not gonna happen the
parties might evolve over time
I mean the parties are the parties are
flipping in a lot of ways well think
about this the party of Lincoln is the
only party that currently not the
Democrat there are some Democrats who
are like this but the majority of people
who are running as admitted white
supremacists are part of the party of
Lincoln mm-hmm so a lot of a lot of
switches happen there I mean you've got
some really awful rhetoric out there
from folks like Candace Owens who will
say we'll talk about the Left plantation
look I think identity politics are
dangerous but calling saying that the
real racists are the Democrats is a
hasty generalization I think that I
think there's actually some truth to it
well there's a difference between the
the Liberals and the left mm-hmm
well you're speaking my language
you can't pigeonhole them together
spigen all the right word for that yeah
okay you can't page him home together
I'm a liberal but I think that all men
and women are created equal and need to
be respected equally whereas people
farther to the left will say as a white
cisgender heterosexual male I don't have
the right to say any of that
look you a friend of mine Michael
Skolnik who I've worked with before said
something to me that I really
appreciated which was you can't judge
somebody by the hand they're dealt you
judge them by how they elect to play
that hand mm-hmm people farther to the
left will judge me by the hand I'm dealt
I grew up in a pretty well-off family I
had a pretty easy childhood I could have
walked around my neighborhood without
fearing death which is something that
some of my friends I made in Chicago
were not able to have but they'll say
that my opinion is less valid than
anybody's because I don't deal with the
struggles they do I have an incredible
amount of empathy for people who are not
as privileged as I am I believe the
white privilege exists I don't believe
it's as systemic or
or really structural as people say it is
I don't think the government exists to
oppress people but white privilege I
believe exists I believe that there are
certain situations where I will be where
I will be in a better place because I'm
a white cisgender heterosexual male
again it's not this large oppressive
force that people treat it like but it's
something we need to address and that's
that's the real thing I'm talking about
recently which is we can find common
ground on these issues and not try to
push each other away because in my view
in my view white privilege exists and
people will say well no because in many
situations on the SAT African American
students were given points and Asian
students were were deducted points and
and that proves that that well I got
myself yeah we don't have to go too far
down down that road because we could
have a whole other conversation on that
because I actually don't agree with you
on that but but that's the point of this
yeah that's the point and I'm still
learning you're still learning and it's
kind of a beautiful thing I'm 17 I can
hardly smell my expertise yet and that's
actually the point of the new podcast
I'm putting out yeah pretty soon it's
called Cameron knows nothing do you
watch Game of Thrones I do
lookyou great told me yeah and it's true
I you know I have my own personal views
on abortion I actually I watched a video
of yours you and I have this pretty much
the same exact view I'm a twenty weeks
guy mm-hmm
but I also have not taken enough science
classes I also do not have not conversed
with enough women who have had abortions
my opinions mean jack but I'm
allowed to have them you know it's I'm a
17 year old boy so there's only so much
I could truly say about pro-life or
pro-choice but I'm allowed to say it
yeah and you know in Cameron knows
nothing I'm gonna tell you guys what I
think but it doesn't mean it's right you
know where do you think that attitude
comes from within you because it seems
to me that I think a lot of what's
happening right now is I see adults that
are now afraid to say what they think
and you know they think that the mobs
gonna come after them which is
completely legit they think it might
hurt their job opportunity or things
like that yeah the mob whichever
whichever
right I mean I think but we see boycotts
on both sides and I think a lot of
misguided anger off and but I think most
people need a little bit more of what
you just did there which is I just am
what I am
you know maybe convince me of some other
stuff but I'm trying to learn here I
don't want to hurt anybody you know I
want the government to crackdown on guns
that doesn't mean I want the government
to oppress you I believe that there's a
certain amount of time somebody you
should have access to an abortion and I
think that abortion should be more
accessible just for a certain amount of
time but I don't want to kill babies and
I don't want to oppress women I want the
world to be a better place you want the
world to be a better place I don't know
about about you know anybody up in the
booth but they seem really nice yeah
they're pretty good yeah yeah Todd
McFarlane I hand selected these people
exactly Todd McFarlane wants the world
to be a better place David hog wants the
world to be a better place
Jordan Peterson wants the world we all
pretty much all of us do I'm actually
glad you mentioned Jordan Peterson
because you know I'm on tour with him
right now and one of the things that I
find is first of I meet a ton of people
your age I'd say the bulk of the people
that are coming there are young people
probably probably right around your age
seventeen eighteen into into they're
probably early 30s and it's male/female
gay straight black white the whole thing
but it's very obvious to me that he's
providing some level of guidance that
somehow it seems that your generation
kind of missed now it sounds like you're
your folks are pretty great in your
extended family and all that but do you
sense that there is some missing piece
here that partly I don't know that
there's like some I discussed this last
week with Peter teal that there was some
disconnect between the baby boomers my
parents age and that that my guys the
Gen X people we never had our moment or
something and then we've sort of handed
it off to you guys the Millennials and
their genetics
I'm genetics oh I'm Jed Z actually
you're Wow
whether those are three or four years
older than I am all right oh man I don't
but that we handed it off to the to the
generation of people who grew up with
with cell phones immediate access to
knowledge response are the best and
worst thing to ever happen to us yeah if
I wanted to get to a hospital I can get
to a hospital much easier with a cell
phone if I want to look up a fact
forgetting the fact that facts are
difficult right now active facts are
difficult to find regret is if they you
know I can do it but also I before all
of this I was very very obsessed with my
own image not because I thought I had a
good one but because I wanted it to be
good mm-hmm
I was posting things online because I
wanted people to think I had a cool life
I mean I did I had a great life but I I
wanted people to know that and and it
the hyper connectivity of social media
which is a term I stole from many been
plat interviews where he's talking about
his musical do you Evan Hanson I don't
want him to see this and think I'm
stealing for the hyper-connectivity of
social media is um
is is a good and bad thing but I think
the problem here and I think that you
know folks like Jordan I'm a big fan of
Jordan I'm a big fan of yours don't get
it be good people people like you guys
one of the things that you advocate for
is is conversation and people on the
right young people on the right that I
know and I'm friends with they want to
own the lips this is all about proving
them wrong and saying like facts don't
care about your feelings I agree facts
by definition don't care about your
feelings but there's also logic which is
kind of the middle between the two
really and that's the interpretation and
the insight and the fact where you know
if we if we only based everything in
facts which a lot of young people on the
right do we're just talking about the
past you can't look at the future and
you can assess facts but a lot of a lot
of young people on the right want to
prove people wrong and a lot of young
people on the left I've seen want to
want to make people want to make people
who disagree with them look worse it's
all about making the other look worse
the right wants to show that the left is
a bunch of commies and left wants to
show that the rights a bunch of fascists
and that's a waste of time that is a
that is what is harming our country
right now I think Donald Trump's
rhetoric is dangerous and harms our
country but Trump is is the there's a
symptom of something greater like
President Obama said when he made his
return that made all of my liberal
friends think Jesus came back which is
you know Trump Trump is the result of a
country where the people who love Trump
are loving it more than ever and the
people who hate Trump are hating it more
than ever because we are divided mm-hmm
you know with our rhetoric is is driving
these driving everybody in different
directions that's why you see the rise
of democratic socialism and that's why
you see the rise of
more and more people coming out and
saying things that are stupid because
they have the first man right to do it
look if you say something I don't like I
will defend it with my life I will
defend with my life you're right to say
it but people are mixing being not PC
and being a jerk and and right now we're
driving apart we need to come together
stop attacking each other both sides are
equally as guilty certain sides in
certain situations are obviously guilty
everybody yeah it it's it's it's it's
so do you sense a little more
flexibility on the ability to talk to
people on the right than on the left
because you know that that's been a sort
of big part of what's going on with me
like I get invited to go to these
conservative things in turning-point USA
and I talk about being gay married and
I'm pro-choice and against the death
penalty and all of these things that are
thought of as leftist things but they
invite me we have a great time I take a
zillion selfies with the kids after and
all that stuff where there doesn't seem
to be that flexibility over there now I
get I don't want to harp on this because
I get your greater point which is we got
to get past this sure but it's where
it's what I am
I do see something on one side
especially with young people that has
become more corroded I would say then on
the others here's what I'll say I say
the left cares too much about people and
the right doesn't care enough and I'll
tell you what I mean because they're
they're equally as wrong here young
people on the right will attack you with
facts and in in either positive or
negative ways and they're open a
conversation very often I believe
because they want to prove you wrong
that's what I've seen from that like
that's not a fact it's an opinion
joining me today is an activist and
advocate who co-founded the student-led
gun control advocacy group never again
MSD he also helped organize the March
for our lives nationwide student
protests earlier this year cameron
Caskey welcome to the rubin report
thanks for having me I'm really happy
that you're here for for many reasons
mostly because you strike me suddenly as
someone that's trying to find some
common ground these days and we're gonna
get into that and a whole bunch more but
of course I have to mention up top you
are a survivor of the parkland shooting
in Florida before we go whole into that
and everything that you've been through
since just tell me a little bit about
life before because I assume you have a
life before and now a new life well you
know I spent most of my life as your
typical little shit-stirrer who just
said whatever you wanted to had a voice
I was always so convinced that I was
right about everything whether that was
nature or nurture is kind of up to
interpretation but I really grew up just
dead set on the fact that I knew
everything everything I said was right
and I was a genius I learned the hard
way recently little too recently that
I'm not and that was a crazy awakening
learning that you don't know everything
in the entire world is actually an
interesting experience but one of the
things that helped me a lot was doing
theater I was a big theater kid because
I had this voice I always wanted to
express myself I was you know I was
flippantly loud all the time and do I
didn't know what to do with it you know
I was knocking doors for Obama when I
was seven Wow yeah I was really
interested in you know being active with
all that I mean I knew nothing I thought
that John McCain was running with Tina
Fey not Sarah Palin because I really
only seen the news and I guess I got too
mixed up I was seven yeah I didn't
expect myself to be a policy expert but
you know again I think the point is I
was always really excited to to speak
and I got involved to drama and drama
said hey you have a voice here's a way
to use it and you learn a lot of lessons
from doing theater have you ever done
anything on stage that's cool not in
height
school I did spend 12 years doing
stand-up comedy in New York City which
is a whole other nightmare but I am I
always wanted to do stand-up and then I
tried it once when I was 7 years old I
was on a cruise with my family and there
was a kind of adults-only nightclub it
wasn't really the you were able to get
in if you were younger but I was the
only person there under maybe 40 and
they had an open mic and I kept on I
kept on raising my hand to get on him
but the host was saying know what that
was this kid doing good and finally he
just caved in I was like all right let's
let the kid get up here and and I walk
up there and I drop a 3-minute routine I
make a joke about my dad's penis which
was an interesting experience and the
thing is I did not know that while I was
sitting alone in the front row I snuck
out of my room my parents went to the
club and I didn't see them Wow so I'm
not there I'll say I'll send you the kid
the clip privately I'm out there and I'm
4 foot 3 and and everybody's drunk so
they think I'm a riot so I think I'm a
riot and I just kept going and going to
the point where though the guy who's
running the open mic was just looming
behind me waiting for me to be done but
I guess he just didn't want to grab the
mic from a small child without looking
kind of weird stand-up is probably best
done once at 7 years old and never again
so you're doing everybody's had their 15
minutes of fame when they were 7 on the
cruise yeah all right so so you were a
theater kid anything else we should know
about just like high school life like
high school life for a kid in 2017-2018
like what's it like I'm not that old but
I ain't 17 anymore well you know I high
school was really fun for me I really
enjoyed it on a social level I was a
shitty student my test scores were
always good but my grades were awful cuz
I never bothered to do homework I
thought I was too smart and cool for
that but um I liked high school a lot
because I I never really subscribed to
one social circle I kind of hung out
with a lot of people you know kids who
were the stereotypical popular kids you
know I was just the guy they knew that
was funny I would hang out with them
sometimes kids who were the
stereotypical Nerds we would talk about
movies and comic books which I want to
get into your comic book collection and
I'd say that my core group was the
theater kids okay I love my friends from
drama
and it's really fun having a group of
friends where you'll you'll be hanging
out in the weekend shooting the and
then you'll get to school and either be
falling in love with each other and
making out on stage or killing each
other on stage you know we just did
Fiddler on the Roof and I got to marry
one of my best friends I'm sure you're
familiar yeah yeah there I am familiar
with fiddler it's a classic yeah so all
right so it sounds like a pretty normal
childhood then so far I don't think
someone like me can be created by a
normal childhood but it was a great
childhood I'm very happy my parents
divorced when I was 10 and I'm lucky
enough to have four great parents you
know I've got two brothers and a
stepsister it's a great group well I'd
like to think that that I'm a pretty
moral guy and when I'm the shittiest
person in a family it's a great family
so I'm you have a stand-up comic in you
I can see it hopefully it doesn't come
out anytime soon all right so now bring
me to that day or later this year so on
February 14th there was a it was a
regular day it was actually a really
nice day and there was a period of time
during the day that I always remember
where I thought that he's going a little
too well hmm I was sitting reading John
Walsh's book tears of rage I believe a
familiar I don't remember the title
exactly but I was a big fan and um I was
planning out a Valentine's Day gift for
a girl that I really liked she had a she
had an endoscopy that day and she was up
she was on a lot of medicine and I was
going to give her cousin some gifts for
her and have her bring it to her and I
made her a card that said I would have
brought you this myself but I didn't
have the stomach for it right I predict
you are a crime I better hope sure of
her doctor and put it in the card and
everything and then I'm were in
rehearsal for a musical we were doing
Yale Vikings which I'm sure nobody's
ever heard of I don't know it and I was
we had just finished up a song and I was
doing and I realized wait a second I
have to go pick up my brother because
that stole my Douglas school lets out at
2:40 but the special-needs kids are out
at 2:10 so the parents can pick them up
before the buses come and my little
brother has autism and he's hanging out
there with all of his friends and the
ESC class and by the way the autistic
scene and Stoneman Douglas is awesome
those kids are the best and the school
specialized in that is it like a magnet
school for kids with autism or no but it
has a great program with great teachers
and I actually went back to parkland
this weekend to see them off to
homecoming and boy let me tell you that
squad is wild I love them and my little
brother I don't want to brag it's kind
of the ringleader over there and and I
went to go pick him up because on days
like that when my mom was at work I
would take him to drama and he would
just hang out and he really loved it
because all the girls would give him
attention yeah and you know he's he's a
bit of a cocky little bastard
and um and I realized it's maybe 220
let's say and I were halfway through the
song and I say I forgot to pick up
Holden so we finished the song and asked
my teacher if I could go run and pick
him up of course she said yes and I'm
picking up Holden and suddenly there's a
fire alarm and and I and that was a
little scary because we were close to
pickup and I was with the special-needs
kids some of whom were in wheelchairs
some of whom were not were you know a
little physically disabled and we had to
go to the parking lot where the buses
would come mm-hmm and I said oh no what
if this what if this is a real fire and
I have to sit out here and make sure
that nobody gets hit by a bus there were
teachers there of course but you know
it's a public school there may be two
teachers for 10-15 students who won't
need a lot of help sure
so we're out there sitting in the
parking lot and there were students out
there from other classes nearby who
because again this is a fire drill there
were students out there who were with us
and it was the ESC class it was a couple
of the nearby classes and one of the
kids jokingly said as a shooter I said
dude shut the up that's not cool
because how could that ever happen right
and suddenly I see everybody running
back inside and the teacher says get
inside get inside and I said okay it
wasn't a real fire and they want to get
all the kids inside before the buses
come and then we're told to go in a row
and we're told to hide get away from the
window and turn the lights off and I say
okay someone's going on and that
experience was was an interesting one
because I was in the leadership room
with a lot of the leadership students
which is a class that specializes in
leadership yeah and they planned problem
and everything sort of student
government and it was also the
special-needs kids because it was the
nearest room and some of the students
being nonverbal does not mean
can make noise and some of the students
were yelling and wailing fortunately
they had shadows and the special needs
teachers at Douglas are fantastic and we
were able to keep everybody calm but we
didn't know what was going on and we
were there for a couple hours and slowly
more details began to emerge now I
assume you're hearing gunfire and no no
Douglas is a huge school and I wasn't
now mind you I thought I heard gunfire
but when you're told being told your
school was getting shot up and you hear
anything you might think it's gunfire
yeah but I'm sitting there holding my
little brother has no idea what's going
on and and slowly I realize okay there's
a shooting I heard and people were
whispering around the room it was maybe
20 kids in the room people saying 50
people are dead two people are dead one
person is dead the there were
conflicting stories I heard conflicting
stories of who was the shooter was I
heard five different names one of whom
was somebody I knew somebody I knew
would not pick up a weapon to harm a
butterfly mm-hmm because that's hysteria
and that and that's natural and I
understand it then I saw something that
was a terrible exhibit of humanity if
you ask me which was there was a
snapchat video going around that was
that with the caption yo with multiple
O's my school getting shot up and it was
a video of a dead teacher look if you're
gonna film us shooting from inside a
room so you can have evidence to show
the police good on you if you're gonna
film a shooting in a room and say yo my
school getting shot up and send it to
everybody you know that's pretty awful
yeah and when you're sitting there in a
room not knowing what's going on and you
see videos of people you know and love
deceased and then the only video I saw
was of somebody who had I had cared
about for many years he was a mentor in
my life you start to realize that
nothing is ever gonna be the same again
yeah so well let's pause one sec because
that we shouldn't gloss over that part
where the social media component of this
is so important because you guys all
grew up on this and then you grow up
hearing about school shootings all the
time and I could own oh who this kid is
it doesn't matter I'm sure
Imperius a perfectly fine person or he
or she time but it's like you know doing
that it's like it just it almost feels
like oh that's the norm
thing to do like there's a shooting like
snapchat yeah you know several people I
knew we're just treating it like it was
normal I mean not the shooting but the
fact that there was a video and so I
understand how some people might like to
not like but you know understand having
to see that because they need to
understand what's going on but I saw and
I said how could you do that this is
somebody who is deceased and you're
filming them to show to send it to all
your friends and that's a reflection of
the social media era we're in where
everything that's going on you got to
show everyone so for how long were you
actually in that room not knowing if you
were gonna be okay not knowing what was
happening I think it was about two hours
I could look at interviews I did a days
after and have a much better gauge I for
dad yeah but I would call it around two
hours and you know when the SWAT team
broke the door down there was the big
issue that there are students who are
developmentally disabled in here who
might not be able to put their hands up
and fortunately one of the only good
things you'll see from Broward's
handling of the shooting was the SWAT
team was very understanding and was very
quick to help these students which was
good but when that glass broken the
first thing that walked into a room was
a was a rifle how are we supposed to
know that that wasn't you know us taking
our turn but and I everybody was texting
their parents everybody the phone lines
were kind of jammed because everybody in
Parkland was making a call I mean it was
Parkland it was a city with I don't even
know how many people but it was it's a
small town where there's one high school
it's there one high school there's
around one high school you know and we I
mean nobody should be equipped for this
but we weren't yeah have you guys been
taught at all like are they teaching in
high school like what to do if this
actually does happen if a shooter comes
to a school we had the discussion of
having a CodeRed drill we had had long
discussions about dealing with a shooter
but we had never participated in a
CodeRed drill at least not while I was
at school I used to skip school a lot
yeah
tell me a little bit more about the make
up of parkland because you mentioned
something interesting that it's kind of
like a little liberal parkland or some
pretty liberal area it's
you know homogenious when it comes to
being liberal you know there's a lot of
different perspectives but the majority
people in parkland are pretty liberal
and pretty classic liberal and and
that's why you'll see a lot of the
activism to come out of stoma Douglas
was less you know let's let's I don't
know it was very gun control related
yeah so let's we'll get to that in a
little bit because obviously so much has
happened in the spotlight that has been
you know put on you guys and everything
else and several of you have stepped
into it and I think there's there's
probably good parts of that and bad
parts of that I think that's probably
why you're here right now double-edged
sword yeah
okay so it ends now what you know they
tell you all right you can walk out of
this room I mean sure I can't imagine
there's so we branded like we ran with
her hands up we sat outside for a bit I
was able to go on a city bus with my
little brother's class to the Marriott
which is the hotel only hotel in
parkland and so they weren't letting
parents come no two parents were coming
to pick us up at the hotel okay but
there are a lot of different ways
students got out of the school a lot of
different places they went some kids I
know just ran which was understandable
yeah normally when there's a mass
shooting nearby you run and my brother
and I were at the Marriott hotel and our
father picked us up it took us over an
hour to get home because as I'm sure you
can understand the streets were very
jammed you know I mean after the
shooting parkland was a no-man's land
this wasn't Mad Max Anarchy where
everybody was wearing leather spikes but
it was a no-man's land there was it was
as if time and space had been suspended
the rules of physics and matter didn't
really exist it was eerie
it was seven two days at least for me
that was when that period of really
surreal fear would existed that that
nothing felt real and then that camp
news was there there was you know the
most we got was somebody at the
sun-sentinel talking about our
production of Fiddler on the Roof the
did you in that period and I'm sure it's
very hard to even remember it clearly
did you have a real chance to more
to figure out what happened I don't know
you can maybe let me know how close you
were to maybe some of the students
because it seems like and I think this
was part of the problem with the way we
deal with these things is that we go
from the incident to immediately a
special on social media just attacking
each other and destroying each other
then you guys all get thrust into the
spotlight and it's like whoa this would
be hard on on an adult you know
impossibly hard meanwhile you have these
kids who are now out there talking about
these things these kids need to mourn we
need to figure out what's going on with
life and find some reality and decency
so I I think that there's really no
formula for recovering for from a mass
shooting especially when at a school I
mean enough of happened that they're
starting to develop a precedence which
is a horrible thing but there's really
no where to look you can I could have
hidden away I could have locked myself
in my room for weeks and maybe that
would have been the right thing to do I
could have I didn't know what to do and
my way of coping has always been doing
something I had dealt with some tragic
loss this past year and I had there were
some really dark things that happened to
people that I loved and the way I always
handled them was by doing something I
never liked to have a clear head because
well I think it's important to process
your pain and deal with it I also think
that them if I if something like that
happens and I do nothing I'm never gonna
forget myself i I had survivor guilt why
should I have left that day yeah there
were fifteen-year-old girls that were
murdered and I made it out and if I
could have pressed a button to trade my
life for theirs it wouldn't have even
been hmm well maybe I should say goodbye
to people maybe I should think about
this no I would have broken my finger
pressing it to heart so what made me
deserve life when other people who did
nothing wrong if people more innocent
more kind than I am didn't get to make
it out and I realized while I'm alive
and one of my mentors wasn't Scott
beagle one of the nicest guys I've ever
met he's the reason that I'm a snarky
little I developed that from him
mm-hmm he didn't make it out there and
and he's somebody who changed young
people's lives by making them better
and making them more proud of themselves
so what makes me does what has me
deserving of this no I'm not a very
religious or spiritual person so I I
don't I didn't think there was some
great plan that got me out of school but
joining me today is an entrepreneur a
venture capitalist and author the
co-founder of PayPal the first outside
investor in facebook the founder of
Palantir and Silicon Valley's ultimate
contrarian thinker Peter teal finally
welcome to the Rubin report David thanks
for having me on the show it's good to
be here with you I normally don't have
this many cards for a guest but I've got
a lot of cards for you today are you
ready to roll ready to go all right so
we have to start obviously Rogan had
Elan musk on last week last week and
they smoked a joint so do you want me to
put the joint on the table right now or
how are we doing this you know mine my
number one rule is never to compete with
the Elan man oh you know I would never I
would never bet against Elan it's it's
been like this I've been I was a close
partner of his at PayPal in the in the
late 90s early 2000s and and after
PayPal you know Ilan set out to start
these to the you know both the rocket
company and the the electric car company
SpaceX and Tesla yeah and I think the
conventional wisdom on Elon was these
were both completely harebrained
projects and if one of them had
succeeded that you have to sort of
question it and when both of them
succeeded it suggests that you know he
knows something people other people
don't all right well that is a matter of
luck
I'll keep I'll keep the joint right here
for a now don't compete with you on all
right but look that's a good place to
start because first you know it's
interesting because we've gotten to know
each other a little bit in the last
couple years and it seems to me that the
person that I know privately is sort of
different than the way the media
portrays you so I thought maybe at the
beginning let's just do a little history
about you and then we can get to some of
the controversies and some of the ideas
that you're really interested and things
like that so let's start with with
PayPal since you mentioned it already
where did the idea of PayPal first come
from well you know it's it's when you
start one of these companies uh it's
it's typically not the case that you get
the whole idea fully formed you know
instantaneously we certainly there was
this incredible internet boom going on
in Silicon Valley in the late 90s it
felt
there was sort of this open frontier
open Gold Rush
one of the natural things to look at was
you know was finance I I was sort of
very interested in the cryptocurrency
could there be new forms of money
there's always something you know super
mysterious powerful important about
money it was it was it was the way that
this this was going to change so we had
I think we had this general idea to do
something with security with money with
payments from very early on of the
founding of the company and then you
iterate a lot on how to how to get the
idea out and the the critical question
for any consumer internet product is
always not what the idea is but how do
you get it out how do you get the
distribution out and we spent there been
a lot of payments companies Internet
payments companies that already started
and failed by 1998 there was one called
when one called up other cyber cash
there were you know there's sort of a
variety of these different ones that had
tried to create these you know
comprehensive currency schemes and they
would work if everybody use them but you
could never get even the first person to
start but the challenge was how to make
it viral how do you get something to
work where it's good for the first
person for the tenth person to the 100th
person and once you have millions of
people you have a network you have
network effects and that was sort of the
chicken and egg problem yeah so how did
you guys overcome that hurdle
well we eventually stumbled on this idea
of linking money with email because they
were ready 300 million people in 99 that
had email accounts and and so if you
could send money to an email address you
know it send it to your email and then
you get an email saying you've received
cash and then you'd obviously click on
the links and do the work necessary to
get the money out and so and so you
didn't need both counterparts to a
transaction to be part of the PayPal
Network only the sender could be part of
it and then the recipient the recipient
would sign up as they took the money out
and and then we started with the 24
people in our office those were the
first 24 customers and they sent money
to friends and to other people but gave
these referral bonuses we gave you $10
who signed up
ten dollars you got something to sign up
and it just grew exponentially when we
were you know it grew about seven to ten
percent compounding daily and now if
you're you know and you start with a
small number if you can get seven to ten
percent daily compounding and after
about a month year at a thousand people
by those mid November of 99 by end of
December of 99 it was a twelve thousand
by February third two thousand was at a
hundred thousand by mid April two
thousand was up two million and so so
what did you do look in terms of getting
people to understand the way you could
work with money differently because I
actually remember the first time I used
PayPal I think it was in 2001 I was a
struggling comic I had moved into a
roommates little apartment because I
didn't have much money and I had but I
had to pay him a couple hundred bucks or
something a month for for rent and he I
was gonna give him a check he said
PayPal me and just the idea that I was
somehow linking my bank account to
something on the computer we didn't even
have I don't know if I'm not mistaken I
think I was still using dial-up I don't
even know that we you know had had Wi-Fi
or anything like that but it's about an
idea that this can even happen how did
you train people to realize well it's
this is something that's real and it's
always on its is it normally you serve
to get people start doing something like
that it has to be something where
there's an intense need and and maybe
it's not too dangerous and so the in one
the natural places that started was on
the eBay auction site where at small
dollar transactions maybe $40 the
typical amount and if you send check
across the country that's like a seven
to ten delay 10-day delay it's slow most
people aren't set up to process credit
cards you roommate probably couldn't
process credit cards and so and so you
know but since you could make PayPal
payments with a credit card you could in
fact send a credit card payment to 300
million people whereas they're only
something like three or four million
that are set up to process their like
hundred fifty million people with emails
in the u.s. at the time there may be
three million that were set up to
process credit cards small businesses
things like that so we expanded it by
you know 147 million do you remember
what it felt like as it started
compounding the way you're talking about
like what it was like
as it was growing and you realize like
wow we really have this well you are
you're new you're at the forefront of
like some sort of revolutionary thing it
it's incredibly exciting and it's
incredibly scary and it was a is like
going to take over the world we're all
gonna die and move several times between
you know that those two several times a
day yeah was there any bizarre pushback
from banks or any anyone that was doing
financial tradition that was
traditionally there were certainly like
more than more than our share of
challenges you had a you had an enormous
problem of fraud where people just
figured out ways to hack the system and
steal money mm-hmm and then and you
can't simply get rid of fraud because
you always get rid fought it and make it
cumbersome but it's easy then it's also
easy to defraud so your challenge was
how do you get it to be easy to use but
hard to defraud and that took it took
some time there on certainly banks
didn't like there were you know they're
all the the incumbent players that that
didn't like something new and then of
course it was sort of in this in this
strange regulatory zone where you know
was a new form of payments a new form of
moving money and and you know the way
often thought of it at the time was that
we were in a race between technology and
politics and you know the politicians
didn't like us but if we got the system
the PayPal network to be big enough it
would sort of overwhelm the regulators
and they'd have to accept it as a fait
accompli
so the libertarian party you must have
loved that concept like you were
actually doing something that
libertarians or suppose there was a
early 2000 conversation you know one of
the one of the execs at PayPal said that
you we need to hire a whole bunch of
lawyers else what we what we can do or
can't do else we can't do so we have to
just go ahead and not hire the lawyers
and just just do it yeah now you know
the the sort of uh I I actually I do not
know if a company like PayPal could have
been started even two three years later
so you know in the in the aftermath of
9/11 we got the Patriot Act in the US
and that that attached you know much
more regulatory scrutiny to to financial
transactions to payments that no your
customer rules became much much trickier
and so so I do think that there's a
weird way in which there was an opening
to start a business like PayPal
in 1999 2000 even three years later I
think it might not have been possible
yeah and it's so cool to me just knowing
a lot of your ideology and the
libertarian ideas you care about and
just going ahead and building what you
want to build instead of waiting for
other people to do it I mean you
actually did it and and that's a pretty
pretty great thing well it was it was um
it was sort of the sense that you know
we were gonna change the world we're
gonna know give people more control over
their money we had all these ideas about
you know getting rid of central banks
and creating a new currency we never
quite you know got to the Bitcoin ya
stage of it we'll get to that later but
but certainly certainly these ideas were
you know we're incredibly motivational
in doing it and it is always a little
bit of a contrast from you know I always
have this view on politics where it's
both you know incredibly important and
then in many ways incredibly frustrating
yeah as it's so on it's like the air we
breathe that permeates our whole system
and then it's also so hard to ever
change you know as a as a college
student I started you know this
conservative libertarian newspaper and
Stanford the stanford review and and
there's a lot and it's important to have
debates to discuss things and then it's
often so hard to change things indeed
the the PayPal hack was in a way and
we're gonna stain the world we're gonna
ask for permission yeah you know we're
just tech technology over politics well
speaking of changing the world let's
flash forward a couple years so we're
just doing some business background
first before we get to a lot of your
ideas of the day you were the first
outside investor in facebook 500 grand
to this Zuckerberg I did you know him
well before that had you guys
communicated a lot how did that even
come to pass
not really was the sort of actually
literally the first day we met we
thought wow he for an hour we came back
and we gave him the term sheet about an
hour later so it was how was it was a
fast decision I think I think people
always have the sort of Shark Tank image
of these things the exam sort of you
know super sophisticated pitch and you
could say just the right things right
that's what works and I was nothing of
the sort and he was a he was a you know
kind of introverted 19 year old you know
sophomore between sophomore junior year
summer summer too
2004 and and and the the main and and
and and and the main thing I'd going for
was it was just growing fast they were
they were at something like twenty
college campuses they had about a
hundred thousand people on the network
and they just needed more money for
computers because there was such a
demand for for the product is they were
gonna launch at more colleges in the
fall so as that would appeal to you more
than the product itself just that you
saw engagement was already it was
already working yeah um and then but I
would I would say the other the other
part of it was that there was like a
prehistory to it so one of my one of my
good friends from PayPal back from
Stanford's guy named Reed Hoffman
he started LinkedIn later years but and
he'd worked with me at PayPal in the
late 90s early 2000s but before that he
had started a social networking company
back in 1997
seven years before Facebook and they had
they already had you know they had
social net was the name of the company
so there's social networking in the name
of the company seven years before and
there were all these things that they
had they had thought about doing so I
was gonna be you know
it was gonna be you're on the 1990s
version of social networking was we're
gonna have these avatars in cyberspace
and I might be a cat and you might be a
dog and virtual cat you're a virtual dog
we have to figure out how we relate and
it turns out people aren't weren't
really interested in that they weren't
really interested in since of a
fictional an online persona it was much
more about real identity and and somehow
Facebook was the first one to crack the
problem of real identity where you know
even those always a little bit curated
certainly for the most part people on
Facebook are who they they say they are
yeah for the most part at least so am I
mistaken you're the only person who's
been on the board of Facebook the entire
way out except for mark right right
right since the beginning yes yeah what
can I ask you about that that Facebook
won't get too angry about if I ask you
well just what's the experience like of
being a but you're part of a board from
the beginning of really the thing of the
internet what seems to drive
conversation the most on the internet
well there's um you know there's I mean
it's it's been sir like this incredible
trajectory you know uh where it's it's
it's gotten probably much bigger than I
would have thought possible at the time
you know I was you know I was incredibly
optimistic and bullish on it's certainly
back in back in 2004-2005 I think that I
think that one one kind of perspective
for a lot of the world-class
entrepreneurs is they're not specialists
there there's something close to
polymaths and so you know if you have a
conversation with Mark Zuckerberg he'd
be able to speak you know with with you
know surprising amount of understanding
about a lot of things so we could speak
about the details of the Facebook
product you could talk about you know
the way people think about social media
the psychology the the way the culture
is shifting the management of the
company has ideas on that his ideas on
and then how this fits into the bigger
history of technology and so it's uh you
know it was sort of an academic view is
often that you're like a sort of a
narrow expert on one thing mm-hm and
that's what you do and and what it is
about it's it's much more sort of this
this polymath like intellect to
understand all these different things
the kinds of board conversations we've
had over the last you know 13 14 years
have it's just been this crazy range
yeah it must be particularly interesting
for you though as sort of the outsider
in Silicon Valley and we're going to
talk about you why you moved down to LA
and all that stuff that you've been
there the whole time that it's not you
know they didn't for all the reasons
that Silicon Valley may be what it is
you weren't ever booted off the board or
anything like that they've they've let
you be the contrarian guy there so that
that actually must that's a good thing
about Silicon Valley I suppose or at
least within the little microcosm that
you sit in right no I I you know I I
don't experience you know a great deal
of hostility to me personally you know
people you know it's it's it's you just
you you always you know it's it's it's
sort of manifests in all sorts of other
way so I do think Silicon Valley at this
point has a bit of a conformity problem
it has you know a bit of a way in which
people are
- too much all thinking the same way
it's just like the there was you know
the the Apple I saw this this meme on
the internet the other day where was
sort of the Silicon Valley 1997 : think
different that's the look in valley 2018
: think the same yeah and and so there
is something that's uh that's gone
that's gone a bit wrong even though you
know it's it's I'm hard-pressed to cite
things were you know it's really
affected me personally yeah all right
well I was actually gonna push that to a
little bit later but let's just stay
with that for now then do you remember
moments did you see some markers along
the way where you realized some of this
groupthink was affecting the actual
products where where the actual ability
to create new technologies or new
products where that was actually causing
stagnation because I sent I said it's
been sort of a long road to get here but
you have sort of been talking about this
for a while now and I think there's a
direct connection to the diversity myth
which we'll also talk about what you
wrote you know twenty years there great
right well I I do think Silicon Valley
has shifted a lot over over the years so
I was in an undergraduate at Stanford in
the late 1980s Stanford was sort of a
very liberal politically correct place
but the Silicon Valley surrounding not
so much it was vaguely libertarian you
know it was it was a moderate Republican
congressional district and and then so
by the late 90s I would say to shifted
to being sort of a moderate moderate
Democrat which is around the time I
started PayPal and he fast forward
another twenty years it's sort of it's
it's it's sort of a pretty hard left
yeah so what is it what do you think has
there because it seems to me that if I
was taking the people that I wanted to
be the most creative the most outside
the box the most to look at the system
and go how do we fix the system from the
outside you'd want a lot of libertarian
thinkers that's that's the way I would
at least look at it so you'd think that
everyone in Silicon Valley would be
pretty libertarian they want to do
things on their own and yet somehow in
those twenty years it became the Opera
well it's it's all I can only ask the
question why is it why is it so so long
I think these things are you know
there's somewhat over to term
so I would say part of it is on is that
it's probably the most educated part of
the country in terms of how much time
people spent in college mm-hmm and I
think one of the downsides of too much
education is that you get the most
brainwashed and so it's it's it's the
most educated can also mean that it is
it is the it is the most brainwashed you
know this is perhaps not so true of the
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right Wow when you get back on the
grid you really get back on the grid we
are live for the second time today I am
the guy on the show wearing the shirt of
the show I'll get into that a little bit
more in just a second but I wanted to do
just a live stream just directly with
you guys it was great to sit down with
Ben and I knew that was gonna be fun I
knew who's gonna be kind of cathartic I
knew it was gonna be a little nutty it
was just gonna be a little bit of
everything because after not ingesting
the news since August first about 34
days obviously I had missed a lot but I
also had time personally to kind of work
on some things I wanted to work on clear
out some space in my brain
there was a one-week period so actually
the last week so all of last week before
I got back on ended up being a workweek
I wasn't on my computer and I was and
you know I wasn't doing anything
obviously on social media or emailing or
that kind of stuff but I was taking a
couple phone calls and we were doing a
lot of work here because as of today we
launched a new website Dave Rubin comm
which we had been trying to get for at
least 10 years maybe 15 years there's a
Dave Rubin in the middle of the country
somewhere who had this family website
but he slowly wasn't using it or he was
using a less and less over the course of
a couple years we're finally able to get
that from him so we now have Dave Rubin
comm so all things Rubin report you can
still go to Rubin report comm it's gonna
send you over to Dave Rubin comm and all
things Rubin report will be there you
can find out more about the show you can
also find out my live events I'm back
into stand-up again I'm on tour with
Petersen actually I leave tomorrow
morning to head out to Rochester
tomorrow then Long Island my home island
on the six then we're up in Connecticut
then on the eighth I'm doing an event in
New York City with with faysville Muhtar
who's been on the show and with Eric
Weinstein a couple other people I think
Melissa Chen is hosting that one anyway
there's just a ton of stuff going on it
was just incredible to be away for a bit
you know like I saw a couple people on
Twitter I'm actually only looked at my
Twitter mentions once or twice today but
I saw a couple people like oh how can
you say you're like a news person or in
the news or whatever and take time off
from all of this like you know
it's not possible and it's like actually
I feel I feel more clear on things now I
sense like a little bit of clarity with
some things and I think getting away
from the noise is as important is as
important as being part of it all the
time and I think everyone could use a
little bit of an escape more I think
part of the problem right now is that we
don't have enough escape so yeah so
launched a new website we redid the set
which was a tremendous amount of work so
we wanted the set to look a little bit
more like my my house itself we want it
to be a little more a little more slim
and trim America we've jumped to the
wide shot for a second is that possible
while we're doing this so we look giving
me a signal we can't do it okay we can't
do it that's alright all right well what
we're gonna do is I'm gonna talk a bit
about patreon in a second and we'll do
some behind the scenes video stuff on
patreon that'll that'll show you that
we're gonna do a picture we're gonna do
a picture okay yeah so we wanted to set
just to feel a little more a little more
minimal I love the set that we had
before we had it for about two years but
it's good to just freshen things up so
we've got new artwork on the wall the
picture that is behind me and behind the
guest or done by cailin rosa janet who's
done a bunch of artwork for us and i
have a lot of her art in my house these
shelves right here I don't want to brag
people all right you can bring it back
to her you know yeah either way the
shelves over there don't want to brag
but they are from Ikea and I do have a
bunch of them in my house in the middle
of the thing there we've got some of my
old stand up tapes from the late 90s
we've got every book that is now on the
set by the way is a book of a guest of
the Rubin report we thought that was
pretty cool before we had a mix of just
some other people who have influenced me
in things we have new carpet new table
new chairs we changed some lighting
things so basically it was just like a
big reinvestment in all the things that
we're doing here I think it's good to
just say I think it's good to reinvest
in things I think it's good visually
just to mix things up and I think I just
wanted I just felt like doing something
fresh after taking a big a big break
like this so a new website new set you
may have noticed we have a new theme
song so I found so one of the things I
was doing when I was off the grid
was I was listening to a lot of music
and I've lately really really been into
non vocal music so just you know like
music but no singing no words I get it
you love a girl you lost a girl okay
it's all good so I've really been into
synth Wave lately which I really liked I
always like these sort of long melodic
sort of futuristic II but kind of 80s
throwback music interludes that you know
the movie oblivion I really love the
soundtrack Tron the movie I love the
soundtrack you know there's a bunch of
this stuff out there so I was really
into synth wave and I came across this
guy Marvel 83 and I just loved
everything the guy was doing it was just
while I was away
it was just speaking to me the tenor of
it the tone of it it felt like sort of
real but also thoughtful and decent so
there was a song by him which you can
check out on YouTube later called Venice
Beach and that was the song that I
really wanted to be the theme song and
we laid it in a couple of times we
couldn't get it quite right so we ended
up going with another song called
every evening which I did just as much
and he's kind of sampling his own song
from that and he's a great guy and we
chatted a bit he's in the Czech Republic
so Marvel 83 if you're watching thank
you for the for the song so we
reinvested in all that and as you can
see we have a new graphics package so
the the video that you saw when we came
in and the lower thirds as we call them
in the guest name pop up and swipes and
all kinds of other stuff is all new but
the real big thing and then I'll take
your questions and I'll talk a little
bit more about being off the grid and
that kind of stuff the real big thing
that we relaunched today was we
relaunched our patreon now we got on
patreon in June I think of 2016 and I we
were basically the first of these sort
of political talk show things to be on
patreon it was a lot of video game
things it was a lot of more anime stuff
I don't know that kind of thing and we
jumped in and and I've told the story
before but the night before we launched
and we had we had left our jobs at aura
TV
we left our salaries and insurance and
the whole thing I said to David and Amir
I was like look this thing could go bust
tomorrow like maybe we really just
screwed up and I don't think we did but
we shall see and within hours of
launching we realized that we
gonna be okay and the show has grown
exponentially since then we've expanded
the team we just had another hire
actually over the summer which is thanks
to you guys on patreon so we just hired
Helen who is now my assistant and
assistant to the Rubin report and she's
just great and I'm sure you guys will
meet her at some point as well and and
we're still looking to expand beyond
that with some graphics people and some
other things so the show has just grown
and grown and grown and I'm really proud
of what we've built and what we realized
though was we wanted to clean up patreon
because we were in so early that we did
some things that maybe we wanted to do
differently you guys know I do this day
I do an 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. day once
a month where I do these one on mostly
one-on-one chats with people who are the
very high tier people and we realized
that because I'm on tour with Jordan
Peterson now and this is basically we're
rolling into 2019 on this I'm about to
do another like 50 stops with him 16 in
Europe which is all on Dave Rubin calm I
don't think the European stuff actually
is there yet because we're finalizing I
might miss one or two in the middle but
we've got all our dates on there and
stand-up dates and all that but the
point is we're expanding we're building
everything we're doing and we felt that
I was just I didn't have as much time to
do the one-on-ones and we wanted to
change the tiers so in many cases if you
are on patreon and you're one of our
patrons you are now getting more for
less we're going to try to make the live
streams and the AMA is this kind of
thing a little bit bigger and more
engaging but also one of the things that
I really realized when when we were off
the grid was that look everyone looked
the Internet's great social media it's
all good you know we can complain about
it all the time and obviously we all
have issues with it and people are
seemingly acting crazy and behaviors
online or leaking into real life and
okay all that stuff but I do think that
overall the the conversations that are
happening this is a net good I still
think it's a net good but the trolls and
the haters not even the trolls as much
but just like haters and just all that
stuff are just ransacking everything
they're just like going through and
destroying everything so our feeling was
if we can build some real community on
patreon where for you know a couple
bucks you can get in and you know we
post all our videos there you can chat
with people who you might agree with my
disagree with but do it in somewhat of a
Praful manner and if you won't do that
we'll just return your money and that's
it we thought it would be a cool thing
to do so that's why we launched Rubin
select and we posted a video this
morning all about that so you know since
we launched originally on patreon as I
said back and I think June of 2016 we
really haven't done I think maybe one
other time we did a real push for it but
we do want people to know about it today
because by being on patreon you guys
have allowed me to say no I said no to
at least three networks in the last
three in the last year that wanted me to
join and be part of things I've said no
to bigger money offers a whole series of
other things because I'm controlling
what we do here and we've got a great
small business and as that as I said
we're expanding and that really is
because of you guys
so here's what I do so anyone if you go
to patreon.com slash rubin report right
now anyone that donates any amount will
get a live shout-out on the stream right
now I've got a handy iPad here with all
sorts of questions and a bunch of other
things so Reuben report comm slash
patreon and donate any amount right
there and you're gonna get a live shout
out and then we are going to oh I'm
sorry it's not any amount it's level 1
or above you'll understand it when you
get there level 1 or above I'm gonna
give you a shout out if I did any amount
it would be completely insane I'd be
screaming my head off all for the next
five hours so or if you increase up to
level one and then let's just see I want
to get this all straight okay if you
join level 5 or above while I am live
right now I will Skype with you as a
thank you after this show that's right
I'm devoting the whole day to it today
and then I head back out on the road so
if you donate to level 5 or above you're
gonna get a Skype one-on-one video thank
you from me to day I promise you that
couple just came in John and Ben thank
you very much and if you so level 1
you're gonna get a verbal shout-out
level 2 okay why am I wearing this shirt
so this was our original patreon
exclusive t-shirt so only people who are
at that the the t-shirt level of patreon
for the last two years have this shirt
it's kind of fun because I see it out in
the Petersons crowd sometimes people
have worn it
to to stand-up shows and wherever else
I've seen one or two on the street I saw
one at the mall the other day so if you
donate but we're not using these shirts
anymore because now our new patreon
shirts are Ruben select shirts so these
are the old shirts we've got a bunch
left over so there's a limited amount
cuz we're not going to be printing any
more of them so if you donate now while
I am live at level or level two or above
you are gonna get the original Ruben
report patreon t-shirt that's right
we're gonna send that to you and the
select members are getting the new
t-shirt that's at a at a higher level
shout-out to Jack okay alright so I want
to make this a little bit about that
kind of fundraising and talking about
that but I also want to answer your
questions I know you guys have a lot of
questions about about the off-the-grid
thing and just catching up on everything
and everything else so let's go let's
just start doing some stuff and I'm
gonna go to patreon first though I will
jump in on super chat as well when is
Kanye West coming on the show I am
pretty sure it's gonna happen like just
give me a little time on it it's one of
these things that's out there in the
universe this guy operates in the
universe we're gonna make it happen at
some point yo Dave where do you get your
shirts your dress shirts I think they're
awesome
so most of my dress shirts I'm hesitant
to say it because then everyone's gonna
start wearing them and then it won't
look as cool but most of my dress shirts
are Ted Baker which you there are Ted
Baker stores I think they're in
Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's but I've got
about five of those on rotation that I
that I really do dig and I know people
really like them but please don't wear
them all over the place because then
then it won't be special anymore and
that's obviously very important Rueben
always seems to come back on the grid
around my birthday 9/5 happy birthday to
you please interview Michael knows I'd
be happy that Michael on the show I
think there was some discussion about it
before I got off the grid we'll make it
happen
we've got some great shows coming up by
the way we've already booked out
basically through October because of my
troubles are so crazy we had to get
ahead of the 8-ball here our guest next
week probably is the biggest get we've
ever had we've been in the works on this
thing for gosh eight months or so we
were supposed to have this person on in
May
then there was a little hiccup but next
week it's probably our biggest get yet
and I think sort of what will be viewed
as a game-changing interview so I'm
super psyched about that as I said I
head to Rochester tomorrow then Long
Island and Connecticut then I come home
for that interview then I head out to
four different cities in Florida with
Peterson then I actually have a couple
days at my parents house then I'm down
in Grand Rapids we're all over the place
so a lot lots happened and lots
happening here remember you're gonna get
a shout out if you join a level two or
above you're gonna get a shout out right
now like Jonathan you just got a shout
out my friend thank you very much and if
you jump in at level five or above
you're gonna get a Skype thank you from
me right now and by the way the whole
point of creating reuben select as i
said not only do i want to create
community there where you can actually
chat and engage with and respond to
people without just the endless noise
look that things always going to exist
look this is the beauty this is the
catch-22 of the internet right we we put
all of these things out there or I don't
know we put them out there all of these
things got out there Twitter Facebook
MySpace
Friendster all of these social media
things and we never knew exactly what we
were doing and we started being friends
with our co-workers and then you know
connecting with someone from 20 years
ago who then you were never going to
connect with again after one connection
and all of these things and it just
became this like giant cacophony of
craziness and I know how many of you
care about these issues that we talked
about on the show just as much as I do
and I think by creating a little home a
little space for that and by throwing a
couple bucks in its going to eliminate
99% of the haters I mean that's the
irony the the ante to get in the game is
so low because you can create a zillion
burner accounts on Twitter and just a
million anonymous accounts and the bots
have been ramped up and all of that
stuff that is ruining a lot of the
goodness and it's making good people
crazy so I really wanted to try to
create or at least foster an atmosphere
where people would be able to have good
conversations and my guys will be in
there furthering the conversations I'm
gonna jump in you know when I'm on the
plane and I have time and I'll be
checking in with you guys and responding
and all that good stuff
and so the level 5 tier that we have on
Rubin select now
the Google hangout so I used to be doing
all these one-on-ones and a couple
groups we've expanded the group Google
Hangouts to a bunch of them I think
there are a hundred slots total and we
do groups of 20 and then groups of 10
and groups of 5 depending on how much
you donate and I have to tell you they
have been amazing I mean the the last
two years that I've been able to once a
month talk to a group of you guys from
all over the world sometimes I'm talking
to people from Australia and Mexico and
Japan and Brazil all in one group and
people have gotten to know each other
it's also helped me frame some of my
ideas because when you talk to people
all over the world and they're every
gender and sexuality and religion and
all that and you go wow we're all kind
of thinking about the same stuff it
really makes you see how actually small
the world is and and and that we can all
care or be concerned about the same
things it's pretty great Molly welcome
aboard thank you very much Michael how
you doing my friend all right let's see
do you see any viable way back to
civility for a political party that is
called the other side and it's 30
percent of voters Nazis so Ben and I
touched on this a little bit earlier
it's gonna be tough man there's a fly in
here a fly has made its way into the new
Rueben report set it's going to be very
tough if your if your strategy and your
go-to move is always to say that the
other people do this because they're
racist it's hard to back out of that
right and this is where the Democrats
find themselves it seems pretty clear to
me after talking to Ben that there was
no backing away from that that if
anything it's just gotten worse so I
don't know how much worse it has to get
I mean this is this is the million
dollar question how much worse does this
sort of collectivist leftist
monster have to get before it implodes
now look it could implode if they do
really badly in the midterms it could
start imploding but I don't want to talk
hey I'm Ben Shapiro and welcome to a
very special edition of the Reuben
report one Jew replacing another joining
me today on his new set after thirty
four glorious days off the grid is the
host of the Reuben report Dave Rubin
welcome back and I'm sorry dude
Shapiro I feel like I'm in the twilight
zone right now
truly I really do I mean first time
you're hosting my show we're on a new
set here new chairs new carpet new table
new art do everything I have no idea
genuinely genuinely I have no idea
what's going on in the world since yeah
August first I know one thing that I
found out two days ago because my dad
could not control himself in an idiotic
phone call so I know one thing I suspect
it's a pretty big thing that that has
happened I know you have a list I have a
list of 20 things here 20 things you
missed during the last month because as
we all know one month of time in Trump
world is actually seven years of regular
time so but let's talk first about like
what it was like to actually be off the
grid for for 34 days so I do it like
once a week but you did it for 34
straight days which has got to be both
wonderful and also now you have to feel
like you just jump directly into a
cesspool of crap
well I haven't jumped in yet I think I
will assure you there is no cesspool of
crap right there
I mean first time I just I feel great I
genuinely mean that like as I think
because a minute with a little bit of
runway here and then you're gonna you
know take us off into the ditch but like
just in terms of like how I feel as a
human being right now my mind feels
clear I feel good I feel positive I feel
very grateful for the things that I have
oh this last month I mean really I don't
know that I heard the word Trump more
than three times truly like you know how
every conversation now that anyone has
anywhere and I'm not even just talking
about the world we live in but just
everywhere people talk about Trump all
the time talking about politics all the
time everyone thinks World War 3
starting tomorrow where the Russians are
just like this endless like rancor
monster of insanity
and I didn't have any of it for a month
I'm telling you that every interaction
that I had with the human being since
August 1st and
today's September 4th was good it was
decent weather I was talking to cashiers
or waitresses or the girl at the
hardware store who I've told you about
who every time at this local hardware
store I go to she always goes Oh Dave I
love you but I really love that ben
shapiro it turns out that the hardware
store is closing and i said to her the
other day i said well good luck and
whatever you're gonna do when she was
like don't worry about it i'm going to
grad school now and it was just like
talking to different people and i try to
do all that anyway and not be online all
the time and not focus on the hate and
all that monstrosity but i just i feel
freaking clear man I really do and I'm
psyched that we that we did all these
changes around here and beautiful yeah
thank you for coming in and doing this
you know the guy who read The Game of
Thrones books and then was waiting for
the rest of the world to catch up on the
red wedding this is gonna be the Reg
it's pretty wild but first I want to ask
you about like how hard was it to
actually you know shut yourself off to
actually put that phone in that safe
because yeah man I do it once a week but
you know the rest of the week I find
myself with the phones in my pocket I'm
checking Twitter almost as a reflex at
this point how hard was it to actually
put it down for a month
well first off I I want to give a little
credit to the Orthodox Jews out there
because perhaps this Shabbat thing has
well I guess it's not just the Orthodox
thing but has figured something out with
getting off technology well done God
because yeah so here's one for God right
because look I do I try to do the
weekends off in general but I struggle
with it sometimes and a lot of times if
I'm on the road you know I've been on
the road with Peterson for the last
couple months so like if I'm on the road
it's like yeah what else am I going to
be doing you know I can visit some
tourist stuff and have some dinners or
whatever but I'm feeling around it you
know I did this thing last month last
year last August and it was it was
basically you know the first couple days
you've owned it's your pocket all the
time like literally you feel your phone
there or you get those phantom
vibrations all of that stuff and you
feel like you need it or you know what I
noticed was weird like if you're just if
I was just waiting for somebody like
when's the last time you just like
waited on a corner yeah for somebody you
automatically look at your phone yeah
you don't just stand there even for 10
seconds you don't just stand there and
kind of like
around or people watch or just think or
look at the sky or anything you
literally just go to your phone that
moment so that sort of thing I noticed
that in the moments of quiet where I was
doing nothing if I was in-between things
but even if I was taking a I'm on
my phone usually I am and I suspect what
everyone's doing it but guess what I was
pooping phone free and then you have
moments to think I mean I know this all
sounds having by pooping phone free in
them but I'm sorry that we did this but
well it just look even this like
avoiding the news in general is also
work because what I realized is when
you're off this for a little while we
are slammed with this nonsense all the
time and when I say nonsense I don't
mean the important things that I think
you and I and a bunch of other people
are trying to talk about and trying to
deal with the difficult questions of the
day and I'm sure we're gonna get into
some of that but just the endless 24
hour news cycle of just drivel that
keeps everybody angry at each other and
and confused about truth and distracted
and clicking and all that even avoiding
CNN when you're not looking at
television and don't have a phone was
hard CNN is wherever a muted television
is period it's everywhere airports
it's at the gym it's at the local you're
gonna go to a burger joint it's playing
or a diner or whatever everywhere I went
to get my car tuned up its playing in
the lobby there and I had to literally
avoid watch you know because there
everything's breaking news and none of
its really breaking they're actually
breaking news but you know you I had to
actually avoid that so I was at the gym
and they have all these TVs up there and
I had to literally do cardio with my
head down because I didn't even want oh
boy that so we're just like slammed with
all of this stuff and I think when you
step away from it a little bit that I
know you're very excited to get me back
in but when you step away from a little
bit it does give you a little
perspective and I was also thinking
about things like I mean as I said every
interaction I had was positive like this
idea that we live in this country of
like endlessly racist evil people when
you're out there actually talking to
real people you know and again I do this
I tried to do as much of this as I can
normally but when were also in this
digital thing
it's like it's not like that people are
good people want the same thing yeah
like I so fundamentally believe that and
I I've always believed it but I really
really believe it now I used to think
that the hope for the country rested and
you know the 40% of the population that
was following this stuff closely and the
more I viewed the stuff now I'm starting
to think that the future of the country
rests with the 60% who really do not
follow this stuff closely well that's
the thing it's like well what do you do
then because part of me literally like a
week ago and I knew I was about to come
back I was like man like I ever come
back fine else to do I wanted to be in
the NBA like why I'm saying else you
know and not that you I mean you know
how much like you really know how much I
love this and like I think what we're
doing is so important and I think I'm a
better person now and all this stuff and
and after being on tour with Peterson
for months where for months I've been
performing in front of thousands of
people every night and it's this great
love fest of people who are getting
their lives together and disagree on
what the marginal political issues are
but like all of that greatness and it's
like I could see because of because of
all the evil that is out there and when
I say evil I mean just like the hate and
all the people that want to keep you
clicking and angry and distracted and
and fighting with everybody I could see
why a lot of good people that we really
need would just be like I'm out
altogether
I'm never gonna post again and I'm never
gonna read this you know and and that's
a real problem because then if we push
out all the good people now you have the
middle majority that's endlessly just
being slammed by one side dare I say
that's partly why I think this whole
intellectual dark web thing has has
taken root and has some meaning now it's
because I think for all of our
differences which we've discussed many
of them including abortion and death
penalty and a whole bunch of other
things it's like we're trying to
basically live in the same society
together and and not hate each other for
whatever those differences are and as I
said to you last time you were you were
sitting here it's like on something like
abortion where we disagree it's like you
know what hopefully for the next 50
years we'll do this and then maybe when
I'm a little older than you so I'm 92
and where are you gonna be in 50 years
I'll be 84 and you're 84 like maybe one
of us will have moved one of us one way
or another
you're looking at me going Ruben you're
not gonna move me but you know who knows
what happens over the course of time but
the only thing that will allow that and
we're looking you like I don't know if
me alive that's why I would recommend a
digital detailed you I feel better my
heart feels better my head feels better
I know this is a little corny but I I
genuinely do feel that way and I was
also just making me want to reinvest in
everything I'm doing that's why we have
a new set now and a new website and all
this it's like I really like I believe
in this thing and I want to sort of take
now these pieces that I just absorbed of
the world over the last month and now
apply them to all this stuff like you're
so calm and your talk about time Shapiro
and now I'm going to take a bunch of
torture okay here let's go to work my
friend mmm-hmm I mean this is the you
know you were promised a tsunami of news
and so it shall be so alright so I knew
of the story yeah
what was the last thing that you saw in
the news okay let's go over Lebanon so
the last thing that I know of was the
day that I got off the shut down
everything the last thing that I heard
was that the New York Times hired that
writer the the female Asian writer and
apparently she had tweeted a lot of anti
white rain so Jon yeah yeah so I know
nothing print for all I know she doesn't
have a job now she does have a job she
has a big job than ever she show on CNN
she has a job so she hasn't got to see
at right and there was blowback on
anyone who suggested that she was a
racist a lot of the left came out and
said that she couldn't be racist because
racism is actually discrimination plus
power yeah right so she she still has a
job yeah and that's totally okay let's
be very clear on this because I am
feeling clear minded yes right now
racism is hating someone because of
their race it has nothing to do with
power yeah that was my price you
couldn't be black and hate white people
in your racist you can be white and hate
Asian people in your racist and you can
be Asian and hate Latino people just
because of their skin color and you are
racist no not according to New York
Times is wrong right so that's the end
of that story
meanwhile Alex Jones got banned from
Facebook literally so she still has a
job there so so I saw a bunch of the
tweets the only one of the the one tweet
look I've joked you know before I sort
of woke up politically I used to joke
about Republicans be an old white man a
lot and whatever and it was just stupid
jokes
I don't regret them because it's just
part of what made me me sort of I think
they're stupid and they were
short-sighted and maybe not very
informed at that time but what one tweet
that I did see and I think this might
have been quite literally the last thing
I saw before I shut down was there was
something about she like hated she loves
making old white people cry yeah yeah
yeah and I thought that that kind of
strikes that kind of strikes me you know
so there was a big argument that took
place over Sarah Jean not just over her
actual comments but over whether she
should be fired based on Twitter mobbing
so there's a big sort of discussion that
happened about social media mobbing and
people piling on and whether people
ought to be fired and lose their jobs of
our old stuff that they've tweeted and
of course that followed in the wake of
the James Gunn's stuff which you were
still here for those Jim's gun from
guardians of the galaxy members brain so
that had just as I was getting off and I
mean exactly so James Gunn getting
Guardian the galaxy director he lost his
job because there were some old tweets
of his that were that were you know
making jokes about pedophilia and such
and so there was a lot of talk about
Twitter mobbing and then the Sarah's
young thing happened and that was a
Twitter mob and so there was a lot of
talk about whether not whether she
should have been hired which is a
separate conversation but whether people
should lose their jobs based on people
digging up crap you did ten years ago
and now coming after you so let me get
this straight so so she still has a job
justifies all that stuff Roseanne Barr
does not have a job right because of one
tweet which I actually do believe that
Roseanne didn't know that Valerie
Jarrett was black and Rose a crazy
person Roseanne is what she is right so
describe a crazy person right right well
depends which person you're talking to
but I just want to understand all this
if you're trying because when you step
away it does seem a little odd so
Roseanne sends this one tweet which she
apologized for said she didn't know that
she was back there's no reason to think
that Rosanna's a history of racism she's
always been fighting for left because
it's forever actually so she gets fired
from the number-one sitcom in the
country then this girl sorry one more
time John cuz I'm out of it a little bit
she she maintains her job she maintains
her job and gun his gun got fired yeah
gun got fired there was an attempt to
bring him back but that kind of failed
yeah turns out they're pictures of him
at some like joke pedophilia themed
party
with the women were overage but they're
dressed of schoolchildren and such so
Disney was not going to maintain his job
so I don't even know what to do with all
that but I think partly I guess and I
guess this is from stepping away for a
little bit it's just this sort of when
we apply the standard and certain that
that I think that's what's driving
people crazy probably mostly
conservatives and people on the right
yeah that seems to always weigh much
more heavily on you even learn one of
the facets of this the miss was so
Candace Owens then tweeted out
everything Sarah Jean had tweeted but
with reversing the races and Twitter
immediately suspended her before they
realized what she was doing
no sure they yeah that was good okay so
meanwhile Alex Jones gets banned from
Facebook and iTunes there's a
coordinated hit on Alex Jones between I
believe it was Facebook and YouTube and
iTunes to D monetize him and deny him
platforms Wow all in the same day
on the same day I think was within 48
hours so it's fun to break this stuff to
you and and Wow wait so just D
monetizing him no I think YouTube
actually took down his entire channel oh
wow Alex Jones is not on YouTube I
believe so I haven't checked recently
but yes that was the story and they all
did this on the same day within 48 hours
so it was it was obviously a coordinated
hit obviously coordinated it Wow and so
they took him down
they gave various reasons why but they
didn't give any sort of objective reason
why so it wasn't like some of them said
it was because he had threatened
violence in the past some of them said
that it was because he had said
unpalatable things in the past but there
was no clear standard and so there are a
lot of folks on the right saying listen
even if you don't like Alex Jones you
know people I said that I'm no Alex
Jones fan I mean threatened me
personally but but you got to at least
articulate a clear standard for how
you're gonna police the boundaries here
otherwise everybody ends up in the in
the throw them overboard category
because these boundaries are randomly
expanding so yeah Alex Jones got hit he
hasn't really paid any serious monetary
price because he has alternative
distribution channels right and he's and
he's insulated and but don't lose the
nice things you get a massive hit oh
yeah no I mean it's obviously took a
seriously although his listenership I'm
sure is up because people are tuning in
because so where do you stand on this
now because you know for the last two
years I've been saying relentlessly the
answer is not government intervention I
just don't think that the government
Leasing Facebook and YouTube writer and
all those things that that will help
anything I think it would muck things up
even worse it would give more power to
just middle management bureaucrats and
since the government's not very good at
anything I don't think would be very
good so President Trump is this is one
of the other stories president Trump has
sort of jumped into this and suggested
kill president he's still president
okay so congratulations CJ McIntyre you
didn't miss the big finale but he was
suggesting regulation some other
Republicans have sort of put it out
there I don't agree with regulation but
I do think that we're gonna have to come
up with either some market-based
solutions or we're going to have to you
know recognize and enforce Facebook and
Twitter to be treated as as not
platforms but as as actual publishers
which is the real controversy over over
Facebook is it a platformer is it a
publisher to like over a tail a wire
which I run if we print something that
is libelous we'll be sued yeah I mean
legally Lavis will be sued if Facebook
puts up an article by us that is
libelous then Facebook doesn't get sued
it's a platform if they're not policing
what can be put up and what cannot at
what point you start saying well you're
just like The Daily wire or the New York
Times or CNN and you start getting
police that way I think that Facebook
[Music]
joining me today is a new zealand-born
author speaker and founder and
headmistress of Michaela Community
School a free school established in
London all the way back in 2014
Katherine verbal saying welcome to the
Rubin report hi hi I'm very happy to
have you here oh thank you having me
I have heard a rumor that you sometimes
play my videos in your classrooms well I
don't know about the classrooms but
among stuff yeah among staff in the
school somewhere in the school yeah in
the school definitely we're all demands
thank you for our two controversial to
play in the class yeah I think so I
think so there's so much I want to talk
to you about about education your your
personal sort of political evolution all
the things that you've been through so I
always like finding out a little bit
about somebody's history at the top and
you come from a long line of teachers
and some interesting background stuff so
tell me a little bit about young
Katherine well um I mean my parents my
father is Indian Guyanese my mum is
drank and black Jamaican I say that
because the whole race thing is
important you know bizarrely because
these days you know people are so much
more interested in who said it as
opposed to what is being said and you
know some what some random person set up
a Wikipedia page for me and there was
this kind of major argument going on
between my detractors and and the people
who support me people who support me one
of the truth to be there the people who
didn't like me wanted it too wanted me
to be Indian rather than black because
black was kind of a bigger victim to
discredit me they needed to push me up
the the victim pole you know yes so they
might hit hard following the oppression
Olympics yeah I know exactly and so you
know my mother was a nurse my father
taught at University and came from you
know dirt poverty in Guyana but is one
of those extraordinary people who made
something of himself through hard work
and I was born in New Zealand and then I
grew up in Canada and then I've now been
in London for you know nearly 30 years
and I went to Oxford University
and I've been a teacher ever since and I
was a very left-wing teacher a very
typical teacher in that way yeah and I
used to write a blog which was called to
miss with love based on the book and
film sir - sir with love you know Sidney
Poitier it was in the film and I wrote
this blog you know a few times a week
I'd go home and write about how little
Johnny had his money stolen and that
kind of thing things that made me really
upset about the education system and
wait let's pause for a second before you
get to get to the point where you sort
of woke up and got in trouble and I'll
have people fighting on your Wikipedia
page so what what sort of education did
you have that pushed you towards leftism
or was it just just how it was kind of
like where do those ideas come from do
that did that come from school yeah that
come from family was it I suppose my
family yeah you know it's really
interesting because I think ethnic
minorities really are small see
conservative naturally but because the
black vote normally goes to the left my
family was no different from from a
typical family you know ethnic family in
that sense and so I was brought up in a
left-wing household yeah why do you
think they generally vote small to see
conservative or that bit why not vote
why do they internally either think it
or have been taught to thank you I think
they come from small see conservative
background so when I say that just the
belief in and pulling yourself up from
your own boots but your own bootstraps
hard work will get you somewhere
personal responsibility being stoical
when things are difficult but the kind
of thing that makes people successful
yeah exactly and and I think minorities
especially the ones who've been
immigrants moved somewhere knew they
believe in giving their children a
better life and in working hard in order
to be able to do so so it fits with them
okay so now so you come from a small
seed conservative family what kind of
voting left yes
and then that's right you start right
and I'm a teacher so everyone I know is
on the Left and I don't speak to any
conservative people because that's how
it is there's this big divide and nobody
ever speaks to each other I didn't know
any conservative people or the way
conservative people thought and then I
was writing this blog and that's where I
started meeting
conservative people and I say meat on my
blog so Twitter didn't exist in those
days people would have discussions on
the blog comment section and all these
left wingers would come on and start
attacking me and telling me how awful I
was with the stories that I was writing
and how could I judge the education
system as I was judging it and all these
conservatives would come on and defend
me and I'd be saying to the left wingers
no no I wanted well I'm one of you who
you know I'm with you I'm a good person
and they'd say no you're a right winger
and I think well of course I'm not on
the right of course I'm not conservative
I'm a good person
so how did I possibly be conservative
and the Conservatives would come on and
say I think you'll find that you are and
over years of me writing and me
insisting that I was on the Left I came
to realize that I wasn't my instincts
the things that I valued the values it
was that those basic values of personal
responsibility and and and and and
perseverance and and and being happy
with competition and all that kind of
stuff I liked and then I realized I came
to realize slowly and and then I met a
few people so like I met you would be
interested because you always interested
in meeting people who don't think like
you yeah I met this guy so there was
this guy used to come onto my blog
called
he British national party member so he
was he was just I mean people call it
the fascist party you know and in the
day they had a lot more power than they
do nowadays and so he was part of the
BNP and I would let him come on my blog
so all of these kind of lefties were
outraged how can you let him come on
your blog you need to ban him but I
always thought what do you mean can't
worry about just just comment it's a
common dangerous con he would comment
and get into discussions sometimes of me
and sometimes with other people and some
of the left wingers would refuse to talk
to him at all you know and they get
really angry with me but you didn't take
that I should just say you're not
allowed to be on here and then you know
I
he was on there for a just this is over
years and then and then I said you know
it'd be really interesting to meet you
because you're very different from
anybody I know and so I met this guy and
you know I mean he was a racist you know
I mean he was you know the things that
he believed about
black people and so on he was a racist
but you know what I always say is some
of my best friends are racist you know
it's like Avenue Q you know the the
musical with you know everyone's a
little bit racist and people are racist
on different levels you know sometimes
you're really racist sometimes just a
little bit racist anyway I met with him
he was wearing a suit he's a young white
guy um wearing a suit nice shoes and and
he went he took me for lunch he paid
from lunch
so the racist took you for life that's
right that's right that's what's so
interesting about life right yeah and um
so we went for lunch and he was hobbling
along and I said you know you were right
he said oh you know the thing is I
bought this Sutan and these shoes
because I was meeting with you and you
know you went to Oxford University and I
figured I gotta get dressed up you know
but the shoes are new and they're really
hurting my feet and I thought isn't that
interesting here's this racist yeah who
was taking me for lunch who's wearing
new shoes that he's bought because I've
been to Oxford you know and that's
what's so interesting about life is that
it's not as easy as some of the left put
people you know you're a racist you're
not a racist you're a good person you're
a bad person you're this it's not like
that
there's a whole variety of different
ways of seeing people and learning from
people yeah and um and was he able to
learn from you after that well we met a
second time and you know I mean when I
say he was right I mean like he was
telling me about how that morning he'd
been to see his girlfriend and they have
a toddler and he'd gone to see her and
see the the the baby she wouldn't let
him hold the baby because she knew that
he was coming to see me and she said
you're gonna contaminate him that's true
racism is that's like truly exactly yeah
exactly um but you know he was a good
guy in so many other ways and that's
what that's what's interesting about
life is what I'd say is that nobody's
perfect and people changed their minds
you know I think about my parents who
lived in the same house for 46 years in
Toronto and there was a man called mr.
snow who lived opposite them and when he
moved when they moved into the area it
was all white and he was outraged
because he was a racist
and he thought no way I don't want these
people living there and over the years
over the 46 years they got to know each
other and they became friends and in the
end mr. snows wife you know she she got
cancer and she died and mr. snow I had
to depend on my parents for a whole lot
of help and and my parents loved mr.
snow and mr. snow loved them you know
things can change people can change and
when mr. snow died my parents moved
house because the the community they
lived in and had had died with mr. snow
and this was a man who was so racist he
didn't want them to live there you know
isn't it personally powerful too I mean
I can feel it when you're saying it that
when you can accept some people for all
their flaws that it actually allows you
to figure out how to grow instead of
just other member ever even even if they
might do that to a whole set of people
for awful reasons yeah well and they can
change
I mean people change their minds you
know I have this quote in my office from
Muhammad Ali that says you know if a man
at 40 still thinks the same way as when
he was 20 then he's lost 20 years of his
life you know and thank God we can
change I mean when I think about how I
used to think you know and how I think
now well that's what life's all about
right so okay so let's back up to some
of those ideas because so you were you
were a lefty and then you started
teaching in inner-city schools that's
right that's when you started waking up
and that's what sort of forced you to or
of course you were led you to write the
blog yeah what were some of the ideas
that you were seeing specifically that
you realize wow this is not working in
these schools yeah yeah so so one of the
big things that I used to think before
going into teaching and everyone used to
just accept was that black kids failed
at school because white teachers are
racist the system is racist the white
teachers are racist and that's why black
kids are failing a lot of teachers go
into teaching for racist purposes now
you think well this is what's so crazy I
was thinking but I've met hundreds
thousands of teachers not one of them
has ever said to me I'm a racist and I
want to stop black kids from from
succeeding in fact they are killing
themselves you know working all hours
giving everything that they can to the
job
and I started to question the kinds of
things that the the normal the normal
way of seeing things was what I was
being told and it wasn't just that you
know in which we might get into later
about teaching methods and about
discipline and so on the kinds of
leaders I worked in the whole second
half gonna be on your solution okay so
yeah I started to question all of that
and I went there was this black
achievement kind of conference that used
to happen once a year which was about
improving black achievement and how what
do we do raising black achievement and
there was a labor so that's our left
political party black woman MP so one of
our politicians who used to run this
thing and I went along and I took one of
the white teachers who I worked with and
he was older than me he's retired now
and he'd been doing this for 25 years
and given everything to the job and I
took him along and these people were
standing up on stage essentially saying
that white teachers were racist and I
was so embarrassed I was so humiliated
that I had taken this man giving up his
Saturday to go and sit and be told that
he's a racist when he had given
everything to these black boys so we
worked in this boys school and it was
mainly black boys in this school and and
I was just I was mortified so gradually
I started to change my mind on these
sorts of things and then I started to
see that there was it had to do with our
expectations of kids it had to do with
our our expectations of parents it had
to do with the kinds of values that the
way we were giving them so if we were
saying to them poor you you're a victim
life is so difficult you're black you'll
never be able to get anywhere then it's
quite hard for the black inner city boy
go oh well you know actually it's about
working hard it's about we always say at
school even when it's difficult
especially when it's difficult you do
what's right right and as opposed to
saying that's difficult I can't do it
right except before michaela that that
business of even when it's difficult
especially when it's difficult that that
value that that that business of
believing in hard work
I didn't see it so much and and we would
give kids excuses we would give kids
excuses to fail and I wouldn't do it in
my classroom and the kids behave for me
and the kids learned with me and of
course I'm not the only teacher was
doing that their teachers all over the
place and their own classrooms were
doing that what I what I wanted what did
the administration think of you because
it sounds like you know oh we've got you
and obviously as you said you weren't
the only one but we've got people
pushing against the very because that's
the fabric of what these schools
eventually become that it's not it's not
on them it's on the system that is
ruined people where they've even begun
yeah yeah and they're poor I mean I
don't suppose people realize what I was
saying you know I mean I'm you're
talking to kids privately do your own
thing and if kids are behaving for you
and you're getting good results and then
then the principal loves you you know
it just works and people don't know why
I don't even sure I realized why you
know you just you build up an experience
over years and you know what works with
the kids and how you get them on board
and how you show them that you're in
charge and and then you teach them
properly and they love you for it
do you realize that your political
evolution was happening at the exact
same time
because it was sort of very personal in
the classroom but then that you were
evolving yeah would have been in another
sense
oh it is for a lot of people i when
people come up to me on the street or
email me they're saying you know
something's happening at work I'm
dealing with this and now it's starting
to make me think differently about
politics or are used to always vote
Democrat but you know something happened
here my family we got in a conversation
and now I'm starting to think something
else is a little bit different well that
was the blog yes so it was the
Conservatives on my blog that I was
realizing I'm agreeing with you and I'm
not agreeing with the left wingers on
the blog and it was then that I just
thought well maybe I am just a
conservative I accepted it and then in
you know accepted the idea of being
conservative and then in 2010 I voted
conservative which was a major deal for
me
and it was funny because you know after
I did that I remember this is after I
ended up in the press and so on I was
speaking to a friend of mine
I said to her and she's Indian and I
said to her you know it will obviously
you've seen me the press and everything
and how I voted conservative and she
said well you know I have something to
tell you Catherine
I voted conservative too and that's the
thing people are doing this on the can
admit to it it's so crazy so I voted
conservative in May 2010 and then in
October 2010 I was invited to go to the
Conservative Party conference to to give
a speech yes and that's like a
convention you guys have conventions
here and um I was a teacher I never
really took much notice of political
things I mean I I didn't I was a bit
naive and a bit stupid to be honest and
anyway I went along and I gave this
speech which the audience really liked
and and then I ended up all over the
press yeah so this is the speech really
that changed everything that changed my
life yeah for the worse at the time I
mean I think now I can look back and say
it was for the better in many ways or
you know at least yeah I mean I every
cloud has a silver lining and my silver
lining has been has been a good one
because I've made it into the silver
lining but I could have been destroyed
by it quite easily I mean in the end I
ended up without a job I was told that I
would never get a job in the state
education ever again yeah could you just
lay out some of the things that you
talked about in the speech right so I
talked about black kids failing and that
I talked about I talked about that's not
expecting enough of kids and how we are
constantly making excuses for them and
how we label them with things like anger
management or you know dyslexia or all
these kind of labels that we give the
kids oh he can't possibly believe he's
he's got issues that's what we always
say they have we they have particular
needs and we have to meet their needs as
opposed to just expecting them to behave
everybody has different needs nobody we
can't expect anything of them and that's
just the norm it's the norm so I I
talked about all this I talked about
competition and how it was needed in
schools that kids need to feel as if
they're competing against somebody else
and so on they need to feel like they're
being inspired to work hard
as opposed to being indulged and
constantly let off the hook because well
it's not your fault
your parents are divorced it's not your
fault because you live on an estate and
your black and your mom is a single mom
and you can't possibly do your homework
I mean I don't understand you know like
and that was because over the years you
know I'd visited I'd worked for a summer
once in South Africa
I'd been to see schools in China and
Brazil and India and all of these
countries where the kids were far poorer
and yet they were walking five miles
getting to school and working really
[Music]
all right so let's really focus on what
you've done with the Michaela school
that you started in 2014 there was a lot
in in the research that I was doing
about discipline really before you even
get to education so you guys do a
bootcamp before you get to teaching them
anything you're actually teaching them
some things P early about discipline and
and sort of how to live how to behave
yeah yeah and that's because we believe
you haven't taught them how to behave
then you can't give them a detention for
it because they don't know how and the
reason why they don't know how is
because we know that elsewhere they
haven't necessarily been taught they
haven't necessarily learned it at home
they certainly want to learn it at other
schools and that's because our
expectations are really high and so we
teach them we have silence in the
corridors for instance so that's
something people come and they say why
do you have to be so extreme I'll tell
you why you had to be so extreme because
otherwise you've got kids fighting in
the corridors bashing each other's heads
against the wall some schools where
teachers are scared to walk through the
corridors because it's such mayhem you
have silence everybody just moves really
quickly to their lessons you've got
change over that takes maybe a minute
and a half children aren't losing loads
of time from their lessons I we say 59
minutes out of every 60 minutes in the
lesson you've got it at Makayla and
we're trying to catch them up you know a
lot of our kids come to us for the
reading age of a five-year-old
six-year-old when they are 11 years old
in fact I mean some of them aren't like
that some of them are Oxbridge material
and we'll go to oxford a Cambridge and
some of them need real help so that they
don't leave school illiterate and a
numeron 20% of the kids in Britain leave
school illiterate and innumerate right
20% one out of five kids now and that's
functionally so it looks like they can
read but they can't really read and this
is happening across the country and it's
become normal to expect that now none of
our kids going to be in that position
because we teach them so and we teach
them in an environment where the
children are able to respect their
teachers they love their teachers they
thanked them for their lessons at the
end of their lessons they say good
morning and good afternoon and so on and
things that you would never imagine you
know inner-city kids you you you know if
you have an idea
in your head if what need to see kids
are like you imagine the boys walking
with their with the trousers down here
in the kind of way and and and girls
dressing in a way that isn't appropriate
at our school none of that exists so you
do have a dress code right well they
have a uniform the uniform and that's
normal in Britain everybody has a
uniform yeah but the thing is we
actually stick to the uniform so you go
elsewhere there the ties are down
the shirts are untagged they look like a
mess they walk like a gangster I'm
always saying to the kids I mean if they
start if they ever start barking like
that I say you look like a gangster you
need to stop that right and they get it
they say yeah yeah I miss yeah yeah I
get it I get it and then they start
doing it because we talk about getting
to the best universities we want you to
get the Ivy League universities to get
to Russell Group universities in Britain
and we want you to have you know you aim
for the moon you land amongst the stars
that's why we think right and so they're
all really ambitious and they're all
working hard why anyone would be against
this as a concept okay I don't know so
when you hear pushback against that I
guess it's that people think it's like
presumptuous or something to imply that
their parents can't do it even if often
the parents are failing or or the
parents just have to work too hard and
they don't have time to do the things
that you're doing and I think then
people think there's a racial element to
that so if you even address that I
actually have a problem with it itself
they don't like the idea of us being in
authority mmm they don't like they think
being in authority means that we must be
Nazis I've been called not a Nazi many a
time which is a bit ironic when you
think that what the Nazis would have
done to somebody like me but exactly so
and they don't like the idea of us being
in authority and us being in charge so
one we're really key on discipline but -
we want the discipline so that we can
teach them properly and this is where
you're referring to what you said yes
sir I was watching you at the Oxford
Union and you said about how kids need
to be taught properly and I was and
you've said they need to be taught
critical thinking and take me to task
yeah yeah yeah the thing is is that you
can't teach critical thinking right peep
are critical in their thinking or
independently minded or inquisitive when
they know lots about something and it's
only by knowing lots it's like a 10,000
hour thing you know you got Malcolm
Gladwell you got you know Steve Jobs you
got the Beatles you spend a lot of time
doing something you will get really good
at it and then you'll be able to break
the rules uh-huh
but if you're trying to break the rules
right right away when you don't know
anything then you end up with kids and
this is it the public don't realize just
how bad things are where kids don't know
where Paris is you know kids don't know
in Britain who Winston Churchill is you
know they genuinely they have no idea
and that's because nobody's taught them
because people are anti knowledge so the
grandfather to like the whole knowledge
movement is is Edie Hirsch and he's an
American his most recent book is why
knowledge matters which I would
encourage all of your viewers to read
you know education is the most important
thing in any country right and and
that's one of reasons I'm so pleased to
be talking to you because people need to
realize you know you you you can have
all your arguments about free speech and
about about I don't know guns and about
whatever it is you want but if the
schools are not teaching children
properly then that is the end of any
country right and I am desperately
trying to shout as much as I can to tell
people too that we need to do something
and we are doing something I mean we're
doing something and other people we're
not the only ones you know there are
other people who are doing things we
named mckaela mckaela after a woman who
died of cancer who I used to work with
and she in her own classroom used to do
exactly this and there are teachers all
over America and all over Britain doing
this in their own classrooms we need we
need it to be more than that we need
entire school districts you know we need
people to get this point and when you
said about teaching critical thinking
it's a romantic view that comes from
Rousseau so 18th century philosopher
Rousseau and he said you know man is
born free but everywhere in Chains this
whole idea of you education makes you
less
free this is what the the progressives
think and actually self-control brings
you freedom right it's counterintuitive
but actually order and structure make
you free they allow you to pursue all
those avenues of knowledge basically
because you have a sort of Center
exactly if you learn lots about
something then you're able to apply that
knowledge in different ways so I mean as
an example um you know if you take a
math question that a primary school kid
might be given you know John has 8 cents
at the end of the day it's one quarter
of what he had at the beginning of the
day how much money did he spend during
the day now I think I can do it and I
don't I think you can - I'm terrible at
math but I do I think you can do it is
because you got short-term memory and
long-term memory and you've got a whole
bunch of math facts in your long-term
memory that you're able to draw out
you're able to go quarter know there's 4
of those in a hole and then you're able
to go 4 times 8 because I know my 4
times table and then I can do
subtraction so I can take it to 24 yeah
right now if you're 7 years old however
if you have to hold all those facts in
your working memory working memory can't
do it you have got to drill and practice
those a time table facts for instance
and put them into your long-term memory
and put those fractions into your
long-term memory so that when somebody
gives you something more complex you can
go bam bam bam and bring it out and then
you've got the answer sadly what happens
is people say now what we need to do is
teach some complex problem-solving let's
give them that mm-hmm
first you got to break it down what are
the bits underneath that you've got to
build up from and that stuff is a bit
boring yeah and because it's boring and
isn't very romantic this ruse I was
talking about for soso Rousseau this
idea with you you you you bring it out
of the child right so they they have
this phrase which says you know the mind
is not a vessel to be filled but a spark
to be ignited it all sounds really
exciting and thrilling right and that's
the thing it's so seductive it pulls
everybody in but the reality is that
actually what you need is a whole lot of
facts and you're in your memory
there that you can then go boom boom
boom and apply now that doesn't mean
that you're just a parrot and you just
end up learning a whole load of facts
which you then can just you know
regurgitate you need to apply them and
you need to give children the chance to
apply them and have a class discussion
and we do paired work and so on often in
more progressive places they'll do group
work
they'll put five kids four kids around
the table and they do group work and
then what happens is the teacher moves
amongst them as a facilitator of
learning as opposed to the teacher who's
driving the bus I always say the teacher
needs to sit in the bus and drive and
the kids get on the bus with you and go
the more progressive way you're there
just keeping them on task you do that
let me come and see you you do that but
they don't learn very much and then they
don't succeed and then we say it's
because they were black it's because
they were poor what we need to do is
give them welfare and then they'll be
okay because that will make them equal
and my point is no fix the education
system give them an education and then
they'll make themselves equal gosh this
reminds me of
so I mentioned I'm not that good at math
and I remember the day I haven't thought
about this in probably 15 maybe
literally maybe 20 years I remember
being in sixth or seventh grade and we
were doing division for the first time
yes and I remember the teacher gave us
we had a quiz or something and I was
able to do it in my head and I so she
they had you know the the equation and I
just wrote the answer and she gave me AI
failed or I got a zero or something even
though I had all the answers right she
said you didn't show your work and I and
I remember saying her but I got all the
answers right and she said no no I need
to see how you do work now I didn't know
how to do it that way but somehow I was
able to do it in my head and I remember
thinking that if that was all necessary
to show the work that at some point I
would get to a place where I would have
to do it but somehow I had figured out
my little trick first but because of the
way she kind of just failed me for it it
completely turned me off man I really
haven't thought of that in probably 20
years or something that's this total
sidebar altogether but I guess just to
show that we all we all kind of learned
differently and you need teachers that
can kind of embrace the way you do it a
little bit rather than just jam it down
your throat
yeah well you use which is probably a
little bit
the progressive thing that you don't
like in a way yeah what I would say is
you remember that particular incident
and think that's all it was but I
guarantee you that had you been taught
properly in that classroom you would
have known her methods yeah you would
have known what to write down you didn't
know what to write down cuz there was
too much chaos in the classroom you
weren't listening
you were busy talking to your friend
because she let you talk because she
didn't have high enough standards of
behavior and so you there yeah well and
that's it because this is just standard
this is just what happens in all
classrooms and then people think you
know it's mean to make kids behave and
after a while the thing is is that
remember there's more of them than there
is of us right so we're not actually
making them do anything they want to
behave we're just creating an
environment where they're able to do it
right that's all now there's there's the
there's the 10% there's the 10% on the
outskirts that the detentions I saw and
keep them in line right but the vast
majority you need that tipping point
the vast majority buy into what we do
and if you come visit our school the
kids will say to you yeah it's super
strict and yeah we get the tensions but
you know what I get a great education
yeah and that's what I want because I
want the opportunity to be able to
change my stars and if you believe that
if you believe in equality of
opportunity which sadly I think too many
people in education don't believe in
equality of opportunity if you do then
you want to provide an environment where
they're going to be able to do that and
and and that's what we do and and I and
I really hope those teachers who come
and visit us they're able to take from
that and and and and do something in
their schools yeah well first off I told
you before we started I'm gonna be in
the UK with Jordan beaters and put a
couple stops so I will do everything I
can to stop by and maybe I can get
Jordan to swing by wow yeah daughter is
Mikayla by the way so they're really
deep powerful powerful what about the
type of kids you've mentioned that
there's some diversity and the type of
kids that are coming and how do you guys
decide who actually can can cut it and
can afford it and other you know all of
that well it's not up to us who comes to
us it's the local council that kind of
send kids to us so we gotta they decide
well it's a lottery and people apply and
then they get picked out of a hat
literally and then and then they come
some of the people you know some of the
kids would end up with us didn't even
necessarily want to be with us they just
end up being pushed towards us because
that's the way the system goes I mean
frankly I don't even understand the
system but we get a bunch of kids we got
120 kids in every year so it's a pure
lottery to get to the school yeah and
basically if they don't win the lottery
so to speak they're just going to the
public school because at that point most
likely the parents can't afford a
private school right yeah yeah no
definitely the parents can't afford a
private school but there's no I mean you
talk about it as if we're different I
mean like we're just another school
there's loads of schools like us in that
sense around I mean we are a free school
but yeah it doesn't it's not like we're
the free school and then there's the
local public school there's loads
there's lots of schools and and parents
will choose us if they want to and as I
say sometimes we end up with with with
kids because the system is such that you
have to choose your top five schools and
you know if you chosen us fifth you
probably don't want to be with us but in
the name of fairness as the people
who've chosen as fifth have just as much
of a chance getting it and as the people
Jackson got very American there I grew
up in Canada so but yeah so people who
don't want to come to us come to us and
people who do really want to come to us
come to us and look you know I call
myself the dragon lady and I say you
know what I'm not gonna change and if
you're happy to put up with me these are
the rules and this is what we do so if
we hear your phone or if we see your
phone we'll take it and we will keep it
for up to 16 weeks and that's the way
that it is
you know these smart phones are killing
kids I wanted to get there yeah yeah
what do you make of that because it's a
it's a disaster and in 20 years people
are gonna know you know when I say it
now people say oh you're being extreme
you know some schools they actually have
these phones out in lessons lots of
schools they have them out in corridors
and in the yard and so on
we have them banned completely and I'm
even trying to get parents to take them
away at home we know we sell brick
phones so your phone that you can't
access the Internet
so that trouble you try and encourage
parents give them that you want to keep
in touch with a kid fine I understand
but you don't need to give them a
smartphone that accesses the Internet
you know Steve Jobs Bill Gates all of
those big guys in nightie they don't
give their children phones until they're
15 they keep them away when Steve Jobs
in 2010 and the iPad came out and he was
interviewed and they said what did you
think about what does he what do your
kids think about the iPad and he said I
don't know I wouldn't give my kids the
iPad he they they protect their children
meanwhile our parents have no idea
they're there saving up for months but
give their kids this Christmas present
and it's it's it's like giving them
heroin I say it's like playing Russian
roulette you know who you give anybody
access to your child on this phone right
any weirdo out there knows who your
child lives knows where how they go to
school knows where they go to school
knows who their friends are they get in
I'm in I I don't understand
well the reason why people do this is
because they don't know and they don't
think about the dangers not just with
random people but also lovely girls who
get involved with the bad boys at school
bad boys who might be criminals
elsewhere etc and they they quite like
them and they wouldn't otherwise known
them but oh you maybe he's gonna add me
on snapchat whoa you know and this is
the kind of it's terrible what about
just for attention spans because I would
imagine you're dealing with a lot of
that for young people right now it's not
supposed to have snapchat as you just
said exactly so you know before when
they used to watch you know Dallas and
dynasty and so on at least there was a
narrative arc that went like this and it
told a story and then something bad
happened and then it gets resolved and
so on never gonna happen anymore
you got like 20 second I went to the
hairdresser's look at this man's bald
head and there's a little ditty that's
what they're watching right right it's
terrible so smartphones are a huge
problem for the inner city and but the
biggest problem I would say our
progressive teaching methods that have
infiltrated our schools and sadly this
kind of Russo an idea that you're
drawing something out of the child as
opposed to putting something in and the
[Music]
joining me today is a new zealand-born
author speaker and founder and
headmistress of Michaela Community
School a free school established in
London all the way back in 2014
Katherine verbal saying welcome to the
Rubin report hi hi I'm very happy to
have you here oh thank you having me
I have heard a rumor that you sometimes
play my videos in your classrooms well I
don't know about the classrooms but
among stuff yeah among staff in the
school somewhere in the school yeah in
the school definitely we're all demands
thank you for our two controversial to
play in the class yeah I think so I
think so there's so much I want to talk
to you about about education your your
personal sort of political evolution all
the things that you've been through so I
always like finding out a little bit
about somebody's history at the top and
you come from a long line of teachers
and some interesting background stuff so
tell me a little bit about young
Katherine well um I mean my parents my
father is Indian Guyanese my mum is
drank and black Jamaican I say that
because the whole race thing is
important you know bizarrely because
these days you know people are so much
more interested in who said it as
opposed to what is being said and you
know some what some random person set up
a Wikipedia page for me and there was
this kind of major argument going on
between my detractors and and the people
who support me people who support me one
of the truth to be there the people who
didn't like me wanted it too wanted me
to be Indian rather than black because
black was kind of a bigger victim to
discredit me they needed to push me up
the the victim pole you know yes so they
might hit hard following the oppression
Olympics yeah I know exactly and so you
know my mother was a nurse my father
taught at University and came from you
know dirt poverty in Guyana but is one
of those extraordinary people who made
something of himself through hard work
and I was born in New Zealand and then I
grew up in Canada and then I've now been
in London for you know nearly 30 years
and I went to Oxford University
and I've been a teacher ever since and I
was a very left-wing teacher a very
typical teacher in that way yeah and I
used to write a blog which was called to
miss with love based on the book and
film sir - sir with love you know Sidney
Poitier it was in the film and I wrote
this blog you know a few times a week
I'd go home and write about how little
Johnny had his money stolen and that
kind of thing things that made me really
upset about the education system and
wait let's pause for a second before you
get to get to the point where you sort
of woke up and got in trouble and I'll
have people fighting on your Wikipedia
page so what what sort of education did
you have that pushed you towards leftism
or was it just just how it was kind of
like where do those ideas come from do
that did that come from school yeah that
come from family was it I suppose my
family yeah you know it's really
interesting because I think ethnic
minorities really are small see
conservative naturally but because the
black vote normally goes to the left my
family was no different from from a
typical family you know ethnic family in
that sense and so I was brought up in a
left-wing household yeah why do you
think they generally vote small to see
conservative or that bit why not vote
why do they internally either think it
or have been taught to thank you I think
they come from small see conservative
background so when I say that just the
belief in and pulling yourself up from
your own boots but your own bootstraps
hard work will get you somewhere
personal responsibility being stoical
when things are difficult but the kind
of thing that makes people successful
yeah exactly and and I think minorities
especially the ones who've been
immigrants moved somewhere knew they
believe in giving their children a
better life and in working hard in order
to be able to do so so it fits with them
okay so now so you come from a small
seed conservative family what kind of
voting left yes
and then that's right you start right
and I'm a teacher so everyone I know is
on the Left and I don't speak to any
conservative people because that's how
it is there's this big divide and nobody
ever speaks to each other I didn't know
any conservative people or the way
conservative people thought and then I
was writing this blog and that's where I
started meeting
conservative people and I say meat on my
blog so Twitter didn't exist in those
days people would have discussions on
the blog comment section and all these
left wingers would come on and start
attacking me and telling me how awful I
was with the stories that I was writing
and how could I judge the education
system as I was judging it and all these
conservatives would come on and defend
me and I'd be saying to the left wingers
no no I wanted well I'm one of you who
you know I'm with you I'm a good person
and they'd say no you're a right winger
and I think well of course I'm not on
the right of course I'm not conservative
I'm a good person
so how did I possibly be conservative
and the Conservatives would come on and
say I think you'll find that you are and
over years of me writing and me
insisting that I was on the Left I came
to realize that I wasn't my instincts
the things that I valued the values it
was that those basic values of personal
responsibility and and and and and
perseverance and and and being happy
with competition and all that kind of
stuff I liked and then I realized I came
to realize slowly and and then I met a
few people so like I met you would be
interested because you always interested
in meeting people who don't think like
you yeah I met this guy so there was
this guy used to come onto my blog
called
he British national party member so he
was he was just I mean people call it
the fascist party you know and in the
day they had a lot more power than they
do nowadays and so he was part of the
BNP and I would let him come on my blog
so all of these kind of lefties were
outraged how can you let him come on
your blog you need to ban him but I
always thought what do you mean can't
worry about just just comment it's a
common dangerous con he would comment
and get into discussions sometimes of me
and sometimes with other people and some
of the left wingers would refuse to talk
to him at all you know and they get
really angry with me but you didn't take
that I should just say you're not
allowed to be on here and then you know
I
he was on there for a just this is over
years and then and then I said you know
it'd be really interesting to meet you
because you're very different from
anybody I know and so I met this guy and
you know I mean he was a racist you know
I mean he was you know the things that
he believed about
black people and so on he was a racist
but you know what I always say is some
of my best friends are racist you know
it's like Avenue Q you know the the
musical with you know everyone's a
little bit racist and people are racist
on different levels you know sometimes
you're really racist sometimes just a
little bit racist anyway I met with him
he was wearing a suit he's a young white
guy um wearing a suit nice shoes and and
he went he took me for lunch he paid
from lunch
so the racist took you for life that's
right that's right that's what's so
interesting about life right yeah and um
so we went for lunch and he was hobbling
along and I said you know you were right
he said oh you know the thing is I
bought this Sutan and these shoes
because I was meeting with you and you
know you went to Oxford University and I
figured I gotta get dressed up you know
but the shoes are new and they're really
hurting my feet and I thought isn't that
interesting here's this racist yeah who
was taking me for lunch who's wearing
new shoes that he's bought because I've
been to Oxford you know and that's
what's so interesting about life is that
it's not as easy as some of the left put
people you know you're a racist you're
not a racist you're a good person you're
a bad person you're this it's not like
that
there's a whole variety of different
ways of seeing people and learning from
people yeah and um and was he able to
learn from you after that well we met a
second time and you know I mean when I
say he was right I mean like he was
telling me about how that morning he'd
been to see his girlfriend and they have
a toddler and he'd gone to see her and
see the the the baby she wouldn't let
him hold the baby because she knew that
he was coming to see me and she said
you're gonna contaminate him that's true
racism is that's like truly exactly yeah
exactly um but you know he was a good
guy in so many other ways and that's
what that's what's interesting about
life is what I'd say is that nobody's
perfect and people changed their minds
you know I think about my parents who
lived in the same house for 46 years in
Toronto and there was a man called mr.
snow who lived opposite them and when he
moved when they moved into the area it
was all white and he was outraged
because he was a racist
and he thought no way I don't want these
people living there and over the years
over the 46 years they got to know each
other and they became friends and in the
end mr. snows wife you know she she got
cancer and she died and mr. snow I had
to depend on my parents for a whole lot
of help and and my parents loved mr.
snow and mr. snow loved them you know
things can change people can change and
when mr. snow died my parents moved
house because the the community they
lived in and had had died with mr. snow
and this was a man who was so racist he
didn't want them to live there you know
isn't it personally powerful too I mean
I can feel it when you're saying it that
when you can accept some people for all
their flaws that it actually allows you
to figure out how to grow instead of
just other member ever even even if they
might do that to a whole set of people
for awful reasons yeah well and they can
change
I mean people change their minds you
know I have this quote in my office from
Muhammad Ali that says you know if a man
at 40 still thinks the same way as when
he was 20 then he's lost 20 years of his
life you know and thank God we can
change I mean when I think about how I
used to think you know and how I think
now well that's what life's all about
right so okay so let's back up to some
of those ideas because so you were you
were a lefty and then you started
teaching in inner-city schools that's
right that's when you started waking up
and that's what sort of forced you to or
of course you were led you to write the
blog yeah what were some of the ideas
that you were seeing specifically that
you realize wow this is not working in
these schools yeah yeah so so one of the
big things that I used to think before
going into teaching and everyone used to
just accept was that black kids failed
at school because white teachers are
racist the system is racist the white
teachers are racist and that's why black
kids are failing a lot of teachers go
into teaching for racist purposes now
you think well this is what's so crazy I
was thinking but I've met hundreds
thousands of teachers not one of them
has ever said to me I'm a racist and I
want to stop black kids from from
succeeding in fact they are killing
themselves you know working all hours
giving everything that they can to the
job
and I started to question the kinds of
things that the the normal the normal
way of seeing things was what I was
being told and it wasn't just that you
know in which we might get into later
about teaching methods and about
discipline and so on the kinds of
leaders I worked in the whole second
half gonna be on your solution okay so
yeah I started to question all of that
and I went there was this black
achievement kind of conference that used
to happen once a year which was about
improving black achievement and how what
do we do raising black achievement and
there was a labor so that's our left
political party black woman MP so one of
our politicians who used to run this
thing and I went along and I took one of
the white teachers who I worked with and
he was older than me he's retired now
and he'd been doing this for 25 years
and given everything to the job and I
took him along and these people were
standing up on stage essentially saying
that white teachers were racist and I
was so embarrassed I was so humiliated
that I had taken this man giving up his
Saturday to go and sit and be told that
he's a racist when he had given
everything to these black boys so we
worked in this boys school and it was
mainly black boys in this school and and
I was just I was mortified so gradually
I started to change my mind on these
sorts of things and then I started to
see that there was it had to do with our
expectations of kids it had to do with
our our expectations of parents it had
to do with the kinds of values that the
way we were giving them so if we were
saying to them poor you you're a victim
life is so difficult you're black you'll
never be able to get anywhere then it's
quite hard for the black inner city boy
go oh well you know actually it's about
working hard it's about we always say at
school even when it's difficult
especially when it's difficult you do
what's right right and as opposed to
saying that's difficult I can't do it
right except before michaela that that
business of even when it's difficult
especially when it's difficult that that
value that that that business of
believing in hard work
I didn't see it so much and and we would
give kids excuses we would give kids
excuses to fail and I wouldn't do it in
my classroom and the kids behave for me
and the kids learned with me and of
course I'm not the only teacher was
doing that their teachers all over the
place and their own classrooms were
doing that what I what I wanted what did
the administration think of you because
it sounds like you know oh we've got you
and obviously as you said you weren't
the only one but we've got people
pushing against the very because that's
the fabric of what these schools
eventually become that it's not it's not
on them it's on the system that is
ruined people where they've even begun
yeah yeah and they're poor I mean I
don't suppose people realize what I was
saying you know I mean I'm you're
talking to kids privately do your own
thing and if kids are behaving for you
and you're getting good results and then
then the principal loves you you know
it just works and people don't know why
I don't even sure I realized why you
know you just you build up an experience
over years and you know what works with
the kids and how you get them on board
and how you show them that you're in
charge and and then you teach them
properly and they love you for it
do you realize that your political
evolution was happening at the exact
same time
because it was sort of very personal in
the classroom but then that you were
evolving yeah would have been in another
sense
oh it is for a lot of people i when
people come up to me on the street or
email me they're saying you know
something's happening at work I'm
dealing with this and now it's starting
to make me think differently about
politics or are used to always vote
Democrat but you know something happened
here my family we got in a conversation
and now I'm starting to think something
else is a little bit different well that
was the blog yes so it was the
Conservatives on my blog that I was
realizing I'm agreeing with you and I'm
not agreeing with the left wingers on
the blog and it was then that I just
thought well maybe I am just a
conservative I accepted it and then in
you know accepted the idea of being
conservative and then in 2010 I voted
conservative which was a major deal for
me
and it was funny because you know after
I did that I remember this is after I
ended up in the press and so on I was
speaking to a friend of mine
I said to her and she's Indian and I
said to her you know it will obviously
you've seen me the press and everything
and how I voted conservative and she
said well you know I have something to
tell you Catherine
I voted conservative too and that's the
thing people are doing this on the can
admit to it it's so crazy so I voted
conservative in May 2010 and then in
October 2010 I was invited to go to the
Conservative Party conference to to give
a speech yes and that's like a
convention you guys have conventions
here and um I was a teacher I never
really took much notice of political
things I mean I I didn't I was a bit
naive and a bit stupid to be honest and
anyway I went along and I gave this
speech which the audience really liked
and and then I ended up all over the
press yeah so this is the speech really
that changed everything that changed my
life yeah for the worse at the time I
mean I think now I can look back and say
it was for the better in many ways or
you know at least yeah I mean I every
cloud has a silver lining and my silver
lining has been has been a good one
because I've made it into the silver
lining but I could have been destroyed
by it quite easily I mean in the end I
ended up without a job I was told that I
would never get a job in the state
education ever again yeah could you just
lay out some of the things that you
talked about in the speech right so I
talked about black kids failing and that
I talked about I talked about that's not
expecting enough of kids and how we are
constantly making excuses for them and
how we label them with things like anger
management or you know dyslexia or all
these kind of labels that we give the
kids oh he can't possibly believe he's
he's got issues that's what we always
say they have we they have particular
needs and we have to meet their needs as
opposed to just expecting them to behave
everybody has different needs nobody we
can't expect anything of them and that's
just the norm it's the norm so I I
talked about all this I talked about
competition and how it was needed in
schools that kids need to feel as if
they're competing against somebody else
and so on they need to feel like they're
being inspired to work hard
as opposed to being indulged and
constantly let off the hook because well
it's not your fault
your parents are divorced it's not your
fault because you live on an estate and
your black and your mom is a single mom
and you can't possibly do your homework
I mean I don't understand you know like
and that was because over the years you
know I'd visited I'd worked for a summer
once in South Africa
I'd been to see schools in China and
Brazil and India and all of these
countries where the kids were far poorer
and yet they were walking five miles
getting to school and working really
[Music]
joining me today is an author the
editorial director of the American
Institute for Economic Research as well
as a senior fellow at the Austrian
economic center Jeffrey Tucker welcome
to the Rubin report thanks for having me
good to be here I almost wore the same
bowtie my friend really I should have
brought one extra for you yeah that
would have been work on this all right
there's a ton I want to talk to ya
you're sort of one of these people that
are right around all of the topics that
I'm talking about from freedom and
liberty and free speech and the battle
between the left and the right and all
that but your new book and I want to get
the title absolutely correct right wing
collectivism the other threat to Liberty
I thought that would be the spot for us
to kick this off because most of the
people watching the show know that I've
mostly focused on the left sure yeah was
my home I was a progressive I've woken
up to what I shouldn't real liberalism
is obviously and that has nothing to do
with the modern life but sometimes
people say Dave you don't critique the
right enough so let's dive in what's
interesting about talk about it is that
so often the left and the right are not
as distinguishable as they seem to be
for example the this trade stuff you
know Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump
basically agreed yeah you know how do
you account for that and and now will
you see all the celebration of the
working classes you know you're gonna
get again the trumpian right agreeing
with Bernie Sanders on that the left is
evermore trending nationalist and it's
immigration policies for example that
didn't use to be the case so how is the
left well you know listen well like
Bernie Sanders complained that free free
immigration is is a coke a Koch
Industries plot basically to provide the
capitalist class cheap workers for
example now that you would have never
found anybody on the Left 20 years ago
saying that but but now you know it's
happening you know the the the the the
hatred of the of Commerce and and the
the merchant class is so intense now
that if a luxury resort and
in Florida wants to hire soon some
immigrants to work for them then the
left is saying oh no this is this is
terrible because this cab this
capitalism at work so here's trying to
see the strange blending the left and
the right have different cultural
pitches different appeals different
constituencies but they both have this
this agenda that's that boils down to
the to the use of power is this a little
bit of just what people refer to as the
horseshoe theory that the more that the
sides have become sort of extreme that
they're oddly that may be right I've
heard this this horseshoe thing I tend
to think that's a little bit superficial
I mean I look at it a little bit more
historically and you see since since
liberalism was born in the world in the
18th century really light Middle Ages
but when the revolt against liberalism
began in the early 19th century right
too much change too much wealth the
wrong people are getting rich there's
not enough control what are we going to
do about our religion our language our
race you know this the revolt began to
grow from about the 1820s and and
intensified and spread to the United
States Britain really began to take root
in continental Europe there took two
forms there was a left form and a right
form and at each country they took they
took on different iterations different
names you know so so in Britain you had
the Tories then you had the labor labor
party they both wanted to use the state
for their own purposes then you always
had the opposition party which is the
Liberals you know and and that's the way
it's fleshed out itself in country after
country the Liberal Party has always
been the people said why don't we just
let society be let people live their
lives let them choose a religion of
their own of their own choice if they
don't hurt anybody it's not a problem
let's have free speech this have
universal rights that's how rights for
this get rid of slavery let's have
rights acknowledge the existence of
women's rights equality of freedom for
everybody leave everybody alone
that's the liberal position that's a
pretty good position it's a it's a
beautiful position and it's what I
favorites what I think it's what built
civilization coming out of the religious
wars of the high middle ages we
discovered this idea of freedom we tried
it it worked
but there's but there's a brief there's
always been a revolt brewing against it
a resentment resentment against it again
resentment against the commercial class
too much change too much wealth wrong
people getting wealthy we're not
controlling demographics well enough
there's not enough equality whatever the
thing is it takes different forms in
different countries and at different
times in different places but ultimately
the right and the left are ideologies of
control and power and liberalism has
always been the alternative to that so
so we keep having to rediscover this
again and again in every generation yeah
well that's why now I'm so happy that
there is as you said to me right before
we started the phrase classical
liberalism now is coming back you know
you mean you had it on TV every now and
again I like to think that maybe I had a
little something to do with it you know
and meaning to me
it is the only current antidote to the
problems that we have either the the
more state power that the Democratic
socialists want as they've sort of
ransacked their own party and purged all
of the Liberals and it's also the
antidote for all of the people if you
think Trump is all of the horrible
things that people say about him all
time what's the antidote
the antidote isn't to get somebody else
in that more power yeah the antidote
obviously is to take power away from
that that's what liberalism and I my
hope is that that there are the good
people who left the center of the left
that are looking at the emergence of the
Trump problem will reconsider the uses
of power and the executive state and why
do we build this gigantic machinery of
the total state if it's so vulnerable to
being captured by our enemies right
right the real question that we're at
right now if you believe this thing has
been captured by the Russians or
whatever it is it's like yeah well okay
yeah and answering your own question I
hope that we can we can rekindle a kind
of a new resurgence or I do have to
credit you and Jordan Peterson for this
I mean I've been working at it for about
ten years to try to bring back this not
just the term liberal but the concept of
the brill ism
- to public life and but it's been
difficult because because because we do
have this state that creates a kind of
moral and intellectual and ideological
hazard
somebody's got to control it and and now
that we built it over the last hundred
years this this this total state of
massive taxes regulations interventions
run in people's lives everybody's trying
to get hold of it and grab it and beat
up their enemies and it's a problem it's
a serious problem so when people say to
me and we've discussed this on the show
a bunch of times before and I've dressed
address this in several forums when
people say to me wait a minute when
you're when you say you're a classical
liberal you talk about lazy for
economics and getting the government out
of the way and all those things really
this is just a repackaged libertarianism
or you're just afraid to say that you're
a conservative because it's still not
cool
or something that is how would you
define the difference between say
classical liberal and a libertarian
let's talk about that because because
after World War two these neologisms
these new terms came along one was
conservatism it wasn't really used
before the early 1950s Russell Kirk's
book called the mindset of a
conservative something like the
conservative mind I think is what it was
called and libertarianism was again
first used at about 1957 by the
translator of the works of Basquiat the
problem was the term liberal had been
captured you know by the new dealers
mmm-hmm as early as 1933 once they
acquiesced to the idea of the corporate
of a state andr blame the Great
Depression on capitalism that became a
problem for liberalism that kept the
term liberalism but they were no longer
liberal because they were suddenly for
big government here before big
government and and even worse the
corporate state and actually we can just
be more blunt about it and say that back
in the 1930s is this this ideology had a
name the name is fascist yeah okay so so
they caved right I mean in the New York
Times in 1933 the New York Times
magazine was celebrating the great
professor Mussolini
and how he and FDR shared a vision for
the planned economy so that's the world
we were living in back then so we lost
the term liberal after World War 2 there
was an attempt to to just speak language
and to and to describe who we are and on
one hand you had this new thing called
conservatism and they they they kind of
sampled some of the story
Tory like nostalgia for the past a
little bit of revanche ISM you know
let's recapture what we've lost didn't
you on the other hand who had the
genuine liberals and they coined the
term libertarianism which had been
sitting on the shelf since the late 19th
century now most of the people who call
themselves libertarians in the late 19th
century America and England were
anarchists socialists but nobody had
bothered with the term for decades and
decades
so Dean Russell said well nobody's using
that word why don't we use it and that
was closer to the truth of what they
were in effect well what was interesting
about that is as Dean Russell described
it in his 1957 article it was a synonym
for what was once called liberal right
he didn't think it was a tweak or an
improvement or a distillation or
refinement or a new dogmatic way of
describing the bill ISM he thought it
was liberalism so I need to read that
because I mean that's how I feel I don't
know if someone says me Dave you're a
libertarian I don't mind that if we need
labels I don't mind that lame I don't
mind you know we can split the
difference on how much government sure
should be so the problem I think
libertarianism has a number as a term as
the other problems one is it's a little
clinical sounding and it has too many
syllables and it makes you sound a
little bit awkward and it sounds maybe a
little too canonical you know like we we
have a list of things you have to
believe you know like this this this
it's all rooted in this kind of
reductionist more commonly these days
that's rooted in this kind of in the
reductionist non-aggression principle
which is a fine principle as a rule of
thumb but it's not a good it doesn't
describe the whole of life so the other
problem is that libertarianism is is a
new term so it doesn't have a deep
history so we can't look back
and say oh look the libertarians freed
the slaves the libertarians acknowledge
to the rights of women the the
libertarians gave us the commercial
society that built the middle class and
brought dignity to the average person
right if they had existed as a party
they would have done those they would
have done those yeah where's the
Liberals who did that but it delivers so
we changed our name so now we can't like
feel a sense of pride in our past so it
doesn't have a past hmm that's a problem
so we're libertarians tend to be
detached from their own history for that
reason and I think it's a it's a problem
as a word problem the second problems
that libertarianism doesn't have a
universal of usage like where's
liberalism does you can go to Spain
describe yourself in liberal Brazil
there's there's liberals in Germany
there's liberals Everett there's a word
for liberalism in every language and it
more or less means the same thing except
in the United States right so so if we
acquiesce to this term libertarian and
just wipe out our liberal history we're
cutting ourselves off both from the
world and from our own history it's so
funny because you've just said it in a
far better way than I think I've ever
really laid it out but people will say
to me Dave stop saying you're a liberal
and I don't want to stop saying them I
get that I'm fighting an uphill battle
right now right I'm a salmon swimming
upstream this is gonna be tough but I
don't want to deny what is the truth
just because because it's tough it's who
you are
and you want to you want to have it an
ancestry you know you want to look back
and and see the the champions of the
meta cheese and and 15th century
Florence and say I know those people
those are my people yeah you know the
people who long for a world without
slavery you know in the early 19th
century the people who wanted world free
trade and fought hard for it those are
our people that's our history I mean we
were we were born as part of a long
stream of emancipation that's been
taking place for 500 years that's our
movement our people our history let's
embrace it I'm with you brother yeah all
right so are there any of those
liberals part of the Democratic Party
anymore
do those people exist that's strange
things are happening on the left very
strange things and I I'm not sure I
should applaud you for one sec I have my
original question here was I wanted to
do the deep dive on the right so we're
gonna go we will get no I promise you
we're gonna get to them yeah the deep
dive on the far right gets us into a
very dark place yeah all right well
maybe that night so maybe the whole
second half will be on that let me just
put that out there right now that's what
we'll do really sighs it's not getting
out of my depression having my book it
was terrible all right so our whole
second half is gonna be what my first
question was about let's just keep going
on yeah out for now so so strange things
have happened to the left let's just
mention that the the phrase cultural
appropriation for example now when when
did that the approbation of the Society
of cultural appropriation came out over
what two three years ago you know four
five I don't know academia is weird it
may have been brewing for ten years yeah
but when I first heard about it I
thought that is the craziest bunch of
nonsense I've ever heard I mean
civilization is nothing but cultural
appropriation has been doing this since
since the 9th century you know at the
height of the comfo Vincey omits in
Spain where different Judaism and Islam
and Christianity came together in this
beautiful melting pot where we all learn
from each other and the cultures began
to blend and our religions began to
change in our our outlook on life began
to because we learn from each other if
we stay isolated in our little tribes
we're never gonna progress and and and
the idea that and I don't know if it was
inadvertent or what happened we can talk
about this but that when when suddenly
you're told you cannot have affection
for another culture and take what you
find valuable and and learn learn for
yourself and live a better life that is
very strange they seem to think it's
cultural annihilation not cultural
appropriation right like they seem to
know that this is something that will
lead to the destruction of that culture
when in fact yeah it actually spreads
the ideas of the culture the foods that
were losing the the ideas not just
they're generating culture
as a scarce good like it's a property
but it's not the magic of culture which
is the same magic of ideas is resides in
its infinite reproducibility and its
malleability this is something that the
world of ideas can do that the physical
world cannot do and if we don't make
that distinction we're gonna get very
confused do you see what I mean and
cultures spread and they're infinite and
they can constantly change and that's
the magic and beauty of culture we can't
get that out of this glass of water this
table right there they're bound by the
constraints of scarcity but the world of
ideas is as magical it's like a constant
constant infinite sandstorm you know
unpredictable and and constantly
changing and we can we can take a
culture for ourselves without taking it
from somebody else right it's just it's
it's it's reproductive reproduction it's
infinite reproduction so loaves and the
fishes
isn't isn't the beauty to that America
has done this better than anyone
perhaps in the history of the world you
just references some other points in
time but that we have taken in more
cultures and you said the phrase melting
pot I mean that that's what we designed
and set up here the most beautiful
melting pot ever I lived in New York
City for most of my life most of my
adult life at least and would be on
subway cars and you are on that car
with absolutely everyone with I have
white guys with dreadlocks and the whole
thing and guess what you may not like
everybody and you may not like the way
this guy smells and that person may be
doing this but we're all there and I
live in together it's magic you know
it's it's it really it's commerce it's
because this country elevated the
commercial ethos to be the the highest
thing the great ennobling factor of
human life and its commerce that brings
people together and we experience that
every day you know you can in a
commercial setting people aren't
fighting each other they're they're
getting along I mean I I find I'm with
you I go to that I go to a restaurant
and I get served by some guy from
from Pakistan it's it it's a chance to
meet somebody new it's a chance to
engage somebody to have a personal
relationship with somebody who's serving
you and you're serving them and you
experience this magic of exchange
Benjamin constant used to talk about
this and the 1830's how how how commerce
brought to the world a new understanding
of freedom and a new opportunity for us
to find value in each other in service
of each other and can America just
flourished in commerce and that's why
that's why we have you know the the
diversity and this melting pot you call
it and this rich cultural life you know
it's so funny because I'm so keenly
aware of it right now not only because
of the conversations I'm having and
because people are screaming about this
stuff all the time but you know I'm on
this tour with Jordan Pederson and when
I go to every airport that I go to a 90
percent of the time unless someone said
a car for me I take an uber and it's hop
in whatever rubra shows and there is
there there is every single type of
person that looks every which way and
every little or every sexuality and
usually I talk a little bit to them it
you know and it's like man these are
just people I've you know I'm maybe for
the same way you know I live in Atlanta
[Music]
let's shift let's talk about the scary
right are you ready I tried to do this
bad we did the happy stuff yes we're
going to plunge look you know Dave when
I began to research this thing I
probably ended up reading about 200
books on this topic why the end and and
I'm a happy guy I like happy things are
like technology I'm an optimistic guy
but this really put me in a dark place
digging through this history from from
Hegel essentially up to Julius Caesar
Avila and the and the post-war Nazi
movement and realizing that there is an
intellectual strain that stretched over
all of these years okay so let let
silver two hundred years yeah so let's
go back 200 years when you talk about
right-wing collectivism yep because I
think most of my audience now
understands what left-wing collectivism
is because that's what we've got right
now very in a very strong way talk to me
about right-wing collectivism okay David
I gotta tell you a story
I love Luda von Mises I think he was a
genius right and I thought I'd read all
of his works but and there was a
transcript of a lecture he gave in 1956
at the San Francisco Public Library and
he had about three sentences in there
that just knocked me over and I couldn't
believe it it because they explained so
much he says something like this and
he's speaking casually right he says
Hegel ruined German philosophy for a
century
his original followers became believed
that all of history would end in the
Prussian state and the Prussian Church
having all power and the end of
individualism they became the right he
galleons that became the Nazis his the
dissidents of this of the right had
galleons became the left to galleons
they wanted a universal transformation
of humanity and a historical drive to to
something other than the commercial
society they became the Marxist and and
the communists and he said that that's
it's the left right he galleon ISM and
that explains pretty much all the
political history and I
that I thought no that explains more
than practically any other book I've
ever read and so I began to begin to
explore this I understood the left to
Gallienus I understood Marxism I mean
those were those were our professors
right and they're annoying but what I
did not understand was the right
Hegelian ISM and what that what that
tradition looks like is that the throne
and altar this this historic sister you
that the nation should constitute its
own unit of profound integrity that that
that is more important than the
individual and that commercial society
was too chaotic that it that that it was
leading us giving us the wrong kind of
progress that it was flattening out the
hierarchies that we need to have an
orderly life right this is this is the
right hey Gillian pitch that ultimately
by mid 20th century becomes this very
dangerous dangerous movement in Europe
you know it became catastrophic but it
gradually emerged from all the way from
from Hegel because this is at the the
end of the endless seemingly endless
franco-prussian war there's this battle
at the Battle of Jena that that Germany
lost and the explanation for that was
that it was a temporary setback that
history was going to determine that
Germany would rise just despite despite
the choices of individuals history's got
its wind it's like meta-narrative that
that that was going to override
everything Hegel himself was a
theologian by the way and so and so this
this view began to kind of spread
throughout German academia and it was it
ended up being imported to the United
States through through circuitous means
but one of the great theorists of the of
the 1840s who and 1850s who brought the
suit to the nine states of Frederick
list who was one of the first economists
to repudiate the free trade tradition of
the Smith Ian Manchester ides and now
was celebrating the nation as a unit as
productive power and and believed in
tariff walls which was strange and a
viridis book but and that had a huge
influence of American trade policies
actually the late 19th century and and
it began to flow out from there so
Thomas Carlyle and and and Britain now
begins to celebrate the great man theory
of history and really were nothing
without Napoleon without without
gigantic figures that we can worship
admire and and and our individuality
should be subsumed within them they act
for us their godlike you know and and
and it was Thomas Carlyle who first
coined the phrase quote coined the
phrase to describe acute economics as
being the dismal science and the reason
he said that is that every economist he
knew imagined a world without slavery
and he said you can't have a world South
slavery that's that's a dreadful world
without slaves you don't have masters
right and we need a world with masters
and slaves so we can we can have a
vision of hierarchy and greatness
without that we don't have greatness so
you begin to see this building of this
intellectual apparatus that was not left
to galleon there wasn't Marxist he was
actually anti-marxist another strange
way but as an alternative form of
collectivism it began with a kind of a
historicism and a celebration of
nationalism of the German state it began
to grow with this there's this
alternative theory of trade that we
should we should build up tariff walls
and Carlyle with his with his great man
theory of history and then and then
Ruskin and and Britain with his hatred
of commercial society because they
believe that somehow Commerce was
ruining quality and culture and was
giving us mass production about we all
need to be really doing this is is
living in guilds and and making our own
stuff you know because we're gonna
destroy English life and English country
life and so so a full-scale reactionary
trend on the right began to develop and
we're always a racial element
so that's what's interesting I'm so glad
you asked that because it comes about
first of all through through nationalism
now in the in the early 1820s and 1830s
this the celebration of nationalism now
you have to ask yourself what is a
nation but what do we mean when we say
nation and and I'm taking this a lot of
this from from an S I gave it given to
1882 by Ernst ran in a great French
historian looking back at the rise of
nationalism said there's only five ways
you can consider nationalism we consider
the geographic definition so we're just
living the space there's a dynastic
element we can all trace our lineage
back to the great founders of our our
nation there's a language theory of
nationalism we all speak the same
language there's a religious theory of
nationalism we all worship God and a
precise assembly I believe in
transubstantiation do you believe in
consubstantiation we can't be part of a
nation in that case right and then
finally and probably most insidiously
there was a racial the ratio of you and
that came along and essentially the
1860s and 1870s with a misapplication of
Darwinian theory and scientific racism
came along and that swept through
academia particularly in the United
States like nothing you've ever seen it
was absolutely astonishing how much
racism with orthodoxy in American
academia in the 1890s from the very
first monograph published by the
American Economic Association by a game
I think his name is Andre Hoffman was
called race traits of the American Negro
and the first chapter dress goes all-in
you know it's it's it's the the horror
of the black people they don't have the
right values they can't can't save money
that is terrible shiftless and and lazy
and ghastly and uncivilized Abel and now
chapter 2 the Jews you know these people
I don't know what they've got this
crazed out of control commercial ethics
they can't stop hoarding money they
really went for it yeah and then chapter
3 is the slauson's and so on and so the
American
Association you know and then and there
was essentially no what do you think was
happening in the world there that it was
taking Italian what was happening baby
let's a fair had transformed society so
dramatically that the the intellectuals
felt that they had lost control now you
might think that when the world becomes
massively prosperous and we suddenly
have cities rising up and we've got
steel that's transversing large bodies
of water and we're developing the
telephone and indoor electricity and and
people are living longer lives and and
so much wealth is being created that
everybody was data to say Hawaii we've
found the answers but the gatekeepers
who had controlled everything for so
long so that's so interesting because of
revolt this is sort of what it feels
like now to me the gatekeepers we've had
so much success
there's someone there's so many reasons
right now to understand how great
everything is that book right there by
Steven Pinker and light mr. right book
is is all about how great things are and
has a very probably we are there is less
violence now in all sorts of the revolt
you always have to be on the gamekeepers
aren't having you know not in the
narrative intellectuals are what
regional classic calls the Clara Sea
right so it's it's the the high-end
intellectuals it's the power elite
bureaucrats and and the public the the
permanent people keepers of our civic
culture you know it's it's the political
class and so this is sort of what my
audience that maybe not families this is
sort of what the New York Times is sort
of right like yeah maybe I shouldn't
have said it so obviously but like
that's kind of what it is like that
class a ruling class yeah the ruling
class and and they were in full-scale
revolt oh they did not like what was
happening to the world in the 1880s and
90s because of the loss of control and
so the the scientific racism came along
to add to the celebration of
dictatorship and the and and
protectionism and the new nationalism to
add a very insidious element which
culminated in eugenics ideology and
that's when it gets very strange and
this is where this is where they're
reading gets very difficult because now
you're reading all the way into your the
the the 1910s
the works of Oswald Spengler you know
the the right he galleon German theorist
and enraptured every American here
they're all reading his book oh my god
the decline of the West we better
reconstitute ourselves as a tribe or
we're gonna be eaten alive by but
there's a strain of that that's still
going on right now you know there's
nothing new you like and and you know
the this this very funny book called the
passing of the great race by Madison
grant that was on every coffee table and
the late nineteenth and early 1920s you
know was was forecasting doom for the
white race you know and he was he was a
fascinating figure because you know of
course I British because as it everybody
did everybody the Great Gatsby makes a
passing reference to it it was that
popular it was that popular and I tell
you there's not a single outright racist
alive today who hasn't is not repeating
those cliches that were written by
Madison grant it's all pseudoscience is
all just nonsense and it's just
ridiculous embarrassing but but it keeps
being resurrected but here's what's
interesting
he was a thoroughgoing Darwinian because
she recall that Darwin had two great
books Origin of Species the other was
called The Descent of Man and The
Descent of Man had the very unfortunate
paragraph in there where he gret regrets
the invention of mass disease killing
cures essentially it's like if we keep
curing people and we keep feeding
inferior people and and curing disease
then then our genetic stocks gonna go
down and down you know so so they're all
kind of playing off this little passage
the Madison grant was was not an unusual
by American acts to academic standards
at all they oh they this is Orthodox in
the 1810 to 1920s what made Madison
grant interesting you can look up his
Wikipedia entry right now if you look it
up it'll it'll celebrate him as the as
the father of the National Park Service
well in the course of my research I
wanted to know what is the connection
between Madison's grants hardcore
eugenics based racism and his
environmentalism hmm what is the
relationship there and it's not just to
people usually people have haven't
figured out in their own heads I went
through and read some of his works on
him on the environment it turns out that
he had a master race theory of nature
and he went to the California Redwoods
and he looked at these glorious mighty
trees and he was horrified to see they
were being cut down for for making
coffee tables and boats and things like
that he thought it was dis genic to
nature
so he wanted the master race but
California ed woods too to be protected
and that's that so that's why he started
the National Park Service and now the
left Harrelson is as this great as a
great visionary environmentalist but
actually he was like a tree Nazi I don't
know how you want to call it green ice
very creepy stuff we don't have enough
Nazi labels being thrown around now
we're gonna have tree not you ensure
that order he was nuts but you know you
could just march through the history and
it gets worse and worse and then to me
Dave it all it all culminates in the
works of Karl Schmitt from the from the
late 1930s and is in his amazing book
called the concept of the political and
if you'll give me just one quick second
to explain this because because you as a
liberal I would need to read this book
because it's the most passionate I would
say an even competent attack under Bill
ISM written in the 20th century now Carl
Schmitt that's a jurist a brilliant man
and a philosopher and a hardcore Nazi
okay he wasn't tried at Nuremberg he
escaped I'm merely an intellectual ok
sure his book concept of the political
says what's wrong with liberalism I tell
you it's dull
nothing happens nothing dramatic there's
nothing just requires no courage
whatsoever liberalism is a life in which
we all benefit from each other's
presence we all just trade with each
other what kind of life is that where we
all just are kind of the same and like
each other and hope backyard barbecues
and baseball games and and just get
richer and live longer lives and send
our kid to college this is terrible
we need to live big dramatic mighty bold
courageous transformative lives and live
in times that that that that that are
shocking that are amazing that make our
lives worth living that requires above
all else
politics liberalism imagines a world
without politics that's a terrifying
world what we need is a world of
politics and and he continues to lay it
out chapter by chapter why we have to
destroy liberalism and celebrate the
concept of the political and for him
that means having friends and having
enemies defeating your enemies and
rallying around your friends now who are
your friends and who your enemies and
Carl Schmitt says at some level it
doesn't matter what matters is that they
exist and then the state the powerful
men will choose them for us they will
decide who our friends and our enemies
are now let's be clear what we mean by
enemy I just don't mean something you
don't like I mean the willingness to
kill there has to be the presence of
real bloodshed in your time for you to
have a sufficiently prescient sense of
any meanness so that you'll feel the
intense desire to rally around your
friend for your friends and experience
that that the the awesomeness that only
comes with belonging to a group so so he
says so here the end feeling there is
that you can't achieve what what the
real purpose of a human is that's right
that you can't experience whatever the
the highs of belongingness essentially
and and the life of drama the a big
important life without being part of a
kind of a group on the move the
slaughtering and enemies and so we have
to have the presence of a bloodshed so
it really is the opposite of live in let
live it is it so through through through
bloodshed comes life and without without
bloodshed and death and violence and
politics then you're just gonna live at
an irrelevant life and we can't have
that so he was in many ways the
philosophical architect of the Holocaust
again not a leftist not a Marxist
although he dabbled in a you find this a
little from a lot of these right
collectivists the right and elegance
that they dabbled guys
Vernor son Bart writers once a communist
have later became a Nazi Carl Schmitt
dabbled and and leftism and then went
full right and it was in many ways the
culmination of the writer galleon
ideology and the increment so it's it's
a book worth reading and contemplating
and I would say to anybody who rejects
liberalism you know be honest about
where you're going with this this is the
opposite of liberalism and celebration
of death in the works of Karl Schmitt
very powerful thinker highly regarded
even today worth reading and worth
reflecting on what kind of world you
want to live in you want to live in at
peace with others what do you want to
slaughter your friends a slaughter your
enemies and rally with your friends so
move me from that point 1930s into of
course obviously into Nazi Germany and
so actually well yeah and and you know
my book really does end in nineteen
fifty and not necessarily didn't have to
but I started to get really queasy about
what happened after World War two a lot
of the writing Elian movement went
underground you know and and became a
kind of a quiet neo-nazi movement that
never really had access to social media
they were clear they weren't in academia
obviously and but the ideology never
entirely went away and and it was just
lying in wait wait waiting for the
failure of the left and for the
resentment of the population against the
left to rise up and receive who get it a
fevered enough pitch that it would it
would then come on full force and that's
really what's happening in Europe Russia
United States it's an alternative form
of collectivism it's got a different
flavor a different orientation a
different kind of resentments but it
still drags in this gigantic history of
writing gillion ideology the celebration
of the dick great man dictated the
protectionism the anti-immigration the
nativism the nationalism that could take
any one of five forms including the
racism what do you make about how now
and it's obviously largely because of
the internet it seems to be happening in
so many places at once we're seeing this
unholy it's an oddly unholy alliance
that I've seen the collective
left and then that drives in minutes
exactly what you're saying then you've
got this other day that's just waiting
there for these guys to go to bananas
yeah it's like ah we got all the easy
answers meanwhile you have the Liberals
and everyone all the decent 80% of us
yeah better trying to live unless it's
part of it part of it really comes down
to this there's a weird a sociological
[Music]
joining me today is an author the
editorial director of the American
Institute for Economic Research as well
as a senior fellow at the Austrian
economic center Jeffrey Tucker welcome
to the Rubin report thanks for having me
good to be here I almost wore the same
bowtie my friend really I should have
brought one extra for you yeah that
would have been work on this all right
there's a ton I want to talk to ya
you're sort of one of these people that
are right around all of the topics that
I'm talking about from freedom and
liberty and free speech and the battle
between the left and the right and all
that but your new book and I want to get
the title absolutely correct right wing
collectivism the other threat to Liberty
I thought that would be the spot for us
to kick this off because most of the
people watching the show know that I've
mostly focused on the left sure yeah was
my home I was a progressive I've woken
up to what I shouldn't real liberalism
is obviously and that has nothing to do
with the modern life but sometimes
people say Dave you don't critique the
right enough so let's dive in what's
interesting about talk about it is that
so often the left and the right are not
as distinguishable as they seem to be
for example the this trade stuff you
know Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump
basically agreed yeah you know how do
you account for that and and now will
you see all the celebration of the
working classes you know you're gonna
get again the trumpian right agreeing
with Bernie Sanders on that the left is
evermore trending nationalist and it's
immigration policies for example that
didn't use to be the case so how is the
left well you know listen well like
Bernie Sanders complained that free free
immigration is is a coke a Koch
Industries plot basically to provide the
capitalist class cheap workers for
example now that you would have never
found anybody on the Left 20 years ago
saying that but but now you know it's
happening you know the the the the the
hatred of the of Commerce and and the
the merchant class is so intense now
that if a luxury resort and
in Florida wants to hire soon some
immigrants to work for them then the
left is saying oh no this is this is
terrible because this cab this
capitalism at work so here's trying to
see the strange blending the left and
the right have different cultural
pitches different appeals different
constituencies but they both have this
this agenda that's that boils down to
the to the use of power is this a little
bit of just what people refer to as the
horseshoe theory that the more that the
sides have become sort of extreme that
they're oddly that may be right I've
heard this this horseshoe thing I tend
to think that's a little bit superficial
I mean I look at it a little bit more
historically and you see since since
liberalism was born in the world in the
18th century really light Middle Ages
but when the revolt against liberalism
began in the early 19th century right
too much change too much wealth the
wrong people are getting rich there's
not enough control what are we going to
do about our religion our language our
race you know this the revolt began to
grow from about the 1820s and and
intensified and spread to the United
States Britain really began to take root
in continental Europe there took two
forms there was a left form and a right
form and at each country they took they
took on different iterations different
names you know so so in Britain you had
the Tories then you had the labor labor
party they both wanted to use the state
for their own purposes then you always
had the opposition party which is the
Liberals you know and and that's the way
it's fleshed out itself in country after
country the Liberal Party has always
been the people said why don't we just
let society be let people live their
lives let them choose a religion of
their own of their own choice if they
don't hurt anybody it's not a problem
let's have free speech this have
universal rights that's how rights for
this get rid of slavery let's have
rights acknowledge the existence of
women's rights equality of freedom for
everybody leave everybody alone
that's the liberal position that's a
pretty good position it's a it's a
beautiful position and it's what I
favorites what I think it's what built
civilization coming out of the religious
wars of the high middle ages we
discovered this idea of freedom we tried
it it worked
but there's but there's a brief there's
always been a revolt brewing against it
a resentment resentment against it again
resentment against the commercial class
too much change too much wealth wrong
people getting wealthy we're not
controlling demographics well enough
there's not enough equality whatever the
thing is it takes different forms in
different countries and at different
times in different places but ultimately
the right and the left are ideologies of
control and power and liberalism has
always been the alternative to that so
so we keep having to rediscover this
again and again in every generation yeah
well that's why now I'm so happy that
there is as you said to me right before
we started the phrase classical
liberalism now is coming back you know
you mean you had it on TV every now and
again I like to think that maybe I had a
little something to do with it you know
and meaning to me
it is the only current antidote to the
problems that we have either the the
more state power that the Democratic
socialists want as they've sort of
ransacked their own party and purged all
of the Liberals and it's also the
antidote for all of the people if you
think Trump is all of the horrible
things that people say about him all
time what's the antidote
the antidote isn't to get somebody else
in that more power yeah the antidote
obviously is to take power away from
that that's what liberalism and I my
hope is that that there are the good
people who left the center of the left
that are looking at the emergence of the
Trump problem will reconsider the uses
of power and the executive state and why
do we build this gigantic machinery of
the total state if it's so vulnerable to
being captured by our enemies right
right the real question that we're at
right now if you believe this thing has
been captured by the Russians or
whatever it is it's like yeah well okay
yeah and answering your own question I
hope that we can we can rekindle a kind
of a new resurgence or I do have to
credit you and Jordan Peterson for this
I mean I've been working at it for about
ten years to try to bring back this not
just the term liberal but the concept of
the brill ism
- to public life and but it's been
difficult because because because we do
have this state that creates a kind of
moral and intellectual and ideological
hazard
somebody's got to control it and and now
that we built it over the last hundred
years this this this total state of
massive taxes regulations interventions
run in people's lives everybody's trying
to get hold of it and grab it and beat
up their enemies and it's a problem it's
a serious problem so when people say to
me and we've discussed this on the show
a bunch of times before and I've dressed
address this in several forums when
people say to me wait a minute when
you're when you say you're a classical
liberal you talk about lazy for
economics and getting the government out
of the way and all those things really
this is just a repackaged libertarianism
or you're just afraid to say that you're
a conservative because it's still not
cool
or something that is how would you
define the difference between say
classical liberal and a libertarian
let's talk about that because because
after World War two these neologisms
these new terms came along one was
conservatism it wasn't really used
before the early 1950s Russell Kirk's
book called the mindset of a
conservative something like the
conservative mind I think is what it was
called and libertarianism was again
first used at about 1957 by the
translator of the works of Basquiat the
problem was the term liberal had been
captured you know by the new dealers
mmm-hmm as early as 1933 once they
acquiesced to the idea of the corporate
of a state andr blame the Great
Depression on capitalism that became a
problem for liberalism that kept the
term liberalism but they were no longer
liberal because they were suddenly for
big government here before big
government and and even worse the
corporate state and actually we can just
be more blunt about it and say that back
in the 1930s is this this ideology had a
name the name is fascist yeah okay so so
they caved right I mean in the New York
Times in 1933 the New York Times
magazine was celebrating the great
professor Mussolini
and how he and FDR shared a vision for
the planned economy so that's the world
we were living in back then so we lost
the term liberal after World War 2 there
was an attempt to to just speak language
and to and to describe who we are and on
one hand you had this new thing called
conservatism and they they they kind of
sampled some of the story
Tory like nostalgia for the past a
little bit of revanche ISM you know
let's recapture what we've lost didn't
you on the other hand who had the
genuine liberals and they coined the
term libertarianism which had been
sitting on the shelf since the late 19th
century now most of the people who call
themselves libertarians in the late 19th
century America and England were
anarchists socialists but nobody had
bothered with the term for decades and
decades
so Dean Russell said well nobody's using
that word why don't we use it and that
was closer to the truth of what they
were in effect well what was interesting
about that is as Dean Russell described
it in his 1957 article it was a synonym
for what was once called liberal right
he didn't think it was a tweak or an
improvement or a distillation or
refinement or a new dogmatic way of
describing the bill ISM he thought it
was liberalism so I need to read that
because I mean that's how I feel I don't
know if someone says me Dave you're a
libertarian I don't mind that if we need
labels I don't mind that lame I don't
mind you know we can split the
difference on how much government sure
should be so the problem I think
libertarianism has a number as a term as
the other problems one is it's a little
clinical sounding and it has too many
syllables and it makes you sound a
little bit awkward and it sounds maybe a
little too canonical you know like we we
have a list of things you have to
believe you know like this this this
it's all rooted in this kind of
reductionist more commonly these days
that's rooted in this kind of in the
reductionist non-aggression principle
which is a fine principle as a rule of
thumb but it's not a good it doesn't
describe the whole of life so the other
problem is that libertarianism is is a
new term so it doesn't have a deep
history so we can't look back
and say oh look the libertarians freed
the slaves the libertarians acknowledge
to the rights of women the the
libertarians gave us the commercial
society that built the middle class and
brought dignity to the average person
right if they had existed as a party
they would have done those they would
have done those yeah where's the
Liberals who did that but it delivers so
we changed our name so now we can't like
feel a sense of pride in our past so it
doesn't have a past hmm that's a problem
so we're libertarians tend to be
detached from their own history for that
reason and I think it's a it's a problem
as a word problem the second problems
that libertarianism doesn't have a
universal of usage like where's
liberalism does you can go to Spain
describe yourself in liberal Brazil
there's there's liberals in Germany
there's liberals Everett there's a word
for liberalism in every language and it
more or less means the same thing except
in the United States right so so if we
acquiesce to this term libertarian and
just wipe out our liberal history we're
cutting ourselves off both from the
world and from our own history it's so
funny because you've just said it in a
far better way than I think I've ever
really laid it out but people will say
to me Dave stop saying you're a liberal
and I don't want to stop saying them I
get that I'm fighting an uphill battle
right now right I'm a salmon swimming
upstream this is gonna be tough but I
don't want to deny what is the truth
just because because it's tough it's who
you are
and you want to you want to have it an
ancestry you know you want to look back
and and see the the champions of the
meta cheese and and 15th century
Florence and say I know those people
those are my people yeah you know the
people who long for a world without
slavery you know in the early 19th
century the people who wanted world free
trade and fought hard for it those are
our people that's our history I mean we
were we were born as part of a long
stream of emancipation that's been
taking place for 500 years that's our
movement our people our history let's
embrace it I'm with you brother yeah all
right so are there any of those
liberals part of the Democratic Party
anymore
do those people exist that's strange
things are happening on the left very
strange things and I I'm not sure I
should applaud you for one sec I have my
original question here was I wanted to
do the deep dive on the right so we're
gonna go we will get no I promise you
we're gonna get to them yeah the deep
dive on the far right gets us into a
very dark place yeah all right well
maybe that night so maybe the whole
second half will be on that let me just
put that out there right now that's what
we'll do really sighs it's not getting
out of my depression having my book it
was terrible all right so our whole
second half is gonna be what my first
question was about let's just keep going
on yeah out for now so so strange things
have happened to the left let's just
mention that the the phrase cultural
appropriation for example now when when
did that the approbation of the Society
of cultural appropriation came out over
what two three years ago you know four
five I don't know academia is weird it
may have been brewing for ten years yeah
but when I first heard about it I
thought that is the craziest bunch of
nonsense I've ever heard I mean
civilization is nothing but cultural
appropriation has been doing this since
since the 9th century you know at the
height of the comfo Vincey omits in
Spain where different Judaism and Islam
and Christianity came together in this
beautiful melting pot where we all learn
from each other and the cultures began
to blend and our religions began to
change in our our outlook on life began
to because we learn from each other if
we stay isolated in our little tribes
we're never gonna progress and and and
the idea that and I don't know if it was
inadvertent or what happened we can talk
about this but that when when suddenly
you're told you cannot have affection
for another culture and take what you
find valuable and and learn learn for
yourself and live a better life that is
very strange they seem to think it's
cultural annihilation not cultural
appropriation right like they seem to
know that this is something that will
lead to the destruction of that culture
when in fact yeah it actually spreads
the ideas of the culture the foods that
were losing the the ideas not just
they're generating culture
as a scarce good like it's a property
but it's not the magic of culture which
is the same magic of ideas is resides in
its infinite reproducibility and its
malleability this is something that the
world of ideas can do that the physical
world cannot do and if we don't make
that distinction we're gonna get very
confused do you see what I mean and
cultures spread and they're infinite and
they can constantly change and that's
the magic and beauty of culture we can't
get that out of this glass of water this
table right there they're bound by the
constraints of scarcity but the world of
ideas is as magical it's like a constant
constant infinite sandstorm you know
unpredictable and and constantly
changing and we can we can take a
culture for ourselves without taking it
from somebody else right it's just it's
it's it's reproductive reproduction it's
infinite reproduction so loaves and the
fishes
isn't isn't the beauty to that America
has done this better than anyone
perhaps in the history of the world you
just references some other points in
time but that we have taken in more
cultures and you said the phrase melting
pot I mean that that's what we designed
and set up here the most beautiful
melting pot ever I lived in New York
City for most of my life most of my
adult life at least and would be on
subway cars and you are on that car
with absolutely everyone with I have
white guys with dreadlocks and the whole
thing and guess what you may not like
everybody and you may not like the way
this guy smells and that person may be
doing this but we're all there and I
live in together it's magic you know
it's it's it really it's commerce it's
because this country elevated the
commercial ethos to be the the highest
thing the great ennobling factor of
human life and its commerce that brings
people together and we experience that
every day you know you can in a
commercial setting people aren't
fighting each other they're they're
getting along I mean I I find I'm with
you I go to that I go to a restaurant
and I get served by some guy from
from Pakistan it's it it's a chance to
meet somebody new it's a chance to
engage somebody to have a personal
relationship with somebody who's serving
you and you're serving them and you
experience this magic of exchange
Benjamin constant used to talk about
this and the 1830's how how how commerce
brought to the world a new understanding
of freedom and a new opportunity for us
to find value in each other in service
of each other and can America just
flourished in commerce and that's why
that's why we have you know the the
diversity and this melting pot you call
it and this rich cultural life you know
it's so funny because I'm so keenly
aware of it right now not only because
of the conversations I'm having and
because people are screaming about this
stuff all the time but you know I'm on
this tour with Jordan Pederson and when
I go to every airport that I go to a 90
percent of the time unless someone said
a car for me I take an uber and it's hop
in whatever rubra shows and there is
there there is every single type of
person that looks every which way and
every little or every sexuality and
usually I talk a little bit to them it
you know and it's like man these are
just people I've you know I'm maybe for
the same way you know I live in Atlanta
[Music]
joining me today is a lawyer a gun
rights activists and the host of no are
on NRA TV colleano are welcome to the
Rubin report how's it going man how's it
going my friend it's going good it's
good to be in LA I am I'm glad to have
you know we've been trying to do this
for about a year
yeah yeah yeah I just like to think so
yeah it might just be a facade I put on
to avoid people but now and actually but
in reality now it's it's been it's been
a pretty busy year yeah like extremely
so and it doesn't ever seem to slow up
and just what I think it does something
else jumps off well if you think coming
on this show is gonna help slow it down
you are sorely mistaken
yeah well I'm a bit of a masochist in
that regard we'll see by the time this
hour is done work on earth hell we can
write I'm pretty sure there will be some
yeah well don't worry because there will
be equal amounts on me just for a
sitting here with you that's the
interesting thing
you know I it's I don't want to say I've
been blind to it but just being just
seeing some of the reaction and
responses that I got especially for
instance when I was on Maher when I did
Bill Maher you know I saw some of the
comments from I say the other side just
for ease of communication yeah but for
people who largely don't agree with me
in his audience they were like I would
drop the NRA guy on there even a I was a
tweet I responded to yesterday and even
though I was on my no tweeting do that I
like to put myself on because so toxic
in there sometimes how often do you do
that
happy 30 minutes I'm trying to do
weekends and disappearing at all of
August see it man
Twitter's toxic man when you're in the
lane that you and I are in yeah it's
toxic man and it can really even though
you don't think you're taking that in
even just kind of scrolling through
you're taking it in yeah you know and in
it it's like I constantly I developer
this pattern of just yeah don't respond
to that cuz they're baiting you yeah I
mean things of that nature but um I was
I saw a tweet and she's like yeah I
loved Omar oh I love this episode but
you have that NRA guy on it I'm like
Jesus are we not allowed to have
discourse anymore
if especially if it disagrees with with
something that you believe in oh and you
know like this is a very
we're going down if that's good if
that's gonna be the case because you
forget you know we live in this country
together yeah and we're not all the same
there's about 350 million other yeah
might not all think the same thing
exactly pretty crazy it's it's kind of
sad some it will least for me it's a
little disheartening yeah because I grew
up under the guise and understanding the
importance of discourse and being able
to talk things out even if you do
disagree with someone but didn't even
still having the ability to set aside
whatever views I may have on a
particular issue and then be able to
speak of you cordially or have respect
for you even though we don't agree
that's the way I was brought up in so to
see the country kind of falling into
this extremely of erotic divisiveness it
it's a hardening yeah you know I don't
wanna get all emo on you you don't have
to guess cried till the end but that's
exactly why I wanted to have you on
because you you are okay going into
enemy territory I'm not on this enemy
turns yeah but you did you did Mars show
where you knew a certain percentage of
the audience was just gonna hate you
yeah and we talked about it briefly
right before we started but you found
Maher to be basically pretty pretty
respected even kill yeah okay even
though I'm policy he probably disagrees
with you with 8080 pretty much yeah and
you know and it was something that I
ended up respecting about him and in
that regard cos like I said I I kind of
I went in prepared for I didn't go in to
do war but I went and prepared for it
you know it was like prepared for the
worst hope for the best and I tell you I
got the best in a sense of it was a it
was a discourse where he challenged me
but it wasn't this kind of tumultuous
kind of flooding of the heads where it
just turned into something that was just
ugly yeah well he wasn't trying to get
yet yeah trying to understand you
because that that you know I'm trying to
do that here I there's a couple other
places where people are trying to do
that but yeah that's the thing that's
been lost and that's an interesting
thing you point out there it's I think
sometimes people take offense to that
idea it's like I don't your intruder
intriguing I think intrigue kind of
offends people sometimes because it's
like we all grow up with a typical
understanding what we expect certain
people to be like and then when certain
things don't fit it's like that's
interesting how did you get there right
and I think when it's innocent like that
I don't think there's an issue there
when you use it to try to kind of muscle
people into believing a certain thing
based on what they are then that's when
we start having problems you know what I
mean it's like you see me it's like how
do you as a black guy like it happened
to me when I first started doing what I
did with the NRA Russell Simmons and
I'll never forget this I was like I was
like in Virginia Beach I think and
Russell said I I did my first sets of
videos and rolled out with the NRA and I
get this tweet from Russell Simmons and
he's like how can you as a young black
man push Daddy you get you know the
typical rhetoric in that regard even
though he often is all about trying to
get people to exactly which is really
yeah and so I responded I said you know
like I didn't know advocating for self
defense and self-reliance was a bad
thing I didn't know that only non black
people are allowed to do that right and
so that was kind of like my first foray
into that world of wait a minute people
have an expectation of me based on my
race that I'm not gonna say I was
oblivious to but it just when it was
coming from people that look like me as
well with the same level of intensity
that's when I go WOW okay alright so
here that's what this is yeah okay so I
won I want to back up to a little bit of
childhood and growing up because you're
evolutions kind of dream but let's just
say with this for one second because I
think there's something really
interesting about that thing right there
that often if you listen to the media
they'll tell you that police are hunting
down black men and all of this and then
at the same time you're saying well we
should be able to arm ourselves and
protect ourselves from the white
supremacist but meaning that lawfully
and legally we should be able to take
care of ourselves if you believe that
the system is so corrupt and the police
are so corrupt and there's racists
running around everywhere you're trying
to bring the power back to yourself
that's to me that's very empowering yet
somehow this seemingly is lost when this
conversation hits the mainstream it's
amazing I don't understand it it's like
in one breath you're talking about let's
let's take the colonel ministration for
instance
paint it as this the most vicious and
vile thing on a planet and then it's
like well then let's give the same guns
that you have for your own self reliance
I would you would use to protect
yourself against this monster that you
said existed and let's give it to them
and then place your entire reliance with
respect to your safety on the same
people you you're telling me I should be
scared of it doesn't you're horrible
give them your weapons what it's it's
mind-blowing right and so what it does
though it exposes this notion that the
there's a absence of ability to I don't
say mobility or people just choosing not
to critically think mm-hmm you know and
we're at a point now where we have
access and that's like it amazes me some
of the questions that I get and it's
like you literally have a device that
gives you access to all of the
information in the world in the case of
my overabundant ass I have two of them
right and it's like it takes you to
follow I assume you have like eight guns
on you at all right yeah you know and
it's it's amazing how when we have such
access to so much information we've
become so lazy at reaching for it this
was almost like back in the day when we
didn't have this access we we more
adamant about search searching and
seeking it out and critically thinking
about things it's almost we become too
fast for our own good right so the
obsession now is instant information
into the information regardless of
whether or not the information is of any
use or good or the or if it's even
correct yeah you know and so it's it
hate it because you know I logged I've
done all of those things and I actually
people get mad at me when I don't jump
on a certain issue quick enough and when
I say cook enough within 30 seconds I'll
see that sometimes it goes down in the
news and a literally two minutes go by
or I'm at dinner and I wasn't looking my
phone and then I'll get a slew of tweets
people I see you didn't comment on he
must be in on it
good god paid off god forbid it involves
a black person and there's a gun within
10 miles I have to jump on it yeah you
know and in their some cases I
understand there are some people who do
who are just now getting into this who
are just now getting in the fire
and they are black right and you know
maybe they look to me for understanding
and direction because I've been doing it
for so long so that I understand but but
other people it's just this constant
desire to be like ah ha I got you I knew
you were the kind of deal right and
it's like like give me 30 seconds to
even read the article you just sent me
ten seconds ago yeah right and then from
there and then not to mention you know
there's a thing called work that I do
so yeah I'm still doing that as well so
I'm you know I'm juggling a lot of
things I don't have to tell you you
probably 310 more articles to even
ascertain anything close to the truth
bingo and that's the one thing that I I
think a lot of people don't do and I
almost tweeted that the other day I go
you know it's very dangerous to read
headlines especially in the day and age
of clickbait titles to just read
headlines and then make an opinion based
off of that or think you know understand
what happened in a particular story
because there are so many articles that
I've read about me yeah and what I've
said where the headline said one thing
and to cover their asses within the
article they'll clarify exactly what
that what it is that I said but they're
banking on the idea that people are just
gonna read the headlines and then run
with that yeah and so it ends up making
a fool of you fool of people what's your
personal policy on that about how to
respond to that do you go all in on the
fight do you ignore it because I this
has happened to me not just in the last
week and daily be said I was an all
right cheerleader you're black I think
so how am i doing for the fur and all
right you you suck well no I mean but
this is the level of pity but but then
it's about how much time do you want to
invest in in defending yourself and by
doing that defense do you just add
intensity to the people going hi see we
can get him to defend himself and then
before you know your whole life is
dedicated to defending yourself from
fake attacks rather than doing the work
that you care about two things one
you're they do the teachers are
dangerous
you're dangerous not because you agree
with me in certain certain issues you're
dangerous in the fact that you're just
simply willing to talk to me
so for it's the same thing happened when
I did I did the interview with killer
Mike mmm-hmm
right they jumped all over him not
because of what he said
but just because he sat down I had the
conversation with me yeah half the time
they don't even listen oh that's that's
interesting you point it out because I'm
like how can anyone watch this interview
and not walk away with saying you know
that was a great conversation about two
people who don't agree on everything but
there's some things we agree on he's
like because they didn't watch it that
sounds like what do you mean it's like I
had just this weird blonde moment right
yeah I'm like what do you mean he's like
he didn't watch it he's like they don't
actually watch the video they just read
the title and then assume they know what
happened in the video and then make
their opinion from there yeah I'm like
Danny right I hate going down the weeds
with too much of this because it feels
like we're just responding to all of the
craziness but even in the evenin like
the YouTube ecosystem yeah when we put
videos up sometimes within 10 seconds
there's a hundred comments that was an
hour I want that time machine because I
would be a lot more productive but it's
always the haters that do it that's why
I want to bring it up cuz it because
then that hate is the thing that's
always leading us and then I think that
brings it back to where you started a
moment ago which is that we're in this
polarized thing and because the haters
are sort of paving the road and everyone
else is just going down the road I think
a few of us are actually trying to find
a better Road that more of us can get I
the interesting thing about the
discourse the way it is now right and so
our politics have become our
entertainment that's the one that's the
dangerous aspect right so if it's not
vitriolic if it's not snarky if it's not
any of those things it people don't pay
attention to it and I'm the biggest
advocate of light all right look if you
if you don't agree with me on something
you're not to be an ass about it yeah
right now can I be snarky yeah no I can
absolutely be snarky but what I what I
tried to do to respond to your initial
question you asked him how do I like how
do I go all-in do I respond so like for
instance on Twitter what I've kind of
held myself back to doing now is if I
can tell that the person is later he's
seeking out an answer or response that's
I'm gonna give them that same energy in
terms of okay no let's let's have that
conversation right because there was a
point in time where everything I
responded to when I would spawn to it
through the lens of just being this
snarky has you know what I mean
and yeah sure was i entertaining myself
absolutely yeah but didn't I had to ask
myself was I really moving in
conversation in the dialogue along even
though it is Twitter right it's 20 it's
a dumpster fire right but what I started
has some importance it does just the
truth that's why it keeps coming up in
so many of these conversations we got
high-level people with great minds that
are open and engaging that are still
involved in the stupidity of that so
it's like when I bring it up with the
guests noise like I don't want to touch
that again and then on the other hand we
all know it's real it just it just is
whether we want it to be or not
everybody said whether we like not just
the meaning of expression right now and
so we have to you know it's like you
either adapt to die yeah but you know
it's it's I try I try to be what it is I
I tried to be the opposite of what I
could plane about at least I try in
terms of like sometimes I'll see snarky
messages and then I'll respond by trying
to be reasonable I'll say okay I get it
you don't like me but answer this
question for me and I try to move the
dialogue along you know what is up
happening to gets deleted yeah almost
every single time
yeah the second you shed a little light
on it Congrats scatter yeah yep what is
the before we dive too much into your
past what is the thing that they're
criticizing you most for like you come
across to me as a pretty rational mm-hm
decent open guy you're trying to empower
yourself okay so what is it that they're
always going after you is is it that
thing that a black man shouldn't be for
guns I mean is it that's simply stupid
so I'm like so I don't not gonna be so
naive as to assume it's simply just
because I'm blacking them in the gun
yeah they're alright thing holds up
that's the part of it that's a big part
of it
it's just aligning myself an
organization that they seemingly that
they see as being a racist organization
that hates black people okay we're gonna
talk plenty about the internet right so
there's that element of it but then
there's there is also this idea that
being young black men that I'm supposed
to run from guns because of the
projected image that we've all had
forced down our throats with respect to
black men in firearms in this country
for decades
you know black man with a gun he's a
thug he's drug dealers and getting
banger
so now when I young attorney educated
open-minded and deal with respect to
different issues and then I'm pushing
the narrative of the Second Amendment it
sets off an explosive level of cognitive
dissonance and people who have what I
love this quote and I believe was Bush
who said it
this soft bigotry of low expectation
right and it they hate it I hate it the
same way they they hate you now because
you can't control someone who's willing
to think independently outside of what
is stereotypically expected of you right
and that's where the labels come in and
so it's like you go do progressive
you're liberal you know so forth wrong
but you still have that ability to step
outside of that and say you know what
let me mean okay I can see that
perspective that's dangerous for people
who want to control people so when I
want to control the way you think the
way you see yourself I cannot allow you
to develop an ability to think
independently on separate issues because
then I can't control you so if I if I
say you know what I can do everything
for you depend on me the last thing I
want you to do and understand is you
know what wait a minute you mean tell me
I can protect myself you mean to tell me
I don't have to depend on calling a cop
in order to come save me if someone does
try to break into my house because then
I can't control you
I can't own your vote because what the
gun has done from me and a lot of people
it serves as a catalyst for the
awakening of a lot of people to
understand you know what I can do more
for myself than I realize you know and
once that once that spark is set off
then a lot of things you start to
realize you know I don't you know what
maybe you know now that I'm holding
myself to a different level of
accountability maybe I might try to do
this on my own you know doesn't it just
feel good I mean putting aside I know a
lot of people are into facts over
feeling these days right Shapiro but
doesn't that statement right there that
that you can do more for yourself it
just feels good like making some power
back to yourself and going the
government or you whoever you are that
[Music]
all right so let's do this I want to do
gun 101 with you okay all the things
that we should know about guns and then
I want to do the most common
misconceptions about guns because I
think part of the issue right now is
every time something happens every time
there's a shooting half the people don't
know anything about guns on one hand
half the people then give you all of
those misconceptions it can't sit
confusing for everybody and even the
people who I generally trust now I sense
don't know exactly what they're saying
so I want to do a video with you right
now every time one of these incidences
happen and someone starts asking me this
asking me that I want to go I've got the
thing that I can point to with the
answers so let's do gun what a lock on
what do we need to know about that all
right first of all most a r does not
stand for assault rifle so when I say
ar-15 that's not assault rifle does not
mean assault rifle an assault rifle is a
gun that is fully automatic right that
means I pull the trigger I hold it back
and it expends all of the ammunition in
the magazine that's that's Jesse Ventura
in predator boom okay it's a great gun
yeah love that gun right I can argue
about not gonna side with mine owning it
so okay so that's automatic that just
hold it down and down in it it will fire
every round
subsequently until it's completely out
okay right and that's so at a very high
rate of speed
okay generally speaking somebody
automatic so now there's been this thing
where people conflate this or use semi
automatic as a kind of a hyperbolic way
of characterizing guns as death killing
machines right
virtually every modern gun is
semi-automatic and what that means is
one press of the trigger you get one
bullet versus holding the trigger down
once and getting all the bullets okay so
that's a great distinction out there
because often when this happens you see
people saying we have to ban semi
automatics yes semi automatic that's
virtually every month so it's not
because all that the only difference
between that and a what a fully
automatic well what's one that you're
just loading one bullet in okay so that
would be a bolt-action okay right so
there's fully automatic semi-automatic
and bolt-action right right bolt-action
more
as more lines like like hunting right or
hyper high precision shooting and it's a
both because it allows you to build a
gun up in such a way where you it's the
tighter constraints within a gun and it
allows you to be more accurate okay
without certain mechanism moving back
and forth causing throwing off the
accuracy of the shot so you would say
then that when when all of these people
come out and say we have to ban semi
automatics that they are actually just
flat-out confused or intentionally
conflating or obfuscating what the truth
is related to them yes absolutely
and so it's either they're confused
ignorant or they're doing a purpose
field like you just stated
okay so what is the so let's do some nra
stuff while we're doing this what is the
nra stance on automatics just being able
to hold and shoot I mean the way it's
currently regulated is the way it stands
like right now there's like in order to
get an automatic gun there's a certain
process you have to go through in order
to get them and and that it's been that
way for a very long time now and that's
been that it exists yeah as it does now
and that's essentially war where the
stance is it with respect to fully
automatic well what are people use in
fully automatic guns for so because I
think this is where you hear people go
well no one needs an automatic to hunt
well see here's the thing no it's it's
it's the idea of putting it under the
guise of needing right there name
another right where we use that same
standard you know Beck's question that's
so it's like okay you haven't fully
automatic gun and you have
semi-automatic guns you have bolt-action
there are different reasons why you
would want each of these guns now I can
delve into that but then that starts
getting into the very nerdy side of
firearm ownership where the enthusiasts
aspect of that comes into it is
understanding tactically why you would
want certain things and so for me I'm
not personally I don't have a problem
with people on the fully automatic guns
personally I just don't see that as a
significant danger above and beyond say
owning a nuclear suitcase right so if
people tried to make that absurd
argument to me before I well then won't
you be loved and well that's because
there's there's a cost-benefit ratio
that doesn't make any sense right that
you just that's inherently
self-destruction
so how is this how was that protecting
you in any way from the very thing that
you're supposed to be checking yourself
against do you think there should be a
higher threshold to be able to get an
automatic than some of the other weapons
you're talking about me personally
threshold in what respect like in terms
of either hire back graded background
checks or references so let's talk about
background checks every minute so
there's this i dentist notion that we
don't have background checks for our
guns we do and a funny thing is we in
the gun community we have become a
victim of technology and what i mean by
that is people think that just because i
can go into a guns if I really wanted to
I can do a gun store right now buy a gun
within two minutes just like that
you can't yeah because you've done all
of the the background stuff see that's
the thing though I'm still going under
I'm undergoing the same processes right
so I go into the store I find a gun I
like this gun I said I want to buy this
gun I fill out the 44s form 4473 which
asked me a series of questions then they
take that information and they submit it
to the FBI database and they do a
background check but it happens
instantly because technology right
people it's interesting because there's
a lot of people who feel like I said
undergo some type of CIA investigation
before I buy a gun the same people who
also hate the government exactly right
so when they the instant aspect of the
background check causes people who don't
know very much about the process to
think that there isn't one right just
because I can buy the gun easily doesn't
mean it was done thoroughly mm-hmm
you know what I'm saying I underwent the
background check there's a system there
they checked it against the system if I
don't have any felonies or anything that
prevents me from owning that firearm I'm
allowed to buy the gun okay so when
people say there are there are no
background checks and Matt ground checks
aren't tight enough or however you want
to extract that is there any credence to
any of that so now let's talk so I think
what you're what you're kind of going
into is the universal background checks
right so when they say universal back
now they do conflate these terminologies
there's the universal background check
is a very specific statement it's it's
not like saying Coke right because
people here universal background checks
on other here's the background check
part that Universal means something and
what that means is it's a requirement
that on
every single transaction you have to
undergo a background check even private
transactions right so right now in
California if I had a gun right I can
bring a gun into California I just can't
carry it but you were like hey you know
Kant's I like that gun you have right
what I buy for me in California I can't
sell it to you mm-hmm
right now what here's what I can do I
could say all right cool when I get back
to Texas I'll transfer the gun to a gun
store here in California if it's on the
specific list that allows you to
actually own that gun right because
California has exactly yeah and then you
would have to go to the gun store and
then buy it right now let's say I
decided to give you the gun anyway
privately right now in this room no one
else is here but you and I and I sell do
you've a gun give each other cameras oh
yeah I mean you know I don't have any
plans on going to jail but and I sell
you the gun you and then let's say you
have the gun what is there - checked
against what database is there to check
against this determine whether or not
you got a background check for that gun
now just completely two issues right now
yeah so well if we get it on the DL
there there's no there's no way and
that's what the whole concept of the
universal background check is it is to
require a background check for every
private transaction now legally right
now I can't do it but like in Texas I
can sell a gun to a friend and as long
as I know he's not a prohibited person
and I know he's not a felon I can sell
him that gun no problems that's
completely legal what the universal
background check idea suggest is I
should have I should be required to
undergo a background check before I can
sell in that gun now I mean you and he
and I would have to go to a gun store
and undergo a background check then he
can go and buy the gun from me so is the
problem with the way it is currently
saying Texas the way you're describing
that you just would not know potentially
enough information about the person you
were selling yes that that's a potential
absolutely and so the reason why I'm
against the universal background check
is because there is no other way to
enforce it but for a national gun
registry because otherwise you have
nothing to check it against right to say
is if I if a cop walks down the street
sees you have a gun he's like do your
background check for the gun yeah
how's he gonna prove otherwise unless
there's a national registry then it was
okay fine well then let's have a
national registry no because we've seen
time and time again and when the
government's have a national registry of
firearms they subsequently use it to
confiscate guns now the problem is when
you say that they try to put the tinfoil
hat on you right except because what
they what they envision is you know
roaring Clark black military trucks
coming down the street pulling guns from
people's houses no that's not what
happens or how they do it it's
constructive and then when you have
potential presidential candidates like
Hillary Clinton suggesting we should
take a part we should take up the
Australia model which did that very
thing they use the National they use a
national gun registration to tell people
to say you know what you need to turn in
your guns it's a voluntary buyback no
it's an in the mandatory buyback right
so and if you don't sell your guns back
guess what you go to jail
that's a confiscation yeah it's a
constructive confiscation but a
compensation nonetheless just because
they didn't roll the military trucks
down the street and pull them out of
your house doesn't mean it isn't
confiscation and so that's why I'm I'm
adamantly against universal background
checks unless you can demonstrate it
away from me for it to be applied in
such a way that would not require gun
registry because I do not trust my
government not to exploit that registry
in their favor
yeah so how much of this then because
we've talked about it you said to me
right before we started you're sort of a
libertarian I think it's exactly he said
I don't want to put worry about how much
of this does go back to that states
should be able to make the decisions
that they see fit I mean I suspect you
probably wouldn't be that thrilled
living in California other than the
weather I I'm here in California whether
the women that's pretty good food yeah
we do yeah I might complain about that
so see that's just it too it's like well
how far those states rights go from the
standpoint of violating my Second
Amendment right right
I believe in states rights right at some
point you start violating my
constitutional ones and so when you have
places like California which I think I
think I'm being currently violated now
that
that I can't carry my mic on what is the
difference I can take my I can take my
car with my Texas license and drive it
right into California no one has a
problem with that I can drive up and
down these roads and as fast as I want
as recklessly as I want yeah that might
be illegal but I still do it does that
potentially do it but yet I can't carry
the thing that I carry to protect my
life with the same license does it make
some sense to me like am i any in any
less danger here then I would be in
Texas if anything I can make the
argument that I'm more there's more
danger for me here in that I don't know
the area very well so in a weird way
you're actually making an on states
rights argument here because if you're
saying you want the same thing
everywhere that's a that's not a states
rights argument it's not that but that's
what I'm saying
yeah because but that that's under the
guise of me feeling like me not being
able to carry as a violation of my
constitutional right right because
states rights doesn't allow them to
violate those constitutional rights and
that's that's the argument I'm making
now it's difficult because then you
start talking about the idea of having a
uniform like concealed carry platform
right where one license allows you to
carry a gun everywhere right then you
start getting into weeds but okay well
that's violating states rights that's
only if you don't see my ability to
carry a firearm as a as a sorry my
ability to carry a firearm as a
violation of my constitutional right
right so it's an interesting
philosophical place to talk because it's
like it just depends where you start
yeah because even though I'm definitely
a states rights guy I hear what you say
there and then on the other hand as a
states rights guy to me if a state wants
to have stricter laws and you're a big
gun guy than you actually are allowed to
leave it's kind of as I would say for
virtually every other situation it's
kind of shitty it doesn't feel great to
have to leave a place that you want to
be at but if they're doing things as
part of their state experiment that you
don't like well done it's on you to get
gone yeah but if that same state creates
a law that violates my right to privacy
right well we have constitutional right
that's super C so I see so I get I get a
chair are we missing anything else on
the technical front because we did that
pretty calm oh you'll see
[Applause]
from a mechanical state right yeah just
from the mechanical standpoint or just
any of the language that we use related
to this okay okay so yeah so then of
course there's some people can say it's
trivial some people say it's not so the
magazine versus clip it's yeah the
general term it's actually it's called
the magazine a clip is an actual thing
it's just different from a magazine that
that's kind of slightly trivial but it
does typically kind of expose people who
don't really know much about guns
when you say clip versus magazine
because the proper terminology would be
magazine as far as any other mechanical
components yeah well what do I need to
know about the magazine well that's just
terminology it is semantics yeah right I
don't always go about correcting people
because I feel like it just creates
something it kind of makes me look like
an ass but that's why we're doing it
yeah and I want to clean somehow the
biggest thing is it's just the assault
weapon thing right because the ar-15 is
a civilian weapon it's it's designated
the biggest difference between an ar-15
and an assault rifle is that the assault
rifle is fully automatic and they are 15
isn't that's the biggest distinction
between the two now of course then you
can make the argument well that's some
very minor distinction you know there
are a lot of people who make that
argument but I don't look at the ar-15
any differently than I look at the
handgun in that sense okay so every time
when one of these happens and we hear
the ar-15 is a weapon of war solo
handguns you would basically put the
ar-15 in the handgun in the same
category yes as pulling ones Shiban ones
yeah so that would not be categorized as
a weapon of war we'll see that's the
destination that terminology is designed
to to manipulate the emotions of people
who don't know anything about guns so
when you hear if you don't know anything
about firearms and you hear he's the
weapon of war technically speaking all
guns or weapons of war right swords can
be weapons exactly yeah so but what that
does mentally like they understand
language very well yeah they like
they're like not human but in terms of
the I call it the anti-gun side of it of
things they understand the use of
language very well and and they confuse
it purposely so when you hear someone
who doesn't know anything about firearms
think about it like if if I'm already
kind of I'm a little scared of firearms
and then I hear he used a weapon of war
what image comes up in your mind it's
it's Rambo you know he's running down
there just going crazy and that's
exactly what he's doing
but he could do the same thing with a
handgun and so the biggest thing that I
like to when I'm having these
conversations with peoples you're gonna
walk away with you can walk away with
two with two points of two trains of
thoughts I'm either gonna get you to
admit you just want to ban all guns or
you can see my perspective because if
you if you're willing to say you know
what we need to get rid of all this salt
weapons as they as they understand them
to be which is essentially ar-15s but
now it's actually becoming more broader
like me to get rid of all semi-automatic
weapons right that's virtually every
modern gun so let's say they move they
want to ban ar-15s ar-15 rifles aren't
even used like the percentage that
rifles are used in actual shootings is
so low and marginal it's unreal so then
why are we focusing on it but okay then
what are most shootings
they're handguns yeah right so if you
get rid of that and we got rid of ar-15
and then we have another shooting
happening because the are loves deadly
school mass shooting was Virginia Tech
and he used a hangar so then what
happens if that happens again so now
what are you gonna ban you gonna ban
handgun and that's when you're stuck
having to confront the fact that okay
either you really just want to ban all
guns or you understand that the
distinction is irrelevant right we've
got to get to the absolute point of
issue and why these things are happening
and focusing on the gun is doing a
disservice to the conversation it sounds
like I'm just utilizing I'm using a
bigger issue as a scapegoat but in
reality if you really sit down and think
about it all right
we have over 300 close to 400 million
guns in this country going in
and understanding that you've got to
then sit down and say to yourself all
[Music]
joining me today is a lawyer a gun
rights activists and the host of no are
on NRA TV colleano are welcome to the
Rubin report how's it going man how's it
going my friend it's going good it's
good to be in LA I am I'm glad to have
you know we've been trying to do this
for about a year
yeah yeah yeah I just like to think so
yeah it might just be a facade I put on
to avoid people but now and actually but
in reality now it's it's been it's been
a pretty busy year yeah like extremely
so and it doesn't ever seem to slow up
and just what I think it does something
else jumps off well if you think coming
on this show is gonna help slow it down
you are sorely mistaken
yeah well I'm a bit of a masochist in
that regard we'll see by the time this
hour is done work on earth hell we can
write I'm pretty sure there will be some
yeah well don't worry because there will
be equal amounts on me just for a
sitting here with you that's the
interesting thing
you know I it's I don't want to say I've
been blind to it but just being just
seeing some of the reaction and
responses that I got especially for
instance when I was on Maher when I did
Bill Maher you know I saw some of the
comments from I say the other side just
for ease of communication yeah but for
people who largely don't agree with me
in his audience they were like I would
drop the NRA guy on there even a I was a
tweet I responded to yesterday and even
though I was on my no tweeting do that I
like to put myself on because so toxic
in there sometimes how often do you do
that
happy 30 minutes I'm trying to do
weekends and disappearing at all of
August see it man
Twitter's toxic man when you're in the
lane that you and I are in yeah it's
toxic man and it can really even though
you don't think you're taking that in
even just kind of scrolling through
you're taking it in yeah you know and in
it it's like I constantly I developer
this pattern of just yeah don't respond
to that cuz they're baiting you yeah I
mean things of that nature but um I was
I saw a tweet and she's like yeah I
loved Omar oh I love this episode but
you have that NRA guy on it I'm like
Jesus are we not allowed to have
discourse anymore
if especially if it disagrees with with
something that you believe in oh and you
know like this is a very
we're going down if that's good if
that's gonna be the case because you
forget you know we live in this country
together yeah and we're not all the same
there's about 350 million other yeah
might not all think the same thing
exactly pretty crazy it's it's kind of
sad some it will least for me it's a
little disheartening yeah because I grew
up under the guise and understanding the
importance of discourse and being able
to talk things out even if you do
disagree with someone but didn't even
still having the ability to set aside
whatever views I may have on a
particular issue and then be able to
speak of you cordially or have respect
for you even though we don't agree
that's the way I was brought up in so to
see the country kind of falling into
this extremely of erotic divisiveness it
it's a hardening yeah you know I don't
wanna get all emo on you you don't have
to guess cried till the end but that's
exactly why I wanted to have you on
because you you are okay going into
enemy territory I'm not on this enemy
turns yeah but you did you did Mars show
where you knew a certain percentage of
the audience was just gonna hate you
yeah and we talked about it briefly
right before we started but you found
Maher to be basically pretty pretty
respected even kill yeah okay even
though I'm policy he probably disagrees
with you with 8080 pretty much yeah and
you know and it was something that I
ended up respecting about him and in
that regard cos like I said I I kind of
I went in prepared for I didn't go in to
do war but I went and prepared for it
you know it was like prepared for the
worst hope for the best and I tell you I
got the best in a sense of it was a it
was a discourse where he challenged me
but it wasn't this kind of tumultuous
kind of flooding of the heads where it
just turned into something that was just
ugly yeah well he wasn't trying to get
yet yeah trying to understand you
because that that you know I'm trying to
do that here I there's a couple other
places where people are trying to do
that but yeah that's the thing that's
been lost and that's an interesting
thing you point out there it's I think
sometimes people take offense to that
idea it's like I don't your intruder
intriguing I think intrigue kind of
offends people sometimes because it's
like we all grow up with a typical
understanding what we expect certain
people to be like and then when certain
things don't fit it's like that's
interesting how did you get there right
and I think when it's innocent like that
I don't think there's an issue there
when you use it to try to kind of muscle
people into believing a certain thing
based on what they are then that's when
we start having problems you know what I
mean it's like you see me it's like how
do you as a black guy like it happened
to me when I first started doing what I
did with the NRA Russell Simmons and
I'll never forget this I was like I was
like in Virginia Beach I think and
Russell said I I did my first sets of
videos and rolled out with the NRA and I
get this tweet from Russell Simmons and
he's like how can you as a young black
man push Daddy you get you know the
typical rhetoric in that regard even
though he often is all about trying to
get people to exactly which is really
yeah and so I responded I said you know
like I didn't know advocating for self
defense and self-reliance was a bad
thing I didn't know that only non black
people are allowed to do that right and
so that was kind of like my first foray
into that world of wait a minute people
have an expectation of me based on my
race that I'm not gonna say I was
oblivious to but it just when it was
coming from people that look like me as
well with the same level of intensity
that's when I go WOW okay alright so
here that's what this is yeah okay so I
won I want to back up to a little bit of
childhood and growing up because you're
evolutions kind of dream but let's just
say with this for one second because I
think there's something really
interesting about that thing right there
that often if you listen to the media
they'll tell you that police are hunting
down black men and all of this and then
at the same time you're saying well we
should be able to arm ourselves and
protect ourselves from the white
supremacist but meaning that lawfully
and legally we should be able to take
care of ourselves if you believe that
the system is so corrupt and the police
are so corrupt and there's racists
running around everywhere you're trying
to bring the power back to yourself
that's to me that's very empowering yet
somehow this seemingly is lost when this
conversation hits the mainstream it's
amazing I don't understand it it's like
in one breath you're talking about let's
let's take the colonel ministration for
instance
paint it as this the most vicious and
vile thing on a planet and then it's
like well then let's give the same guns
that you have for your own self reliance
I would you would use to protect
yourself against this monster that you
said existed and let's give it to them
and then place your entire reliance with
respect to your safety on the same
people you you're telling me I should be
scared of it doesn't you're horrible
give them your weapons what it's it's
mind-blowing right and so what it does
though it exposes this notion that the
there's a absence of ability to I don't
say mobility or people just choosing not
to critically think mm-hmm you know and
we're at a point now where we have
access and that's like it amazes me some
of the questions that I get and it's
like you literally have a device that
gives you access to all of the
information in the world in the case of
my overabundant ass I have two of them
right and it's like it takes you to
follow I assume you have like eight guns
on you at all right yeah you know and
it's it's amazing how when we have such
access to so much information we've
become so lazy at reaching for it this
was almost like back in the day when we
didn't have this access we we more
adamant about search searching and
seeking it out and critically thinking
about things it's almost we become too
fast for our own good right so the
obsession now is instant information
into the information regardless of
whether or not the information is of any
use or good or the or if it's even
correct yeah you know and so it's it
hate it because you know I logged I've
done all of those things and I actually
people get mad at me when I don't jump
on a certain issue quick enough and when
I say cook enough within 30 seconds I'll
see that sometimes it goes down in the
news and a literally two minutes go by
or I'm at dinner and I wasn't looking my
phone and then I'll get a slew of tweets
people I see you didn't comment on he
must be in on it
good god paid off god forbid it involves
a black person and there's a gun within
10 miles I have to jump on it yeah you
know and in their some cases I
understand there are some people who do
who are just now getting into this who
are just now getting in the fire
and they are black right and you know
maybe they look to me for understanding
and direction because I've been doing it
for so long so that I understand but but
other people it's just this constant
desire to be like ah ha I got you I knew
you were the kind of deal right and
it's like like give me 30 seconds to
even read the article you just sent me
ten seconds ago yeah right and then from
there and then not to mention you know
there's a thing called work that I do
so yeah I'm still doing that as well so
I'm you know I'm juggling a lot of
things I don't have to tell you you
probably 310 more articles to even
ascertain anything close to the truth
bingo and that's the one thing that I I
think a lot of people don't do and I
almost tweeted that the other day I go
you know it's very dangerous to read
headlines especially in the day and age
of clickbait titles to just read
headlines and then make an opinion based
off of that or think you know understand
what happened in a particular story
because there are so many articles that
I've read about me yeah and what I've
said where the headline said one thing
and to cover their asses within the
article they'll clarify exactly what
that what it is that I said but they're
banking on the idea that people are just
gonna read the headlines and then run
with that yeah and so it ends up making
a fool of you fool of people what's your
personal policy on that about how to
respond to that do you go all in on the
fight do you ignore it because I this
has happened to me not just in the last
week and daily be said I was an all
right cheerleader you're black I think
so how am i doing for the fur and all
right you you suck well no I mean but
this is the level of pity but but then
it's about how much time do you want to
invest in in defending yourself and by
doing that defense do you just add
intensity to the people going hi see we
can get him to defend himself and then
before you know your whole life is
dedicated to defending yourself from
fake attacks rather than doing the work
that you care about two things one
you're they do the teachers are
dangerous
you're dangerous not because you agree
with me in certain certain issues you're
dangerous in the fact that you're just
simply willing to talk to me
so for it's the same thing happened when
I did I did the interview with killer
Mike mmm-hmm
right they jumped all over him not
because of what he said
but just because he sat down I had the
conversation with me yeah half the time
they don't even listen oh that's that's
interesting you point it out because I'm
like how can anyone watch this interview
and not walk away with saying you know
that was a great conversation about two
people who don't agree on everything but
there's some things we agree on he's
like because they didn't watch it that
sounds like what do you mean it's like I
had just this weird blonde moment right
yeah I'm like what do you mean he's like
he didn't watch it he's like they don't
actually watch the video they just read
the title and then assume they know what
happened in the video and then make
their opinion from there yeah I'm like
Danny right I hate going down the weeds
with too much of this because it feels
like we're just responding to all of the
craziness but even in the evenin like
the YouTube ecosystem yeah when we put
videos up sometimes within 10 seconds
there's a hundred comments that was an
hour I want that time machine because I
would be a lot more productive but it's
always the haters that do it that's why
I want to bring it up cuz it because
then that hate is the thing that's
always leading us and then I think that
brings it back to where you started a
moment ago which is that we're in this
polarized thing and because the haters
are sort of paving the road and everyone
else is just going down the road I think
a few of us are actually trying to find
a better Road that more of us can get I
the interesting thing about the
discourse the way it is now right and so
our politics have become our
entertainment that's the one that's the
dangerous aspect right so if it's not
vitriolic if it's not snarky if it's not
any of those things it people don't pay
attention to it and I'm the biggest
advocate of light all right look if you
if you don't agree with me on something
you're not to be an ass about it yeah
right now can I be snarky yeah no I can
absolutely be snarky but what I what I
tried to do to respond to your initial
question you asked him how do I like how
do I go all-in do I respond so like for
instance on Twitter what I've kind of
held myself back to doing now is if I
can tell that the person is later he's
seeking out an answer or response that's
I'm gonna give them that same energy in
terms of okay no let's let's have that
conversation right because there was a
point in time where everything I
responded to when I would spawn to it
through the lens of just being this
snarky has you know what I mean
and yeah sure was i entertaining myself
absolutely yeah but didn't I had to ask
myself was I really moving in
conversation in the dialogue along even
though it is Twitter right it's 20 it's
a dumpster fire right but what I started
has some importance it does just the
truth that's why it keeps coming up in
so many of these conversations we got
high-level people with great minds that
are open and engaging that are still
involved in the stupidity of that so
it's like when I bring it up with the
guests noise like I don't want to touch
that again and then on the other hand we
all know it's real it just it just is
whether we want it to be or not
everybody said whether we like not just
the meaning of expression right now and
so we have to you know it's like you
either adapt to die yeah but you know
it's it's I try I try to be what it is I
I tried to be the opposite of what I
could plane about at least I try in
terms of like sometimes I'll see snarky
messages and then I'll respond by trying
to be reasonable I'll say okay I get it
you don't like me but answer this
question for me and I try to move the
dialogue along you know what is up
happening to gets deleted yeah almost
every single time
yeah the second you shed a little light
on it Congrats scatter yeah yep what is
the before we dive too much into your
past what is the thing that they're
criticizing you most for like you come
across to me as a pretty rational mm-hm
decent open guy you're trying to empower
yourself okay so what is it that they're
always going after you is is it that
thing that a black man shouldn't be for
guns I mean is it that's simply stupid
so I'm like so I don't not gonna be so
naive as to assume it's simply just
because I'm blacking them in the gun
yeah they're alright thing holds up
that's the part of it that's a big part
of it
it's just aligning myself an
organization that they seemingly that
they see as being a racist organization
that hates black people okay we're gonna
talk plenty about the internet right so
there's that element of it but then
there's there is also this idea that
being young black men that I'm supposed
to run from guns because of the
projected image that we've all had
forced down our throats with respect to
black men in firearms in this country
for decades
you know black man with a gun he's a
thug he's drug dealers and getting
banger
so now when I young attorney educated
open-minded and deal with respect to
different issues and then I'm pushing
the narrative of the Second Amendment it
sets off an explosive level of cognitive
dissonance and people who have what I
love this quote and I believe was Bush
who said it
this soft bigotry of low expectation
right and it they hate it I hate it the
same way they they hate you now because
you can't control someone who's willing
to think independently outside of what
is stereotypically expected of you right
and that's where the labels come in and
so it's like you go do progressive
you're liberal you know so forth wrong
but you still have that ability to step
outside of that and say you know what
let me mean okay I can see that
perspective that's dangerous for people
who want to control people so when I
want to control the way you think the
way you see yourself I cannot allow you
to develop an ability to think
independently on separate issues because
then I can't control you so if I if I
say you know what I can do everything
for you depend on me the last thing I
want you to do and understand is you
know what wait a minute you mean tell me
I can protect myself you mean to tell me
I don't have to depend on calling a cop
in order to come save me if someone does
try to break into my house because then
I can't control you
I can't own your vote because what the
gun has done from me and a lot of people
it serves as a catalyst for the
awakening of a lot of people to
understand you know what I can do more
for myself than I realize you know and
once that once that spark is set off
then a lot of things you start to
realize you know I don't you know what
maybe you know now that I'm holding
myself to a different level of
accountability maybe I might try to do
this on my own you know doesn't it just
feel good I mean putting aside I know a
lot of people are into facts over
feeling these days right Shapiro but
doesn't that statement right there that
that you can do more for yourself it
just feels good like making some power
back to yourself and going the
government or you whoever you are that
[Music]
joining me today is a sex researcher a
neuroscientist and co-host of the wrong
speak podcast dr. Deborah so welcome to
the Rubin report hi I am glad to have
you here finally I'm so happy to be here
all right we got a lot to talk about I
thought the best way to start this thing
I don't like to look at my notes upfront
but you had a line on your patreon page
that I thought summed up the whole damn
thing pretty perfectly your patreon bio
says creating journalism that defends
science and free speech you've come to
the right show all right I think so yeah
okay should we talk about sex first
should we just start with sex and then
cuz it's all gonna it all bleeds into
one thing definitely yeah okay you
started as a neuroscientist
but you were sort of more attracted for
a lack of a better word to studying sex
tell me about that yeah so I mean I
decided to go back to school and do my
PhD in neuroscience and along the way I
had the chance to do a placement in
psychology so I'd never heard of sex
research before I had no idea what it
was but it was so fascinating to me and
I thought it's crazy that we have the
technology to look at people's brains
and look at sexual arousal in the brain
and it tells us so much about what it
means to be human so from from there I
was hooked I loved it my PhD was in
using brain imaging to look at
paraphilias which are a typical sexual
interest and hyper sexuality in men and
I love research I always will but I made
the decision to leave academia and work
full-time as a journalist now because
the climate had changed so much even
between when I started my PhD and when
it when I finished yeah and that's why
the stuff that you're talking about
really is a nexus of everything that I'm
doing here because now you're on the
journalist side but it's because of the
hostility that you were facing on the
academic side so what worried what is it
that you were unearthing or studying
that was so triggering to people HM well
within psychology you can't really study
anything that isn't triggering it's
across the board someone's gonna get mad
at you no matter what but even though
you're really looking at facts you're
look you're you're looking to find
yeah exactly and even with brain imaging
I mean that's that's definitely it's a
growing feel the technology is
legitimate but no matter what I think
because sex is still considered very
taboo people will either project their
own ideas and beliefs and values onto it
or they just don't see the value and
they think why is the government funding
this I feel really lucky being in Canada
we do have a pretty amazing scene in
terms of sex research and my colleagues
do manage to get funding so I think
that's excellent but my decision to
leave academia in the last two years I
had noticed things were starting to go a
bit weird and in terms of the climate
and in terms of mainstream media I was
seeing piece after piece about
transgender kids and how young children
were socially transitioning getting on
blockers pubertal blockers and the media
is basically saying this is the greatest
thing this is something that we should
rejoice about that these kids are so
much better off after but from a
scientific perspective the research
actually shows that the majority of kids
who are gender dysphoria grow their
feelings they're more likely to grow up
to be gay in adulthood not transgender
and so it makes sense for them to wait
not for them to socially transition at a
young age so I wanted to write a
mainstream piece about this and there's
been a very long-standing history
between trans activists and sex
researchers a very ugly history of
activists going after sex researchers if
they don't like what some one study says
or what they say publicly so I thought
about it for a long time I wrote the
piece and I sat on it probably for about
six months and I wasn't sure if I wanted
to put it out I asked a bunch of my
colleagues and mentors and they all said
you know what the science is solid but
you know you know what's gonna happen if
you do put this out and at the time I
wanted to stay in academia and I said
should I wait till I get tenure and
everyone told me even if you have tenure
nowadays it's not going to protect you
you can still lose your job so I decided
eventually I couldn't stay quiet and I
thought I'm not going to stay in an
environment where I can't speak the
truth and I can't even pursue questions
that are meaningful anymore because I
have to worry about who's gonna get mad
and then I'm gonna lose my money and my
funding and I'm gonna lose my job so
that piece went out it's called white
transgender kids show a way to
transition and
and I haven't looked back since yeah so
I reread I've read the piece before but
I reread it this morning thank you I got
here and there's a lot here so how much
of this is just blade is just blatantly
a misunderstanding of science like I
think there's partly that you have a
misunderstanding of science and then you
just have activists who just want you to
bow to them all the time are you able to
sort of quantify how much of the
backlash is each I think should be
charitable I try to look at the other
side and give them you know credit and
try to you know think that they have
good intentions
maybe people I mean it's pretty
consistent all 11 studies ever done on
the topic of desist in so this
phenomenon I talked about where kids
grow out of their feelings of gender
dysphoria all of them say the same thing
so the final statistic is about 60 to 90
percent so this is the vast majority of
kids you can't really question those
data so I think what it could be is
people I mean trans people have a
history of having you do of medical
gatekeeping of people telling them they
don't really what they feel isn't real
I do think gender dysphoria is a real
phenomenon and I do think we should have
empathy for people who are suffering so
I think it could be coming from that of
that place of well we don't want people
saying that this isn't a legitimate
thing or that trans people should be
forced to not feel the way they do but
in terms of you know these children we
should be thinking about the best
outcome so it doesn't make sense for
them to transition if that's not
actually going to help them in the long
term I try to give people the benefit
the doubt but I do think the activists
they on some level I think they know
that they can bully sex researchers
because of that history they know that
there's only so much an academic can do
and they've won a couple battles so I
think that's part of it as well
how shocking was it to you when you were
discussing this with colleagues that
they were kind of hinting you may want
to wait on this thing I mean did you
think that you'd be in that situation
and I'm wondering did any of them sit on
some other things because they were
afraid to hmm it was eye-opening yeah
but I kind of knew one
one I guess instance I can talk about is
one colleague Michael Bailey at
Northwestern University he wrote a book
that upset transgender activists and
they went off after him ruthlessly I
mean they really tried to destroy his
life and thankfully you know he's he's
still considered one of the foremost
experts in psychology internationally
but I would say that you know I've
written about him previously I think
he's kind of been the poster boys to why
people are really terrified to say
anything that goes against the trans
narrative yeah so I think you've already
hinted at this and I know your work
otherwise but so you have no issue with
trans people as people just to be clear
this is purely about the science related
to transitioning and hormone blockers
and things of that nature of a certain
age where they're doing it as young as I
think you're right about 14 right oh
younger than that now well yeah I mean
if there's parental consent definitely
and I have to say for transgender adults
and I say even kids who reach puberty
and still feel that way I think
transitioning is is totally up to you if
that's what the path you decide to go
then power to you I don't think there's
any ones penny it's anyone's business to
tell you what to do at that point so a
lot of their basic parameters related to
age then well there are in terms of I
don't work with children I don't do
clinical work anymore but in terms of
the research literature usually
clinicians will wait until puberty and
see how the child feels at that time
when the body starts changing when they
start having crushes on their peers and
that kind of thing and the research does
show that when kids start to you know
have crushes and start dating and that
can play a role in terms of how they
feel about their bodies and whether they
do outgrow it but just at that point
your whole body is in flux your mental
states and flux your physical states and
flux and as you said what did you say a
percentage on that of how many of them
turn out to just they generate so yeah
so they so sixty to ninety percent of
the the children undergoing these
feelings turn out to be gay and then I
assume the ones that don't transition
probably most of them end up being okay
with being gay I would imagine
roughly yeah and I would say even I grew
up in the gay community I have a lot of
gay male friends and they've said to me
when I was young I told my parents all
the time
hated being a boy and I wanted to be a
girl and I am a girl and why can't I
become a girl and now as a gay man I'm
so comfortable I'm so happy and they say
to me you know I'm kind of glad I'm not
growing up in this time because I think
I probably would have transitioned yeah
well that's why the the external
pressure seems so crazy to me because
you just don't know at that at that age
and even if you do know waiting a little
bit isn't gonna for the science to flesh
out it's not that's not gonna kill you
it's just hard talking about this even
you know yeah I mean the thing is what
people also aren't talking about is that
for these kids so in some cases the
parents don't want a gay child and this
is what upsets me the most so if you
have a little boy who's very feminine
he's likely gonna grow up to be a gay
man but if you take that same Lavoie and
allow him to transition to female when
he grows up he's gonna appear to be a
straight woman and so these parents are
being lauded as progressive when really
they're homophobic God how perverse that
is that's interesting what you just said
about a certain amount of gay men that
grow up you know they wanted to be or
felt more like a girl or whatever and
that eventually grow out and we were
okay
because I never felt that like I played
sports and I played video games and
transformers all all the things that my
friends did I never felt like I was a
girl or more effeminate people always
say to me I don't seem gay I'm always
like I don't know what that you know I
didn't mean like I'm married to a guy
yeah I mean that's pretty gay but I
never had that but that's that's sort of
just interesting about the psychology Oh
gay people in general there are gay
people that grow up feeling very
effeminate or gay men that grow up not
feeling that way and I'm sure there's
women that grow up feeling very butch or
whatever and there's women that grow up
that are you know lipstick lesbians yeah
and the whole thing have you done any
research on it on any of that in terms
of my research no but in terms of what
studies have shown it is about hormone
levels in utero
so testosterone if you are exposed to
higher levels of testosterone in utero
you're more likely to be male typical in
masculine when you're born so whether
you're male or female so most boys are
exposed to high levels of testosterone
so that explains when they're born why
they are interested in male typical toys
and activities so for gay men they were
likely exposed to lower levels of
testosterone which is why
they're more feminine and the same with
with girls if they're exposed to higher
levels of testosterone they're more
likely to be masculine and lesbian right
even though there's obvious outliers
this is on average on average anna is is
there danger in talking about that
because I would imagine that the certain
amount of people in the gay community
that would want you to never go down
that road because then you could end up
in a place where oh we would be able to
prevent people from being hey ultimately
if we can really figure out the science
behind all this definitely and I mean as
a straight woman I have to say I even
iron right now feel like maybe I
shouldn't be saying these things because
I'm not gay I can't speak for the a
community but as a former sex researcher
I am very much a proponent of I'd rather
you speak researcher that a gay person
or a straight person or anything else I
mean this this is the problem though
you're you know to be like you're an
expert in this and it's like even for
you who's so brave on all of these
issues it gets weird to talk about it
even for me I just it's like a little
weird to talk about you feel like a
traitor no I I am what I am and that's
all that I am that's it but like I know
that just even talking about this just
gets people crazy and I know what our
what our Twitter feeds are gonna look
like yeah you get ready so I mean it's
crazy because even my colleagues who
have the best intentions they're doing
this research because they just want to
understand why are people the way they
are it's not there are no nefarious
intentions there but people are so quick
to jump on I mean there was earlier this
year that there was a study about using
AI to be able to detect whether someone
is gay by looking at their face and so
again studies have shown that on average
you can see differences between straight
and gay people both men and women in
terms of facial features and so
everyone's freaking out about this study
and I'm thinking why aren't we saying
this is amazing that we are able to know
this and I mean I think I've really good
gaydar I've always thought I have and
now I think great like there's actually
some quantitative data to suggest that
I'm not just making things up right and
they're also they always say well gay
guys have gaydar there's something else
that maybe you can see or whatever it is
or though they're I don't know the
people say it anymore but he was just a
gay face like there was just something
about the facial features sometime
of gay men maybe they were a little
softer or whatever it is I don't even
know what it is but like people were
talking about that in the gay community
then it comes out through some sort of
science lens and it's like ooh we better
watch out for that and the thing is then
researchers see that and say well I
don't want to go through that so then
they don't want to touch that topic so
now there's they're eventually going to
be only like two different things you
can probably study unless you know that
what your findings what you're going to
find is going to be politically
acceptable in which case you shouldn't
be doing the research because that means
you're not actually doing science yeah
what do you think it is about you that
makes you brave enough to do this sort
of thing because I've had a couple other
people we're going to talk about James
the more in a little bit cuz you've also
written about him and and why the whole
thing about diversity and all that but
I've had a bunch of outliers in these
communities on the show and I'm always
curious what it is about the specific
people that make them sort of put it out
there and go I'm gonna do it whether you
like it or not it's probably my
personality yeah I mean I just generally
don't really care what people think
about me and I'm pretty stubborn and I
I'm very I feel very strongly about sex
research being taken seriously and my
decision to have gone and gone into that
field you deal with a lot of stigma as I
mentioned earlier you deal with it on
both sides you know and when you make
the decision to go into the field
suddenly when people know what you do
they will judge you on a personal level
so I think that was part of it you know
I grew a very thick skin from saying I'm
gonna do what I find interesting people
can assume whatever they want about me
and that I think that just translated
into now what I do as a science
journalist but this I would say to and
I'm sure you probably went through a
similar experience once you speak out it
becomes much easier and I find I can't I
can't stay quiet now and I find the
people that are gonna you know turn
their backs on you let them because you
don't need them in your life yeah once
you start you just you can't stop
actually yeah if it's built into you you
just can't stop so one of the things I
think is really interesting is how you
know there's there's such a movement
always to say that gay people are born
this way right Lady Gaga even wrote a
song about war in this way party Gaga
yeah and yet at the same time if I know
for a fact like I have a friend who for
many years was my lesbian friend
one good lesbian friend and she was you
know datin girls all the time and all
that then about three years ago we were
sitting there and she told me that she
met a guy and now she's been with this
guy for about three or four years and
they're getting married and she
identifies basically as bisexual now but
she's only she's exclusively been with a
guy for about four years but what I find
interesting about it is that her lesbian
friends have basically all turned on her
and this is supposed to be that these
are supposed to be the people of
tolerance and we should accept your
sexuality and all that but when it goes
the other way suddenly it becomes this
other thing have you have you seen that
before I suspect you hey I can imagine
that I'm guessing they probably think
that she sold out they think she's a
sellout yeah yeah you're taking the easy
road or something like that like every
insane cliche and I know her to be
completely authentic and real how does
how has she dealt with it I'm curious
it's been well it's woken her up in a
zillion other ways so for a lot of the
other things that that we talked about
about free speech and politics and
freedom and all that she started to wake
up to all of that she was a huge lefty
progressive and now she's basically a
libertarian because she saw that
authoritarian thing why do you guys want
to control me yeah the second I think
differently you guys want to control me
yeah so now she's like the locust of all
of my friends so to speak that's the
thing I think all of us are eventually
gonna have a moment like that where you
realize what you thought was the truth
is not the truth and there there's so
many other things it's like falling down
that rabbit hole in real and you start
to question everything then and it's
really liberating but you know in terms
of sexuality that's I mean that's very
common women female sexuality is much
more fluid than men so men tend to be
very category specific if you're into
women you really like women and you're
not two guys if you're into guys -
[Music]
so one of the things that I think is
fascinating about all of what we're
talking about here is that it's not just
about gender and sex and sexuality but
this is also leaking into all sorts of
other things talking about ethnicity and
color of skin and all of that you've
written a bit about this I have yeah I
wrote about how university applications
in particularly Harvard has been
discriminating against Asians for
decades and to the point where Asians
when they apply to university will want
to hide their ethnicity in hopes of that
that's going to give them a fair chance
of actually getting into the school yeah
so all right so somebody that's watching
this right now that doesn't know about
this they're gonna go wait a minute why
would Harvard discriminate against Asian
people because apparently there are too
many Asians there if it's based solely
on SAT scores and meritocracy there's a
very high proportion of Asian students
and so in the name of quote-unquote
diversity and inclusion Asian students
get penalized so this to me is the most
blatant example of why this diversity
stuff is complete nonsense because
people are face value it seems nice we
want to help people we want to help
groups that maybe have struggled more
for whatever reason I think we should
and and there's probably many good ways
to do that maybe investing in more
education or whatever else I'm happy to
hear your thoughts on that but what they
take as a good thought then they don't
think all the way through which means
okay now we're gonna have to punish
people who have worked very hard and
done everything right and by and large
the Asian community whether it's Chinese
or Japanese or Korean or whatever else
have worked really hard and put a focus
on education and family and then what is
the result of that it's now harder if
not almost impossible at some level to
get into Harvard mmm-hmm and the
craziest thing I don't understand why
people think is this is acceptable and
even when I wrote that column I had a
number of Asians reach out to me and say
you know don't don't be used as a token
for the far right and I'm totally okay
with this this is fair and I'm thinking
what are you on I wasn't good at the
times do an op-ed I think by an Asian
woman if I'm not mistaken hmm yeah
saying that this is okay and I just I
mean what are you doing what do you do
it that you are fighting for true
equality yeah that is simply not what
they're fighting for
I think it's indoctrination at some
level I think especially for the kids
who are applying to these schools and
who are okay with having to score much
higher on the SAT in order to get a fair
chance I think they've just been told
you know this is how it has to be but
this idea that it should be equality an
equality of outcome as opposed to
opportunity is is silly and it doesn't
actually deal with actual differences in
terms of opportunity you know in terms
of the differences that we see and the
reasons why there are these differences
they're not actually being addressed
please tell me that you got some nice
support from members of the Asian
community and it wasn't just sort of
brainwashed lefties that were I didn't
know I didn't I got it across the board
of you know many races so I was grateful
for that because I wasn't sure how
people were going to respond to that
piece but I felt very strongly that I
had to say something has Harvard issued
a response to any of this or do we even
know where they're at with all this no
as far as I know that lawsuit is still
ongoing yeah it's just it really is just
crazy so I are you with me on this I
sense that there's some massive minority
groups that are breaking right now I
think the Asian community because of the
I hate saying community but you know you
have to use some words to describe some
of this but I think the black community
is breaking this is what a lot of what
Candis Owens is talking about I sense
this happening in the gay community I
sense this happening in the Jewish
community on very similarly the Asian
community have hard work and education
and all that so that you'd be decide we
have to put you at the bottom of the
oppression Olympics so there's an
interesting like strange Alliance now
now building up are you seeing that I
could say yeah I see it coming
I see well we were talking about the bit
about this earlier about how the left is
gonna eat its own until there is only
one person left so it's only a matter of
time really we're all gonna find each
other and say yeah we've had enough of
this I mean gay men you guys don't count
doesn't count to be
anymore so and I never wanted extra
credit I wanted equality equality I
wanted equal credit not extra credit
yeah so I'm in a weird way I'm actually
okay being thrown out in that regard of
this pyramid because I don't want to
play that game but I think actually
finally some gay men especially gay
white men because now they're they're
fully thought of as the enemy I mean
I've even seen things on college
campuses where LGBT organizations are
saying well you can't be a gay white man
and be the president of the organization
because you're you're one of the bad
guys I mean that that's really dangerous
thinking well I saw what you had to deal
with too with that professor who said
that the LGBT community doesn't want you
at the was at the University of
University of New Hampshire yeah do you
know that so I didn't know at the time
so I think much of my audience will know
what you're referring to but I spoke at
University of New Hampshire and they
were all these hecklers there and there
was a trans woman who I did not know was
a professor I didn't know that until
literally two months later who was was
screaming at me how much I hate trans
people all this and I kept saying I want
you to have equality under the law and I
want you to be treated with decency and
respect and I hope you find someone that
loves you all of the things I would want
for anyone else I just don't want the
government using dictating what pronouns
I can use to refer to you and you know
basically she was calling me all right
and all that and of course it turns out
she's a gender studies professor yeah I
should never be a surprise anymore
but there's gonna be no discipline at
the school or anything like that I mean
I could probably make more of a hey of
it and see what happens but it's like
yeah you know you handled it amazingly
well and works I mean it's only a matter
of time like I see with feminism they're
turning on white women now too so
it's insane is that the only logical
outcome of these disciplines because
they are not held to the scientific
standard of everything else that we
discussed here in the first half
that you that you are held to as a
scientist yeah I think because
everything is there's so much based in
subjective feeling and validating
people's experiences you apparently
can't question someone's experience so
if someone's offended or they don't like
you what can you say so I could see that
and it's it's very much rewarding people
for being emotionally driven instead
I think the best way to have a debate is
to remove emotion and just try to look
at the facts as objectively as you can
no matter what the issue is so it's that
it's that they don't really have any
sort of method to how they do their even
their researches I mean it's kind of a
joke yeah but are we kind of hearing
that even the methods now are part of
the patriarchy and all of those things
you're using facts they don't want facts
to actually count because they believe
in this postmodern drivel that that
facts have been arrived to by mechanisms
that they don't believe in that's it
that's a tough thing to trick somebody
out of yeah but you know I think on some
level I think some of these scholars
know that what they're doing is very
lucrative and so they're just basically
trying to shut people down in any way
they can they can't really justify it
but you know they just keep screaming
about it and academics who have better
things to do like actually do real
research and they've got their courses
and their students and a million other
things and they're 80-hour workweeks
they don't have time to deal with this
so this is why there's such a lopsided
discourse in terms of what you see
coming out of the universities and there
are some institutions that you know they
won't allow academics to engage with the
media without permission first so that
that's part of it too it's just it's
really an unfair battle right now that's
being fought yeah how do you think we
get to a place where specifically
related to sexuality and topics related
to gender and sex where we will be able
to talk about it in a in a better way so
for example the me2 movement where
everybody every I think basically
thinking person understands that there
were some really bad people here that
did some really bad stuff obviously
Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and some
people that really that drugged people
and that you know years of history of
doing all this and then there's all
sorts of other people who seem like
they're just getting swept up in it or
basically accused or all that now you
can be for the idea of the me2 movement
without being for taking down all of
these other people also and I guess what
the real issue is is litigating
everyone's history where we could all
look back and go I did this someone did
that to me this that the other thing
college kids now have
and assign things before they hook up I
mean really where we're creating this
situation where our interpersonal
relations are going to have almost
nothing to do with the stuff that's
hardwired into us the stuff that you
study mm-hmm I think me too probably
started as something honorable and I do
agree that women and men have been
dealing with harassment for far too long
and that it doesn't get taken seriously
sometimes but it's to the point now
where relations are so strained
especially between men and women I sense
men are terrified and that's not going
to be helpful across the board for
anybody I think especially when you look
at shades of gray well I mean there's so
much I could say on this no best place
to start would be with consent say I
think one message that's been missing as
women I've read about this women need to
advocate for themselves and that's not
to say if you are experienced harassment
or if you were assaulted that you are at
fault I'm not advocating victim blaming
but I think what's missing from this
narrative women are portrayed as though
they're helpless and if something
happens to them they're helpless and
that they're basically they have no say
in terms of how men behave towards them
and you know I've written about sexism
in the sciences and how women are
basically being scared off I think of
going into the field as someone with a
PhD in a science field yeah you deal
with sexism and it's unpleasant but I
still got my degree and now I'm speaking
out about it so if you want to achieve
something you can a sexism it's not so
terrible in the world that women can't
achieve what they want so going back to
consent you know I think women need
young women especially you need to be
told you know you have a say in this if
you don't like something or if you don't
want to do something say so don't don't
feel like it's on the man - I don't read
your mind and I feel like I'm gonna get
in so much trouble for saying this but I
think that empowers women instead of
telling them you know just really hope
that this doesn't happen to you and if
it does then get on Twitter and use the
hashtag and talk about how men are
terrible and men are trashed men are not
terrible they're lovely men in the world
you know there are some bad men but you
can't generalize to all men yeah but we
love the generalization thing right I
mean you even see this the amount of
articles where I see you know we have to
take down white it's always white yeah
we have to take down or or now it's
women's turn to rule the world or all of
these things and it's like well a woman
could be president or a woman could be
you know anything that a man could be
but it shouldn't be because she's a
woman it should be because she's just
capable but but we've seen this sort of
hysterical reaction to it and I think
that that now is just another one of
these places where we're on this crazy
pendulum just bouncing back and forth
yeah I'm hoping it's going to come back
to the middle and hopefully not too much
damage will be done before that happens
and that the you know relations between
men and women aren't going to be so
terribly strained I do think we're
reaching that point though because there
are only so many men left who haven't
been accused of a me-too moment so no
it's only a matter of time you know it's
interesting I have a running joke with
some of my friends that I know a lot of
great straight girls in LA that are
single mm-hmm a lot of straight great
girls I don't know a lot of straight
guys that I think are great like I know
I know some straight guys that are
whatever but I don't know like a lot of
straight guys that kind of have their
 together that are so I have all
these girls that are like oh can you set
me up with a guy and I'm like not guys I
know which does show that there's sort
of a crisis I think in masculinity or
something and obviously Jordan Peterson
is addressing this at some level
although now I've spent so much time
with him I think he's addressing it in a
certain way almost equally for men and
women although people only focus on the
male part but do you know is anyone
doing research on sort of what is
happening to young men in particular
right now hmm that's a good question I
know that levels of testosterone are
lower on average more recently so I
don't know if that has something to do
with it do we know what that what the
reasoning for that is could be maybe
there's more estrogens that are that
we're putting into our bodies trying to
think of what I can give you because
that's an interesting so how old are
your friends I'm curious this sort of
set of friends that I'm
these girls usually are in there sort of
like early 30s yeah kind of thing and
there and they're single which you know
most often cases a lot of them their
friends are married already
and like there they're on the hunt and
they've got good jobs and they look good
and they take care of themselves and all
of those things and I just don't see the
equivalent here mm-hmm
I don't maybe there's an odd subset of
because la is like a little bit of an
odd place maybe there's more gay people
here I don't know exactly yeah I mean I
could see the average age for people
getting married is 28 so I don't want to
I don't want to generalize and say that
across
what do you Sciences want to be fair
yeah yeah but I mean it could be that
for guys who are a certain age if
there's a reason but at the same thing
for women of a certain age and not to
say that you're friends of course but
you know if you're focused on your
career maybe you're not used to giving
your time to someone else that could be
part of it yeah yeah do you think that
the feminist movement which I know is
sort of we've sort of ancillary been
talking about it this whole time that
they really did give up something very
special by putting so much focus on work
and success in that way I mean you know
I think back to my childhood now which I
think in retrospect was so amazing my
mom was home for most of it she worked
before I'm the oldest of three she
worked before I was there and then she
didn't work all the years that she was
raising us and then went back to work
after and that having someone at home
that was cooking and taking care of us
and making sure we got to school and all
of those things like that's like the
greatest thing that anyone could do it
happens to more often be the woman but
that's a that's a pretty great thing
that's often been sacrificed now we're
thought of it it's mocked in a way now
yeah I mean I've always been a typical
in terms of I've always been felt more
masculine I've always been very focused
in my career but I definitely think that
feminism and for some people or some
proponents of feminism they will
denigrate female typical roles and
motherhood and wanting to be you know at
home with your family and I think you
know I've heard from women who say I've
been told that the path to happiness is
for me to focus on my career and
to neglect my personal life and and then
they reach a point where they realize no
I do want those things and I don't think
there should be anything wrong with that
and the same thing you know I've written
about how there's such an emphasis for
for girls to be like boys now I saw you
tweet about babies yeah babies and
underlined that is a sexism that you
know says that girls need to be like
boys in order to be equal or worthy of
respect and no one's talking about that
where people are just saying yeah
for sure let's just you know tell girls
that they have to be the same as boys
and women have to be the same as men
yeah so the article you're referring to
it there was this piece I think was in
Newsweek that these parents are raising
their twins as babies th ey babies
babies because and they're gonna let
them pick their gender mm-hmm and it's
like you're gonna create more
psychological problems than you were
trying to hide them from most likely I
think yeah and it goes back to biology
again and hormonal exposure in utero
yeah I think it's great that he might
have been NBC News I think that means
okay yeah yeah but I think there are a
couple outlets that were so excited
about this and the whole that's what it
without was why I wrote about it not
because of the thing you know these
parents can do whatever they want that's
what I followed up with immediately
after parents could do whatever they
want and then when the children are of
age they can either decide my parents
were crazy or not right this is on the
parents right and all that but but that
wasn't the issue for me it was that the
way these headlines are always written
it's like that this it was like this is
the new thing and the implicit piece of
that is you better do this yeah to be a
good parent and tolerant parent to be a
progressive parent and that is
open-minded person and that to me is the
danger here
not the little isolated case necessarily
of these people that are doing something
that's an outlier thing yeah and and the
thing is I've heard stories now where
people are terrified of giving their
daughters dolls and which is what's
really funny is you have some of these
really progressive parents who raised
their girls they only have
gender-neutral toys or they give them
boys toys and then the girl obviously
goes to school and sees girl typical
toys and wants to play for them and the
parents are horrified and they think oh
this is the patriarchy coming in the
return of the Patriots just biology and
we shouldn't be a
and we shouldn't we shouldn't shame
girls for wanting to be female typical
[Music]
joining me today is a sex researcher a
neuroscientist and co-host of the wrong
speak podcast dr. Deborah so welcome to
the Rubin report hi I am glad to have
you here finally I'm so happy to be here
all right we got a lot to talk about I
thought the best way to start this thing
I don't like to look at my notes upfront
but you had a line on your patreon page
that I thought summed up the whole damn
thing pretty perfectly your patreon bio
says creating journalism that defends
science and free speech you've come to
the right show all right I think so yeah
okay should we talk about sex first
should we just start with sex and then
cuz it's all gonna it all bleeds into
one thing definitely yeah okay you
started as a neuroscientist
but you were sort of more attracted for
a lack of a better word to studying sex
tell me about that yeah so I mean I
decided to go back to school and do my
PhD in neuroscience and along the way I
had the chance to do a placement in
psychology so I'd never heard of sex
research before I had no idea what it
was but it was so fascinating to me and
I thought it's crazy that we have the
technology to look at people's brains
and look at sexual arousal in the brain
and it tells us so much about what it
means to be human so from from there I
was hooked I loved it my PhD was in
using brain imaging to look at
paraphilias which are a typical sexual
interest and hyper sexuality in men and
I love research I always will but I made
the decision to leave academia and work
full-time as a journalist now because
the climate had changed so much even
between when I started my PhD and when
it when I finished yeah and that's why
the stuff that you're talking about
really is a nexus of everything that I'm
doing here because now you're on the
journalist side but it's because of the
hostility that you were facing on the
academic side so what worried what is it
that you were unearthing or studying
that was so triggering to people HM well
within psychology you can't really study
anything that isn't triggering it's
across the board someone's gonna get mad
at you no matter what but even though
you're really looking at facts you're
look you're you're looking to find
yeah exactly and even with brain imaging
I mean that's that's definitely it's a
growing feel the technology is
legitimate but no matter what I think
because sex is still considered very
taboo people will either project their
own ideas and beliefs and values onto it
or they just don't see the value and
they think why is the government funding
this I feel really lucky being in Canada
we do have a pretty amazing scene in
terms of sex research and my colleagues
do manage to get funding so I think
that's excellent but my decision to
leave academia in the last two years I
had noticed things were starting to go a
bit weird and in terms of the climate
and in terms of mainstream media I was
seeing piece after piece about
transgender kids and how young children
were socially transitioning getting on
blockers pubertal blockers and the media
is basically saying this is the greatest
thing this is something that we should
rejoice about that these kids are so
much better off after but from a
scientific perspective the research
actually shows that the majority of kids
who are gender dysphoria grow their
feelings they're more likely to grow up
to be gay in adulthood not transgender
and so it makes sense for them to wait
not for them to socially transition at a
young age so I wanted to write a
mainstream piece about this and there's
been a very long-standing history
between trans activists and sex
researchers a very ugly history of
activists going after sex researchers if
they don't like what some one study says
or what they say publicly so I thought
about it for a long time I wrote the
piece and I sat on it probably for about
six months and I wasn't sure if I wanted
to put it out I asked a bunch of my
colleagues and mentors and they all said
you know what the science is solid but
you know you know what's gonna happen if
you do put this out and at the time I
wanted to stay in academia and I said
should I wait till I get tenure and
everyone told me even if you have tenure
nowadays it's not going to protect you
you can still lose your job so I decided
eventually I couldn't stay quiet and I
thought I'm not going to stay in an
environment where I can't speak the
truth and I can't even pursue questions
that are meaningful anymore because I
have to worry about who's gonna get mad
and then I'm gonna lose my money and my
funding and I'm gonna lose my job so
that piece went out it's called white
transgender kids show a way to
transition and
and I haven't looked back since yeah so
I reread I've read the piece before but
I reread it this morning thank you I got
here and there's a lot here so how much
of this is just blade is just blatantly
a misunderstanding of science like I
think there's partly that you have a
misunderstanding of science and then you
just have activists who just want you to
bow to them all the time are you able to
sort of quantify how much of the
backlash is each I think should be
charitable I try to look at the other
side and give them you know credit and
try to you know think that they have
good intentions
maybe people I mean it's pretty
consistent all 11 studies ever done on
the topic of desist in so this
phenomenon I talked about where kids
grow out of their feelings of gender
dysphoria all of them say the same thing
so the final statistic is about 60 to 90
percent so this is the vast majority of
kids you can't really question those
data so I think what it could be is
people I mean trans people have a
history of having you do of medical
gatekeeping of people telling them they
don't really what they feel isn't real
I do think gender dysphoria is a real
phenomenon and I do think we should have
empathy for people who are suffering so
I think it could be coming from that of
that place of well we don't want people
saying that this isn't a legitimate
thing or that trans people should be
forced to not feel the way they do but
in terms of you know these children we
should be thinking about the best
outcome so it doesn't make sense for
them to transition if that's not
actually going to help them in the long
term I try to give people the benefit
the doubt but I do think the activists
they on some level I think they know
that they can bully sex researchers
because of that history they know that
there's only so much an academic can do
and they've won a couple battles so I
think that's part of it as well
how shocking was it to you when you were
discussing this with colleagues that
they were kind of hinting you may want
to wait on this thing I mean did you
think that you'd be in that situation
and I'm wondering did any of them sit on
some other things because they were
afraid to hmm it was eye-opening
yeah but I kind of knew one
one I guess instance I can talk about is
one colleague Michael Bailey at
Northwestern University he wrote a book
that upset transgender activists and
they went off after him ruthlessly I
mean they really tried to destroy his
life and thankfully you know he's he's
still considered one of the foremost
experts in psychology internationally
but I would say that you know I've
written about him previously I think
he's kind of been the poster boys to why
people are really terrified to say
anything that goes against the trans
narrative yeah so I think you've already
hinted at this and I know your work
otherwise but so you have no issue with
trans people as people just to be clear
this is purely about the science related
to transitioning and hormone blockers
and things of that nature of a certain
age where they're doing it as young as I
think you're right about 14 right oh
younger than that now well yeah I mean
if there's parental consent definitely
and I have to say for transgender adults
and I say even kids who reach puberty
and still feel that way I think
transitioning is is totally up to you if
that's what the path you decide to go
then power to you I don't think there's
any ones penny it's anyone's business to
tell you what to do at that point so a
lot of their basic parameters related to
age then well there are in terms of I
don't work with children I don't do
clinical work anymore but in terms of
the research literature usually
clinicians will wait until puberty and
see how the child feels at that time
when the body starts changing when they
start having crushes on their peers and
that kind of thing and the research does
show that when kids start to you know
have crushes and start dating and that
can play a role in terms of how they
feel about their bodies and whether they
do outgrow it but just at that point
your whole body is in flux your mental
states and flux your physical states and
flux and as you said what did you say a
percentage on that of how many of them
turn out to just they generate so yeah
so they so sixty to ninety percent of
the the children undergoing these
feelings turn out to be gay and then I
assume the ones that don't transition
probably most of them end up being okay
with being gay I would imagine
roughly yeah and I would say even I grew
up in the gay community I have a lot of
gay male friends and they've said to me
when I was young I told my parents all
the time
hated being a boy and I wanted to be a
girl and I am a girl and why can't I
become a girl and now as a gay man I'm
so comfortable I'm so happy and they say
to me you know I'm kind of glad I'm not
growing up in this time because I think
I probably would have transitioned yeah
well that's why the the external
pressure seems so crazy to me because
you just don't know at that at that age
and even if you do know waiting a little
bit isn't gonna for the science to flesh
out it's not that's not gonna kill you
it's just hard talking about this even
you know yeah I mean the thing is what
people also aren't talking about is that
for these kids so in some cases the
parents don't want a gay child and this
is what upsets me the most so if you
have a little boy who's very feminine
he's likely gonna grow up to be a gay
man but if you take that same Lavoie and
allow him to transition to female when
he grows up he's gonna appear to be a
straight woman and so these parents are
being lauded as progressive when really
they're homophobic God how perverse that
is that's interesting what you just said
about a certain amount of gay men that
grow up you know they wanted to be or
felt more like a girl or whatever and
that eventually grow out and we were
okay
because I never felt that like I played
sports and I played video games and
transformers all all the things that my
friends did I never felt like I was a
girl or more effeminate people always
say to me I don't seem gay I'm always
like I don't know what that you know I
didn't mean like I'm married to a guy
yeah I mean that's pretty gay but I
never had that but that's that's sort of
just interesting about the psychology Oh
gay people in general there are gay
people that grow up feeling very
effeminate or gay men that grow up not
feeling that way and I'm sure there's
women that grow up feeling very butch or
whatever and there's women that grow up
that are you know lipstick lesbians yeah
and the whole thing have you done any
research on it on any of that in terms
of my research no but in terms of what
studies have shown it is about hormone
levels in utero
so testosterone if you are exposed to
higher levels of testosterone in utero
you're more likely to be male typical in
masculine when you're born so whether
you're male or female so most boys are
exposed to high levels of testosterone
so that explains when they're born why
they are interested in male typical toys
and activities so for gay men they were
likely exposed to lower levels of
testosterone which is why
they're more feminine and the same with
with girls if they're exposed to higher
levels of testosterone they're more
likely to be masculine and lesbian right
even though there's obvious outliers
this is on average on average anna is is
there danger in talking about that
because I would imagine that the certain
amount of people in the gay community
that would want you to never go down
that road because then you could end up
in a place where oh we would be able to
prevent people from being hey ultimately
if we can really figure out the science
behind all this definitely and I mean as
a straight woman I have to say I even
iron right now feel like maybe I
shouldn't be saying these things because
I'm not gay I can't speak for the a
community but as a former sex researcher
I am very much a proponent of I'd rather
you speak researcher that a gay person
or a straight person or anything else I
mean this this is the problem though
you're you know to be like you're an
expert in this and it's like even for
you who's so brave on all of these
issues it gets weird to talk about it
even for me I just it's like a little
weird to talk about you feel like a
traitor no I I am what I am and that's
all that I am that's it but like I know
that just even talking about this just
gets people crazy and I know what our
what our Twitter feeds are gonna look
like yeah you get ready so I mean it's
crazy because even my colleagues who
have the best intentions they're doing
this research because they just want to
understand why are people the way they
are it's not there are no nefarious
intentions there but people are so quick
to jump on I mean there was earlier this
year that there was a study about using
AI to be able to detect whether someone
is gay by looking at their face and so
again studies have shown that on average
you can see differences between straight
and gay people both men and women in
terms of facial features and so
everyone's freaking out about this study
and I'm thinking why aren't we saying
this is amazing that we are able to know
this and I mean I think I've really good
gaydar I've always thought I have and
now I think great like there's actually
some quantitative data to suggest that
I'm not just making things up right and
they're also they always say well gay
guys have gaydar there's something else
that maybe you can see or whatever it is
or though they're I don't know the
people say it anymore but he was just a
gay face like there was just something
about the facial features sometime
of gay men maybe they were a little
softer or whatever it is I don't even
know what it is but like people were
talking about that in the gay community
then it comes out through some sort of
science lens and it's like ooh we better
watch out for that and the thing is then
researchers see that and say well I
don't want to go through that so then
they don't want to touch that topic so
now there's they're eventually going to
be only like two different things you
can probably study unless you know that
what your findings what you're going to
find is going to be politically
acceptable in which case you shouldn't
be doing the research because that means
you're not actually doing science yeah
what do you think it is about you that
makes you brave enough to do this sort
of thing because I've had a couple other
people we're going to talk about James
the more in a little bit cuz you've also
written about him and and why the whole
thing about diversity and all that but
I've had a bunch of outliers in these
communities on the show and I'm always
curious what it is about the specific
people that make them sort of put it out
there and go I'm gonna do it whether you
like it or not it's probably my
personality yeah I mean I just generally
don't really care what people think
about me and I'm pretty stubborn and I
I'm very I feel very strongly about sex
research being taken seriously and my
decision to have gone and gone into that
field you deal with a lot of stigma as I
mentioned earlier you deal with it on
both sides you know and when you make
the decision to go into the field
suddenly when people know what you do
they will judge you on a personal level
so I think that was part of it you know
I grew a very thick skin from saying I'm
gonna do what I find interesting people
can assume whatever they want about me
and that I think that just translated
into now what I do as a science
journalist but this I would say to and
I'm sure you probably went through a
similar experience once you speak out it
becomes much easier and I find I can't I
can't stay quiet now and I find the
people that are gonna you know turn
their backs on you let them because you
don't need them in your life yeah once
you start you just you can't stop
actually yeah if it's built into you you
just can't stop so one of the things I
think is really interesting is how you
know there's there's such a movement
always to say that gay people are born
this way right Lady Gaga even wrote a
song about war in this way party Gaga
yeah and yet at the same time if I know
for a fact like I have a friend who for
many years was my lesbian friend
one good lesbian friend and she was you
know datin girls all the time and all
that then about three years ago we were
sitting there and she told me that she
met a guy and now she's been with this
guy for about three or four years and
they're getting married and she
identifies basically as bisexual now but
she's only she's exclusively been with a
guy for about four years but what I find
interesting about it is that her lesbian
friends have basically all turned on her
and this is supposed to be that these
are supposed to be the people of
tolerance and we should accept your
sexuality and all that but when it goes
the other way suddenly it becomes this
other thing have you have you seen that
before I suspect you hey I can imagine
that I'm guessing they probably think
that she sold out they think she's a
sellout
yeah yeah you're taking the easy road or
something like that like every insane
cliche and I know her to be completely
authentic and real how does how has she
dealt with it I'm curious it's been well
it's woken her up in a zillion other
ways so for a lot of the other things
that that we talked about about free
speech and politics and freedom and all
that she started to wake up to all of
that she was a huge lefty progressive
and now she's basically a libertarian
because she saw that authoritarian thing
why do you guys want to control me yeah
the second I think differently you guys
want to control me yeah so now she's
like the locust of all of my friends so
to speak that's the thing I think all of
us are eventually gonna have a moment
like that where you realize what you
thought was the truth is not the truth
and there there's so many other things
it's like falling down that rabbit hole
in real and you start to question
everything then and it's really
liberating but you know in terms of
sexuality that's I mean that's very
common women female sexuality is much
more fluid than men so men tend to be
very category specific if you're into
women you really like women and you're
[Music]
joining me today is a New York Times
bestselling author the guy who wrote
that mid-90s New York Knicks anthem a
man who has founded enterprises from
private jet companies - Zico coconut
water the co-owner of the NBA's Atlanta
Hawks and Oh a former rapper Jessie its
lair welcome to the Rubin report thanks
for having me
dude your bio is like complete doesn't
even seem like it could possibly be real
it's been a quite a journey yeah quite a
journey
alright there's so much I want to do
with you I said - you're right before we
started I mean I remember that 94 Knicks
team so well that was like right in my
formative years of basketball which I
loved I said to you right before we
started that that game six which as a
Knicks fan is probably one of the most
painful things you ever watched was the
night of my senior prom and of course
the night of the OJ Simpson car chase
you lived through that whole experience
I did I was at the knick game that night
I was at the knick game as a playoff
game I just written the theme song for
the Knicks and started was starting to
get momentum on the radio and in the
garden and I was so I mean my whole life
go up and Knick fan this was a big
moment and here we are game 6 at home
and all of a sudden the OJ chase I was
getting like a pretzel I went outside I
was everyone's looking at the monitor
and I looked up I'm like what in the
world is this oh wow so they were
showing you don't go out to the
concessions yeah yeah it was on the
monitors so you know I was conflicted
and people were running back and forth
there was wild yeah what a crazy night
because the the Rangers had just won the
Stanley Cup Finals I think and it was
just like a great time to be in New York
then OJ obviously people must have been
talking about my prom so I can only
imagine what was going on over there all
right so speaking of New York you're
from Rosalyn Long Island I'm from
Syosset Long Island we're about 10
minutes away from each other neighbors
on the Long Island Expressway I find
that a lot of interesting people come
out of Long Island have you found that
is it the water what's going on you know
it's crazy I was telling this
conversation in the day with
in mind and I was saying in my town if
you took the year that I graduated my
senior year and went back four years and
forward four years so in that eight year
gap or whatever it is from you know of
kids that went through my school we have
I think we have two with three
professional sports team owners we have
multiple billionaires I have five guys
that I went to high school is better in
jail we've had multiple suicides and
Bernie Madoff was from my town I look at
my town and think that everybody had the
same opportunity same teachers we had
one movie theater I mean it was a small
relatively small town one that one real
hot one high school that everyone went
to a real sense of community everyone
had the same basically you know journey
through with as far as teachers and
everything yeah we had this crazy swing
of the biggest Ponzi schemer and his
family and sons were in our school
you know guys that were super successful
people that had super successful parents
that went to jail I mean all in this
community it was like whoa what was in
the water yeah in this town what do you
make of that actually cuz there's got to
be something there I mean even my high
school I mean there I knew a couple
people that I went to high school with
that ended up in jail but we also had
Judd Apatow into my high school idina
menzel huge Broadway star Natalie
Portman yeah into my high school and and
all sorts of things I think that I would
feel very lucky that I grew up in the
town that I grew up in and the area that
we grew up in yeah that you know is it
was diverse there was a lot of
opportunity there was creativity it
wasn't far from the city so we had like
a little bit of a city vibe is that what
it is I think it has something to do
with the proximity because we were about
45 minutes away from New York City most
of our parents I'm guessing maybe your
parents who worked in New York City so
there was like a little bit of a
commuter thing but you weren't totally
part of New York like something related
to the neck I think that's part of it I
think for me I think it's just the time
period that I grew up you know as a kid
yeah and there was just a change in
music change in culture and we were just
exposed being close to the city we had
early exposure to all those trends
and we were early to the party and I
think that had a big impact at least it
did for me I know as an entrepreneur and
in my journey it was exciting
there was always excitement I want to be
part of everything yeah so you know I
got addicted to newness because there
was always something new going on and
that fueled me even going forward so I
feel very lucky that you know we grew up
where we did yeah anything else I should
know about your your formative years or
family before we get into some of the
things that you know well know if
there's nothing else specific you said
addicted to newness so I feel this is
the right time to play a little clip
from you as a rapper known as Jesse
James lovely
Wow oh man Jesse James that wasn't in
the in the email that you sent me about
the Shelf that you're gonna flashback we
have a pretty crack research team around
here we're going full flashback before
before we get to the future okay and the
president how did that happen
like I said grew up in Long Island in
the 80s you know when hip-hop was coming
was emerging I got really into it at an
early age and then when I was in college
you know I when everybody is writing
their resumes and sending out resumes I
was like I'm gonna try to make a record
yeah I'm like this is what I want to do
yeah and there was no B plan and
ultimately you know that passion really
for three years of college I was working
towards trying to get a record deal and
ultimately landed a deal with a company
called delicious final mountain Cali not
far from where we are and they had two
big acts of the time they had a guy
named Tony Loko yeah Wild Thing a very
old Medina and then they had it had a
little bit of a tone loke feel to it
that yeah some producers yeah and then
we had a young MC who want to grab me
for bust-a-move yeah so I was able to uh
Aksai I didn't know that but yeah
literally I was watching it this morning
and I said to David my producer that
it's not that's what it sounded like
yeah so same guys and same year a same
time yeah and put an album out in the
early 90s Wow
so I was watching and I was thinking man
time changes you know things change we
get sensitive to different things but I
would guarantee if a young guy like you
put that song out now talking about a
white woman and a white rapper we'd have
a certain amount of people screaming
about cultural appropriation and all
sorts other stuff was that anything
remotely something back then well you
know I think it was it wasn't my mind
but the shaker like a white girl was my
first single yeah was actually a remake
the title of an old EU song or no
song from watching a band in Washington
DC huh
that was predominate was all black so I
felt like I was just kind of taking the
momentum of this hit song yeah and
introducing it to the theme to you know
was fun I was in college I was I wrote
the whole album basically you know as a
fraternity in my fraternity house and
yeah it was pretty tongue-in-cheek
yeah it kind of makes you wish that
things were as simple now as they were
back then right cuz you are you
following me on this like I guess see
like some opportunity kid doing
something silly like that now and and
just like getting just like a ton of
 for it yeah I mean if it was
totally good-natured and all that it was
totally good-natured but I look back on
it now and I think you know if I were to
go back in time I probably would do a
lot of things differently just based on
what I know now and you know I'm turning
50 so I'm very aware of you know what
chapter I on in my life but when I look
back at me at 21 and what I knew then
and you know all the mistakes I made at
21 but you know it's part of the growth
and part of the journey yeah
alright so I want to get to some of the
growth in the journey I want to get a
book and all that stuff but wait let's
just jump back to the to the go New York
go New York go thing yeah how in the
world did that even appear that you were
gonna be the guy that wrote that thing
and were you shocked that it caught on I
mean the video which will will also link
through down below I like I remember
every moment of that so what happened
for me is right after college no resume
you know got rejected by a lot of record
labels I had no contacts my dad on the
plumbing supply house in Mineola also
not free I wasn't right there we had I
didn't know anyone that was connected to
anything so I had to take this whole
this whole process on my own shoulders
and I would literally take a Greyhound
bus on Friday from Washington DC where I
went to school with my demo tape which
was a recording of an instrumental that
I played on my CD player and I would hit
record on my answering machine and leave
a rap to the music while it was playing
that was out the only way I could man
unbelievable sound like a time warp I
know that's that was the only way I
could do it no I would show up and hand
out
that cassette to everybody and got
rejected but ultimately I did get a
record I get to get a record deal and
but that was my only goal so I took my
foot off the gas pedal once I got the
deal and I didn't get signed for a
second album which to me was crushing at
the time because the only thing on my
resume now was you know failed rapper
yeah you know it was also a kiddie pool
attendant before there so that wasn't
really gonna get me a job on watch me
that's like a low-level life their
training and walk no peeing that was if
you could say walk and stop stop peeing
you could get the job they're always
peeing on that there always be there's
nothing get him out of there but in any
event I wanted to stay even though I
didn't get picked up for a second album
I wanted to marry my two passions which
was sports and music and I had this idea
to write a theme song for the Knicks I
was like all of a sudden sports were
changing the game is only 48 minutes and
you're there you're a fan for 48 minutes
but for the other two hours that you're
in the arena during timeouts you're an
audience yeah and the teams had to
entertain the audience and now they
brought in the dancers the Knicks City
Dancers came in and they had video
boards that all of a sudden never
existed so let's do a theme song like
the Bears did a song in 86 oh yeah let's
do a theme song we'll get all the
celebrities involved and and maybe it'll
catch on so I wrote this demo basically
in my apartment which was like a dorm
room and I played it for the Knicks and
how'd you even get that meeting I
hearted doing jingles and somehow I did
a jingle for Nancy grünfeld
clothing company her husband Ernie was
the GM uh-huh and she loved the jingle
and I said well Nancy if you love this
let's let's do something for the next
let's try this
so she said I'll take a shot at it so I
just did it on spec I walked in and I
knew it there was something there yeah
and I played it for them and they said
you know we'll give you a $4,000 for the
song and I said okay I hired a write
down in there you said okay right then
and there
oh yeah no lawyer nothing doc I didn't
ask any questions up for
dollars whose 8 months of rent yeah so I
when I hired a lawyer ultimately any
lawyer studio engineer singer drummer
producer etc it cost me 48 hundred
dollars to do this song but every team
that came into Madison Square Garden
said why don't we have a theme so uh
this and the Knicks got hot and it
became the number one most requested
song that little jingle on New York
radio and I realize like that's the
white space nobody else is everyone's
trying to get on MTV and get their
records and Tower Records but no there's
a category a new category that I could
create sports music and I started doing
theme songs for professional sports
teams yeah it's so awesome like it's
just such a great story of just like a
kid basically a kid just like it oh no
just get out there and do something it's
kind of a kind of a beautiful thing you
must look at it back I can see sort of
in your face like there's like a
nostalgia to it cuz it was just like I
just what it was
I look at it from that chapter of my
life where I had 21 years old there were
no consequences like if I didn't get
this song I would have gone to the next
team and kept I was so deeply connected
to my dream they're emotionally
connected to the goal that I was on a
Greyhound bus every day try I mean I
would do anything so just to have the
opportunity that it was just everything
else was gravy yeah so is that really
where the entrepreneurial spirit started
with you because it seems like you got
that going and then that opened up a
whole slew of other doors that opened up
the floodgates for some big for some big
futures you know successes and failures
but I was thinking about this actually
yesterday on a run you know I used to
you'll probably remember I don't know if
you're into tennis yeah but the US Open
was right by you know you can take our
yeah flushing yes we would just take the
train you know my there were no rules my
parents also by 8 o'clock at night yeah
I would take the the train and I
remember I would never have a ticket and
all I could look I would look forward to
being able to try to sneak into the US
Open and I remember though that I've
kind of figured out how to sneak into
the US Open regularly so I would go no
ticket everyone's online and I would go
to like how I went in
and then I would walk out and see if I
could do it again someone else that was
really the start of like as I look back
like I just want I like challenges yeah
it doesn't there's not about anything
other than can I figure it out and and
it started for me at an early age and
ultimately it gravity you know I started
to gravitate towards business yeah so
let's let's get there so okay you're
making the jingles some things happen
you're obviously making money probably
some serious money for the first time
how does this get you to starting
incubators and starting these companies
so I'm so all the soap so every team
that came into Madison Square Garden
said why don't we have a song like this
who did this yeah and I was a guy so I
started writing all these team songs and
ultimately sold though that company to a
public company called SFX and the owner
of SFX had a timeshare in a private jet
and he invite was like 26 years old my
he invited my partner and I as guests
onto his private jet it was like the
scene in The Wizard of Oz when we walked
on the plane when everything goes from
black and white on the plane I'm like
people fly like this yeah and by the
time we land in my partner turned to me
is like we had to start a private jet
company so we can fly around on these
planes and I was like let's do it that's
hilarious and that's literally how we
started this company that ultimately be
caught I was called marquee jet yeah
that became the largest private jet card
company in the world so you eventually
sold the company it's called nest yet it
was called marquee jet I saw the two
warren buffett's burnett jets which is a
berkshire hathaway company yeah and then
so then now you're rolling in dough it
was it was a change definitely a
life-changing moment for me yeah but
again I love newness and I was at that
time in my life I just ran a hundred
mile run for charity and I gave myself
90 days to train for it and during the
process of my training I discovered
coconut water because I did a lot of
research around hydration and nutrition
if you're gonna run 24 you know 100
miles non-stop yeah would eat what do
you drink and how many calories do you
take in and
you're experimenting with that with that
now through your new diet without going
through but I discovered coconut water
and which ultimately you know I fueled
me for this race that I completed and
when I was done I was like man this is
the Fountain of Youth this is gonna be
the next big thing in beverage you know
it's like this is the next orange juice
mrs. Nick's pom wonderful and I spent a
year traveling the globe trying to
figure out how to import coconut water
or what yours is this is 2007 2007 so
like no honey because it's not that long
ago and yet coconut water is so massive
right now you'd think this would have to
be 25 years ago right but in 2007 I was
even on the chef there was one SKU on
the shelf yeah it wasn't didn't really
exist but I realized that the learning
curve I got like a 980 I'm SAT the
learning curve was 1200 okay alright we
were um old ones I should have called
you I couldn't figure it out man I'm
like I know I can market this but like I
don't know how I'm gonna import this as
so many moving pieces so I ended up
partnering with the company that was you
know on the scene called Zico just doing
a couple million dollars in sales yeah
and then ultimately two years later we
sold it to coke so then then you're
really in the business world like at
that point you've sold to companies and
and you're rolling how do you then go
alright
I like newness what's new after this
because that's what your story seems to
be it's just like another what's new
what's new what's new what's new I get
bored easily and I just you know I
believe in checking the box and like not
celebrating what happened happened
what's next and you know my whole thing
I always talked about this it's just
about building my own personal life
resume not even my business resume and
like I love adventure so I was just
looking for you know whatever that next
opportunity was and it became it was not
for me at in the timeline of my life the
next thing was a book but it wasn't
planned yeah I wasn't planned let's
let's talk about that book a little bit
before we get to this book yeah I was at
a at a race 24 hour race I love
endurance I participated a lot of
endurance events and the race was was a
really really format so I was with five
friends and each runs a mile and you
rotate and whatever
runs the most amount of miles in 24
hours wins the competition but at the
start of the race there was a guy
sitting next to us that no one really
with he had no teammates he was his own
team uh-huh
and he waited like 285 pounds just big
african-american guy just sitting in a
chair everything myself how in the world
is a guy that weighs 285 could have run
for 24 straight hours and the race was
on are you even allowed they let you run
a relay one guy he was like the only
solo you know by himself and it was just
like and I was just so big and
[Music]
all right so let's shift to your new
book living with the monks I want to get
the the subtitle totally right here cuz
I love it
what turning off my phone taught me
about happiness gratitude and focus so
we are taping this right now we're
holding it for a little bit because I
want to air this right before I go off
the grid cuz my audience knows I do this
August off the grid thing literally lock
my phone and is safe no phone no TV no
electronics no nothing I'm gonna work on
my book a little bit I'll probably
escape to a beach for a little bit I'm
not even totally sure what I'm gonna do
but just get off the endless information
grid so before we talk about me and why
I think it's good to do that what led
you to wanting to do this at first place
well I'd spent I'd invested so much in
the physical side for my whole life you
know running marathons and doing
endurance events and had a Navy SEAL
move in with me but I really had felt
like I had neglected the inner side and
just the inner work and I was just going
so fast so I felt - really again maybe
I'm turning older I don't know but to
get the whole package
or that what I want it and be is
well-rounded I really needed that side
it's the spiritual side and and I was
just thinking like well who would be the
best teacher and I thought monks and I
didn't know anything about monks other
than like watching some movies right
you know fringe articles here and there
I thought that'd be really cool to learn
about you know the traditions and how
monks lived their lives and doing
exactly what you said you know I'm I'm
bombarded by information mm-hmm and I
don't spend any time alone and when you
don't spend time alone you lose your
superpower you use your intuition
because you're being influenced by
everybody else and you exercise your gut
muscle I was losing my superpower
so I said to Sara I think I want to go
and was there a moment that you really
felt that you had lost it or that you
could really recognize that you lost it
cause I think a lot of people walk
around with that all the time now I
stopped just cuz the endless social
media you're so hit with stuff
constantly that
does make your your sort of inner
monologue sort of harder to listen to
because it's just being slammed in every
which direct it wasn't buildup I just
felt so distracted yeah and you know we
all feel overwhelmed I mean but I felt
really distracted and I felt like you
know four kids a job I married friends
my parents are getting older I mean all
these different things and then all
these different social media things and
news and Netflix and Hulu a little bit
of like I just want to like I got I
would just be alone and so was it
build-up and then I mean my wife and I
were talking about it and so they just
wanted I'm gonna go and live on a
monastery and she was super encouraging
you know and she was like so so that's
what happened so what do you do you give
a call you yelling yelling yeah yes
sirree no I am I actually found this
monastery through a friend of mine who's
actually my publisher and I went to a
monastery with eight monks which already
was a misconception for me because I
thought monastery meant community meant
hundreds but there were eight monks at
this particular monastery for which have
been there for 50 years Wow and they
lived on 500 acres in the States but in
isolation 500 acres and similar to what
you're about to do in August or now yeah
you know no phone no internet no news no
this no that and I just took 15 days to
decompress so what was it like so you
get there day one I mean what was the
most shocking part I got since you're a
pretty open guy so there was probably
not much that could shock you but like
what do they say do they like take all
your stuff like first of all they were
Russian Orthodox they weren't Buddhists
okay so like that arete I didn't I had
no expectation of anything and I walked
into my room which they call cell that's
the rooms are called self and monastery
look and it was the size of this carpet
like where we are and I had a bed one
little desk with a light and brother
Christopher who was like my go-to monk
sat me down and he's
tomorrow at 7 a.m. we'll start with
prayer reflection and meditation and I
said ok it's 6 p.m. yeah what do I do
13 hours and he looked at me and he said
you think and I said ok and he left the
room and I realized like I can't call my
wife I can't there's no books in my room
I mean they had books but there are no
books there's no like it's super like
eerie quiet yeah and I'm like alright
I'm gonna I'm gonna meditate let me
start the journey
I took a TM Transcendental Meditation
course mm-hmm set my timer for 20
minutes I sat in my chair and I started
to close my eyes focused on my mantra
and I'm getting bombarded oh boy how are
my kids my wife you know the Hawks are
gonna what are we gonna do this yeah
everything in my head and we will talk
about the Hawks we're down by the way
I'm sitting I'm going I'm like why isn't
my beeper beep because I've been here
forever yeah and I'm like I probably
just started so I let me just keep going
keep going and finally there's no beep
and I said well let me just reset my
beeper and I'll start over no I go back
that would be cheating anyway I'm in my
chair forever and I finally like this is
ridiculous I'll just let me reset this
and start this again I open up my eyes I
look at my timer 3 minutes and 27
seconds Wow
and I not only calculated how many
minutes I had left on the monastery like
that 15 days times 24 times and I was
like I just said to myself I'm
like this is this is great on paper yeah
in theory but this gonna be hard
yeah and I just sat in my room and I was
like oh my god what'd I get myself into
were you allowed to leave the room I
could leave the room I couldn't leave
the property this is the craziest
situation so huh
the monks to keep the lights on at the
monastery they breed German Shepherds so
there are 11 adult German Shepherds 8
monks and me so they're selling German
Shepherds yes they sell puppies yeah
that's any trained dogs their world
renowned dog trainers world they've
written books they're sold millions of
copies of books they're just it's just a
really unusual scenario so yes I can
leave my cell yeah
and walk around the monastery but first
of all it's four degrees outside it's
there's no lights it's like pitch dark
at four o'clock right it's freezing
there's bear according to the monks like
so no I really couldn't leave them right
so I mean I just kind of like I ended up
walking 120 miles up and down the
driveway they had because I had to get
some exercise over the course of my
journey but I leave mm-hmm so I just sat
there and you know the first five this
five days was really really difficult
for me and I started immediately doing
probably what I think most people do
certainly what I do I started giving
myself an out I started justifying that
it would be okay to go home early mm-hmm
just seven days man that's enough get
out of here in seven days no one's gonna
say oh you didn't do whatever just and I
started creating all these excuses in my
head and I started thinking myself like
what are the goals do I have in areas of
my life and my giving excuses in you
know and really started like analyze
everything that was going through my
head and put it into out the the real my
real world yeah and I just saw a lot of
things about myself you know through
that through just being quiet and alone
how did you break through that moment of
if I can get away with seven days here
like what was the actual thing that
turned in on it I have a to words that
changed my life that I refer back to all
the time and though when I wanted to go
home those two words were like I signed
up fifteen days that's what that's what
this goal was 15 days day five when I
really want to go home and I missed my
kids and I couldn't call you know the
two words are remembered tomorrow when
you have this big split-second decision
or a big major decision how how is that
decision gonna make you feel tomorrow so
I said to myself if I drop out and quit
now the one time
I'm gonna do this in my life how am I
gonna feel about this tomorrow when I
get home when someone says how'd you do
did you make it terrible you know my
legs are swollen at Mile 18 I want to
drop out of the race or the marathon but
I want to come home the next day after
the New York Marathon did you finish
so remember tomorrow yeah so I just kind
of said that to myself over and over
like just remember how you gonna feel
about this and remember how proud you're
gonna feel at the end of the journey and
before I went my wife said don't leave
until you have a breakthrough you're
broken and I'm like I'm not broken and I
haven't had a breakthrough
I'm saying so did you get broken or have
a breakthrough you know it's funny
Hector I know the answer at least a
while I had some breakthroughs for sure
but I never felt broken and I think I
think the reason I never felt broken is
because it had a definitive end date
yeah so broken for you would have been
like I'm leaving okay like yeah it would
had to really take me to a place of you
know yeah yeah I mean I had moments of
being broken and super sad I mean you
know like when you're away from
everything and you don't know what's
going on you just don't know you don't
know God on my kids getting bullied is
something happening is my wife okay you
know is the world in risk is you just
don't know girl and you start to imagine
that the world's gonna head I think your
brain automatically goes to the worst it
doesn't go to everything it's great it's
like oh I should have been so much
nicer to my wife because I'm gonna go
there she's not gonna be home when I get
home yeah like you start sticking
like that yeah and then you spirals
because you have energy and space to
think and imagine and dream and a vision
and all the that's like it all
comes to the surface and you know
because it's in the real world if you're
having a tough day you could say to Dave
you you you guys good you know what
let's put on movie in Netflix and just
so escape and sit down you order
Chinese food and you have your Netflix
and your watch but guess what
the issues don't go away mm-hmm when the
movies over
 is still there your to-do list
they're still there when I'm watching
that right they're still there yeah and
you know this forced you there was no
escape mm-hmm
this was your escape so it forced me to
have to think through stuff and I got a
lot of clarity you know it's funny
although this is in no way comparable
when I did my off-the-grid thing last
year and if for a week we were ten days
or so we were in Mexico and I just I
just needed to do nothing I just needed
to wake up every morning have a light
breakfast I went to the gym and then I
would just sit I got the same seat at
the beach every day and I would just sit
and stare at the ocean for hours really
for hours and I do a little try to do a
little meditation and stuff but I did
have that moment at one point where I
was like anything could be happening
right now like World War three could be
starting there you know the terror
attacked like but you know zombie
apocalypse like where you go to like the
craziest and then I remember
thinking I was like you know you go
there for a while and then I suddenly
got to the end of it and I was like well
nothing I could do about it right now so
I better reset to this better place and
there's a real discipline in that in how
you can control your mind and your
thoughts
I think the for sure the first three or
four days there I was obsessed with my
to-do list and by day four or five I'm
like if a hurricane came and whisked my
to-do list into the ocean life goes on
like okay yeah and you know I was I was
like a captive to my to-do list because
you know I'm always and it's my to-do
list for me wasn't even about finishing
that the tasks as good as I could
possibly do them it was about finishing
him so I could keep it felt so good to
cross him off that even if it was 70% to
what I could probably do it on to the
next on to the next on to the next at
the monastery the mostly to-do list
there was no to-do list mm-hmm it was
whatever is in front of me yeah is my
task at hand so tell me a little bit
just sort of what that day looks like so
you get up the next morning now it's
it's day two so Dave said did you say
7:00 a.m. or 6 a.m. 7 a.m. and then
prayer start yes so they would ring a
big a big like noted Notre Dame you know
church now loud
I was right next to which was the which
signal to go to the to the church where
they would have a about an
hour-and-a-half service which was
meditation reflection service what was
it religious in anyway yeah they were
Russian Orthodox yeah it was it was a
religion it was religious for me it was
it was peaceful but it was definitely
definitely religious and then and then
we would shift to breakfast which was
traditionally silent most of those
breakfast the breakfast were silent and
that would go to let's say 9:30 or 10:00
and afterwards there'd be a little bit
of a long time and then it would go to
tasks and each of the monks would have a
different responsibility which was just
unbelievably efficient and I spent each
day shadowing a different monk so I got
two rounds basically and then there
would be supper dinner was lunch time so
they flip-flop so breakfast was a really
light meal which for me is just fruit
then lunch their lunch was dinners that
would be the big meal mm-hmm rest well
it's like sleepaway camp you go that's
rest time we'll see if they're more
labor
yeah which could be cleaning the church
doing some whatever the everyone's tasks
were yeah they always have stuff to do
cause it's like it's kind of funny like
if you think about it like all right so
eight guys living at this place we're
always doing stuff oh it seems like
there wouldn't be that much more to do
you know because you don't want to know
why if the toilet breaks they don't call
plumber yeah I fixed the toilet they
built the monastery by hand they
everything is they do everything right
well let's let's get a swimming pool
okay get a shovel you get a shovel you
get a shovel
you know let's figure out how to do it
you know and we'll build a shovel this
wonderful piece so they do I everybody
hire you for a couple job and then and
then we would there was just more time
alone so there was a tremendous amount
of time yeah but also from a lot of work
so talk a little bit about the
disconnecting from technology I get the
concerns about your wife your kids
things like that how did you feel about
not
putting your hand in your pocket to go
to your phone or not having an iPad
right in front of you or television
screen or the rest of it you know it's
funny because when I got back everybody
asked me well would you miss and the
obvious answer is I miss my family and
this and that but no one ever asked me
what didn't you miss and when I didn't
miss at all were things that I do every
day that I thought I would miss for
example I went during the NCAA
tournament I didn't miss not watching
March Madness vina something I loved to
do forever and if I calculated how many
hours of basketball I've watched yeah
that's like you know five years of my
life but I didn't miss it and I didn't
miss hitting like that you know liking
my friends picture in Cancun with with
you know they did with a corona yeah I
didn't miss any of that stuff I didn't
miss going through Hulu and Netflix and
debating with my wife what to watch and
I realized I spent a lot of time on
things that I really didn't miss and if
I eliminated some of those I would freed
up a lot more time to spend to do the
things I love to do with people I love
to do them with yeah so but it was it's
a reading of so comfortable with my
phone's always in my hand it was hard
man really hard it took it took a long
time to get to ask that did you feel
that there was like a little bit of a
learning curve with it like when I did
it and as I said I locked my phone and a
safe I did not know the code and I found
that for the first day or two I kept
going in my pocket even at the beach
like I'm just going to but there's
nothing in my pocket I don't think my
shirts had pocket so I was just like
going like this and then there's like
this weird anxiety of like what's going
on what did I miss is the zombie
apocalypse or the war started or
whatever and then suddenly by day like
five I kind of felt empowered by day
eight I was like I want nothing to do
with that then maybe there's a little
bit of like a return to I it'll be okay
I'll manage it differently did you go
through all of those steps the exact
steps you just mentioned in the exact
timeframe you just yeah once I got to
the point where I didn't miss it where
the habit of checking before I went to
bed or waking up at 5:00 in the morning
and seeing anything new come in through
you know the werner's once I got past
that yeah I just I didn't miss it I
didn't want
you know and once I got home and I put
on the news and read you know like
what's going on in the world and all the
negative stuff it was just like uh but
Here I am I've been home and I'm back on
my phone I came home I'm like I'm off
email right and then you know but you
drift back so have you been able to put
any kind of just personal policies in
place to manage this stuff because I'm
still trying I don't do phone in bedroom
90% of the night yeah every now and
again it's just somehow ends up there
but like that's one for me so that at
5:00 a.m. I just don't do that yeah I'm
at 11 the obvious ones you know no not
not in the bedroom not at Meal Time not
at movies I'm at I used to sit in movies
and I heard a ding or a beep or a buzz
yeah I go into my shirt and look it
doesn't like you know I look under here
but now so there's so I became misfit I
think this will summarize my experience
the best they had a retreat at the
monastery I made all these guests and
when the guests left they said to me
Jesse you're gonna clean up all the
dishes like the like the rookie on the
team okay
there's 500 dishes stacked so I started
cleaning the dishes I'm drying I'm
cleaning up and drying them and they go
and they bring more in and I turned him
I'm like I'm this gonna take me forever
how am I gonna do all these dishes and
one of the most certainly goes there's
not all those dishes there's only the
dish that's in your hand and I was like
it reminded me that I'm never where my
feet aren't and I gotta be where my feet
are you know this is what I'm doing yeah
there's something there because I do
find that I actually like doing the
dishes I know that's a little nuts and
I'm not doing it I'm not doing it for
500 people but I do find it's like one
[Music]
I'm on a one-day break from touring with
Jordan Peterson and joining me in studio
today is a free-speech lawyer and the
director of the individual rights
defense program at the foundation for
individual rights in education
aka fire ah Rico and welcome to the
Reuben report thanks for having me
that was a wordy intro a lot of freedom
stuff in there and that's all the stuff
that I like so I'm looking forward to
this say so you guys fire as an
organization is one of the the few
bastions of sanity these days like when
I see what you guys are tweeting about
and consistently defending the
principles of free speech and free
expression and open inquiry I'm always
like ah there are some good guys left so
first can you just tell me a little bit
about the organization why you guys got
started how you personally got involved
well we got started in 1999 with a
professor at Penn and a civil liberties
lawyer in Philadelphia who we're you
know they both decided that there were
there was a problem there was an
epidemic at our colleges and
universities of the core individual
rights that that make up you know our
our Constitution if you will as
individuals as people as citizens of the
United States
we're being respected on campuses across
the country back in 99 99 yeah that's
interesting because a lot of people say
this is just the totally recent
phenomenon well I think you know a lot
of it the there is the political
correctness movement of 80s and 90s a
little bit you know that might have had
something to do with it but then this
has been a problem since the Free Speech
Movement back at Berkeley you know long
before even the 80s or 90s you know
censorship is an age-old problem it
predates the United States of America
really and as Alan and Harvey you know
went about creating fire and they
decided to locate it and like located in
Philadelphia which is you know the
birthplace of our nation they really got
an outpouring of people saying hey this
happened to me too and they said well
this is you know this is a problem this
is an epidemic we need to fix
and fire I was born or lit if you will
and over the years I getting close to 20
now crazy enough that has actually just
gone up every year more and more people
reach out to fire for help you know when
I got to fire for the second time
actually was a legal fellow of fire
after I graduated from law school before
I started in private practice but when I
came back in 2013
getting several hundred K submissions a
year and now we're getting damn near
close to a thousand a year and that's
just the stuff that we hear about can
only imagine how much other stuff is
going on around the country for people
who don't know that we're out there to
help them or you know people who perhaps
go about it themselves it's it's crazy
to think about how much is going on yeah
so I want to talk about some of those
cases and some of the specific work that
you're doing
but foundation for individual rights in
education I am a believer right now
partly because of Kanye West and because
of a lot of people online right now that
the individual is making a comeback that
the idea of the individual verse the
collective is actually making a comeback
do you have any idea when they came up
with the name for fire why it was so
important to put the individual front
and center well I think it's you know
and I'm speaking you know out of some
level of ignorance because I haven't
actually discussed this with either of
them personally but you know if I had to
guess it's it's because the the
individual qualities the freedom of
conscious the freedom of speech the
things that allow us to participate in
society we don't get to the collective
unless we have the individuals one is
necessary to have the other because what
is a collective other than a group of
individuals and consensus is a bunch of
individual opinions that throughout the
process of winnowing and debating
different good ideas and bad ideas we
reach a common understanding we reach a
you know a norm for society and that's
how that's why free speech particularly
is so important
that's how we get to the optimal
resolution the optimal conclusions
that's how we reach these communal
positions is only through our own
personal expressions of what we believe
which exposes us to criticism or
agreement or just flat-out discussion
with other people so how do you think
the ideas of the collective took root so
much at college campus then well I think
there's the give-and-take in society at
large that we really go through every
once in a while in terms of thinking
about things as individualistic and then
worrying about broader concerns of the
community and that's not altogether a
bad thing and I think the college campus
and it's always been this way it's a
microcosm of what we're experiencing in
the broader society and I think that's
another reason why it's so important to
protect individual rights on college
campuses because where they fall on
college campuses they're almost
certainly sure to fall in society writ
large yeah so that actually we discussed
this briefly right before the cameras
turned on that's my concern about this
when people will say oh you know there
isn't a free speech issue on college
campuses and even though I keep going to
college campuses and it's very clear to
me that there is a free speech problem
there but it's not what's gonna happen
it's not just these screaming kids right
now it's not that it's that these are
the people that are going to be in
leadership positions 5 10 15 years in
the future and further than that
obviously and if those ideas take root
because they were able to silence us
once they are the lawmakers once they're
in charge of public policy they're not
going to be too kind to the people who
they were silencing way back when right
yeah I mean that's really one of the key
problems and it's not even just if they
get elected to power even if they aren't
elected and they don't rise to power and
they can't impose these views on other
people these are future citizens even if
they're not necessarily future leaders
and then discourse of the nation if that
is the the prevalent feeling in society
is going to suffer tremendously as a
result if even if they're not in
Congress or in the state legislatures if
50 percent
the country's population thinks that we
shouldn't be talking about certain
things we're not going to talk about
these things and it's going to be
societally imposed if nothing else and I
think that's incredibly damaging to just
about every aspect of our life as a
country yeah it's so interesting to me
because I know used you read about this
but I was at the University of New
Hampshire a couple weeks ago and you
know first we were supposed to give a
speech on campus then about two hours
before they announced that they couldn't
secure the room that they felt there
were too many threats so they were about
200 or 250 people supposed to be in the
room they moved us to the hockey rink
which seats 7,500 people so I stood in
front of a little you know backdrop and
I talked to about 200 people it was
about 150 people that were there to
listen and be respectful and all that
stuff and then they were about probably
about 50 protestors roughly those are
the rough numbers but the desire just to
shout down to use noisemakers to scream
to chant like robots they love robotic
chants all of these things and I kept
saying to them guys do you have any
direct questions is there something that
I've said that you disagree with or is
there something you directly like to ask
me and time and time again the answer
was no and I don't know how you break
them out of that other than keep having
these conversations and hope that the
refugees make it to us and that's a
common problem I think it really comes
down to ideological purity that people
are after the idea that if I disagree
with you on something whether small or
even fundamental if I disagree disagree
with you on that one thing that means
nothing that you have to say could
possibly be of value to me and that is
completely false then you couldn't be
farther from the truth
we can learn so much from the people we
disagree with the most even if I
disagreed with you on absolutely
everything it would still be incredibly
valuable for me to talk to you if only
because that helps me sharpen and really
understand why I believe what I believe
in and people really discount the
importance of understanding why you
believe something yeah so the argument
that I've been making for a while is
that and I do think right now at least
in 2018 this is more of a problem on the
left
but they've only ideas in the narrative
and the college campus discussion and
academia and media and all that they've
owned that for so long that the reason
these kids end up be or these students
end up being so hysterical is because
they never hear counter ideas so then
you get a pretty moderate guy who's
arguing about liberty and freedom for
everybody and live and let live and that
actually offends them because they never
hear anything outside of what they're
being taught that goes to the academic
part I think mostly well I think we're
doing a really crappy job of educating
students before they get to college
about why free speech and our other
rights are important civics education is
clearly in the toilet right now yeah
and it's bizarre to me I grew up in
Skokie Illinois one of the sites one of
the most famous free speech cases you
know in recent history
yeah can you lay it out for those that
don't know this the story in the 70s the
American the American Socialist Party
that nationalist party the Illinois
Nazis if you'd ask the Blues Brothers
yeah wanted to march through Skokie
Illinois which outside of New York had
the largest concentration of Holocaust
survivors in the United States and
Skokie tried to stop them and they sued
with the aid of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Illinois and it went
too well both the Supreme Court of
Illinois and the Supreme Court of the
United States and the Nazis had the
right to march and and the courts held
so and there were threats of violence
and disruption and all you know people
out crying as to how this could be
allowed but ultimately the Nazis had the
First Amendment right to march through
Skokie and I grew up learning about that
case from a very young age I can't tell
you how many times I saw the movie they
made about it yeah and it really it got
me thinking at a young age about why
this is important how I think about it
and I can't tell you that as a young
child I completely agree that the Nazi
should have a right to march you know I
when I was that young a part of me
didn't grasp the overarching fundamental
importance of free speech but I was
thinking about it
yes and I got there and I get the
feeling that some
we're not doing enough to make our
students think about why it's important
yeah it's such an important case and I'm
glad you mentioned it because it goes
really to the heart of this that the
people that lived in Skokie as you said
the second largest amount of Holocaust
survivors in the country these people
literally survived the genocide probably
virtually all of them lost some of them
probably lost all of their family
members and friends and all of that and
yet I would sit here as someone that
lost Holocaust survivors on both sides
of my family and tell you it was the
right decision you can't let the the
Nazis or the white supremacist whatever
they're you can't let them start
ransacking property you can't let them
start killing people are harming people
but letting letting them march that's
the exchange of free speech and it's
kind of shitty but you got to defend it
when it's hard to defend you that's
defined it when it's hard to defend
because otherwise there's it's not going
to be around to defend when it's easy to
defend you know once you can start
creating exceptions and encroaching
there's no end to it and you know we've
kind of seemed even in other countries
that once the the encroachments start
it's always well we make that exception
and just this one other small exception
and then there's inevitably another one
and another one and all four perhaps
even you know good reasons in terms of
you know ideals and and the goals are
laudable perhaps I say at every show the
road to hell is paved with good
intentions getting tired of saying me
both yeah but you know it's really
practically speaking it's inevitable
yeah how much of this is just a
confusion as to what the First Amendment
is that's also what I've started to
realize because when I've gone on
college campuses and the protesters are
there and I always say it I welcome
peaceful protests I completely welcome I
welcome the exchange of ideas the
questions all of that but when when
they're screaming about certain things I
think there's just a disconnect as to
what I think to legal things I think
what the First Amendment is and what
hate speech is is or isn't so can you
talk about that a little bit yeah I if I
had to have to hear one more person
whether it be student
Internet comment or even journalists or
faculty numbers sometimes say hate
speech is not free speech I'm gonna lose
it okay so let's do it let's do that one
first cuz I really I mean this will be
maybe what we promo for this episode but
I really want people to understand this
why is hate speech free speech well on a
legal level hate speech is free speech
because the First Amendment and the
courts have said nothing about freeze or
hate speech being unprotected by the
First Amendment speech is protected by
the First Amendment unless it falls
under one of the very few existing
categories of unprotected speech yeah
what are what are those categories
there's incitement to imminent lawless
action and these all have very high bars
true threats and intimidation you can be
sued for libel or slander defamation as
they're known some states I think
actually still have criminal statutes on
the book but books but they're rarely
enforced love fraud obscenity which
people often confuse with mere profanity
or lewdness but they are not the same
thing by any stretch of the imagination
what's the difference on those two well
profanity and lewdness are generally
protected by the First Amendment
obscenity is a very high bar it's a
speech that has to be our expression I
should say more broadly than just speech
that has to appeal to the prurient
interest which is an inordinate
fascination with sex describe or depict
sex in a patently offensive way and have
no social political literary or artistic
value whatsoever and to get down in the
in the mud he ever heard of crush videos
I feel like I have but I'm honestly not
sure what that is they are videos of
women wearing stilettos crushing small
animals like hamsters and gerbils to
death and people apparently get off on
that yeah I don't intend to understand
it even that is not wholly unprotected
by the obscenity exception to the First
Amendment that that's a particularly
interesting case I suppose because the
idea of it talking about it seems like I
would have no problem with that but the
action itself probably there's
legal reasons right like killing and
killing animals there's some law I guess
if Charlie state law right but if you
have this pornography you can call it
that I just have a hard time getting it
yeah if you have it in you to possess it
or like unit you can't be prosecuted for
for possessing that obscene material
it's an interesting distinction that the
Act is the crime or the act is what is
illegal not the depiction depiction or
is it disseminating of the information
or that sort of thing right child
pornography obviously not protected by
the First Amendment yeah you know but
there's some others the one additional
wrinkle of the fighting words doctrine
although there's a considerable doubt
that it remains a viable exception to
the First Amendment but it really gets
brought up a lot in the hate speech
debate to the extent it still exists
it's limited to face-to-face
interactions where say I say something
to you that is so insanely abusive that
you are likely to punch me in the face
without thinking twice about it instead
of taking a deep breath and either
ignoring me or coming back at me and
there's reasons why it's fallen into
disuse and it's worthwhile to note that
the Supreme Court hasn't upheld a
fighting words conviction since the case
in the 40s when it created the fighting
which is how far it's fallen into disuse
it incentivizes punching people in the
face right it creates an easy way to
censor the people that you disagree with
and it would I assume be some level of a
subjective piece of information as to
what you think is offensive at the
highest order is different perhaps than
what I think or exactly what some of
these other people yeah it creates
terrible incentives and it would
basically lead to an institutionalized
hecklers veto so it's really not tenable
yeah so on that on the hate speech front
which was clear what the Supreme Court
has said about hate speech you're
allowed to do it with with these
exceptions that you've just laid out
you're allowed to say mean things what I
what I'm realizing on college campuses
is they really don't like that the
people the set of people that we're
talking but they really don't like that
so like they think if you like
you it's just the fact you are allowed
to say bad things you can say I hate all
the Jews you can say I hate all the
black people and all the gays or
whatever you can say it you can't cause
direct call to violence but what I think
they think is that if you keep saying
those things I hate these people that
it's going to incite violence now my
counter-argument would be no you have to
use free speech to counter those bad
ideas that's the whole purpose of free
speech but do you see that that that
seems to be the slope that they
consistently are on that if we allow you
to say I hate these people which is
bigoted and prejudiced and all of those
things but it's afforded to us by the
Bill of Rights they think that that's
going to get you to violence how do you
combat that notion if you agree with the
premise well that is something that we
tend to hear a lot in the First
Amendment world and you know first of
all generally speaking in this country
we punish the people who do the bad acts
if I watch your show and I get some
kooky idea and go off and you know
commit some crime we're not going to
throw you in jail because I'm an idiot
and took a terrible idea that you didn't
even intend me to take right now it
might be different though if I was up
here saying you should violently attack
these people etc right exactly and
that's why the incitement standard is so
high he has to be likely to incite and
intended to incite immediate criminal

I'm on a one-day break from touring with
Jordan Peterson and joining me in studio

epidemic at our colleges and
universities of the core individual
rights that that make up you know our
our Constitution if you will as
individuals as people as citizens of the
United States
we're being respected on campuses across
the country back in 99 99 yeah that's
interesting because a lot of people say
this is just the totally recent
phenomenon well I think you know a lot
of it the there is the political
correctness movement of 80s and 90s a
little bit you know that might have had
something to do with it but then this
has been a problem since the Free Speech
Movement back at Berkeley you know long
before even the 80s or 90s you know
censorship is an age-old problem it
predates the United States of America
really and as Alan and Harvey you know
went about creating fire and they
decided to locate it and like located in
Philadelphia which is you know the
birthplace of our nation they really got
an outpouring of people saying hey this
happened to me too and they said well
this is you know this is a problem this
is an epidemic we need to fix
and fire I was born or lit if you will
and over the years I getting close to 20
now crazy enough that has actually just
gone up every year more and more people
reach out to fire for help you know when
I got to fire for the second time
actually was a legal fellow of fire
after I graduated from law school before
I started in private practice but when I
came back in 2013
getting several hundred K submissions a
year and now we're getting damn near
close to a thousand a year and that's
just the stuff that we hear about can
only imagine how much other stuff is
going on around the country for people
who don't know that we're out there to
help them or you know people who perhaps
go about it themselves it's it's crazy
to think about how much is going on yeah
so I want to talk about some of those
cases and some of the specific work that
you're doing
but foundation for individual rights in
education I am a believer right now
partly because of Kanye West and because
of a lot of people online right now that
the individual is making a comeback that
the idea of the individual verse the
collective is actually making a comeback
do you have any idea when they came up
with the name for fire why it was so
important to put the individual front
and center well I think it's you know
and I'm speaking you know out of some
level of ignorance because I haven't
actually discussed this with either of
them personally but you know if I had to
guess it's it's because the the
individual qualities the freedom of
conscious the freedom of speech the
things that allow us to participate in
society we don't get to the collective
unless we have the individuals one is
necessary to have the other because what
is a collective other than a group of
individuals and consensus is a bunch of
individual opinions that throughout the
process of winnowing and debating
different good ideas and bad ideas we
reach a common understanding we reach a
you know a norm for society and that's
how that's why free speech particularly
is so important
that's how we get to the optimal
resolution the optimal conclusions
that's how we reach these communal
positions is only through our own
personal expressions of what we believe
which exposes us to criticism or
agreement or just flat-out discussion
with other people so how do you think
the ideas of the collective took root so
much at college campus then well I think
there's the give-and-take in society at
large that we really go through every
once in a while in terms of thinking
about things as individualistic and then
worrying about broader concerns of the
community and that's not altogether a
bad thing and I think the college campus
and it's always been this way it's a
microcosm of what we're experiencing in
the broader society and I think that's
another reason why it's so important to
protect individual rights on college
campuses because where they fall on
college campuses they're almost
certainly sure to fall in society writ
large yeah so that actually we discussed
this briefly right before the cameras
turned on that's my concern about this
when people will say oh you know there
isn't a free speech issue on college
campuses and even though I keep going to
college campuses and it's very clear to
me that there is a free speech problem
there but it's not what's gonna happen
it's not just these screaming kids right
now it's not that it's that these are
the people that are going to be in
leadership positions 5 10 15 years in
the future and further than that
obviously and if those ideas take root
because they were able to silence us
once they are the lawmakers once they're
in charge of public policy they're not
going to be too kind to the people who
they were silencing way back when right
yeah I mean that's really one of the key
problems and it's not even just if they
get elected to power even if they aren't
elected and they don't rise to power and
they can't impose these views on other
people these are future citizens even if
they're not necessarily future leaders
and then discourse of the nation if that
is the the prevalent feeling in society
is going to suffer tremendously as a
result if even if they're not in
Congress or in the state legislatures if
50 percent
the country's population thinks that we
shouldn't be talking about certain
things we're not going to talk about
these things and it's going to be
societally imposed if nothing else and I
think that's incredibly damaging to just
about every aspect of our life as a
country yeah it's so interesting to me
because I know used you read about this
but I was at the University of New
Hampshire a couple weeks ago and you
know first we were supposed to give a
speech on campus then about two hours
before they announced that they couldn't
secure the room that they felt there
were too many threats so they were about
200 or 250 people supposed to be in the
room they moved us to the hockey rink
which seats 7,500 people so I stood in
front of a little you know backdrop and
I talked to about 200 people it was
about 150 people that were there to
listen and be respectful and all that
stuff and then they were about probably
about 50 protestors roughly those are
the rough numbers but the desire just to
shout down to use noisemakers to scream
to chant like robots they love robotic
chants all of these things and I kept
saying to them guys do you have any
direct questions is there something that
I've said that you disagree with or is
there something you directly like to ask
me and time and time again the answer
was no and I don't know how you break
them out of that other than keep having
these conversations and hope that the
refugees make it to us and that's a
common problem I think it really comes
down to ideological purity that people
are after the idea that if I disagree
with you on something whether small or
even fundamental if I disagree disagree
with you on that one thing that means
nothing that you have to say could
possibly be of value to me and that is
completely false then you couldn't be
farther from the truth
we can learn so much from the people we
disagree with the most even if I
disagreed with you on absolutely
everything it would still be incredibly
valuable for me to talk to you if only
because that helps me sharpen and really
understand why I believe what I believe
in and people really discount the
importance of understanding why you
believe something yeah so the argument
that I've been making for a while is
that and I do think right now at least
in 2018 this is more of a problem on the
left
but they've only ideas in the narrative
and the college campus discussion and
academia and media and all that they've
owned that for so long that the reason
these kids end up be or these students
end up being so hysterical is because
they never hear counter ideas so then
you get a pretty moderate guy who's
arguing about liberty and freedom for
everybody and live and let live and that
actually offends them because they never
hear anything outside of what they're
being taught that goes to the academic
part I think mostly well I think we're
doing a really crappy job of educating
students before they get to college
about why free speech and our other
rights are important civics education is
clearly in the toilet right now yeah
and it's bizarre to me I grew up in
Skokie Illinois one of the sites one of
the most famous free speech cases you
know in recent history
yeah can you lay it out for those that
don't know this the story in the 70s the
American the American Socialist Party
that nationalist party the Illinois
Nazis if you'd ask the Blues Brothers
yeah wanted to march through Skokie
Illinois which outside of New York had
the largest concentration of Holocaust
survivors in the United States and
Skokie tried to stop them and they sued
with the aid of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Illinois and it went
too well both the Supreme Court of
Illinois and the Supreme Court of the
United States and the Nazis had the
right to march and and the courts held
so and there were threats of violence
and disruption and all you know people
out crying as to how this could be
allowed but ultimately the Nazis had the
First Amendment right to march through
Skokie and I grew up learning about that
case from a very young age I can't tell
you how many times I saw the movie they
made about it yeah and it really it got
me thinking at a young age about why
this is important how I think about it
and I can't tell you that as a young
child I completely agree that the Nazi
should have a right to march you know I
when I was that young a part of me
didn't grasp the overarching fundamental
importance of free speech but I was
thinking about it
yes and I got there and I get the
feeling that some
we're not doing enough to make our
students think about why it's important
yeah it's such an important case and I'm
glad you mentioned it because it goes
really to the heart of this that the
people that lived in Skokie as you said
the second largest amount of Holocaust
survivors in the country these people
literally survived the genocide probably
virtually all of them lost some of them
probably lost all of their family
members and friends and all of that and
yet I would sit here as someone that
lost Holocaust survivors on both sides
of my family and tell you it was the
right decision you can't let the the
Nazis or the white supremacist whatever
they're you can't let them start
ransacking property you can't let them
start killing people are harming people
but letting letting them march that's
the exchange of free speech and it's
kind of shitty but you got to defend it
when it's hard to defend you that's
defined it when it's hard to defend
because otherwise there's it's not going
to be around to defend when it's easy to
defend you know once you can start
creating exceptions and encroaching
there's no end to it and you know we've
kind of seemed even in other countries
that once the the encroachments start
it's always well we make that exception
and just this one other small exception
and then there's inevitably another one
and another one and all four perhaps
even you know good reasons in terms of
you know ideals and and the goals are
laudable perhaps I say at every show the
road to hell is paved with good
intentions getting tired of saying me
both yeah but you know it's really
practically speaking it's inevitable
yeah how much of this is just a
confusion as to what the First Amendment
is that's also what I've started to
realize because when I've gone on
college campuses and the protesters are
there and I always say it I welcome
peaceful protests I completely welcome I
welcome the exchange of ideas the
questions all of that but when when
they're screaming about certain things I
think there's just a disconnect as to
what I think to legal things I think
what the First Amendment is and what
hate speech is is or isn't so can you
talk about that a little bit yeah I if I
had to have to hear one more person
whether it be student
Internet comment or even journalists or
faculty numbers sometimes say hate
speech is not free speech I'm gonna lose
it okay so let's do it let's do that one
first cuz I really I mean this will be
maybe what we promo for this episode but
I really want people to understand this
why is hate speech free speech well on a
legal level hate speech is free speech
because the First Amendment and the
courts have said nothing about freeze or
hate speech being unprotected by the
First Amendment speech is protected by
the First Amendment unless it falls
under one of the very few existing
categories of unprotected speech yeah
what are what are those categories
there's incitement to imminent lawless
action and these all have very high bars
true threats and intimidation you can be
sued for libel or slander defamation as
they're known some states I think
actually still have criminal statutes on
the book but books but they're rarely
enforced love fraud obscenity which
people often confuse with mere profanity
or lewdness but they are not the same
thing by any stretch of the imagination
what's the difference on those two well
profanity and lewdness are generally
protected by the First Amendment
obscenity is a very high bar it's a
speech that has to be our expression I
should say more broadly than just speech
that has to appeal to the prurient
interest which is an inordinate
fascination with sex describe or depict
sex in a patently offensive way and have
no social political literary or artistic
value whatsoever and to get down in the
in the mud he ever heard of crush videos
I feel like I have but I'm honestly not
sure what that is they are videos of
women wearing stilettos crushing small
animals like hamsters and gerbils to
death and people apparently get off on
that yeah I don't intend to understand
it even that is not wholly unprotected
by the obscenity exception to the First
Amendment that that's a particularly
interesting case I suppose because the
idea of it talking about it seems like I
would have no problem with that but the
action itself probably there's
legal reasons right like killing and
killing animals there's some law I guess
if Charlie state law right but if you
have this pornography you can call it
that I just have a hard time getting it
yeah if you have it in you to possess it
or like unit you can't be prosecuted for
for possessing that obscene material
it's an interesting distinction that the
Act is the crime or the act is what is
illegal not the depiction depiction or
is it disseminating of the information
or that sort of thing right child
pornography obviously not protected by
the First Amendment yeah you know but
there's some others the one additional
wrinkle of the fighting words doctrine
although there's a considerable doubt
that it remains a viable exception to
the First Amendment but it really gets
brought up a lot in the hate speech
debate to the extent it still exists
it's limited to face-to-face
interactions where say I say something
to you that is so insanely abusive that
you are likely to punch me in the face
without thinking twice about it instead
of taking a deep breath and either
ignoring me or coming back at me and
there's reasons why it's fallen into
disuse and it's worthwhile to note that
the Supreme Court hasn't upheld a
fighting words conviction since the case
in the 40s when it created the fighting
which is how far it's fallen into disuse
it incentivizes punching people in the
face right it creates an easy way to
censor the people that you disagree with
and it would I assume be some level of a
subjective piece of information as to
what you think is offensive at the
highest order is different perhaps than
what I think or exactly what some of
these other people yeah it creates
terrible incentives and it would
basically lead to an institutionalized
hecklers veto so it's really not tenable
yeah so on that on the hate speech front
which was clear what the Supreme Court
has said about hate speech you're
allowed to do it with with these
exceptions that you've just laid out
you're allowed to say mean things what I
what I'm realizing on college campuses
is they really don't like that the
people the set of people that we're
talking but they really don't like that
so like they think if you like
you it's just the fact you are allowed
to say bad things you can say I hate all
the Jews you can say I hate all the
black people and all the gays or
whatever you can say it you can't cause
direct call to violence but what I think
they think is that if you keep saying
those things I hate these people that
it's going to incite violence now my
counter-argument would be no you have to
use free speech to counter those bad
ideas that's the whole purpose of free
speech but do you see that that that
seems to be the slope that they
consistently are on that if we allow you
to say I hate these people which is
bigoted and prejudiced and all of those
things but it's afforded to us by the
Bill of Rights they think that that's
going to get you to violence how do you
combat that notion if you agree with the
premise well that is something that we
tend to hear a lot in the First
Amendment world and you know first of
all generally speaking in this country
we punish the people who do the bad acts
if I watch your show and I get some
kooky idea and go off and you know
commit some crime we're not going to
throw you in jail because I'm an idiot
and took a terrible idea that you didn't
even intend me to take right now it
might be different though if I was up
here saying you should violently attack
these people etc right exactly and
that's why the incitement standard is so
high he has to be likely to incite and
intended to incite immediate criminal
[Music]
all right so let's shift to Jordan
Peterson a little bit because you are a
student at the University of Toronto
that's where he's been teaching for many
years this whole kerfuffle over
transgender pronoun is faulty stolen so
like everyone's yelling at each other
and hates each other I blame him what's
the atmosphere like at the school
actually he's not teaching there right
now we can now be on tour in the book
and the whole thing but has the
atmosphere change then do you think it's
directly related to some of the stuff
that he unearthed I think it has changed
because there you can see the groups you
get and when someone you know has a
slightly right-wing or it's funny
because the fact that they associate
individualism and the fact that they
associate thinking for yourself with
being right-wing it's like why would you
want to do that it should not be anyways
why wouldn't you want to be a right-wing
like what yeah so the when you're a
little bit more right-wing I guess they
tend to say that you know you are
joining Peterson fan and you hate
transgenders and blah blah blah like
there's a clear divide you can tell
which side people are on but yeah I
think it was bound to happen regardless
and just again because of the Trump
presidency
can we just blame Trump for everything
yes you're in America too so that's how
it yeah yeah watch out so you sort of
view it as kind of a necessary evil that
he sort of got this stuff I mean again
it goes to what we were talking about
earlier you're like some of these people
get these issues out there and then
hopefully some goodness after them yeah
definitely and I think the other thing
is from allowed people like I said
earlier to think for themselves in the
sense to understand that maybe not
everything is how it seems maybe things
that I'm learning is not exactly how it
is and you know I you know I may
disagree with his politics like because
I'm a liberal in general but I do think
that yeah it was bound to happen and
Trump kind of shook things up and a lot
a lot more people are engaging in
politics now which is so exciting and
also really scary at the same time what
is it that it I mean
see it right there I think just this
morning I tweeted sunny out to that
effect it's like wow it's incredibly
exciting doesn't mean things are gonna
be good I actually I believe things
actually are gonna get better because
there's so many cool new young people
like yourself out there putting out
ideas like I have hope but yeah it
doesn't mean that's how it's gonna go
yeah it might go the other way yeah but
then the other thing is that because the
far-left are scared that people are
starting to you know do more research
we're starting to Google things nowadays
we've started to it that's why they want
to control Google exactly so now you
can't find any right information you can
only find theirs yeah yeah but now
they're changing definitions of things
so I mean the definition of racism is no
longer individual it has to do with
power plus privilege so in other words
only white people can be racist towards
minorities minorities cannot be racist
towards white people they've also taken
hold of the like Student Union's and
Jordan Peterson has talked about this a
lot so sorry what was the question
generally was about Jordan and being a
student at University of tried religious
yeah yeah I feel like the student unions
are just influencing a lot of the
students and influencing a lot of the
events that are happening they claim to
speak on behalf of all students so and
they claim that they're fighting against
racism except they define it a different
way I mean who's gonna go against
someone that says they're fighting
against racism and sexism and every
other buzzword that they can throw out
there you have to accept it and because
they've changed the definition of racism
they started to have events and there's
a white privilege conference which I
actually did a video on yeah it's the
University yeah so that's the way that
they're countering it they're countering
the facts with just you know all that
alternative facts with their own BS
feminist studies ideas I don't even know
but that's I guess the way they're doing
it they're trying to influence students
from schools so then when they get out
they can become more liberal so the
things that Jordan talks about when he
talks about the individual and when he
talks about why the government shouldn't
be able to talk tell you what pronouns
to use etc etc you see these things it's
all directly related to everything else
that you've been talking about here ya
know for sure and I think it's also
about sorry I just blanked Oh
we were at a Jordan event that's that's
where we met about a month ago in
Toronto and was it a white supremacist
oh yeah in Selma I was stoned on my way
out I mean but were you surprised at all
when you saw what an interesting diverse
young I think most of them I've been
telling people it's about 60/40 yeah
male-to-female but sometimes it's even
closer to 5050 yeah no I think it's
pretty diverse and I've gone to several
events like political events I guess
where I look in the crowd I'm like wow
there's a lot of minorities here there's
women here there's been here there's
everyone here and sorry where I blanked
was the idea that you can't you can't
debate something that's where that was
the whole Peter I'm like ranting here so
gets me like all excited because I was
there but the fact that you can't debate
certain topics the fact that you can
debate whether or not we should use
certain pronouns because they say well
you're questioning my identity you're
questioning me as a person my humanity
they turn it around and make it sound
like you hate that person and that's the
thing is it's not like I agree with
Peterson or I agree with the you know
the students I just want to hear both
sides that's all I'm asking for
something we can all make an informed
you know conclusion but they don't want
you to hear both sides they want you to
hear their side and that is the only
side you see what happened with like
Lindsey Shepard as well where she you
know played at Peterson debate where
there are all sides and they don't want
you to hear that they only want you to
hear their side and that's where that's
one thing I hate the most is the lack of
discussion yeah so I'm glad you brought
up Lindsey because that also is
happening at Canada that was that
Wilfred Laurier University now there's a
lawsuit that she's involved and I
suspect I read some of the initial brief
I mean I think this thing's gonna be a
bloodbath the University but what does
that say is happening in Canada in a
larger way I think you've kind of hit on
this a little bit like you guys are
almost having like this like Trump
hangover or something where or even the
black lives matter thing like it didn't
start in America as you said race
relations were different in Canada I
would argue they're still great here for
sure
Canadians are just nicer okay
you know we've done two shows in Toronto
and the shows were totally nice and
present but like we've gone to some
other cities where and I find it's
usually in the progressive cities so
it's been in you know San Francisco and
it's been in Seattle and a couple of the
others where the crowds are the craziest
yeah most raucous which is what I like
most because they kind of they need his
message yeah Toronto you guys are very
pleasant I think we're gonna we're
getting to a point where we need his
message I think it's it's getting a
little scary especially with Trudeau as
our prime minister he's kind of kowtow
to a lot of the social justice warrior
and the fact that he's even you know
talking to black lives matter Toronto
who you know the leader one of the
leaders said she wants to kill white men
she tweeted that she wished she can kill
all white men and the other one actually
stole 300 thousand dollars from my
student union stole it and said the she
on her last day she filed her over time
and she's filed thousands of hours of
overtime I said she's about 300 yes it's
a third of our entire budget of our
student unions but a third and here's
the best part of it she files that
obviously there's alerts that go off you
can't take that much money for what are
your student union president three
hundred thousand dollars sure there
aren't that many hours in the year but
here's the thing she claims that the
majority of those hours come from work
that she does for the black community
for like black lives matter that doesn't
count no one is a ski that's not
affiliated with the school no one's
asking whatever you do at home has
nothing to do with that anyways the
school obviously said they wanted the
money back they try to sue her and they
started a whole campaign saying my
university is anti black and then they
started to put posters up they got
gathered a bunch of people saying that
you're their only suing her because
she's black you stole three hundred
thousand you took three hundred thousand
dollars girl like are you because you're
black are you kidding me does that not
even and when she you know they
vandalized the Student Union they have
like megaphone starts yelling saying
anti black racism happened to your hand
and it was just this whole ordeal like
it's oh gosh anyways what does it found
the best arguments to get people your
age to wake up to some of this stuff
like I know obviously they're watching
your videos yeah it's like probably your
your prime way of do
if you found simple arguments simple
phrases or whatever that you can use to
get some people out of this everything
can be explained the way through a
social economic standpoint you a lot of
the issues that the black community
faces because they're poor which is the
same issues that poor white community
space as well and you know there are
examples of black Americans and black
Canadians that do do well to do well and
you have to look at why they're doing
well okay so they have higher education
you know there's they're both parents or
at home there are all these different
factors to look at and it's like oh so
it's not just the color of my skin
it's either choices aren't I make or the
area I'm in the surroundings I'm in or
the school I went to rather than just
it's the color of my skin but I think
you just have to break it down to that
before a lot of people can understand
where I'm coming from and why I think a
certain way it's just it's easy to just
to say well it's because I'm black and
I'm not doing as well it's no there's
there's so many different ways to
explain it how do you rub off all the
the stuff that they must say about you
because I have enough friends that are
black conservatives or are kind of
liberal whenever you want to call it
that the things that I see get that get
said about them all everytime larry
elder comes and does my show and I look
on Twitter the things that the things
that's the supposed tolerant people
right the progressives the lefties that
they say about this man who I know is
being authentic well it's ridiculous I
mean I get a lot of hate comments where
it's you know they'll call me they
say I hate myself I want to be white all
these different things like it's the one
part is like me speaking this way of
speaking I guess I want to say proper
English per se but it I trying to be why
I'm trying to be something I'm not and
it's like why are you fitting people a
race in a group you're just allowing
white people just to say well black
people are just dumb because if you say
we all act the same way and we should
all think the same way that means you
can every black person can be explained
with one statement that's not fair let
us all be individuals in fact you should
be fighting for us to be individuals and
have our own ideas why are we trying to
form groups and then you know they
wonder why why there's all these like
white supremacist groups forming up
because you've already it's a sites
thing you said there's ours
and there's your slide so you're like
okay sure we'll form a group I guess and
go against you but yeah I mean I don't a
lot of the hate comments are just
useless I ignore the epithets but I do
try to understand a lot of the criticism
and again it's just not understanding
where I'm coming from it's not you know
getting their stats from the right place
the route calm or onion it's not
somewhere to get your facts I like that
you compare those but when I you know
get into a detailed discussion with a
lot of them then they understand where
I'm coming from and it's like there's
this light that kind of shines and I do
that in my school a lot as well where
someone that absolutely hates me I spend
a whole day talking to them and at the
end I call it like it's really awful to
use its conversion therapy
well you're not electrocuting you know
but by the end of it it's like their
minds are blown because they just
believed everything blacklivesmatter
said everything the main stream left
media have said so it's I think it's
just you just gotta talk to them they
don't want to talk they're stuck in echo
chamber yeah do you see this
intersectionality and this combining of
perceived oppressions something that
will just sort of crap out under its own
weight so like for example if you're
gonna keep saying well black people
should or this minority whatever that
minority is should get easier entrance
to this or access to this or whatever
what you're actually saying is well
other people are going to have to be
punished based on their immutable
characteristics we see this now I mean I
see a massive split happening with the
Asian community right now in America
because by every metric that we judge
success they are succeeding at extremely
high levels became hard work and
education and commitment to family but
if you're gonna start saying well we're
gonna have to take less of them because
we have to take more leatherby look
you're actually setting these groups to
hate each other yeah that is so
dangerous and you're telling one group
that they can't do it on their own and
there are some studies I forgot who was
what it was who wrote it but it was
called the mismatch theory which is a
lot of the student minority students are
getting thrown in universities or to not
qualified actually turn out worse when
they come out they don't get jobs
because they don't have the actual
skills that they needed to get in but
yeah it creates cutting this kind of
tension why would you tell someone that
you know they're more important just
because of the color of your skin it's
gonna piss other people off it's I don't
think that
a way to move forward I don't think
that's a way to progress but yeah and
the whole intersectionality thing it's
it's ridiculous the Pride Parade I guess
in Toronto is an example of that it's
like my issues are more important and
then obviously the LGBTQ community they
all hated that and they were all very
upset with it because it's like pride is
one of the most inclusive you know
events in the in the city why are you
trying to ruin it and say this is a
black thing it's an everybody thing
we're we're all advocating for everyone
here so it's it's they're just going to
yeah they're going to ruin themselves if
they keep just biting each other
speaking of that I saw the thing that
you did you were not happy when they put
the black and brown oh yeah stripes into
the rainbow flag which I also thought
was completely it's the whole point is
that this is for everybody we're not
looking at all your differences in all
your races yeah but what thing it's like
reverse segregation I really don't get
it the white privilege conference at
Ryerson University yeah that's reverse
segregation and I actually gave them the
benefit of the doubt I'm like I'm gonna
ignore the name I'm going to actually
try to see what they're trying to teach
and ultimately the end the conclusion of
this event was listen to people listen
to what people are saying so anecdotes
only listening folks are their feelings
so it's like that's not how you form a
society it's the majority we're white
women that were just sitting there
hearing black people tell them just
listen to our stories because we know
and we experience it and you know you we
have to have you know black spaces in
fact there is someone that tweeted
during the event saying a woman just
rolls our hand to speak while white
splaining wait for the for later where
we have our white corner so we can talk
about you know our what is this what
kind of society are we preparing
yourself for it's literally reverse
segregation or segregation in the true
sense of the word and yeah I really
don't what do you make of them guilty
white a lie
those people you know when I've had I
know you met Brett lines now yeah from
Evergreen and and Heather his wife one
of the things that fascinated me most
when he was going through the ordeal
there was that he said he never feared
the black students physically or the
brown students or whatever it was that
it was the white allies he said that had
this sort of look in their eye like they
were the ones that
could get violent and I've seen that
that look what do you make of that date
of ginned up hatred because it's hard to
do if you're not black then I mean there
try to explain it if you're not black
thing you don't experience it then you
don't understand it so as a white I lie
you have to just take everything you
know an activist says to you as fast as
this is what is happening one of the
speakers actually he did an interview
for the Toronto Star and they asked him
and that was like okay what where do you
see white privilege in Toronto and he
said leader like I mean I'm crazy but he
said when you walk into a store black
people of our black people have to think
about the fact that people are watching
them okay sure I was like fine whatever
but apparently black people have to pay
for items in one section before they can
move to another section so they don't
get accused of stealing that's his his
he got a chance to tell us what white
privilege is and that was his example of
white privilege does that happen again
no never it's never happened I've worked
retail for the most of my life what
you're gonna like pay the kids section
before you go to the men's section like
what world is this guy living in it blew
my mind and another one you know did an
article where it's how the outdoors is
racist and how you know people feel like
the you know skiing and hiking and
everything is a white space and
therefore black people don't want to go
to it and it's like who you're saying it
you are the one that are making both
claims why are we it's just more
division it's more like it pisses me off
yeah you know what we're gonna because
you're visiting a lifer yeah I don't
have a ton of time but maybe we could go
on a quick hike and see what happens but
it's just like you're obviously don't
care about the benefits of the black
alright guys first off sorry about the
delay there I'm just gonna start slowly
here today because we had another link
that we normally set up through the
TriCaster through our studio cameras and
the whole freaking thing and then the
TriCaster some of you know about the
TriCaster the TriCaster is like one of
the few ways that you can sort of build
out a studio and control all the cameras
and all that it is a notoriously
herky-jerky thing that often has crazy
bugs and a mirror here our director who
was an absolutely pro at all this and
has been doing this for years she did
every possible thing imaginable so that
we could be doing this normally as we
normally do it through our regular
cameras and all that good stuff and I'm
miked up and it's lit well and
everything but for some reason the
TriCaster just didn't want to play along
I don't know what the hell's going on so
we're doing this old-school people I've
got my laptop right in front of me and
we're just we're gonna do it this way
there's a whole bunch of stuff that I
want to catch up with you guys on you
know I've been on this tour with JP
Jordan Peterson and because of that for
the last whatever it is almost six eight
weeks I haven't been doing direct
messages at the front end of the shows
and that's usually where I'm able to
tell you guys what I've been thinking
about what's on my mind what I think is
relevant and important and all that
stuff but we just haven't been able to
do that because although we've taped
some shows in advance usually when I'm
doing something that's on my mind at the
moment there's a bit of a topical nature
to it so I don't want to tape a DM even
a week in advance and then lay it out
when it feels stale or also I haven't
had a moment in the last couple weeks to
just go directly to you guys what I have
had is a couple chances to do that with
with those of you who are on patreon
because I do the one-on-ones and the
group hangouts and all that kind of
stuff so I've been able to share some
thoughts about this tour and just all
the kinds of stuff that's going on and
then I want to share some some personal
stuff some business stuff we're gonna do
an AMA you guys can ask me anything you
can do that on super chat right here so
for those of you that don't have super
chat works if you throw in a couple
bucks in the youtube comment section it
pumps your comments up I'm pretty sure
that the more you put the longer it
stays up there then my guys can see it
and they send it to me we've got to
trust the iPad here with patreon
questions rolling in
and with with super chat comments
rolling in and all that good stuff we
are streaming right now we're only
streaming on YouTube sometimes we stream
this on on Facebook as well but because
of this whacked-out TriCaster situation
we're just doing it this way yes I am
wearing the classical liberal t-shirt
many of you guys saw no this is a good
place to start actually so last week we
posted I believe it was was it last
Tuesday if I'm not mistaken a week ago
today we posted our first-ever Rubin
report animated video it was a two
minute 37 second video a short that I
wrote and did the voiceover for and we
got a great animator who came in and we
did what is classical liberalism it got
something like last I saw I think it at
around 650,000 views on Twitter I think
it's got about a hundred thousand on
YouTube which is kind of an interesting
little thing about the algorithms and
whatever else is going on here with the
feeds or however you guys ingest this
content there's something interesting
happening so think about this I have
about last night so I think it's around
400 some odd thousand Twitter followers
the video on Twitter got about 700,000
views we have almost 800,000 subscribers
on YouTube so basically double the
subscribers that I have on Twitter the
video got at last I saw it was a little
bit under a hundred thousand views now
you guys keep bumping into you guys on
the street or when I go to the Petersons
events from you guys email me and keep
telling me I'm subscribed but I don't
see the videos I know what's going on
with the feed I get the usual nonsense
from YouTube hoon I don't know what the
answer to any of it is anymore I'm just
gonna keep putting out stuff and
hopefully for those of you that don't
see the videos in your feeds or whatever
they are hopefully you do a little extra
legwork to find this stuff but we're
doing we're doing the best we can we're
also working on a couple things that I
can't quite get into yet on that front
how is that for a tease we're just
working on some stuff on that front
anyway we put this video out and what I
wanted to do with this was because
obviously in the last two years and I
think it has a little something to do
with what we've been doing around here
the ideas of classical liberalism have
been catching on and something sort of
beautiful happened today that I'm sure
many of you saw Barack Obama former
President Barack Obama was given a
speech
and he talked about how you cannot
automatically dismiss people's opinions
just because they're male or just
because they're white I mean I suspect
that the conversations that we've all
been having here between Peterson and
Rogan and the line Stein's and Sam
Harris and Shapiro and everybody else
but these conversations we know I mean I
can't get into every little detail of
how we know everything you know but we
know that these conversations have moved
up the ladder and then a lot of people
all over the world important powerful
people are taking note of this and
taking note of the massive amounts of
numbers of people that are listening to
these podcasts and being influenced by
the stuff and the fact that Peterson has
sold about two million books it may be
more than two million already about a
month ago is one and a half million I
mean this thing is it's it's actually
incredible when I was in DC a couple
weeks ago for the Petersen event and
then I did a I did a sold-out show I'm
back doing stand-up and I did a sold-out
show at the DC Improv it was awesome
thank you for all of you guys that came
there and we did a meet-and-greet after
which was totally fun it was great I
brought up christina hoff sommers for
the second half the show's great but
anyway I was in DC and I went to this
little party and I got on I can't say
who was there because I don't know if he
wants to be known as somebody but there
was a senator there who was a very
influential senator one of the most
influential senators and all of the
Senate and he was there and I walked in
and he's like hey Dave Rubin I know
you're on tour Peterson I'm reading this
book right now so cool things are
happening this stuff is starting to
percolate and I don't think it's a
coincidence that Barack Obama came out
and did a real that was a real swipe of
identity politics and you know it's
interesting because there's so many
things happening here at once and we're
watching the massive realignment of
politics and media it's all happening
together this is the fertile ground
we've been talking about for the last
couple of years here we're watching it
sort of all shake out right now and we
don't know what'll be on the other side
but it's exciting I think if you're
aware and you're you got a couple
neurons still firing and you're paying
attention to what's going on
so when Barack Obama does that that's a
signal I think to some of the same
lefties and by the way there are sane
lefties right I used to know a lot of
them
and we need I think a Seine left and a
Seine right and I would love to see for
all of my frustrations with the left
that you guys know I talk about all
times and I hate identity politics and I
hate what the Democratic Party has
become and the oppression Olympics and
all of this nonsense and I think they're
way too big government and all of that
for all of that if the same part of the
Left came back the part of the left that
for those of you that are libertarian or
conservative or whatever that you may
disagree with but I think you believe
our principles or should at least
believe their principles so if the part
of the left that say Brett Weinstein who
considered himself deeply progressive
for his whole life believed in or his
wife Heather I believed in if that same
part of the left were the part of the
left that I once was part of when I
considered myself a Democrat and when
Democrats were actually liberal not
leftist when they were open-minded not
so talat Arian if that came back that
would be good for everything so there's
something interesting going on right now
because I see right now I see three sort
of distinct pieces or we could say I see
three distinct units on the right so
right now you've got the Trump people
the magg of people okay big column right
there that's a that's an ideological
column then you have the never Trump
pers the sort of more old-school
conservatives BAM okay these are very
separate people but they're thought of
on the right or they're thought of as
Republican or conservative whatever you
want to call that then there's also what
I with the part that I like the most
which is I think there is a very strong
growing libertarian wing of the
conservative party when I go to these
Peterson events when I speak at colleges
when I do stand-up I talked about
libertarian ideas and that's when people
get most excited so there's three
distinct ideologies right now within the
right so to speak right so we've got the
trunkpeople the never Trump people
old-school conservatives and we've got
libertarians they're all fighting for
control of their thing of their party of
their ideology all that that's great
that's a beautiful thing you know it's
unfortunately when you just see them
fighting at each other to the point
where they hate each other and these
people are evil and those people that
gets nobody anywhere what a beautiful
thing you if you have an idea
logical war the right way like really
fighting out ideas that's a beautiful
thing and I think that's what we try to
do around here
right now on the left unfortunately we
don't see as much of that because there
has been a purging of the Liberals and
the progressives and the Democratic
socialists and that crew that wants
really big government and that does
judge on your skin color and your
immutable characteristics and thinks
that government can solve all the
problems they have basically purged out
all the same
San Jose saying all the the more
pleasant thoughtful liberals let's say
and I do see and that's why I said this
would be the year of unusual alliances I
see a lot of old-school liberals finding
a lot more in common in common with
old-school conservatives are certainly
the libertarian people and I guess some
of them are Magga people too but there
isn't an ideological fight there really
because it's basically just been a
slaughter where there's almost nobody
left so that's why today I thought was
so interesting because by Obama saying
in effect he said identity politics are
 and you have to be able to
listen to people even scary
white men yeah you have to be able to
listen to them because they might have
good ideas that's pretty powerful and if
that signals some sort of comeback on
the left of that theory and and that
takes root a little bit I think that
would be great and you know Peterson in
a lot of the events that we talk about
because one of the things that happens
is we do a Q&A at the end of what
happens is we use an app called slide oh
so when we first started we were just
letting people come up to the mic to do
the Q&A but what happens is people are
so excited they end up telling their
life story and they very long-winded
things and sometimes they're very
nervous and they lose their train of
thought and a whole bunch of stuff and
we want to get to as many questions as
possible so what we do now is there's an
app called slide o SLI do and people
that are in the audience and they're
usually three to four or five thousand
people at the audience in these shows
and it's just been incredible I'll tell
you a little bit more about that later
people submit questions on the app and
then while Peterson is doing his thing
so basically the way the show works is I
go up there for about 10 or 15 minutes I
do warm up I welcome everybody we do
some silly stuff I talked about lobsters
and cleaning your room
I just get everybody going and
everybody's in a great mood and people
are screaming and it's and it's just
wonderful it's none of the things that
these awful articles and slime ball
you know hack pieces are saying about it
what about what's going on there so
anyway so I do my thing that I bring out
Peters and Jordan talks about everything
everything under the Sun for an hour
sometimes he talks about the 12 rules
sometimes he talked about the media
sometimes he talks about the
intellectual dark web some 90 talks
about what what whatever else is on is
mine every single one of these shows has
been different it's been it's been truly
incredible being on this tour I mean the
guy is a true tour de force and whether
you love them or hate them or you're
different or whatever it's like it's
just so cool being around it I've just
thoroughly enjoyed every every second of
the end I've enjoyed also just bouncing
around from city to city and figuring
out which cities I like orange and just
the differences of the people I gotta
say many of you guys were at the
Nashville show you were the happiest
freaking bunch of people I've ever seen
in my entire life I don't know what is
in the water in Nashville but that's the
one that really stuck out to me and we
were in the Ryman theater which is from
the Grand Ole Opry and just the history
there but we've been an amazing theaters
and it's so cool cuz we go to these
really old school theaters that are kind
of like Phantom of the Opera that we've
been to some some newer more modern
theaters and just and the people are
great name
in any event people submit questions
during the show and then while Jordans
doing his thing I basically look through
them and Jordan made it very clear to me
from the beginning he said nothing is
off-limits I want you to challenge me
etcetera etcetera so I go through I find
some silly ones I find some funny ones I
find some some some painful ones I find
some hard ones some political ones some
not political ones some personal ones
psychological questions I mean all sorts
of stuff now and we do that at the end
for about 30 to 45 minutes and it's just
it's just been absolutely great and you
know it's so funny because being on this
tour with the guy it's like as were on
the tour hit pieces come out so like
that ridiculous enforced monogamy
article came out in the New York Times
and I had met the author of it two or
three days before she was sitting in the
green room with us at our first show in
Toronto and it's like she seemed like a
great gal I talked about this a little
bit when I
had Jordan in here with Eric Weinstein a
couple weeks ago and it's like and then
just writes this piece that as if Jordan
is trying to force anyone to be married
or force women into monogamy or anything
enforcement either he meant marriage
that's all he meant and it's like you
watch these people in these slime bags
and often I've invited people to come to
the show after they've written bad
pieces there's been a writer a guy from
the Blais who spent a couple days with
us who's writing a piece right now and
wrote a profile piece on me a couple
months ago that I think is gonna be an
excellent piece coming out about the
tour because I took the time to learn to
trust the guy as much as I can trust a
reporter and and we spent some time with
him and all that but unfortunately you
know what's happened these days because
of the clickbait machine that you guys
know about that these guys real all of
these reporters but they're activists
they're not journalists and what they do
is they go holy cow
Peterson's got the number one book he's
selling out these theaters now he's
doing these things with sam harris where
they're getting you know 8,000 9,000
people overseas and it's like well
instead of learning what's actually
going there so instead of actually
showing up to the show and reporting on
the truth that has nothing to do with
racism or misogyny he's actually giving
you the tools by empowering your own
life by cleaning your own room he's
giving you the tools to not be racist to
not be beginning to not to hate cultural
Marxism and the progressive politics of
the oppression Olympics of all of that
stuff he's telling you hate that but
also well not not hate it that's not
even the right word know what it is and
know why it's wrong and then he's also
saying the identity politics of the
right are just as bad he focuses more on
the left as I focus more left
because that seems to be the thing
that's the cultural norm that is jammed
down our throat every day but these
reporters they don't even show up to
these things because they just want to
write something so that they can get
more clicks they're just in the click
business and and I don't think any of us
you know this whole crew of people IDW
whatever you want to call it I don't
think we're in the click business
there'd be a lot of ways for us to get
more clicks I mean you can look at the
way we tag and title all of our videos
we know if we use certain buzzwords
we'll capitalize certain things differ
Lior gotcha destroys it's like we know
we could get more clicks but it's really
not about that we're doing good and I
try to treat the channel the same way I
treat the conversations that I'm having
with you guys and I think one of the
things that's really happening here is
that out of this whole crew of people
it's like we genuinely respect you I
want to hear from you the fact that we
go out there now and it's so awesome
there's been a couple nights where
Jordan and I have just walked out into
the audience there there was sometimes
there's a line around the block I mean
literally around four square blocks in
Seattle
wrapped around it was awesome and we
just go out there and say hi to people
when I've been wandering around the the
cities during the day people come up to
me and they want to take me out to
dinner and drink and I join some people
some time one night where the hell was
it Portland I was I was pretty beat
after the show because it had been a
long run and I went back to my hotel and
I was just gonna have half a glass of
wine at the bar and it turned out that
like 40 people from the show were there
we hung out did our thing there so it's
just it's just been wonderful and
inspiring and for me look you guys know
I rail against the mainstream media all
the time and it's like wow this thing
being part of this thing has just it's
been the proof in the pudding you know
what I mean like they say the proof is
in the pudding well all the things that
I'm always talking about how these
[Music]
joining me today is the Libertarian
candidate for governor from the great
state of New York Larry sharp welcome to
the Rubin report thanks for having me
libertarian New York yes are you okay
sir the issue to remember here is Cato
actually rated us 50th when it came to
freedom we beat California see we got
you huh we're Bhavana yeah you came you
came here to California to see me yes
because we're better than you when it
comes to tyranny we got you down we got
you you can't beat us so yes this is a
critical piece I'm glad I'm doing this
it's the right answer because imagine
this if I make any impact in New York
what is that save the country it shows
that the impact of this race is so
important that if I can make anything
happen in New York State it will affect
the rest of the nation overnight what
you imagine for a second in my race I
just get 10% that will change how people
think in New York throughout the entire
state it'll force Republicans that
actually have the Republicans Democrats
to be Democrats because now the term
party will have an actual voice so now
when I go to Republicans and I say
you're supposed to be about
small-government
someone will listen want to go Democrats
and say you're supposed to be about
civil liberties someone will listen it
will force them to be better but I'm
gonna go one step further what if I
actually beat the Republican in New York
State that's magical I beat the
Republican New York State politics works
for the first two two parties actually
run everything mm-hmm so Republicans
would officially be knocked out so of
course that we write the rules overnight
of course they were right they were two
rules course if I know that are you
implying that New York State has a
corrupt assembly no come on come on we
rose to office Emily yeah let's be clear
of assembly you're insulting me now most
corrupt yeah so no my point being it
would then allow for third parties to
really exist in New York State and that
again would cross the nation
but imagine if actually one if I
actually win I turn New York State gold
that would change the entire nation
overnight overnight all the Liberty
leaning Republicans Democrats would come
out of the woodwork and like we always
love Larry sharp and they would all job
on board and the Libertarian Party will
become huge overnight this race has the
most impact because it's New York okay
so you are acknowledging this is an
uphill battle it's coming - yes and I
gotta tell you if it was six months ago
I knew I could make impact that 10% I
knew I could get
I knew that six months ago what does a
libertarian usually get in a
gubernatorial race 1% maybe I meant
that's a lot we rarely break 40,000
votes if I don't think I've ever bring
in 2,000 folks what do you think of that
before we go specifically a fantasy
because one of my issues with the
libertarians it's like as a party
there's such disorganization you know
III want to talk a little bit of a guy
about Gary Johnson because I know you
work for him and we're almost his VP
choice which I'm gonna mop but I'm a big
fan yeah we can get into the up to some
of that stuff and I've had him on the
show and I think he's a good person I
think he was just a flawed candidate but
just that the party itself seems to be
extremely disorganized and you know when
they should have these conventions and
it's like naked people and naked guys
but that habit met naked guy I'm sure
he's a great he's a great guy nice guys
but that that as a party there's been a
lot of disorganization here and I guess
that when you're making things about the
individual it's hard to get people to
come together on the collective but what
can you do what do you think that's a
fair diagnosis number one what I just
laid out look it's tough the system is
set up against us right it's up against
us to fail any third party right do you
find any other third parties that are
great no but I'll at least like the idea
yes I'm not on board the green stuff so
I want that everything to I mean a lot
of the third parties collapse because
the system is against them but I say the
same thing always the panacea the
cure-all is victory when we begin to win
people will come up with us on arts on
our team a lot of the people who believe
in us don't join our party because of
that so chicken and egg yeah right the
party isn't awesome because awesome
people aren't flooding to it because the
party isn't awesome yeah therefore
awesome people aren't flooding to it
right it's a chicken an egg so once we
become a real party where people
actually are saying wow these guys can
win so one reasons why I'm bringing
Secretariat right
I'm not jump I'm not jumping ship and
join another party and trying to go on
some other party everybody's libertarian
I'm doing
I want to show people a third party can
have impact and can win and join the
third parties my candidacy is assuming I
do very well doesn't just couple
batarians it helps any third party but
obviously heavily my part it's what I
care about but it will help others also
right so you're right it's a problem of
course it is but all the parties are a
problem
look the Republicans Democrats have
kook's also right they're crazy there's
what about it it's just as so few of us
that I would stand out yeah and what a
scrutiny I mean the things that the
things that politicians who are Democrat
Republicans have said are far worse they
were libertarians have said mm-hmm but
it's whatever that the main that the two
old parties so they get a pass yeah I'm
not mad at it it's the way it is it's a
burden that we have that I've accepted
and I've taken on it's the burden I take
on but here's the glory if I win this
battle my victory is sweeter because I
had all the burdens I'm fine with it is
what it is yeah all right so before we
get into the specifics of New York and
what your libertarian principles aren't
things like that tell me a little bit
about your history because you are
actually born and bred in New York and I
am you've got an interesting history and
we're in the Marines and all sorts of
stuff so it was so god gave me back I'll
give you the short version I'm born in
Manhattan biracial parents in the 60s my
mom gives me up for adoption because she
can't handle the issues of bi racial
issues in her family I'm very lucky I
get adopted very young I think I was six
weeks old by a lovely couple who took me
to the Bronx a German immigrant and her
husband who was an in the Army in
Germany that's how we met her so I
raised in the Bronx from around nine or
ten in that area 11 and at that point my
mother had actually divorced and then
another man who was my actual father who
actually raised me and taught me to be a
man
we moved at Long Island he died when I
was around 12 years old when he passed
there just me and my mom my mom couldn't
handle it
she was really devastated by this her
family was in Germany she was here I was
distant that was a young teenage boy
trying to find my way also when I was 17
I left and join the Marine Corps Jenna
Marine Corps was there for about six
years seven years when I got out my
mother had already collapsed she was
initially addicted to legal drugs and
eventually illegal drugs she was
arrested victim the drug war she was the
prison break the felon
I got her out and tried to put it back
on her feet I tried to help her too she
left the prison with two garbage bags
that was what her life was so I helped
her get back on her feet try to get a
job I saw how hard it was for to get a
job I mean she was always lying on every
form because of the knew she was a
felony wouldn't hire her and when she
was working she had to always lie and
she was a hostage basically I became an
entrepreneur because I did my mom to be
a hostage so we set her own business me
and her and my stepdad who was another
man she she had married afterwards and
so we stopped to start a business
together so that she could be her own
person and not be a hostage no that was
our first business after that got up and
running I left that had a bunch of sales
jobs and then decided to then decided to
sell my own business again that business
did not go well I sold that one off then
I went and got this business which I've
had for 14 years I'm a consultant a
trainer I've been an officer in public
company twice I've taught in colleges I
teach now at Baruch sometimes John J
I've taught that at the graduate level
of as a guest instructor and Yale in
Colombia
so I've taught a lot I do a lot of is
like the coaching training leadership
sales that kind of stuff I'm an
entrepreneur benefits of 14 years and
two years ago I saw an opportunity to
jump on board Libertarian Party as a VP
nominee so I tried to get the VP slot
I lost the bill well by 30 31 votes
nothing was counting yeah and now I'm
running for governor that was two years
ago where that was in 2012 2016 that was
2016 1 here's what was why I first came
to the party okay I was not I was not
really political at all when I was uh
when I was a youngster do you wanna hear
this story yeah when I'm a young I'm
interviewing you all right I love
anything we're doing I'm happy too yep
away 90 me out I know the first time
anyone's ever said that to me I love you
wanna hear all these ones me and my cool
stuff I don't want to guess Yap away and
they're like you know clicking off I'm
going to watch I don't have a drink
instead what do you wanna do if that
would make it better maybe all right
let's see what the story so as a
youngster I grew up in New York City and
of course Democrats are good and
publicans are evil how it works right
you're evil because you're gonna are by
your name you're good because you vide
by your name yeah who is the mayor at
the time this is really I think it was
Ed Koch Ed Koch okay I love dead Koch
although I grew up in Long
but we were big family but it wasn't
about him it was about the party yeah my
mom and dad were strict Democrats that's
who you are
you were a Democrat because they were
good and Poppins were evil yeah but when
I joined the Marine Corps at 17 the
Marine Corps is a very conservative
branch when it comes to the branches and
most of my friends and people had no and
leaders that I respected they were
mostly conservative Republicans Ronald
Reagan was my first commander-in-chief
so I think I kind of became a Republican
as a as a teen and as a young
20-something I became over Republican so
I kind of shape the back I wasn't part
of a party and I only voted in the
presidential elections because it was
absentee I wasn't I was also Versys so I
voted be a male so I didn't even
register locally to do the local
elections yeah so we pause everyone to
act because so you mentioned you're
biracial yeah and I hate making anything
about race because we're so overly
racialized now and identity politics and
all this but I think that a certain
amount of my own is when they hear you
say that all right so you were you were
Ronald Reagan was your
commander-in-chief and you were
identifying as a Republican back then as
a black man yeah you know I've had many
black conservatives on here some of whom
I consider great friends like Larry
elder and I bet this is Thomas olan and
many or no so that's why I wanted to ask
you about that yeah what was it like
then to take that political it wasn't
very political if that made any sense I
wasn't talking about things I did but
other than internally for you I didn't
care to be 40 I didn't care if you I
don't care now I didn't get her then and
over here now yeah I am Who I am I
believe what I believe and you like it
or you don't and that's how is it didn't
care that either right on man so I
didn't really care to be folk with you
some people thought I was crazy
my parents Rob with insane whatever I
didn't care I didn't talk about it much
it wasn't I was worried about you know
chasing girls and it's 19 20 years old
being a marine I was I wasn't worried
about it it wasn't part of my life to
before with you I I look back now I wish
it was I wish I had known more stuff
then but I was a young guy trying to
figure out to be a man I wasn't really
thinking about that very much so that's
why eventually in the 90s I went to I
went to Peru because I just didn't want
the arse of the DS then I went to NATO
in 2000 because I didn't want the arse
of the DS I knew that the arse and the
DS were the same there was a difference
ideally all putting my friends in jail I
knew they were all the war on drugs and
the war on terror wasn't gonna stop
that's that was gonna be bad no matter
what I did
excuse me so I just and again if you
would have asked me what was Perot what
was it what was Nate errs policies I
couldn't have told you I just knew they
weren't the mainstream and therefore
they were good enough for me and again
people thought I was crazy I didn't care
so finally in 2008 I was considering not
bullying all anymore I was really
finished I was like who cares it doesn't
matter of growing a business I'm gonna
run my business make my money become a
bazillionaire and who cares who's in
charge
cuz I'll run them cuz I'll have all the
money that was my logic it doesn't for
ya so but doesn't eight when Obama came
I thought okay this is different he's a
city guy he's black this is the guy he's
different he speaks differently people
are excited alright you know what maybe
this is the guy night I had hope I
bought the hope and change I bought it
mm-hmm and when I joined before you
added sort of a libertarian awakening
right actually I I this I was having
libertarian awakening but that sort of
overrode it but I gotta tell you how I
became there yeah I became looat Arian
not through politics
I came them training through Robert
ringer do you know Robert ringer I don't
think Robert ringer is a business guy
he's Objectivist and he had brought many
books looking out for number one to be
or not to be intimidated nothing happens
unless something moves action he talks
about how to brand yourself he talks
about how to be successful in business
in life I was a trainer that's what I
said to now he was one of my you know
mentors I don't know in person but I
read his books I was part of his website
so I knew who he was so he got me into
reading and rent I didn't come to
libertarianism through politics I came
in through business I'm a business guy
huh so I was reading Atlas Shrugged
because he said we got the shrugged not
because some political guy did I didn't
know who Ron Paul was doesn't eight I
had no idea I wasn't political I was a
business guy yeah the reason why I care
about Obama's because he was so
different it got my attention so again I
did really understand his policies if
that made me sense yeah I just thought
he's different he's not them it can't be
worse that was my thought process so as
I'm moving towards objectivism in that
regard I'm not an Objectivist and I
never been
but some of the market ideas made sense
to me the idea of Austrian economics
made sense to me I didn't know was
Austrian economics though cuz I never
read Friedman I never read those I
didn't know I read brought a ringer yeah
and he had told me what his his views so
I gotta think secondhand through him so
I was already teaching I was teaching
post-industrial internship obviously
she'd buy-in I was teaching sales is not
about forcing someone to do something
getting to do it I was teaching
volunteerism not knowing what it was
called or what it was I was already
doing it in my own business so anyway I
was I was having that change three dozen
Ford about 2010 anyway that was
happening already I'm so it changed my
business model and doing it already
after crash hit I had to jump into it a
lot cuz I was crushed in it scratch
scratch devastated me so anyway III
think Obama's great after the first year
I realized he's no different again I'm
finished I'm like it's over
until 2012 I hear Gary Johnson speak and
people say well Gary Taubes he's an
awesome speaker no but he was a business
guy I'm a business guy I could hear him
I couldn't hear anyone else cuz I didn't
care I could only hear the person who I
was identified with him self-made man
growing a business I identify with Gary
Johnson I still do and so when he
decided to talk I said oh I get it and I
came to the part because of him but to
be forward I didn't join the party still
right away I've never done a partner mat
in my life I never joined a party but at
this point I thought you know what I'm
gonna go to the meetings and never been
to a party meeting before and I went to
the meetings and when I went to
Libertarian Party meetings as odd as
they were and they are odd it was still
just regular people
it wasn't crazy there was regular people
business owners people who wondered see
some change I identified it quickly with
them and I joined so I joined the party
in 2012 and that's when I became a
libertarian yeah but when I joined the
party I hadn't read Basquiat I hadn't
read for I didn't read any of them and I
didn't even know them so that's when I
joined them I began looking around and
then I read the law - my favorite of all
them was bossy is my favorite that was
the simplest and the one that identified
with the most
still my favorite but I read all the
rest also I began to read them right I
read the word Road to Serfdom I began to
read those afterwards but they were easy
for me to understand the people they
teasing a Larry you've been in the
movement so short so hard but you can
you can talk with the principles I've
been teaching them for 14 years
yeah but not under the name right in a
different world so it was very easy to
me to adapt and to bring those those
things to bear so I've order for Gary
Johnston 2012 and I support his
candidacy completely in 2016
I was running around doing debates in
his stead that was on TV instead for him
and they wanted I would do so I jump
through hoops for him because I I wish
it was a president now yeah I wish she
was so I don't want to belabor the point
Gary I voted for Gary I did I did a
video in the summer before the election
of why it would be great to support him
he wasn't a perfect handed etc etc but
he he had a couple gaffes that were
pretty bad and I also I don't even blame
him for them in a certain way because it
was the only 2-year point it was the
only way he could get press like the
only time they talked about him yes was
aleppo apps or the other moment where he
couldn't name a leader that he respected
but the one the one policy point that
really bothered me with him and I don't
know maybe maybe we don't see eye to eye
on this is that he wanted the the Baker
to bake the cake well let me touch two
of those things yes the first thing is
every problem that Gary Johnson had is
fixed with good advisers everyone yeah
repaired with good advisers yeah every
[Music]
joining me is an evolutionary biologist
formerly of Evergreen State University
who is now a professional professor in
exile Heather hi and welcome to the
Reuben report thank you for having us
dance professor in exile I believe that
is in your Twitter bio it is I believe
it is in your husband Brett Weinstein's
Twitter bio yeah we generated just
together is that gonna be the title of
the co-authored book when the dust
settles on all of this stuff oh I don't
know I think both of us are both eager
to leave the Evergreen story behind but
still heartbroken that an institution
that we loved and still believe in the
educational model that it offered and
still believed in the students who got
great education was there for many
decades we we would love to see it
resurrected but it doesn't look like
it's gonna happen yeah all right so this
is it's a little crazy to me that this
is the first time that we've met because
obviously our circles have been sort of
closing in on each other for for quite
some time so when when the whole
Evergreen thing happened and I only want
to spend a little bit of time at the top
talking about and then I want to do all
sorts of evolutionary biology stuff and
the other the other things that you're
really passionate about the story
obviously was more focused on Brett and
then he was sort of thrust into the
media and all that but this was a direct
attack on you as well and as you said
the institution that you loved and all
that can you just give me any sort of
recap or just pieces of it that maybe we
don't know that well or just her
perspective on what was happening there
well as briefly as I can leaving out
many many relevant pieces we got a new
president and the new president very
quickly got rid of a Provost who was
going to get in his way and spoke
publicly about his desire to turn
evergreen into the social justice
college that was actually on the record
early in George bridges tenure at the
point that the protests broke out a year
ago now-ish he had been president for
about two years and a year before that
had broken out in equity
a desire to bring equity and inclusion
to the forefront which is which is
codewords it's dog whistles for the
people on the far left who are actually
interested in a reversal of power not an
end to oppression but an actual reversal
of historical oppression did you guys
recognize those things as dog whistles
at the time because as Brett said at the
time he considers himself or at least at
that time did consider himself deeply
progressive you just said to me right
before we started you still consider
yourself progressive yeah so did you
realize those buzz words and and what
they actually meant at the time
absolutely
I mean Brett actually I was on
sabbatical that you're most of the year
before this broke out is murder and why
I was disappeared from the story I said
as I went onto sabbatical Brett I will
continue to read everything you want to
send out to these lists but I am not
engaging I am doing my own work now so
about a year actually a year to the day
before the protests broke out the first
announcement of the new plan came came
live and then and there and for the next
year Brett was I was a little bit a
couple of other people who are a little
bit standing up and saying this doesn't
smell right this this feels like this is
actually about something that we're not
talking about and furthermore if we are
actually interested in improving the
fate of various demographic groups these
processes are not going to be the way to
accomplish them so we were saying that
Bret mostly was saying that a few others
of us were saying it and was there any
sort of understanding of that point of
view privately yes
privately yes people were scared and
when in fact when Brett used the phrase
culture of fear on campus what came back
at him was you have to prove that
there's a culture of fear or else
there's not one and you know show me the
people who aren't standing up or else I
will know that they they don't exist
which is you know it's baffling yeah
right it's it is obviously an improve an
unprovable statement to say there's a
culture of fear and I'm not going to out
the people who have come to me
they're scared as I actually am going to
honor their privacy but if if everyone
who had come to us privately and said
this is nuts and it's got to stop
had stood up it would have been a
totally different outcome well that's
the culture of fear summed up right
there right okay so without rehashing
the whole thing can you just tell me a
little bit about sort of how your life
has changed throughout this and sort of
you know look you and Bret you guys did
settle it wasn't for a ton of money at
least in my humble estimation but I
think you probably wanted to just put
some of this behind you but you guys are
professors and I saw you if you have
kids and family and all that stuff and
just sort of sum up kind of where you're
at at the moment yeah so I mean we had
we've been living in Olympia for 15
years the the college was an amazing
place to really do a deep dive in
community with students and so you know
Bret and I had done one and I had done
several long study abroad trips in
Panama and in Ecuador with pretty large
groups of undergraduates taking them
through the Amazon through Galapagos we
spent time in the field in Washington
State in the San Juans in Eastern
Washington took people places where not
only we were studying evolutionary
biology and animal behavior and field
techniques and statistics of the
philosophy of science but also coming to
know each other such that after you
after you break bread with people for
days and you play ultimate with them and
you sit around a campfire you come to
understand that when they disagree with
you it's not inherently coming from a
place of hatred or personal animosity
and so that trust that we were able to
create in our classrooms which both of
us love to doing allowed us to
effectively then rip the intellectual
rug out from under people when they made
claims that weren't falsifiable or
couldn't be it couldn't be justified
once you started to ask them what the
assumptions were they were underlying
their claims that was that was an
amazing gift and I don't know that
really almost any other educational
model out there allows for that because
it required the time to build community
with students which was which was
wonderful so yes we lost to tenure track
jobs along with our health insurance and
our retirement plans and all of that and
have two kids still in school so that's
alarming
but some of what we were doing in the
classroom we have begun to do on larger
stages and that is promising it seems
clear that the world is interested in
hearing how to understand systems from
an evolutionary perspective I knew that
was true from the 25 or 50 students that
I had doing the deep dive for every
quarter every year for years it's not
that surprising but it is heartening to
see that that is the response of many
many people out there in a weird way
does it almost feel right then that this
happened I mean I know it's kind of
sucky and again with the salaries and
tenure-track positions and all that but
that the message that you guys are
talking about seems so relevant right
now you guys are now doing more public
speaking gigs I'm dragging Brett on
stage with me to do stand-up and all
sorts of crazy things are presenting
themselves and then the sort of the rise
of this new alliance of whether you want
to call it intellectual dark web or
whatever you want to call it at this
point but there is this sort of
interesting crew of people with a lot of
different feelings on a lot of different
issues with all sorts of different
disciplines coming together and maybe if
you guys were still at university in a
traditional sense you wouldn't be able
to be dealt in the way that you are now
I think that's possible I think there is
both a way in which having gone through
the looking-glass having gone through
the direct you know to borrow a phrase
from the far left but the lived
experience of actually being at the
center of a mob at the center of riots
and then watching as the world the
mainstream media and others tried to do
a public relations spin on it and tell a
totally different story
to live that and to watch the
institution that you love to become
totally disloyal to you and to watch
many people whom you respected hide you
can't don't see that it's valuable and
the fact that we're sitting here talking
together and that many of us in you know
the intellectual dark web and in this in
this bigger group are are speaking and
saying actually the culture of fear that
is society-wide
is real and so I'll say the the first
time I met my students after
November 2016 election after Trump was
selected evergreen it's a very left
place Olympia is a very left place
pretty much everyone on campus had that
glazed eyes slack-jawed look that people
in most progressive enclaves will be
familiar with from that time from those
few days right
myself included even though I was no
Hillary fan but I didn't see that
outcome coming and I certainly didn't
vote for Trump I am we got to class and
my co faculty whom I admire greatly just
preceded with her lecture on horse
evolution and I'm looking around the
classroom going no one here cares about
horse so she ended a bit early and we
had lab a couple hours later and before
she let them go I said hold on if anyone
wants to stay this is no longer class
but if anyone wants to stay I would be
happy to lead a conversation about what
just happened yeah what just happened to
our country and about 40 of our 50
students stayed well skip their lunch
hour again we went right to anatomy lab
that afternoon from from this
conversation and what I said to them was
do not for a minute believe that racists
and sexist elected Trump think about how
many times you have had to censor
yourself on this campus when you had an
opinion that was even slightly different
from the accepted dogma and that
conversation not only brought life to
the room but afterwards I had several
students come up to me some of them in
tears telling me stories about one of
them had lost a job on campus for
speaking an opinion that was not
accepted one of them had an another
story of another friend who'd lost a job
others talked about their self
censorship and that and all of these
people again were for left not that it
should matter but these work even people
who were conservatives or who held
conservative views so that that is the
larger culture of fear that is hardly
restricted to Evergreen but is
society-wide that we are that we are
speaking about and that people are
responding to because in you know at
Google at Starbucks in cubicles in
campuses but far beyond campuses
the country and across the weird country
is at least this is a problem well the
irony to me is that I think that all
that I'm doing is talking about these
things often with people who have a much
better
pedigree than I do but by me talking
about it it's giving room for other
people to talk about that's all that
they want well you're also you oh you
are also providing ways into the
conversation I think so there are a lot
of people when confronted with you're
not allowed to think that say oh god I'm
not actually sure how to respond I
haven't I don't know I don't I don't
have the linguistic skills I don't have
the analytics behind me I don't know
what I'm supposed to say here and so
just listening to to you and to sam
Harris and the Jordan Peterson and to
Brett and to Eric and to me and to know
many many others I believe begins to
give people a sense of not only is this
doable these are good reasonable smart
people who are being respectful and what
they're saying but also it's not just
tools it's actually like freezes it's
you know this is what you can say these
are the things that sort of things that
you can say in response that are still
respectful and don't reject the humanity
of the person on the other side but do
reject the argument it's interesting it
almost shows that what you guys
obviously were doing so well at a
university level that's exactly what's
needed at a societal level now talking
about the language the language to get
these ideas across is so important I
wonder is there a evolutionary
explanation for a little bit of what has
happened here with the left like the way
they've sort of closed off ranks and
then purged everyone because it's just
as I sit here with you it's like the
idea that you and Brett wouldn't be
enough of whatever it is that they want
is so bananas and yet it is true so is
there some way that you can explain that
coming from the discipline you come from
well there's I think this is not going
to be a particularly deep point but it's
it's basic in-group out-group dynamics
and we will always we will not get rid
of of tribal thinking we will not get
rid of our sense of you know you and I
are aligned right that's that's a good
thing there's a way in which there's a
kind of tribalism there even though we
just met for the first time today you're
not and
and we definitely have political
differences and I'm sure which we can
talk about if we won't have right so we
end but but that isn't the main thing
like we're aligned and I you know I feel
walking in here like you've got my back
and you've got my back and I think
people especially raised without much
experience with the physical world and
raised often in situations where they're
being given a number of pharmaceuticals
early on that are disrupting development
arrive at what should be the cusp of
adulthood and aren't sure how to
navigate aren't sure how to navigate the
waters and so when told oh if you just
agree with everything if you just become
an ideologue and go in lockstep with us
you can be with us so you know identity
politics is appealing because it
provides an instant in-group if you will
only subjugate yourself yeah and you
know identity politics on this side
begets at Annie politics on this side of
course because anyone who shows up here
and is told no you don't have enough of
what the progressive stack tells us you
need either you can totally subjugate
yourself or go over there well of course
we're going to get a rise over here and
back and forth when people criticize us
whoever this is for not focusing on that
identity politics enough the the one
that the secondary one that you're
talking about here which is the identity
politics of the right which is either
which is based in actual racism or or
you know there's a white at no state or
ideas that are so the antithesis of the
American experiment it to me they're
they're ridiculous and have no real
real-world traction it's almost like
we've created this boogeyman because we
need it they've long since been just
like what no no almost no one thinks
that way anymore
sorry no well so what's your what's your
best argument against that well people
say well you're not focusing on that
enough because because everyone wants
everything to be equal all the time so
if you're focusing on the identity
politics the left which clearly many of
us see is I mean I truly see it I've
been saying this and I really believe
this I view it as the greatest
existential threat to Western democracy
that there is I believe that if there's
something that would cause us to be on
the streets like killing each other I
think it's that we're will have broken
off and all of the commonalities will
disappear but what what do you
is the best argument for what you're not
focusing on that one enough because I
see that a lot now right I think I think
two things one it's not as big a group
right the the white nationalists to the
extent that they exist only do our
better armed by-and-large than than the
far left but numerically they just don't
exist in the same numbers and they don't
have the kind of play they don't have
the kind of cultural reach that the far
left does and so that's the second well
I guess there's three points a secondary
point then is everyone can walk white
nationalists that is completely
acceptable and in fact demanded that you
do when those sorts of ideas come up in
conversation whereas the stuff on the
far left increasingly it is demanded
that you not using so there is that's a
key right there right so like we are
saying no actually we must we must
disagree with this just as much as we
should just as much as culturally we now
know it's a norm to disagree with what's
on the right we the far right it should
become a cultural norm to disagree with
frankly the cryptic racism and sexism
and you know and everything else that's
happening on the far left it is it comes
packaged as if it's anti-racist and
anti-sexist and all it's just it's
racist and sexist against the other
group it's it's a flipping of the the
tables of oppression so I would say the
third point is for me anyway as someone
who has been on the left my whole life
this has changed this experience is
going through the looking-glass in the
last year has not changed my values but
it has changed what I understand about
how people are using language to make
other people out to be things they're
not yeah so you know I no longer believe
in a massive alt right for instance
right right and you know the the boogie
men that are out there that you're not
supposed to do things like talk to Fox
News mm-hmm sorry
no actually we should all be exposing
ourselves to to the media across the
entire range and for me on the left it's
actually my job much more so than to go
after people who I have nothing in
common with
to go after the people who claim to have
values that are similar to mine but I
see that they are actually achieving
goals that are different yeah and that's
why I love this conversation and I don't
get tired of it because we're all in on
it
at different levels we all have
different realizations at different
times along the timeline and it's like
for me that's where I'm free for two
years I kept saying I'm of the left and
that's why I want to fix this I don't
think realistically anymore I can
honestly say that I think I have more in
common certainly with libertarians and I
find him I find an intellectual openness
with conservatives that I just don't
find any more on this other side and I
know there's yet I know there's some
people you just spoke at heterodox yeah
you just spoke at heterodox Jonathan
hates been on the show I think he's
doing wonderful work there's obviously
people like Brett and like Eric and and
Steven Pinker and plenty and Sam and
plenty of other that exists still as
sort of a sane left but I see that just
being whittled and whittled and whittled
away and that doesn't mean the fights
not worth taking it maybe it means it's
the most worthy fight but I just see it
[Music]
alright let's talk about consciousness a
little bit I just had Sam Harris on
we've talked about it quite extensively
I think you have some thoughts on
consciousness the nature of
consciousness indeed yeah I mean it's
probably to do this right we would need
to agree on a definition and I'm not
sure that that's any definition that we
choose will immediately untag and I some
amount of your audience right this is
like the active way this is like
defining truth which seems to be tough
these days yes exactly so maybe maybe
rather than that your are humans the
only conscious beings on this planet I
don't think so but we are the most
conscious we are the most fully
conscious and we have better access to
our own consciousness obviously then we
have access to the consciousness of say
dolphins or elephants or other apes or
maybe wolves any of these long-lived
social organisms with long childhoods
and generational overlap who lived
sometimes with three generations
together at a time so this transmission
of cultural information organisms that
have theory of mind and can imagine can
put themselves in the other individuals
position and think what do they think is
going on right now even though I
understand that that's a different thing
than what I think is going on right now
right which we now know that certain
monkeys and apes exactly do that
yes theory of mind there's a beautiful
book called baboon metaphysics by the
husband and wife team Cheney and
Seyfarth that basically explores theory
of mind in baboons and you know it's
it's not the only one they're not the
only species but you know how do we as
humans find our consciousness best you
know there there are ways that we can
hack into what does some has been called
flow States or you know that's that's
the most common one but you know we can
do so through well through deep
conversation through meditation through
music some sometimes through producing
it but sometimes to experiencing
especially live music mm-hmm
dance for some people
hallucinogens sex sport you know intense
physical or physiological or emotional
experience in which we are just moving
with others usually and you know there
are those of us like myself you know
very strong introvert who will refined
so my deepest flow space you know access
to consciousness alone you alone in the
Amazon when I could sit and watch
monkeys and write nothing for me that's
one of them what sport is also so when I
talked about this with Sam the way he
was defining it which i think is sort of
similar to what you're saying here it
strikes me as just like an extreme
ability to maintain present in the
moment that that really sort of win a
basketball player so if we use the sport
analogy like a basketball third when
they're in the zone you know and Jordan
scores 20 points in five minutes and he
just he go he said well everything I
threw up just went in like right that
they hit that level of consciousness or
for you to be outside enough out of
yourself to be able to write in that
perfect moment or whatever does but it
always seems about being present more
than anything else do there is a kind of
time stopping both times stopping and
disappearing on you at the same time
which i think is part of why antigens
hallucinogens can capture that as well
because there the sense of time just
disappearing on you is is remarkable so
you you both don't care about time and
time passes usually in ways that seem
quicker than you're affecting them to
with with say sports or or right
meditation right you know that's not one
of it I do but you know Sam has a lot to
say about that if yes yeah I remember
when I was doing mushrooms at least
college-age somewhat consistently maybe
every six months or something I would
always want the clocks to be covered yes
because I I hated the they're no good I
did I definitely did one trip like five
hours in a mirror forget that but I
always wanted the clocks to be covered
because the idea that time was passing
while I was in this yes state was was
very scary to me now that's scary or
just I just wanted nothing to do with it
I guess
right and that you know it's
maybe it doesn't matter what that
distinction is you know scary or just
not interested right but so it's it's
very different the the kinds of
consciousness enhancing activities that
we can engage in including hallucinogens
are very different if you're inside in a
room like this where you have no access
to what is going on climatologically or
weather wise outside as opposed to if
you if you are out and you can watch as
the Sun sets and as the moon comes up
and you can think again oh right it's a
it's a it's a waxing moon and it'll be
full in four days and or you know or or
you're at a coast and you can watch the
tides and think about the shifting time
so for me thinking about time that is
clearly being brought it's clearly being
revealed by the planet we're on as
opposed to coming at me through a clock
is more meaningful and I'm what I'm
willing to think about time in that way
but definitely not through clocks when
I'm when I'm writing hallucinogens sport
any of that right right and yet we have
all of these devices now that are meant
our time that are meant to take our
attention that are literally designed
this way do you sense Ron's like that
there's actually a digital assault on
consciousness because maybe that really
does explain so many of the other
problems we're having in society right
now it's it's one of the key pieces for
sure and I think that phrase is
brilliant a digital assault on
consciousness this is something just on
Harris who I don't know but yeah I've
got him on the show yeah
talks talks about a lot and you know
he's been he has been ringing the alarm
bell for years about the algorithms that
are being put into our devices that are
that are creating addicts out of us no
but more broadly
you know the digital assault
unconsciousness is there's not there is
it's increasingly hard to find a space
where you're just actually free and
clear and this is you know this is part
of what I do for myself and what I used
to do for my students was take them to
places not only that were remote and
where they could explore nature but
where there was no cell signal where
there was no internet so you know the
deepest part of the Amazon that I took
students to there's just there's no
email
there's no internet there's no Wi-Fi we
are you know a plane ride over the Andes
and then a boat ride and then a truck
ride and then another five hours down a
tributary of the Amazon to a place with
no roads no air strips nothing and boy
does time feel different and you know
you're sleeping in little cabins that
are screened and so you wake up when the
insects and the birds and the monkeys
wake up and they start talking at you
there I can't you they're talking
themselves but you getting a sense of
the rhythms of the planet that we're on
can return people I think to a real
sense of self and also to a sense of
what they value what their passions are
and this is a big thing I think is
missing in many of the to return to what
we were talking about earlier you know
the the far-left activists that the
control left mostly I think lack another
passion and I've said before I you know
the prediction I would make is that you
have very few rock climbers or skiers
among the radical left activists people
who have something that they can engage
in that frees them from time and devices
from from a response to time I need to
be here then or this my thing just
pinged at me I need to look at it are
better able to Center themselves to to
find their own consciousness and
discover who who they are and what they
want to be in the world what does that
say about the self do you think like it
to me there's something there about like
if you really believe in the self and
your and the individual and your ability
to overcome things you don't need all
these external processes to help define
the world because you're sort of
defining it yourself
I agree and I think I do think for me
self sufficiency is one of my highest
values personally and I have a I have a
very hard time understanding anyone who
says oh if you leave me on my own I
wouldn't know what to do
I just don't get this I don't get why
you would maybe the lefty thing I'd be
fine feel like what why would why would
you broadcast to the world that you
would be helpless this doesn't make any
sense to me
but and you know they're they're playing
situations where I wouldn't know what to
do and I would know what to do
in situations that most people wouldn't
just because of where I've traveled and
where I've lived but the idea that
self-sufficiency requite the idea that
you want to be self-sufficient requires
a concept of self I think is is
important here yeah maybe just maybe
that yeah and if you give that up well
then boy you're given a lot you you give
up so much and the devices as as Heron s
Tristan Harris has argued are addicting
us it's no accident you know we should
not view ourselves actually as weak we
when we get addicted to the things we
should Wiener selves we should as much
as possible to provide ourselves zones
periods of time when we have no access
to those things and so we are actually
free and clear to let our minds do what
they will because when when we have when
they have access to our brands they are
designed to attack does so using using
the discipline that you're an expert in
is it possible that we're in a unique
position right now because of technology
that our brains are actually evolving
now evolving or I guess devolving
depending on which way you look at it at
an extraordinarily high pace or
something like that you know yeah the
the rate of change across almost every
sector in the economy and in human
experience right now is higher than it's
ever been
could you say that about any moment in
history maybe but the rate of change
itself is changing right as well right
so that's the important distinction
right and what is going on with
technology is completely untested and so
this is this is a place where you know
why why am I so certain that I'm still
on the left even though most of the
people who say they're on the left
publicly I don't have any interest in
continuing to talk to them because they
don't seem to be making any sense
I look at systems that are involved that
are that are in stable state because
they've evolved over millions tens of
millions hundreds of millions of years
and my instinct is don't mess with that
until you really really understand
you're doing and so for instance I
unlike many scientists I'm not feeding
my children GMOs I mean I give them and
myself organic food and when we meet
which we do a lot of I want that meat to
have been fed the grass of its and the
food of its ancestors mm-hmm what are
what exactly is the harm we now know a
little bit of this but twenty years ago
if you had asked me what's the harm in
feeding cows grains so I have no idea
but I know that messing with a system
that was working is more likely to
interfere with something in that animal
than not mm-hmm why you know why would
you mess if you could not and of course
there are economic reasons to mess but
the the don't mess with systems that are
working until you really have a saw an
understanding of what the what the
effects are going to be the the use of
the precautionary principle pretty
widely yes is what puts me pretty far on
the left but systems that we created
that are evolutionary but people don't
know that we need to regulate in order
to get them under control because
nuclear energy isn't going to regulate
itself and habitat loss throughout most
of the world is not going to regulate
itself so there are some problems that
we've created and that are bigger than
individuals can do anything about and
you know that's why I'm not a
libertarian Yeah right and this is this
is where I think we have a I get it like
I don't know that if you just leave
everybody to do whatever the hell they
want all the time that everybody isn't
going to be doing all sorts of awful
things I think generally the market does
fix some of that but I get what you're
saying like these systems are I suppose
often precarious in nature to to the
point where anything could be tilted one
way or the other and then then we've got
bigger problems right so how do we how
do we fix some of this stuff how do we
how do we actually scale this back I
mean I get it you know most of my
audience will get okay well we have to
keep talking about it sure we have to
wake more people up sure but what can
you do
using the the knowledge you have and the
study you've done I have less I have
less insight right now at least to
answer in this amount of time for the
adult systems but I think I have a fair
amount of clarity on what we should do
should be doing with children and with
parenting okay
really really not doing which is when
you say the adult systems you mean like
economic systems well it's just like and
and more specifically how do you get
adults who are already who they are to
behave differently it's it's less clear
to me what what we can do and okay so
will will shell them for the purpose yes
and you know and the cyst is also also
it's true that I have that I'm not gonna
wade into for instance what we should do
a better economic system here now when
you I might do it later but yeah okay
but with regard to for instance you know
most most people I think have never
thought about what childhood is and if
you don't have children yourself and
you're an adult okay maybe you don't
have to maybe it doesn't matter like
maybe it just doesn't matter to you but
if you're a parent you need to think
about why it is that we have literally
the longest childhood relative to life
span of any organism on the planet this
is a feature this is a way for us to
learn how to become humans we are not
and this is this is a point the Brett
has made very often we're not playing
slates but we are the blackest slates of
any organisms on the planet we we are
more software than hardware and so what
we're doing for these first I don't know
11 to 25 years of our lives right now in
just four days I think but depending on
culture you know when do you start
calling yourself an adult in the Ronis
what we're doing is learning how to be
human and we're learning how to be human
by directing supposed to be learning how
to be human
through instructor direct instructional
by our parents through observing our
parents through observing our siblings
through interacting with including
fighting with our siblings and having
them smack us down both sometimes
literally but definitely metaphorically
when we do stupid things and better yet
if our parents have lots of adult
friends around and they have lots of
kids and there's a whole mess of
humanity that we are learning from and
then we're also in that very long
developmental period supposed to be
learning from direct physical experience
of the world so the example I like to go
to here is
you know the Roadrunner cartoons when
Wiley coyote
scoots his way off a cliff mm-hmm and he
doesn't fall until he realizes there's
nothing below him it's funny right like
it's really funny but of course it's
funny because we know that gravity
doesn't really work that way right
increasingly I suspect that a lot of
kids and now into origin and and some of
the younger Millennials kind of aren't
sure like they were protected so much by
their helicopter parents and they were
behind screens rather than having real
experience and to the extent that they
played sport it was totally regulated
and overseen by adults and they didn't
have any free time to go and get
themselves into trouble and maybe even
like burn something down or hurt
themselves or break an arm or whatever
it is and learn from it that they
arrived at the cusp of what should have
been adulthood totally unclear on what
that's supposed to mean does this
absolutely to you because as I'm hearing
you say that this is might the bell
going off in my head man I've been on
tour Peterson for the last six weeks
everything that you just said there is
basically what he is saying he is trying
to I sense that what he's trying to do
at the most personal level yeah he talks
about society as a whole but at the most
personal level he's trying to retool
young people it's not even retool he's
trying to give them the tools in the
first place that they clearly should
have gotten before so that's what's so
fascinating to me because it's like how
did this happen right how did how did
this happen and you know we can point to
we can point to pharmaceuticals being
given to kids to make boys less boy like
and to some degree to make girls less
girl like you know give great let's give
speed to boys so they'll sit and face
forward and learn what so they'll come
down what do rough and tumble play and I
mean that's insane yeah and at the same
time let's give anti-anxiety meds to
girls and SSRIs and and you know just
just the model of schooling is
ridiculous you know we have we have
schools that have gotten rid of recess
because recess is dangerous and when
everyone who has ever been in school
even if like me you
happened to have been a good fit for the
model of schools that you were in which
i think is pretty rare actually knows
that you also need to have time to get
out there and play and move your body
and experience it and not have it being
overseen by some adult who's decided in
advance what is and is not safe for you
to experience so you know one of the
things I used to say to my students in
advance you know I did a lot of team
building and like actual team building
and planning with them in advance of
these long study abroad trips we would
have spent weeks together on campus in
advance of going on these trips but what
I wanted to do before we left was
established with them what's your
relationship with risk how do you how do
you view yourself your relationship with
risk and we would do this in around like
and I would answer the question too and
you know I would say to them actually I
happen to love risk I will I am the
leader on this trip but I will keep all
of you safe but then I'm gonna go do
things and you know I like I am going to
walk alone in the forest a lot and do
things because it happens to be one of
the ways that I find my consciousness
that night that I find my truest self
and I don't expect any of you to do that
also but you need to be comfortable with
the fact that your leader is going to be
doing that sort of thing and one of the
other things that we would talk about
was you know what's your relationship
with comfort you're gonna be
uncomfortable you could have to you know
just because you can say in advance
you're okay with the bugs and the mud
[Music]
joining me is an evolutionary biologist
formerly of Evergreen State University
who is now a professional professor in
exile Heather hi and welcome to the
Reuben report thank you for having us
dance professor in exile I believe that
is in your Twitter bio it is I believe
it is in your husband Brett Weinstein's
Twitter bio yeah we generated just
together is that gonna be the title of
the co-authored book when the dust
settles on all of this stuff oh I don't
know I think both of us are both eager
to leave the Evergreen story behind but
still heartbroken that an institution
that we loved and still believe in the
educational model that it offered and
still believed in the students who got
great education was there for many
decades we we would love to see it
resurrected but it doesn't look like
it's gonna happen yeah all right so this
is it's a little crazy to me that this
is the first time that we've met because
obviously our circles have been sort of
closing in on each other for for quite
some time so when when the whole
Evergreen thing happened and I only want
to spend a little bit of time at the top
talking about and then I want to do all
sorts of evolutionary biology stuff and
the other the other things that you're
really passionate about the story
obviously was more focused on Brett and
then he was sort of thrust into the
media and all that but this was a direct
attack on you as well and as you said
the institution that you loved and all
that can you just give me any sort of
recap or just pieces of it that maybe we
don't know that well or just her
perspective on what was happening there
well as briefly as I can leaving out
many many relevant pieces we got a new
president and the new president very
quickly got rid of a Provost who was
going to get in his way and spoke
publicly about his desire to turn
evergreen into the social justice
college that was actually on the record
early in George bridges tenure at the
point that the protests broke out a year
ago
now-ish he had been president for about
two years and a year before that had
broken out in equity
a desire to bring equity and inclusion
to the forefront which is which is
codewords it's dog whistles for the
people on the far left who are actually
interested in a reversal of power not an
end to oppression but an actual reversal
of historical oppression did you guys
recognize those things as dog whistles
at the time because as Brett said at the
time he considers himself or at least at
that time did consider himself deeply
progressive you just said to me right
before we started you still consider
yourself progressive yeah so did you
realize those buzz words and and what
they actually meant at the time
absolutely
I mean Brett actually I was on
sabbatical that you're most of the year
before this broke out is murder and why
I was disappeared from the story I said
as I went onto sabbatical Brett I will
continue to read everything you want to
send out to these lists but I am not
engaging I am doing my own work now so
about a year actually a year to the day
before the protests broke out the first
announcement of the new plan came came
live and then and there and for the next
year Brett was I was a little bit a
couple of other people who are a little
bit standing up and saying this doesn't
smell right this this feels like this is
actually about something that we're not
talking about and furthermore if we are
actually interested in improving the
fate of various demographic groups these
processes are not going to be the way to
accomplish them so we were saying that
Bret mostly was saying that a few others
of us were saying it and was there any
sort of understanding of that point of
view privately yes
privately yes people were scared and
when in fact when Brett used the phrase
culture of fear on campus what came back
at him was you have to prove that
there's a culture of fear or else
there's not one and you know show me the
people who aren't standing up or else I
will know that they they don't exist
which is you know it's baffling yeah
right it's it is obviously an improve an
unprovable statement to say there's a
culture of fear and I'm not going to out
the people who have come to me
they're scared as I actually am going to
honor their privacy but if if everyone
who had come to us privately and said
this is nuts and it's got to stop
had stood up it would have been a
totally different outcome well that's
the culture of fear summed up right
there right okay so without rehashing
the whole thing can you just tell me a
little bit about sort of how your life
has changed throughout this and sort of
you know look you and Bret you guys did
settle it wasn't for a ton of money at
least in my humble estimation but I
think you probably wanted to just put
some of this behind you but you guys are
professors and I saw you if you have
kids and family and all that stuff and
just sort of sum up kind of where you're
at at the moment yeah so I mean we had
we've been living in Olympia for 15
years the the college was an amazing
place to really do a deep dive in
community with students and so you know
Bret and I had done one and I had done
several long study abroad trips in
Panama and in Ecuador with pretty large
groups of undergraduates taking them
through the Amazon through Galapagos we
spent time in the field in Washington
State in the San Juans in Eastern
Washington took people places where not
only we were studying evolutionary
biology and animal behavior and field
techniques and statistics of the
philosophy of science but also coming to
know each other such that after you
after you break bread with people for
days and you play ultimate with them and
you sit around a campfire you come to
understand that when they disagree with
you it's not inherently coming from a
place of hatred or personal animosity
and so that trust that we were able to
create in our classrooms which both of
us love to doing allowed us to
effectively then rip the intellectual
rug out from under people when they made
claims that weren't falsifiable or
couldn't be it couldn't be justified
once you started to ask them what the
assumptions were they were underlying
their claims that was that was an
amazing gift and I don't know that
really almost any other educational
model out there allows for that because
it required the time to build community
with students which was which was
wonderful so yes we lost to tenure track
jobs along with our health insurance and
our retirement plans and all of that and
have two kids still in school so that's
alarming
but some of what we were doing in the
classroom we have begun to do on larger
stages and that is promising it seems
clear that the world is interested in
hearing how to understand systems from
an evolutionary perspective I knew that
was true from the 25 or 50 students that
I had doing the deep dive for every
quarter every year for years it's not
that surprising but it is heartening to
see that that is the response of many
many people out there in a weird way
does it almost feel right then that this
happened I mean I know it's kind of
sucky and again with the salaries and
tenure-track positions and all that but
that the message that you guys are
talking about seems so relevant right
now you guys are now doing more public
speaking gigs I'm dragging Brett on
stage with me to do stand-up and all
sorts of crazy things are presenting
themselves and then the sort of the rise
of this new alliance of whether you want
to call it intellectual dark web or
whatever you want to call it at this
point but there is this sort of
interesting crew of people with a lot of
different feelings on a lot of different
issues with all sorts of different
disciplines coming together and maybe if
you guys were still at university in a
traditional sense you wouldn't be able
to be dealt in the way that you are now
I think that's possible I think there is
both a way in which having gone through
the looking-glass having gone through
the direct you know to borrow a phrase
from the far left but the lived
experience of actually being at the
center of a mob at the center of riots
and then watching as the world the
mainstream media and others tried to do
a public relations spin on it and tell a
totally different story
to live that and to watch the
institution that you love to become
totally disloyal to you and to watch
many people whom you respected hide you
can't don't see that it's valuable and
the fact that we're sitting here talking
together and that many of us in you know
the intellectual dark web and in this in
this bigger group are are speaking and
saying actually the culture of fear that
is society-wide
is real and so I'll say the the first
time I met my students after
November 2016 election after Trump was
selected evergreen it's a very left
place Olympia is a very left place
pretty much everyone on campus had that
glazed eyes slack-jawed look that people
in most progressive enclaves will be
familiar with from that time from those
few days right
myself included even though I was no
Hillary fan but I didn't see that
outcome coming and I certainly didn't
vote for Trump I am we got to class and
my co faculty whom I admire greatly just
preceded with her lecture on horse
evolution and I'm looking around the
classroom going no one here cares about
horse so she ended a bit early and we
had lab a couple hours later and before
she let them go I said hold on if anyone
wants to stay this is no longer class
but if anyone wants to stay I would be
happy to lead a conversation about what
just happened yeah what just happened to
our country and about 40 of our 50
students stayed well skip their lunch
hour again we went right to anatomy lab
that afternoon from from this
conversation and what I said to them was
do not for a minute believe that racists
and sexist elected Trump think about how
many times you have had to censor
yourself on this campus when you had an
opinion that was even slightly different
from the accepted dogma and that
conversation not only brought life to
the room but afterwards I had several
students come up to me some of them in
tears telling me stories about one of
them had lost a job on campus for
speaking an opinion that was not
accepted one of them had an another
story of another friend who'd lost a job
others talked about their self
censorship and that and all of these
people again were for left not that it
should matter but these work even people
who were conservatives or who held
conservative views so that that is the
larger culture of fear that is hardly
restricted to Evergreen but is
society-wide that we are that we are
speaking about and that people are
responding to because in you know at
Google at Starbucks in cubicles in
campuses but far beyond campuses
the country and across the weird country
is at least this is a problem well the
irony to me is that I think that all
that I'm doing is talking about these
things often with people who have a much
better
pedigree than I do but by me talking
about it it's giving room for other
people to talk about that's all that
they want well you're also you oh you
are also providing ways into the
conversation I think so there are a lot
of people when confronted with you're
not allowed to think that say oh god I'm
not actually sure how to respond I
haven't I don't know I don't I don't
have the linguistic skills I don't have
the analytics behind me I don't know
what I'm supposed to say here and so
just listening to to you and to sam
Harris and the Jordan Peterson and to
Brett and to Eric and to me and to know
many many others I believe begins to
give people a sense of not only is this
doable these are good reasonable smart
people who are being respectful and what
they're saying but also it's not just
tools it's actually like freezes it's
you know this is what you can say these
are the things that sort of things that
you can say in response that are still
respectful and don't reject the humanity
of the person on the other side but do
reject the argument it's interesting it
almost shows that what you guys
obviously were doing so well at a
university level that's exactly what's
needed at a societal level now talking
about the language the language to get
these ideas across is so important I
wonder is there a evolutionary
explanation for a little bit of what has
happened here with the left like the way
they've sort of closed off ranks and
then purged everyone because it's just
as I sit here with you it's like the
idea that you and Brett wouldn't be
enough of whatever it is that they want
is so bananas and yet it is true so is
there some way that you can explain that
coming from the discipline you come from
well there's I think this is not going
to be a particularly deep point but it's
it's basic in-group out-group dynamics
and we will always we will not get rid
of of tribal thinking we will not get
rid of our sense of you know you and I
are aligned right that's that's a good
thing there's a way in which there's a
kind of tribalism there even though we
just met for the first time today you're
not and
and we definitely have political
differences and I'm sure which we can
talk about if we won't happen right so
we end but but that isn't the main thing
like we're aligned and I you know I feel
walking in here like you've got my back
and you've got my back and I think
people especially raised without much
experience with the physical world and
raised often in situations where they're
being given a number of pharmaceuticals
early on that are disrupting development
arrive at what should be the cusp of
adulthood and aren't sure how to
navigate aren't sure how to navigate the
waters and so when told oh if you just
agree with everything if you just become
an ideologue and go in lockstep with us
you can be with us so you know identity
politics is appealing because it
provides an instant in-group if you will
only subjugate yourself yeah and you
know identity politics on this side
begets at Annie politics on this side of
course because anyone who shows up here
and is told no you don't have enough of
what the progressive stack tells us you
need either you can totally subjugate
yourself or go over there well of course
we're going to get a rise over here and
back and forth when people criticize us
whoever this is for not focusing on that
identity politics enough the the one
that the secondary one that you're
talking about here which is the identity
politics of the right which is either
which is based in actual racism or or
you know there's a white at no state or
ideas that are so the antithesis of the
American experiment it to me they're
they're ridiculous and have no real
real-world traction it's almost like
we've created this bogeyman because we
need it they've long since been just
like what no no almost no one thinks
that way anymore sorry no well so what's
your what's your best argument against
that well people say well you're not
focusing on that enough because because
everyone wants everything to be equal
all the time so if you're focusing on
the identity politics the left which
clearly many of us see is I mean I truly
see it I've been saying this and I
really believe this I view it as the
greatest existential threat to Western
democracy that there is I believe that
if there's something that would cause us
to be on the streets like killing each
other I think it's that we're will have
broken off and all of the commonalities
will disappear but what what do you
is the best argument for what you're not
focusing on that one enough because I
see that a lot now right I think I think
two things one it's not as big a group
right the the white nationalists to the
extent that they exist and they do are
better armed by and large than than the
far left but numerically they just don't
exist in the same numbers and they don't
have the kind of play they don't have
the kind of cultural reach that the far
left does and so that's the second well
I guess there's three points a secondary
point then is everyone can walk white
nationalists that is completely
acceptable and in fact demanded that you
do when those sorts of ideas come up in
conversation whereas the stuff on the
far left increasingly it is demanded
that you not using so there is that's a
key right there right so like we are
saying no actually we must we must
disagree with this just as much as we
should just as much as culturally we now
know it's a norm to disagree with what's
on the right we the far right it should
become a cultural norm to disagree with
frankly the cryptic racism and sexism
and you know and everything else that's
happening on the far left it is it comes
packaged as if it's anti-racist and
anti-sexist and all it's just it's
racist and sexist against the other
group it's it's a flipping of the the
tables of oppression so I would say the
third point is for me anyway as someone
who has been on the left my whole life
this has changed this experience is
going through the looking-glass in the
last year has not changed my values but
it has changed what I understand about
how people are using language to make
other people out to be things they're
not yeah so you know I no longer believe
in a massive alt right for instance
right right and you know the the boogie
men that are out there that you're not
supposed to do things like talk to Fox
News
mmm-hmm sorry no actually we should all
be exposing ourselves to to the media
across the entire range and for me on
the left it's actually my job much more
so than to go after people who I have
nothing in common with
to go after the people who claim to have
values that are similar to mine but I
see that they are actually achieving
goals that are different yeah and that's
why I love this conversation and I don't
get tired of it because we're all in on
it
at different levels we all have
different realizations at different
times along the timeline and it's like
for me that's where I'm free for two
years I kept saying I'm of the left and
that's why I want to fix this
I don't think realistically anymore I
can honestly say that I think I have
more in common certainly with
libertarians and I find him I find an
intellectual openness with conservatives
that I just don't find any more on this
other side and I know there's yet I know
there's some people you just spoke at
heterodox yeah you just spoke at
heterodox Jonathan hates been on the
show I think he's doing wonderful work
there's obviously people like Brett and
like Eric and and Steven Pinker and
plenty and Sam and plenty of other that
exists still as sort of a sane left but
I see that just being whittled and
whittled and whittled away and that
doesn't mean the fights not worth taking
it maybe it means it's the most worthy
and before we start discussing
philosophy and the human soul house
money has to work hi it's wonderful to
have this forum here I'm so excited I
actually started with a dinner we had in
Atlanta and the idea of bringing Dave
and Jordan Peterson here came about and
actually happened so I'm just gonna
introduce not take too much time of the
people standing here sitting here sorry
I'll start with Jordan Peterson dr.
Peterson is a professor at the
University of Toronto was nominated for
the prestigious Levinson teaching Prize
when he was a professor at Harvard and
is regarded by his current University of
Toronto students and colleagues as one
of three truly life-changing teachers

intellect international speaker and a
public personality Dave Rubin mr. Rubin
is a talk show host comedian and a TV
personality is the host of the Rubin
report a talk show about big ideas and
free speech
they've has been heralded for his person
but it politically incorrect an honest
approach to discussing complex issues
and current events focusing on politics
religion and the media dr. Ian Brooke is

and co security of the Iran Society he's
a co-editor of the companion to Iran in
the Blackwell companion to philosophy
series welcomed those for and one word
about the person who made it possible
generous board member of the INA
Institute and thank you to high ground
sorry high road productions for making
this happen so here we go
all right so first off to begin we are
live-streaming this on my channel and as
I'm sure many of you guys saw I was on
Joe Rogan's show a couple weeks ago and
we talked a little bit about objectivism
and he said that you guys are very
serious people that you're you're very
serious people so I need you guys to go
absolutely bananas for the thousands and
ultimately hundreds of thousands of
people that will be watching this at
home can you make some noise
look at you guys you crazy Objectivist
alright you're such an when you're such
a negative influence babe I've never
seen them like this last night last time
I didn't event with you guys we had the
whole audience screaming out George
Carlin 7 dirty work
that's true I don't know if we're gonna
do that at all ok so we're gonna do
about an hour and a half with you guys
and we're gonna throw in some Q&A it's
obviously completely uncensored and in
the spirit of free speech and
individuality that you guys are talking
about here at this conference
so Jordan we've been on tour now for
almost two months and we have a little
break right now but I thought why don't
we just dive right back into all the
things we've been talking about so much
of your your tour for your 12 rules for
life book has been about the role of the
individual so before we get too deep in
into philosophy and and some of the
other things I thought that would be the
right place to start because that's sort
of what unifies all four of us up here
yeah well I've been making the case I
suppose or or developing the argument
and this is an argument everybody knows
to some degree although I don't think
we've done a very good job of
articulating it over the last few
decades that you know it's it's no
secret that our free societies or the
free societies of the world are
predicated on the idea of the sovereign
individual right and that's that's the
that's the place where political power
ultimately resides or let's say
political authority but and it's also in
some sense the derivation source of the
idea of rights the fact that the
individual is sovereign the individual
has inalienable rights and we talked a
lot about rights in our society and way
too much as far as I'm concerned not
that they're not important but they're
secondary because the fundamental issue
of import with regards to individual
sovereignty isn't rights it's
responsibility I mean first of all you
could make a case that your rights are
my responsibility and vice versa
so there's a parallelism between rights
and responsibilities but even more
importantly if the intake
the state is dependent on the integrity
of the individual and and and that's the
argument that's implicit in the idea
that the individual is sovereign then
it's obviously the case that the
individual has a great responsibility
and it's a responsibility that's of
Incred incredible importance because
it's not just limited to you it's it's
you you acting responsibly actually
constitutes the bedrock of the state and
so so that's an interesting issue it
means that you're required in some sense
to take responsibility or the entire
state will shake and I think that's true
for everyone but more interestingly I
think this is a more interesting
argument in some sense is that you need
a meaning to sustain you through life or
you need meaning perhaps not AB meaning
you need meaning to sustain you through
life because life is bitterly difficult
and and and and an ultimately
challenging mortally challenging for
that matter and you need a meaning to
sustain you through that so that it
doesn't embittered you and turn you into
a victim let's say and it's pretty
obvious to me and I think obvious to
anyone when they think it through
that virtually everything that you
derive genuine meaning from and I mean
the kind of meaning that will sustain
you when times are difficult I don't
mean casual happiness even though
there's nothing wrong with happiness
what the the meaning that will sustain
you through the tragedy of life is
always to be found in the adoption of
responsibilities and the people that you
admire spontaneously and I don't think
there's an exception to this unless
you're a little on the psychopathic side
and I mean that technically you you feel
I do I mean I mean it technically it's
like it's a hallmark of psychopathy I
would say generally speaking you admire
yourself to the degree that you do when
you're at least taking care of yourself
at least that and maybe when you have a
little responsibility left over for your
family and maybe some to spill over for
the broader community and certainly the
people that you spontaneously admire in
your in your fellow men are people who
at minimum our accounting further
for the burden of themselves at minimum
that but then who have excess capacity
and devote that to the proper care of
their family in their community and so I
don't think that we've done a good job
of laying out the meaning equals
responsibility equation and it's it's
vitally important and I think it's very
helpful for people to learn that lots of
people have told me that that that you
know that they've been getting their
lives together and digging them out of a
selves out of a nihilistic and hopeless
hole and doing that by understanding
that the meaning they need to sustain
them is to be found through the adoption
of the maximum responsibility they can
sustain and so well that's that's become
clearer to me over the course of these
last let's say 50 lectures so Greg I saw
you nodding along there a lot can you
put some of this within an Objectivist
frame yeah well I mean not to plug but I
gave a talk that actually the event that
I met you act called taking
responsibility for your happiness I
think I have a bit of a different view
of happiness and you do and and Rann has
different when you then you do where
what I mean by happiness isn't the
transient joy or emotion you could feel
in a moment but the the state of being
the state of emotion that comes from
accomplishing achieving your values
having taken responsibility set yourself
goals and leading a life where you're
achieving those goals over time and I
think that's what ethics is about I
think that's what gives meaning to life
and I a really deep part of that is
taking responsibility for yourself I
would I a little bit bristle at the idea
of saying that responsibility is more
important than rights or the reverse I
think they're they're issues that come
up at a different tier so I think taking
responsibility for yourself as a matter
of ethics it's a matter of how you live
your own life it's a matter of how you
lead a life worth living and be happy
and have meaning I think those go
together but then rights are the
conditions that we need when we organize
as a society to make everybody able to
do that not to be in front impinging on
each other and if we don't all value our
own lines and happiness if we're not all
taking responsibility or at least if
many of us aren't we're not going to
have a society
cares about rights and they're gonna go
away and so in that sense I agree we
need to have this shift to talking about
ethics and what we want to make of our
lives each of us yeah I mean when we
talk about the individual I think one of
the points that needs that's important
to make is the individually supporting
partially because that's all we got
right in a sense all you got is
individuals we can talk about society
but society is just a collection of
individuals it's starting point both in
ethics and in politics has to be the
unit of value the unit that actually
exists the metaphysical value the unit
that exists not the abstraction that we
call the state or society what's
important is the ability of the
individual to live a good life to take
responsibility for his own life his own
happiness for his own success for his
own flourishing so the individual is is
is everything when it comes in my view
in morality and and and and then as an
extension in politics and I think rights
are the concept that recognize that is
it's the bridge rights of the bridge
between a morality that says your moral
responsibility is to make the most of
your life and then what kind of
political system should we live in Kent
should we live in to make that possible
and rights recognizes that the enemy of
the good life the enemy of flourishing
the enemy of success at living is
coercion and force it's it's the group
the states the the community are the
people other individuals cursing for
being authoritarian over you telling you
how you must live and how you must act
and rights recognize that as individuals
we have freedom we must be free to use
our own judgments to live our own lives
as we see fit and and that's the great
revolution of the Enlightenment is is
the recognition of the sanctity of the
individual and creating a political
system that allows the individual to
flourish and to thrive by protecting him
from coercion by protecting him for
force and and relegating the state to
that duty the responsibility of the
state is
patek rights to protect you from force
so it seems to me that the battle
between the individual and the
collective is a battle that has been
fought for virtually every Society for
all time however there does seem to me
at least and maybe it's just because I'm
alive right now and doing what I do that
there's something unique about the
battle at the moment that the individual
has been slammed so relentlessly and
that we have ideas out there now that
for for young people that they think
that socialism is cool I mean that seems
to be coming back right I mean these are
these are ideas that I think are really
crazy but I'm happy to indulge in in the
discussion about them do you think
there's anything unique about the the
battle between the individual and the
collective right now or is this just a
repeating of what's gone on I think I
think it's before I think I mean there's
always something unique about each
historical moment but I I think this is
this is been a continuous argument for
the last hundred and thirty years like
as a technical philosophical argument
and and of course it has roots that go
back much farther than that I don't see
I mean it is collectivism versus
individualism I think the fundamental
polarizing force that's that's it's
that's at work at the moment and the
issue with the collectivist types is
whether or not they're collectivist
because they care about the dispossessed
which is their fundamental claim or
whether they're collectivist because
they don't want to bear any of the
responsibilities that would go along
with being a responsible individual and
you know I'm always skeptical of the of
the saint-like moral claims that are put
forth by people who are pushing and
given ideology and now I'm skeptical
about that on my part two of the people
who criticized my perspective say look
dr. Peterson you're not or maybe they
call me something a lot less they say
you're not you're not you're you're
you're under estimating the degree to
which systemic barriers make it
impossible for people to move forward
properly in the world there's there's
barriers to the progress that people can
make even if they bare individual
responsibilities and those barriers are
distributed unequally and of course
there's some truth in that because
every system tends towards rigidity and
tyranny and no system does a perfect job
of selecting among its people for pure
competence but there's a difference
between saying that a system is somewhat
corrupt which is certainly the case with
Western systems and the system is an
absolutely corrupt tyrannical patriarchy
with no hope of redemption whatsoever it
needs to be burned to the ground and
reformulated those are really different
and you know it's it's also possible to
be sensible and say well look I mean
obviously the manner in which people are
selected for success in our society is
imperfect but also to know well
imperfect compared to what exactly like
to your hypothetical utopian perfection
which you would self generate if you
were given ultimate power because that's
really the comparison or to our
societies in the past because we're
doing a lot better now than we were or
compared to every other society that's
ever existed since the dawn of time by
which standard we're doing so insanely
well that it's actually almost
unbelievable and and this is another
thing that I've been trying to promote I
mean there's been at least a dozen books
written in the last six or seven years
by fairly serious scholars and I would
say distributed across the the the
political spectrum pointing out that
like ever since the year 2000 things are
getting better so fast that it's
actually a miracle you know and I can
give you some quick facts so the rate of
absolute poverty in the world fell by by
50 percent between the year 2000 and
2012 so that's a staggering achievement
it was three years faster than the most
optimistic projections of the UN so we
actually beat in optimistic UN
projection so there are more well that
submits absolutely beyond belief there
are more forests in in in the northern
hemisphere now than there were a hundred
years ago the child mortality rate in
Africa is now lower than it was in
Europe in 1950 which is just beyond
belief the fastest growing economies in
the world are in sub-saharan Africa
about 300,000 people I can't remember if
it's a day or a week but it doesn't
matter although it would be better if it
was a day obviously our being plugged
into the electrical grid so increasingly
people have universal access to fresh
water there's almost no country in the
world now where starvation is a problem
that isn't just a political problem
which is to say we have enough food for
everyone and not only do we have enough
food we have the distribution systems
that are actually getting that food to
everyone it's absolutely beyond belief
and what's what's quite remarkable about
that is it's quite obvious that
individually that like that free market
systems predicated on the idea of the
sovereignty of the individual are the
reason that that's happening so
so the question is what the hell are the
collectivists up to yeah why are they
like what's the problem here and the
problem the problem seems to be a
certain amount of ignorance a certain
amount of willful blindness and a
certain amount of discomfort with the
fact that a fair bit of that wealth has
been purchased at the price of a
continuing inequality we don't know how
to generate wealth without also
generating inequality and I actually
don't think that you can generate wealth
without generating inequality and that's
well that's something that's worth
endlessly discussing I think you're
allowed might have a little sign to say
about it yeah I mean I like to say in
brief write inequality is a feature of
freedom not a bug it just comes with
freedom you're absolutely right you
cannot create wealth without any
qualities and there's nothing wrong with
inequality there's nothing bad about
inequality there's nothing I've modeled
the offensive about inequality and in
particular given that what happens is
that everybody's getting richer hmm
everybody gets rich so they just get
rich at a different pace and the reason
they get rich at a different pace it's
because they're producing different
quantities of value the people who
actually get very rich in a free market
now we don't have a pure free market and
all kinds of problems with the system we
have but in a free market you only gain
those values that you produce Jeff visa
says that we is the richest person in
the world because how many of you shop
on Amazon everybody right so there's a
reason he's produced values that have
affected almost every human being on the
planet and and that's that that is why
he you know you're so wealthy so if the
whole inequality debate is is to try to
drive people towards envy the whole
inequality debate is to try to undercut
the the idea of freedom because what
they're really after is not would you
see inequality what they're really after
is eliminating freedom it's the same
people who used to advocate for an
ideology of communism or socialism now
that's been discredited so they have to
call it something else
Joe Stiglitz
the Nobel Prize winner in economics is
not gonna come out for communism but in
a sense he views that as the mall ideal
you can't get there it's rough there's a
little to violence too much blood for
his taste he's an economist after all
right so so inequalities are nice
disguise so we want to reduce inequality
and might debates with people who talk
about any quality say about how much
well well know when we get there who oh
now who gets to decide how we gonna vote
how much are we gonna take and why why
just monetary inequality I mean babes a
good-looking guy it's a lot of it's a
lot of hairspray man I mean how do how
do we how do we do that how do we you
know they've been experiments in trying
to equal us in the book we give the
example of course of the tragedy of the
horrific tragedy of Cambodia in the
[Music]
[Music]
alright here we go guys I got a Peterson
I got a Shapiro I got a Weinstein I got
a Reuben I feel I should go to you first
because using the Canadian yeah that's I
saw that movie was pretty bad
alright you're you're on real time
tonight and I thought that it's an
interesting little piece of all of this
because we're sort of all out of the
mainstream but we kind of dance in there
every now and again you probably dance
in there a little more than the rest of
us
you're gonna smack around Marv tonight
or what you know I think that it'll
probably be pretty pretty cordial I mean
I think that Marv is secretly one of us
now maybe I'm wrong but I think I think
that Marv is tired of the I mean his
show was called politically incorrect I
mean I think that he is tired of the
identity politics I think he's tired of
the intersectional nonsense I think that
he wants to have some open conversations
I just think that he is he's tied
politically the left so I'll be
interested to see how much of that he
goes after you know how much Trump talk
there is which I find utterly
uninteresting is that are and how much
of them will be about kind of broader
issues of freedom of speech and and
civility and having decent conversations
I think that he's on the right side of
those issues I mean I've played him on
my show right and I disagreed him on
everything politically but I play clips
of him on my show specifically on those
issues and him cracking the whip on
people on the identity politics nonsense
and I think we're on the same page there
well if he wants to be an effective
advocate for the left he should lead the
March and dissociating the moderate left
from the radical unreasonable left
someone's got to do it because the
strategy that they're abiding by right
now is pretty damn self-destructive and
he's in a good position to do that and I
think he's motivated to do it because he
is a free speech guy being a comedian
and everything
it's risky I think I think you take your
life in your hands if you're the leftist
she says that right now if you're the
person on the Left who does this I mean
you didn't survived but you but that's
I'm retired from the left that's right
you know so you you found it you found a
bunch of new friends right I mean that's
that's really what what people have to
understand is that when you when you
take these positions yes there gonna be
a lot of people who decide that you are
Satan but there's gonna be a whole lot
of people who are your new friends who
are ready to have these conversations
which is why you know again this sort of
IDW determinant that Eric coined is so
fascinating because everyone disagrees
with everyone about nearly everything in
this group but because we don't want to
shut down the conversation it's created
this whole audience for every one of us
like each one of us our audiences in
creased tremendously just by being part
of conversations with one another so
that's that's it to me what is it you
guys think about us and this wider what
I do just the awesomeness of the
amazingness and all that but like but
like minded people we just happen to be
the examples that are sitting here that
it is for all the differences that we've
talked about on gay marriage and
abortion and death penalty and all of
these things that I know we all have
various disagreements on why are we all
okay
with that and so many people outside of
this seem to not be okay well I think it
has to do with the fact that most of us
are confident there's a sort of a
principle of faith in rationality that
I'm not that worried about a lot of the
things that the far left is very
concerned about because I have an idea
that more or less if you do the reason
correctly the reason incorrectly
everything is going to work out pretty
much okay and I think that we have the
dexterity in changing our minds
admitting them when we're wrong when
we've changed a perspective and stealing
each other's ideas and and giving credit
so that I have a sense that if I'm you
know Ben and I have not gone toe to toe
on abortion for example and I have an
idea of the outlines of his position he
probably has some idea of mine but my
guess is is that he's not going to go
bananas on spermicide and I'm not going
to be advocating for the right to abort
a child a day before it's due date and
except for extraordinary circumstances
and well and even then I'm not sure but
I think what it is is a certain kind of
confidence that you can allow the other
person in a discussion to actually have
a genuine position and that you can
contend with it and what we need to do
is to push out more of the cognitive
Lego that gives us that confidence to
more people so that they can say I don't
need to fear the disco you know
pro-choice and pro-life or both really
limited positions in my opinion and it's
just an example of one of many things
that we have we have gained the
confidence with each other that we it's
not going to devolve into name-calling
if everybody plays in an honest fashion
and uses the full capacity
that's where it is I mean the honest
fashion things I think what counts I
asked Sam about this earlier says just
doing podcast Sam right because we all
hang out together got really seven
people lunch with his mother was more
important than us but you know what what
I asked him about this and what Sam said
is that he thinks that what what has
changed is that there's there's a bunch
of us who are not interested in the
stupidest version of the argument right
so if if if I want to hear an a a
pro-choice argument I want to hear the
most sophisticated version of the
pro-choice argument then see if I make
an argument against that I don't want
the simplistic version of the pro-choice
argument just so I can knock down the
simplistic version of the pro-choice yes
it makes for a great Ben Shapiro
destroys video but it's more fun for me
like personally I really much more enjoy
engaging with the best ideas that
somebody else has to offer then engaging
with the the worst ideas that you can
pick out of a hand what's really well so
I mean one of the things that was useful
for me for example in this portrayed
discussion with Sam is that my arguments
my arguments are better now than they
were and you might say well why do you
care if your arguments are better and
the reason I care about whether my
arguments are better is because I know
that my arguments are part of the
toolkit that I use to operate
effectively in the world like arguments
aren't just some abstraction that you
hold that's disconnected from your
actions in the world and if my arguments
are more fine-tuned and sharper and if I
am able to and to account for a wider
range of phenomena because someone has
put forward facts that were hard for me
to incorporate then my toolbox is much
more efficient and I can operate more
effectively in the world so I find it
well it's a it's a variant of your
position it's like I want to hear the
best versions of the arguments that run
counter to mine because I'd like to
figure out where I'm wrong and I'd like
to make what I'm doing better and that's
more important to me it is literally
more important to me than making sure
that what I already know is right like
I'm confident in what I know but I also
know that I could do a better job of
expressing it that it could be it could
be the system could be more dynamic it
could take more think more things into
account like I've got plenty to learn
and a real discussion with someone who
objects to you that's where you learn so
so I think apparently I would say that I
think there's pretty easy test which is
when someone catches you out on a part
of the argument that you've made that
you that you know was flawed and someone
catches you out do you smile or you get
angry right thing it really is almost
that easy because the truth is that
there is something fun about the idea of
having to rethink your position and
something adventurous about the idea
that you haven't thought everything
through that there are these new vistas
of thought that maybe you haven't
considered before and it does hone you
it makes you better at it and it also
allows you to listen life is funny and
it's funny that we're flawed human
beings that our logic is flawed so
there's certain humors the idea that
somebody is exposing a rift in your
thinking that you now have to deal with
it's well we like fun if you if you were
just a stone all the time it would be
really boring we kind of got there cuz
when we did the abortion discussion my
position basically I think is similar to
yours which is that at 20 weeks where
they've shown that the fetus can feel
pain that to me is the cutoff I describe
myself as grudgingly pro-choice but you
said to me well if you're acknowledging
that it's a life at 20 well then it's
obviously in a life at 18 now to be
completely cogent in my argument I have
to concede that point to you it didn't
it didn't move me to tell you that I'm
gonna now agree with you on this on what
the policy should be but we can do that
and we didn't punch each other after and
and it's alright it wouldn't you know
and then what if somebody comes in and
says well you know life or not life is a
boolean and the problem is in computer
science is one of casting which is if
you if you make it afloat and you're
talking about the degree of life or the
meaning of the life or the quality of
the life does that change things and so
you know this idea about may I break
your frame well I'd prefer if we stayed
in it for a little while but then let's
explore that in a second and so there's
sort of a generosity of spirit argument
and I think that quite frankly one of
the strangest things about this group of
people is that I find it spectacularly
non-ego ik in terms of when we have a
dinner I don't have a sense that anybody
needs to lead I mean it's as close as
I've seen like a round table where the
sheer pleasure of talking to people at a
time in a time this is a McCarthy like
time
and we have I feel so happy to be at a
table in which I can talk about things
that are troubling me or bring out
something I worry that says something
negative about myself that I'm having
these thoughts that nobody wants to be
booted out of the group by virtue of
grandstanding and I think that that that
kind of it's really interesting watching
people who would be thought of as being
highly ago.if behaving in an ongoing
fashion it's all I think that part of
that too is one of the things Dave and I
have talked about and the technology is
enabling this is that because I've
looked at this group and thought well
why in the world did it ever get
categorized as a group because it's a
strange group and there's some there's
some reasons pretty much everybody who's
in it is entrepreneurial in the
fundamental sense and that everybody's
created their own little domain and it's
kind of hard to knock them over because
they're in their domain so we're not
reliant in some important sense on
external funding let's say to to to to
enable us to continue so that gives us a
certain amount of freedom but another
part of it is that as far as I can tell
everybody who's participated believes
that their audience is intelligent and I
think that that's also a reflection of
that it's it's it's not lack of
intellectual self-confidence it is lack
of commitment to your set of ideas as
long as if they're axiomatically true
but that spills over to the attitude
towards the audience like I don't feel
that I'm there to tell my audience a
bunch of things that they need to know
that I already know when I'm conducting
my tour it's like well here's a bunch of
ideas that I'm confused about still and
I'm going to use this as an opportunity
to explore them and I'm gonna explore
them with you and you guys are going to
come along for the ride and that's going
to be good for everyone I really saw
that with Harris in Vancouver because we
had a well as high level of an
intellectual discussion as we could
manage and I would say it was
approximately at the same level as a
good PhD defense when when the defense
is going well and the audience was with
us the whole way and they're
participating in this discourse process
far more important to participate in the
process of discourse than to specify the
outcome and the audience had made that
decision and abided by it while we were
while we were doing this I think that
that's that is the difference between
yeah I think that's why like Joe Rogan
for exam
it's so popular when I listen to Joe I
know he's going on an intellectual
journey that's going to take three hours
I don't know where the destination is
gonna hurry but I know the returnees
gonna be a lot of fun yeah but I think
that that's that's what makes for
success in this in this field and so
much of our politics so much of our
intellectual life has become what you're
talking about standing on a stage and
people yelling at you what you ought to
think if you're a good person
it's no fun Joe does the same thing that
great authors do it's like a distinction
between Dostoevsky inane Rand it's like
you know we're round is going to end
right from the beginning whereas if you
read a dusty esky novel you have no damn
idea where that's going to come out and
neither did he so he was exploring the
ideas and formulating them as he went
along
and that's true art and now that is what
Rogen does is that you know and and he's
very good at that because he's a smart
guy who isn't afraid of the fact that
there's a whole bunch of things he
doesn't know and so he can lead people
on that journey and the journey is more
important than to use a terrible cliche
the journey is more important than the
destination
I think Maria's a tiny time we have to
get on to other points but the one thing
I would add which is a dangerous idea is
that I think there is a concept of good
diversity and bad diversity which is not
understood in the general population
good diversity is when you have a
collection of people with different
ideas and they're somehow complementing
each other and checking each other and
people are backing down and seeing
things that they wouldn't have seen
because you're walking around the
elephant from all the different sides
and seeing all the different components
bad diversity is something like two
people grow up in different countries
one one drives on the left side of the
road one drives on the right side of the
road and the idea that you decide that
everybody should be able to drive on the
same side of the road that they grew up
on and so instead of everybody getting
to a really interesting panel you've got
a lot of auto accidents and nothing
really interesting happens and so I
think it's very important to be honest
that there is a lack of diversity about
what constitutes conversation and I
think that that's a very troubling thing
because we there's no precedent for
discussing bad diversity at the moment
which is I would much rather listen to
to theologians talking and building up
some high structure and to
atheist astrophysicists talking about
the same thing than having two
conversations of an atheist and an
astrophysics where each of them keeps
tearing down each other starting
assumptions and you come back eight
hours later and nothing has been
achieved but does that kind of explain
your success in a way because probably
four years ago when conservatives were
basically only talking to conservatives
the way the left seems to only be
talking to itself these days you started
doing a little of this and I would
venture to guess that you probably in a
way feel more comfortable with this crew
who you disagree with on a gajillion
things then probably when you're hanging
out with just a bunch of conservatives
that you're like yeah we all agree on
this stuff my name is you know I think
that the the idea that I the fun
conversations are the ones where you're
surprised and I think we have yet to
have a group conversation or even a
conversation one-on-one because we all
talk you know one-on-one to each other
to wear something surprising doesn't get
said and that makes everything a lot
more interesting and fun too right now I
gotta say everything is so boring like
for all the chaos everything is so
boring because it just it breaks down
into a truly you mail order it really it
really is just everybody feels like
everything is spun out of control but
everybody's hunkered down in their own
bunker and so everything comes down to
Trump is always right or Trump is always
wrong and we're all supposed to revolve
around this this black hole that is
Trump or this Sun that is Trump and he's
the center of gravity I don't think most
people live their lives thinking about
these problems the whole Trump attack
and Trump defense thing is really dull I
mean when I went on Mars show there was
the YouTube part afterwards and the
panelists with the exception of me were
tearing Trump apart and I was sort of
watching that from the outside in some
sense partly because I'm in Canadian and
I thought well first of all it's just
not that interesting that you can list
Trump's faults it's like you and you and
my crazy neighbor it's like why you're
not bringing anything to the table doing
that it's too easy and then of course
the other problem is while by going
after Trump you're going after his
supporters hypothetically speaking and
of course that's 50% of your population
which turns out to be a very big
strategic problem for you you know now
and in the future so it is dull and and
and I don't I don't think people are
people would rather have a
a more interesting conversation that's
what we can offer to Sonu so that's what
I want where I wanted to take this how
do we I mean we we hit on this a little
bit in the first two hours but how do we
do that now how do we lay I think we're
already laying out a more interesting
conversation but how do we also lay out
something that doesn't make everyone
feel horrible because that is a lot of
what's going on here all these people
that are showing up to your events
they're going wow what a reprieve I mean
I haven't been able to do that
politically I wouldn't say I mean what
I've been suggesting to people is that
as intolerable as they find their lives
for reasons that are arbitrary and
self-inflicted there are things that
they could do at the individual level
that will make a radical improvement
they're difficult things there are
things that require the adoption of
responsibility and vision and the
willingness to to speak your partial and
imperfect truth but if you put that into
practice there is an OP now one of the
things that needs to be done in the
political sphere is to delineate what
that up might look like politically you
know to give people something that's
positive to strive for it well I
mentioned earlier that I see that to
some degree in the burgeoning literature
that's suggesting that many things
[Music]
all right people we are live on the
YouTube I've got the lobster and I've
got the hair it sounds like some sort of
70s guys that could that be a rock band
or is that like it could be some kind of
violent flick or a mafia movie or
violent rock band a violent rock man
yeah all right I've wanted to get you
guys together you two have never been
seen on camera before I think that's
true as far as you know I did appear in
front of Jordan but we never intersected
onstage at the Masonic when you decided
I should open when you mean harmonica
harmonica solo out of all the same
moments that we've had in the last two
months would you say that bringing Eric
Weinstein mathematician out on stage at
the Masonic to play the harmonica and
have 3,000 people give him a standing
ovation would that be the time yeah that
was good that was good it worked really
well too because he turned out he
actually could play the harmonica yeah
she's a good thing if you're going to
try it in front of 3,000 people I'd do
that first for me I didn't play in front
of a smaller crowd before that so I was
uh it was a bit of a it was pretty sweet
all right so good night yeah all right I
want to cover a hundred percent of new
stuff okay for the next two hours
there's a bunch of stuff obviously that
we've been hitting on on tour and some
things that we've been sort of catching
up on as this has all been going on so I
thought the place to start I think would
be something that I've been starting a
lot of the shows with when I go out
there and I do a little intro and I get
everybody going and warming up for for
Jordan the idea that we're starting to
win and when I've been saying win
there's a feeling in the crowd of like
whoa maybe all of this madness that
we've all been talking about for all
these years may be enough people have
woken up now that there is something
shifting so I've brought that up up a
bunch and you've sort of picked up on it
on a couple of shows and talked about
why winning isn't necessarily the way we
should view this or what winning
actually is so I thought that would be a
good place to to kick us off here well
it's like it's more what winning
actually is you know because one of the
things that has to be contended with in
the current situation is that
especially in the United States but also
in the rest of the Western world there's
a political divide Americans have been
voting 50% Republican and 50% Democrat
for for elections pretty much split
right down the middle and they're keep
there can't be any final victory by one
side over the other because everyone has
to live together so the victory is how
can we continue to live together
peacefully and productively and and and
and we have to figure out the pathway
forward to that but then I think there's
another kind of victory that it's deeper
than that that's on the horizon which is
that I think the narrative that
underlies our culture as a whole has to
shift and I started to think about this
when I was working for a UN committee
about five years ago I worked on a
committee on sustainability for the
secretary-general and I had a chance
with the people that I was working for
and within Canada to rewrite the
underlying narrative because it was very
pessimistic it was a real Cold War
narrative North against South and
capitalists against socialists and doom
and gloom on the horizon and it seemed
to me to be outdated really by about 40
years and I started to read a lot of the
economic development and ecology
literature and mostly what I found was
that things are getting better globally
so fast and on so many different
dimensions that it's almost
inconceivable and yet no one seems to
know that and in the aftermath of that
there's been about six books published
in the last five years that like
Pinker's book right but but but by no
means that's by no means the only book
detailing out a revolution in living
standard progress and and ecological
progress for that matter around the
world so I think there's two victories
to be held here to be had here one is to
pull us everyone out of the pessimistic
apocalyptic Cold War narrative that
enveloped us for four or five decades
and to notice that the future could
actually be bright if we were careful
and the second is to make sure that the
political dialogue in the West doesn't
polarize to the degree that we start
doing things that are fatally stupid
yeah all right so let's talk about the
second part first because I think that's
where we've really been for
seeing the political part so it's
interesting to note this fifty-fifty
divides I don't think that's a reason I
guess I have a strongly different take
and maybe it's the same we'll have to
figure that out to me the 50/50 mark is
going to more or less hold as long as
these two parties can calculate what's
the maximum they can what with the
minimum they have to give up to win an
election and so the key issue is what is
the 50/50 composition look like and
unfortunately what it keeps looking like
is the two parties becoming more and
more nightmarish in my mind and less
trustworthy so we the fifty-fifty
continues to hold but what it represents
is attention attention increases is
getting much worse so the key issue is
that those of us who are sort of Center
I mean I don't love the left-right
spectrum but let's just use it as
shorthand that the center left and the
center right have to see each other as
our natural allies and the center left
has to clean house and get rid of the
nutty left and the center right has to
get rid of the far right and that's the
optimistic scenario I think winning is
incredibly important okay well that's a
good interesting way of conceptualizing
it let me go a little bit further sure I
think that we have to stop being
apologetic about winning and what
winning means winning means that the
advance guard of the radical Center has
to make this a safe and habitable space
again and so in order to do that and the
reason I you know try to focus mostly
most of my negative energy on the left
is is that it's my responsibility to
clean house on the radical bad
progressive movement that is almost
certainly going to fuel the far-right
mmm it's not efficient for me to go
after the far-right because I mean if of
course I'm gonna be anti-nazi and it's
you skinhead right but well we've we've
talked about that a lot too because when
we do the events you know you all these
hit pieces that come out and we'll talk
a little bit about that well when they
say that your audience is all these
angry white men and all of this nonsense
which every night it is proven to be
it's like yeah you address that every
night talking about the bad identity
politics of the right but it's not
something that well believe the thing
that's strange and that ties in to what
what you're saying as well is that it
isn't obvious to me who the dangerous
right are you know it's obvious to me
who the dangerous laughte are because
they occupy the universities but it's
not just the universities this isn't I
mean this is so miss thunk if you will
that we have to really break the frame
and and re weave it so the journalists
keep saying oh you guys are focusing on
a tiny problem afflicting a few
universities that mostly nobody's ever
heard of yeah that's definitely not true
well the first thing is is that it
deflects the problem from the number one
problem isn't the universities its
journalism and so the idea is that the
journalists are saying you guys are
complaining about this small story in
the universities like no you're getting
it wrong we're complaining about the
number one story which is the sense
making apparatus having gone haywire and
if you think about these journalists
that we're now dealing with as like the
hermit crabs that have crawled into the
shells that we used to know right so
whether CNN or NPR or National Review or
whatever these structures are it's a
different group of hermit crabs the
shells are the same and the great danger
is is that if you recognize the font at
the top of the LA Times in the New York
Times you think you're getting the same
product but the product has become
radically different and there was a
problem back then I'm not saying that
there wasn't and you know of course the
issue is that when we criticize
journalists now they think we are
criticizing journalism far from it we
are praying for journals right we're
trying to feel ugly and the idea is is
that we are fighting this thing where
they've got their fingers so clearly on
the scale that everything is being
tipped and what you're getting is a more
distorted reality there's some point at
which and we have to talk about what
happened with I don't know how to
pronounce the best yet regenexx and
medicine right the idea that doctors are
creating a created a huge amount of the
harm Don found in hospitals
well many lawyers are the fourth leading
cause of death
right so now we have to talk not about
yet regenexx which is the you know that
which originates from the healers but
journey genex which is what is the harm
done to the truth by journalists and
that is so I have a technological slant
on that to some degree because one of
the things that I think is happening
because I've watched large organizations
degenerate because I've worked as a
consultant for a lot of years now it's
really interesting to see how fast a
large organization that you think is
semi-permanent can disintegrate it can
happen while certainly within the span
of a couple of years and sometimes a lot
faster he's not yes well and I think one
of the things that seems to be happening
to me is that as television dies under
the weight of YouTube primarily but
let's say online video and perhaps also
podcasts is that the the remaining
journalists the hermit crabs who occupy
the old shells which is a good way of
thinking about it get increasingly
desperate for attention and so they're
pushed by economic pressure in some
sense and situational pressure to
exaggerate the danger it's like and it's
a clickbait phenomena essentially and it
seems to me to be akin to what's
happened with with reports on the crime
rate so you know over the last 25 years
the five major indices of violent crime
have declined by 50 percent which is
absolutely sin in the United States
staggering decrease but the rate of
reporting of violent crime has gone up
substantially and so people think that
things are more dangerous now than they
were even though they're safer now than
they have been since the early 60s and
they were safer then than they'd ever
been in history so I think one of the
things and it's interesting to think
about the technological forces driving
this because YouTube and podcasts do
pose a fatal threat I would say
certainly to to to television and so it
makes sense to me that as the
journalists become less professional and
less in demand and their messages as as
is chasing a diminishing audience that
they're going to get noisier and noisier
about what's going on and the trick for
everyone else who's being immersed in
that is to stay sane and sensible while
the death throes play themselves out so
wouldn't you
actually think though that more of them
would start seeing this I mean what we
now see so clearly and that more of them
would be jumping ship or is that old
shell so tainted or corroded that
getting out of that thing well it's
almost impossible to do with systems of
selective pressure so Jordan raises an
excellent point that the dying throes of
an institution tend to be its most
violent because it's in go-for-broke
mode and it's not worrying about
tomorrow it's worrying about maybe serve
up you know buying another month or two
or right what right right there's
another issue of course which is that
the format's are set so that your news
comes to you in a form that is more or
less the same every day and so you know
how to consume it and so everybody
listens to NPR has a pre grooved
template in their brain I'm gonna get
the top stories at the top of the hour
then they're gonna be this many pieces
and they'll be like a feel-good story
and so you know exactly what you're
going to get and like here I don't know
what we're gonna maybe Jordan and I are
gonna come to blows I'm gonna we're
hoping you've got to change the drink
but but the other thing that is is that
in the system of selective pressures as
the business model fails you have a
fascinating phenomenon which people who
are willing to accept strange blends of
payment
so lower financial payment and security
job security but higher psychic payment
stemming from the idea that they are
crusading mm-hmm are going to start to
dominate so you're seeing many more
people who are willing to substitute
activism and the sense that they are
protagonists in a great story about the
resistance let's say yeah so that that
actually becomes more and more necessary
as the stability and and the viability
of the system degenerates right if you
could offer you know two hundred
thousand dollar salaries to good
reporters in short order so that they
could start families and buy homes and
have an easier life like one of the
things that you need to do is you need
to pay people more if you're unhappy
with them and this I think about
professors actually well sociology
professors have their salaries tripled
they'd be a lot less radically I learned
this from
New Orleans Police Department where at
some point they had corruption where
people were ordering mob style hits over
police radio and I think what happened
was that the new police chief came in he
said the first thing he did was raise
salaries mm-hmm and the idea being that
you have to have skin in the game thanks
to the see until evidence that phrases
proliferated thanks to the scene
wherever you are and you need to give
people something to defend and so it's
very important to pay the people that we
are decrying all the time yes your money
and say everybody who's listening should
go online and donate to quill its
patreon page yeah great words and
Colette is doing great well I'm saying
that we should we should try to figure
out how to get Vox more money as well
mm-hmm and we should try to figure out
how to get slate and salon and all of
these things so that you can afford to
pay people in ways in which they don't
have to take a large portion of their
payment as psychic gratification from
having felled imaginary dragon but just
to be clear there when you're saying
that you're not saying that the current
people who have screwed this whole thing
up deserve more money well you're gonna
find I can find I have a very strange
position on this which is in you know my
friend Peter Thiel and I talk about this
all the time his model is is that you
know at some level when the economy
isn't working people engage in this kind
of nonsensical you know fratricide of a
type and my point is slightly different
which is this this bad nature is always
there but it's like it a compromised
immune system when you when the economy
starts to fail you start to become aware
of all of the pathogens in the world
because it can't fight them off and so
it's it's very much the issue that if
you're the guy with compromised immune
system you're the only one aware of all
the pathogens in the world and so at the
moment our collective economic immunity
system is failing and I actually a much
more pessimistic than you are Jordan I
see lots of reasons to be happy about
the decrease in violence but you know
one of the problems with the accounting
in these theories is is that the sword
of Damocles that hangs over
heads you know his gana is has gotten
quite large and the number of threads
holding it up seemed very few in number
and so you have to do the potential
energy accounting as well as the
realized violence and also understanding
that the nature of income inequality and
differential access to financial markets
and technology is creating a lot of very
justifiable concern that the post-world
War two stability is constantly in
jeopardy and if we don't I I personally
think we should think about once every
five years above-ground nuclear test to
remind ourselves of what it is that
we've pushed underground and we haven't
seen for years because we are engaged in
some kind of magical thinking that the
world is fairly stable and that can turn
on a dime so what kind of out do you
think we could for this crew of
journalists that we're talking about
that we want to be doing more journalism
we don't want them to be attacked or any
of those things of course what is the
out so that I get it you can give me you
could fund them in a way that gives them
a little more breathing room but one of
the things that I'm seeing when we're on
tour is be everyone that comes up to me
after says well you just gave us a
little room - yeah I'm think yeah so is
there a way we instead of beating these
journalists instead of getting the wind
where you crush them so that they're
losers what's the way that we can give
them maybe a little well I mean it's
it's sort of standard behavioral
practice in some senses this is
something that was established by
Skinner a long while back even though he
used threatened punishment as ways of
altering the behavior of his
experimental animals he also used reward
but rewards a lot harder to use because
what you have to do is you have to watch
very carefully and then when you see an
increment in the behavior that you want
to want to promote you have to reward it
but it requires a tremendous amount of
attention and subtle attention and and
so one of the things that we can
certainly do and that I've been trying
to do to some degree with my twitter
account is to is to distribute good news
good credible news and good journalism
when I see it which is Martley why I
started to get engaged say with Colette
because I think they're doing a credible
job but
one possibility is to distribute those
pieces that seem to be increasingly
reasonable and another is to also leap
to the defense of people when they're
taken out as individuals and because one
of the things that's happening now is
that when an individual stands up and
says something especially that annoys
the radical left is that they tend to
get mobbed and taken out and that's a
bad thing it would be good if we could
figure out ways of defending people
against that yeah I mean brett has been
defended to some degree by the emergence
of this group of people that that eric
has been describing as the intellectual
dark web yeah and so there's some
strength in numbers there that might be
usefully applied can you just quickly
talk about that just on the personal
level cuz I think one of the most moving
things that I've heard on this show is
when I had you on and I think you I
think it was with Brett and you said
that standing with him was really one of
the most validating things that you've
ever done in your life and it's such an
example of what you've been talking
about on the tour that if you want to
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is
the former president of the ACLU a board
member for fire epic and the heterodox
Academy a professor at New York law
school and author of the new book hate
why we should resist it with free speech
not censorship nadine strossen welcome
to the Rubin report to be here Dave so I
have to tell you when I was reading
through your bio and looking at all the
boards you've sat on and head of ACLU
and all that I don't know that anyone
has ever been more of sort of a perfect
prime guest to sit in that chair and my
prior book defending pornography
attention we can get into that too but
really your your life's work is sort of
exactly why I do this show and I know
I'm setting you up now with a very you
know high bar here but but this is what
it's all about
well thank you so much and thank you for
your ardent defense of Liberty that that
is the most important value for me and
when people ask me what my politics are
I usually say I care more about my civil
libertarian beliefs than I care about
partisan political beliefs and one of
the things that's true for the ACLU as
well as for me as an individual is not
taking per se across-the-board positions
on any candidate official party or group
but judging on an issue-by-issue basis
and issuing criticism or or praise on an
issue-by-issue basis and there's not a
single party or candidate or official
that hasn't earned some praise and some
criticism on some important civil
liberties issues so looking at the glass
half full an activists I always do that
there's nobody with whom I don't share
some really strong convictions which is
very nice now it's also true that
there's nobody with whom I don't have
some strong disagreements but I'm used
to therefore having a positive
relationship across ideological divides
and and the absence of that or the
fading of that in today's climate is
very bothersome yeah all right what a
great
place to start this conversation then so
as you've seen that PHA that fade in
society do you have a couple markers or
moments where you started to really see
it or has it just been a slow slide into
wherever it seems that we're at at the
moment that's a really good question
Dave and I'm sure some sociologists have
probably analyzed it more exactly my
impression is at least on issues let's
stay with issues of free speech my
strong impression is that there started
to be a real breaking point in around
2015 I think that's when we had the
Ferguson riots and demonstrations and
protests around the country and I am
completely sympathetic to that cause
believe me abuses in the criminal
justice system have been on my radar
screen and the ACL u--'s forever way
back in the dark ages or some would say
the great ages of the eye I meant only
in the sense of old it wasn't a
stigmatizing reference but the Reagan
administration I used to debate his
attorney general ed Meese on
propositions such as is the criminal
justice system racially discriminatory
me so the fan I was taking the yes
profession so the fact that we have this
outpouring in support of social justice
and racial justice and immigrants rights
and anti-sexual violence all of that is
wonderful but starting several years ago
it started to seem more and more that
advocates of these causes began to see
free speech as their enemy rather than
what I know it to be which is their
time-tested essential ally so there was
this pitting of Liberty against equality
of civil rights against civil liberties
and as I say that I realized that it was
the second time that had had
and in my adult lifetime the first time
that that happened very strongly was in
the late 1980s early 1990s which was the
first time that hate speech codes were
proposed on college campuses the first
time we started seeing criticism of what
was called political correctness and
then two especially law professors were
arguing very strongly that you have to
choose you can't have both liberty and
equality and that's an anthem to my own
beliefs and experience yeah and that's
kind of where we're at right now that
seems to be where this argument has
boiled down to so before we unpack all
of that stuff how did you get involved
in this what was it about your education
or your upbringing or whatever else that
made you care about free speech civil
liberties everything else that you just
mentioned it as far back as I can
remember I have been in favor of
individual liberty and resisting anybody
who tried to encroach on my liberty or
that of anybody else's so long before I
had the terminology I resisted my
parents authoritarianism my
schoolteachers authoritarianism I was
kind of a contrarian I would always like
to see a different perspective and I
remember being very puzzled as a fairly
young student maybe I was about 10 or 11
years old and a teacher said to me Oh
Nadine why do you always have to defend
the underdog
she said it as a criticism and to me it
was well they're the ones that need the
defense
I have also always valued freedom of
speech for ideas that I disagree with so
I remember I was in college from 1968 to
1972 very involved in the movement
against the Vietnam or movements for
reproductive freedom that was before the
Supreme Court had decided roe v wade
again the reeling dark ages but I also
always defended freedom for people who
disagreed with me so I would have law
big arguments with members of SDS who
those students for Democratics
by a very radical organization that
wanted to shout down certain speakers
that were in favor of the Vietnam War
administration officials and so forth
and while I disagreed with the points of
view of those speakers I didn't believe
it that they should that we should be
denying them a podium so as far back as
I remember I've been I cared much more
about freedom in part because I do see
that as the essential means to advance
whatever other cause is dear to you it's
hard to defend the people that you don't
like isn't it it seems to me that that's
the one we're forgetting these days like
everyone screams about free speech all
the time
the second someone says I met alike then
they kind of get quiet real quick well
so I was shortly after I graduated from
law school the ACLU and I was not
involved at the national level at all at
that point but the ACLU got involved in
the infamous or famous Skokie case and
that was like a real litmus test I
assume most viewers know what that is
but for those who might not know in 1977
the ACLU came to the defense of the free
speech rights of a group of neo-nazis
who wanted to demonstrate in Skokie
Illinois suburb of Chicago that had a
large Jewish population and a large
population of Holocaust survivors and
many members of the ACLU
even this stalwart free speech
organization lost we lost about 15% of
our members who said we really defend
free speech but this is the one
exception we want to make for this
absolutely abhorrent speech now my
father is a Holocaust survivor I have to
say was sadly he died but it wasn't even
an issue for me I have to tell you Dave
and it's coming back to your question
because you said something about how
does it feel to defend people that you
disagree with and to me I'm
never defending them I'm never defending
their ideas I'm never defending what do
they say I am defending the principle
that government should not have power to
silence speech just because the majority
of the public even the vast majority of
the public loathes despises the idea
that the speech is conveying yeah so
that's incredible obviously I know the
Skokie case well and I'm sure many much
of my audience is I didn't realize 15
percent did you say 15 percent of the
membership ACLU members that's a massive
so and and you know it so the ACLU
really put its money where its mouth is
it was a tremendous financial hit and
there was a lot of negative press now in
fairness fairly soon after that the ACLU
began to recoup members maybe not
necessarily the same people in fact
other people who wrote in and said we
see that you really are neutrally
defending civil liberties even for
people that are anti civil liberties
themselves now that said I have to tell
you almost every time I give a speech
anywhere people will come up to me and
say I was an ACLU member but I quit over
Skokie Rea Nayar who was the executive
director at the time and interestingly
enough himself a Holocaust survivor he
was born in Berlin his extended family
was completely exterminated by the Nazis
he and his immediate family escaped and
and he wrote a wonderful book about it
afterwards called defending my enemy
which I quote in my book and we could
talk about how that might seem
paradoxical but it's it's really not but
anyway in this context I brought him up
because he said to me Nadine if every
person who said they left the ACLU over
Skokie really had been a member we would
have been
agent in the world right they were
talking a big game but there you go
but you okay if I can just follow up on
that it's it's not just an abstract
principle because you can really see how
the principle has concrete ramifications
for exactly the opposite idea
so in our briefs in the Skokie case we
pointed out that the arguments that were
being made to justify suppressing the
Nazis namely that their ideas were
offensive and insulting and threatening
and seen as dangerous to the Jews of the
Holocaust survivors in Skokie that was
exactly the same set of arguments that
was made not that much earlier in 1968
when Martin Luther King was trying to
demonstrate in Cicero Illinois the very
same state but with a very different
population that saw his ideas as
threatening and dangerous and subversive
offensive and insulting right and this
is where this weird subjective nature of
this comes in which is why you've said
several times now you're defending the
principle not the person and that that
of course is the is the key to this
whole thing but we've been pushed into
this place these days where it seems
like there's a large set of people or
certainly a set of very loud people who
think that speech is violent
it ain't violence well I suppose speech
could advocate violence it could incite
violence it could threaten violence so
do you say do you agree with where we
have the laws now in terms of you can't
directly incite and that sort of thing
do you think all those laws are just and
appropriate absolutely and I have to say
even though I've been teaching
constitutional law in the First
Amendment for decades the process of
writing this book and thinking about it
an even more focused fashion really
increased my respect for US law and I
really think that for many people if
they would just understand what the law
actually provides they would be much
more supportive of freedom of speech
because it is much more nuanced and much
more common sensical than is often
misdescribed when people say either Oh
hate speech is not free speech
we heard that a lot including when you
were at the University of New Hampshire
that a lot right and then conversely
people will say Oh hate speech is
protected and neither generalization is
correct yes I this fact that speech has
a hateful or hated message idea or
content can never be a justification for
censoring it but if in a particular
context a hateful message along with any
other message directly causes certain
serious specific imminent harm and
there's no way to avert that harm other
than punishing the speech then the
speech can and should be punished and
common examples that satisfy that
standard are intentional incitement of
imminent violence a genuine threat that
instills fear that you're going to be
subject to violence another example is a
hate crime and that is it's it's it's a
little bit different in the sense that a
and I'm going so much into Mike we're
gonna go we're going into the weeds but
that's good okay so if I can say there's
no term hate speech and that was a point
that you made in your university of new
happy when I said that and it's a fact
that is subscribed to by every single
Supreme Court justice across the
ideological spectrum you know from
Ginsburg and Sotomayor on the left to
Alito and Gorsuch and Scalia on the
right and I think that's a very very
important point that for all of their
ideological differences on so many
issues that so many justices every
justice in modern history has subscribed
to this principle and I wish that people
across the ideological spectrum in other
you know branches of government in the
general public would share that
unanimity because no matter who you are
no matter what you believe you really
have a stake in denying the government
and the majority of people that wield
power taking away
from you the choice about which views
you will express or listen to or refute
so in that University of New Hampshire
speech that I know you watched when when
I was saying there you know hate speech
is not real obviously I was making the
distinction between the direct call to
violence which I actually said unless
it's a direct call to violence but hate
speech in and of itself is is nothing
it's not a it's not a thing you can say
mean things I would prefer you don't we
wish we could all be nice to each other
and say lovely things that use pronouns
the way people wanted and all of those
things but you can have a government
doing it is there anything else that I
should have added in that that perhaps
could have gotten those young people to
listen I think that they were disposed
not to listen but fir'd there were
obviously some open-minded people in the
audience and those are the ones that
you're I mean the hecklers I think were
we're not they didn't seem genuinely
interested in hearing you out but many
other people there did and the other
point that that I would make
strategically Dave and I already did it
and pointing out the Martin Luther King
counterpart to the Nazis is I always
tried to give an example we're an idea
that you happen to support that the
person I'm talking to really supports
would be threatened if we gave that
power to the government so for that that
audience where you have people chanting
black lives matter I would have pointed
out how many government officials now
are saying black lives matter advocacy
should be treated as hate speech that
even saying that black lives matter
should be treated as a hate group the
Southern Poverty Law Center which
monitors hate groups has been lobbied to
treat black lives matter as such and so
then you have to say to people you have
to understand that it's not your values
that are going to be implemented by the
enforcing officials across the country
and if we have this loose nebulous
concept I mean hate is an emotion that's
inherently subjective what one person
considers hateful somebody else
cherishes yeah so you mentioned this
other poverty
Center I don't want to get you in any
hot water here but they to me strike me
as an organization that is completely
completely with almost no reservation
can I say this gone off the rails they
have you know between now they just just
in this last week they they lost this
lawsuit imagine Waze is getting a three
point three million dollar settlement
but they had ayaan Hirsi Ali and
Brigitte Gabriel and several other
people who I've had on the show who I
think are wonderful people on their hate
list they just put up a an article about
the evils of Prager University and and
called me out by name what am I to make
of the shifting of traditionally
organizations that were doing good work
into becoming what I would say are
really far left advocacy groups instead
of maybe the original mission statement
do you think that's not knowledgeable
enough about the instances that you cite
saw back to something I said at the
beginning which is I don't endorse or
criticize any organization across the
board I look at it issue by issue and I
think the Southern Poverty Law Center
has done a lot of good work on issues
that that I care about including freedom
of speech on campus and they definitely
oppose censorship including of hate
speech I testified with a leader of the
SPLC before Congress last year and
completely opposed to censorship
completely supporting counter speech and
in fact the SPLC put out a wonderful
guide for college students at the
beginning of the last academic year
urging them when white supremacist
recruiters are coming to campus not to
engage in disruption not to try to
censor them or to shout them down but to
ignore them
and I thought that was right not only in
principle but also as a matter of
strategy because you're just playing
into their tactics now does that mean
that every single thing they've done is
is is praiseworthy I doubt it I I think
even the ACLU is not above criticism
yeah so I know when when they sent over
some notes
about what what we potentially could
talk about your book and everything else
so because you did watch that University
of New Hampshire thing there's a moment
where a girl that was challenged me kept
implying that it was free speech sort of
that led to the Holocaust that it was
this that we they allowed in citement
and that that's what's led to it now my
basic argument was the more speech there
is the more we can allow sunlight to
disinfect bad ideas but I think perhaps
I could have been a little more forceful
there if you were standing next to me
when we were doing this what would you
have been saying in my ear to that
argument that if we just keep letting
people say all these awful things that
it can lead to awful things and awful
things obviously have happened
throughout the course of human I have a
lot of answers but let me start with the
one that is most specific to the
Holocaust and again I have a personal
stake and I know you also lost relatives
in the Holocaust for me my father
fortunately survived but he was in a
concentration camp and suffered
grievously doing forced labor and in
fact was scheduled to be sterilized and
then was liberated by the US military
one day before so you know I almost had
my life exterminated before it began I
have no love loss from of the Nazis in
fact there was there were hate speech
laws in the Vimal republic during in
which is in Germany where Hitler rose to
power and the hate speech laws were very
similar to the ones that exist in
Germany and other countries today they
were very strictly enforced Nazis were
prosecuted and convicted repeatedly and
guess what they loved it
it was a huge propaganda opportunity for
them they gained attention and support
that they otherwise never would have had
just like the neo-nazis in Skokie all
those years later nobody would have
heard of them if we had just allowed
them to have their miserable little
March for the 20 minutes to 30 minutes
think we're seeking to march instead it
becomes two years worth of worldwide
[Music]
alright so there does seem to me to be a
rebirth of a defense of free speech
starting again on the left possibly I
see a little southern happening I said
Jonathan Haidt at heterodox and some of
the other organizations you're involved
in and fire there is this group of
people kind of making a comeback on the
left I'm not so sure it can hold I hope
it can hold but what do you make of how
this sort of bounces back where
sometimes free speech is something that
the left holds more dear sometimes it's
something the right holds more dear and
it kind of switches as the decades
well my perspective and I'm not far be
it for me to pull out the age card but I
think I said a few more decades than you
have and and then it's been a constant
that was very well summed up by Nat
Hentoff whom you would have loved I
don't know if you ever crossed paths
with him but he was a great free speech
stalwart and he wrote a book whose title
really says it all freedom of speech for
me but not for the how the left and
right relentlessly censor each other and
he wrote that decades ago but it's
always been true that most people being
human believe in free speech in general
but those ideas that they hate or
despise or think are dangerous should be
the exception let's go back to Skokie
where ACLU members even 15% of these
die-hard stalwart ACLU members I'm not
surprised that the one exception they
want to make is for speech that's
denigrating civil liberties and human
rights but I had a friend who was the
executive director of the National
Coalition against censorship and she put
it so well she said Nadine everyone has
his or her Skokie
so at particular times I can tell you
for every year I can tell you this was
the one exception or maybe more than one
exception that liberals wanted to make
and this is the one that conservatives
wanted to make and I would say in
general you know like let's amend the
Constitution so that
is a crime to burn the American flag
that has been supported by many if not
most conservatives and by a lot of
liberals as well that and there's not
been I think that is the single most
hated expression in my lifetime because
no other expression has led to a
constitutional amendment coming within a
hair's breadth of being ratified more
than two-thirds of the Senate I'm sorry
if the House approved it came within one
one vote short of two-thirds of the
Senate and more than three-fourths of
the state's so all that's not that long
when was that maybe that was mid-90s
yeah something around there wow that's
incredible actually if you think about
it yeah where do you think Trump kind of
fits into the general discussion because
I say look it seems to me that there is
obviously some sort of authoritarian
bent to him that being said we're not
being people are as far as I know people
are being jailed because of free speech
at the moment do you think our
institutions let's say that his worst
critics his were right about whatever
they think about him do you think our
institutions at this point are strong
enough to ward off that kind of threat
and we don't even have to make about
Trump specifically but if there was
truly like a real authoritarian in
office do you think that the the way our
balance of powers and our separation of
powers works and again I would have to
say you know Trump has certainly done a
lot of saber rattling on free speech
issues and you know said that flag
burners should be deported but let us
not forget that Barack Obama was
responsible for the most stringent
enforcement of the Espionage Act and you
know pressing criminal charges against
more whistleblowers than all pre or
prior administrations added together so
again a pox on both your houses so far
the courts have been a wonderful bulwark
the flag burning example is is a really
good one it was a to Supreme Court
decisions joined by both conservatives
and liberals on the court that struck
down under the First Amendment
laws that criminalized desecrating the
american flag well the Supreme Court
doesn't have quite the last word a
constitutional amendment could overturn
it but I have great confidence that this
Court would continue to uphold what has
been called the bedrock principle of
freedom of speech and that is viewpoint
neutrality I summarized it earlier that
the mere fact that the viewpoint is
hated whether it be flag-burning or
whether it be racist speech that is
never a justification for censorship
again they unanimously endorsed that
last summer in a hate speech case yeah
let's slightly shift for a second so
when you were the head of the ACLU what
are the political pressures that you're
under that maybe the average person
wouldn't know from that from the
headlines like involvement with pop you
know politicians with lobbyists et
cetera et cetera so the ACLU was is and
I was personally involved in in lobbying
and testifying I still do testify before
Congress occasionally and I would say to
me it was a very privileged position
because we did not have to be directly
concerned about partisan political
pressures we could simply make alliances
and work with anybody that we thought
could support an issue that advanced our
cause even if we disagreed with them on
other issues and I remember to me it was
a great source of pleasure I remember on
one piece of legislation testifying
before the Senate Judiciary Committee
and the chair was Orrin Hatch and that
ranking minority member was Ted Kennedy
and they were both supporting this same
Pro civil liberties positions and I was
testifying together with the head of the
National Association of Evangelicals
and the head of the Mormon Church and
despite all of the differences on so
many other issues the fact that we could
make common concern that was on
principles of religious liberty and
freedom of thought and freedom of belief
that's what I feel is deteriorating a
little bit so last year I testified a
couple of times on campus free speech
issues and the bipartisanship had really
worn down even though the theme was
freedom of speech on campus and even
though the chair of the committee who
was Lamar Alexander Republican and patty
Murray the ranking member Democrat they
were both really solid and great on the
issue but the other members of the
committee just used it as opportunities
to trot out their own ideas of which
free speech was bad and should be
suppressed so some of the Republicans
were saying taking a knee by athletes
should be punished and some of the
Democrats were really saying Trump is
violating free speech and there was too
much political grandstanding right and
that's why far as critical as I am for
the left I don't want free speech to
become I don't want it to be a political
issue in the first place I don't want it
to be that the right which at the moment
I see more tolerance related to
diversity of ideas I don't want that to
be the home I want there to be a balance
otherwise we're just gonna end up in
that right well it may be a little bit
skeptical but I think that people tend
to be result oriented and that on the
right there may be much more support for
freedom of speech on campus because they
see that its views on the right that are
being squelch now in fairness I'll give
you a counter example many years ago
during this first surge of political
correctness on campus Mitch McConnell
let me play me and let me put it
backwards
it was Henry Hyde I'm sorry a
conservative Catholic from Illinois who
was completely on the opposite side of
the ACLU on abortion and gay rights he
really was so strong on campus free
speech that he sponsored a bill that
would have required all private
universities to respect the same free
speech rights that public universities
are required to observe under the
Constitution many people don't know this
Constitution only applies to government
including state universities but not
private university how do you guys feel
about well we've totally supported the
legislate Aryans and civil libertarians
my libertarian friends would say you
know keep the government out of it let
the private institutions decide and
there were exemptions for religious
institutions but basically I think
that's where I would fall on this so
sell me sell me your way it's a very
interesting debate and I can understand
but the person you know I've had this
discussion with my dear friends of the
Cato Institute for many many years now
what's the difference between a
classical liberal or libertarian and
civil libertarian I think that we are
less opposed to government regulation
when it is in the service of regulating
very powerful private sector actors that
for all practical purposes the way we
were talking about civil society earlier
can exercise coercive power that stifles
people's Liberty so so what if you you
know if you if if we did not have the
1964 Civil Rights Act then even the most
powerful large landlord employer
corporation private university or etc
would be able to discriminate on the
basis of race or gender under federal
law they still can on the basis of
sexual orientation I would view that as
something that could and should be
remedied through passing a statute
making that illegal hmm Richard Enda
well I think well first off I agree with
you your basic premise here just that
the idea level it's a great place for a
rich conversation yeah the idea that the
government would be coming in and
telling private schools even though I
understand what you're saying that they
would have to adhere to these codes even
if I being the First Amendment right
yeah I don't necessarily think a private
school should have to do that I just
think that ultimately the market would
just you either decide you want to go
there or don't want to go there this one
this one's definitely tough it's an
interesting one and I definitely can see
the other side and I certainly wouldn't
just on some exemptions certainly for
religious schools I think military
schools were also exempted but then I
want to give you another example of a
Republican that I worked with Mitch
McConnell works very closely with the
ACLU in opposing many people are going
to be surprised to hear this the
mccain-feingold law a campaign so called
campaign finance like a lifetime ago we
talked about a CLU very you know we are
the ones who argued Buckley versus Valeo
and arguing that the ability to spend
money in order to promote a message is
protected free speech and it should be
protected even when the speech is
engaged in by people who are organized
into a group and including if they're
organized in the form of a corporation
or a union or not-for-profit corporation
so some liberals are really distressed
by that position I think it's absolutely
the correct line anyway what do you say
to those those liberals or the lefties
who do get more upset about that in
general that you're just going to allow
corporations to endlessly pour money in
the system and manipulate the system and
that's it well again what is the lesser
of two evils would I rather have the
government telling corporations such as
the ACLU and Planned Parenthood and the
Sierra Club you name your favorite
left-wing so-called cause and it is
organized in corporate form and the ACLU
under that law was it would have been a
crime to go on the airwaves and by name
call on people who are running for
federal office and say you know repeal
the Patriot Act because arguing for
issues over the broadcast airwaves was a
crime under that law and spending your
own money to advance your own
issue-oriented message so I think people
are shocked when they hear what the law
actually did and are persuaded that in
at least some applications that went too
far
well McConnell became such
a supporter of free speech as a result
of working on this issue that he
actually changed his position on the
flag burning amendment he had been a big
proponent of it and as having seen how
important freedom of speech was
including for what two liberals is a
very controversial form of speech namely
spending money in the political process
he said well you know I've got to stick
to principles here and we should not
amend the Constitution to outlaw another
controversial expression so I thought
that was a really wonderful idea of not
just being result oriented toward your
own ideological concerns but seeing
their overarching principle and
following it it's almost like if you
actually have the debate you might
change people's mind and be surprised to
your allies suddenly are is there any
country that is protecting these rights
better than we are now for as screwy as
our system may be no well let me make on
sexual expression the United States is
much more repressive than European some
many European countries but like in what
regard you mean with yeah so we still
have I mean not only sexual expression
but four-letter words I mean thank
goodness we're not broadcasting because
I still get bleeped even when I say
whatever you are you're all seven of
them okay well and and when one of them
appears and I'm not even sure if this
was one of these seven but the
draft was upheld as of in a very
important free speech case it by the
United States Supreme Court and this is
a case that has ramifications for hate
speech as well but I cannot describe the
facts of that case on radio or TV and
the another country and we still have
anti obscenity law I mean let's not
forget that the brouhaha about the the
wardrobe malfunction at Super Bowl I
mean
it's so we're much more puritanical but
when it comes to political expression
there's no country that gives as much
protection as we do including for
hateful racist speech and misogynistic
speech including for defamation
you know defamatory falsehoods about
public officials and public figures and
that's why there are so many libel
lawsuits that are brought in the UK
against what would be clearly protected
speech in this country yeah but you do
believe in our libel laws here yes I you
know I I'm sure I would want to trim
them back a little bit but on the whole
we're quite protective so if it's a
matter of public concern or public
official or public figure you get quite
a bit of leeway you can't be held
culpable unless you have acted
intentionally or recklessly and I think
that's correct and one of the time
they're pretty specific yeah one of the
things that that Trump wanted to do as
he said was to reform the libel laws to
make it easier for a public official to
to collect damages and you know a lot of
people say oh come on Nadine Britain and
Germany and France and Canada and
Australia you know it's not as if they
are to tell eteri in authoritarian
countries but if you read the examples
in my book of the kinds of speech that
are being punished even with
imprisonment even with criminal fines
and that's the tip of the iceberg
because for every punishment there is
there are countless numbers of of
self-censorship
incidents it would really make your skin
crawl give examples no matter what your
ideology is you should find something in
there that you would say oh my goodness
I can't believe it so you know France a
couple of years ago criminally convicted
the head of a gay rights organization
for calling the head of an anti gay
rights organization a homophobe that was
considered to be hate speech now
fortunately she wasn't sentenced to
prison but she was subject to a very
stiff fine
$3,500 and and and then you think what
are the ripple effects of that yeah
have you guys tracked this case with the
comedian in the UK who had the dog oh
yeah a salute yes I mean again like it's
like all right first up he was making a
joke there's no there's no exception for
humor or satire when the new online hate
speech laws went into effect in Germany
on January 1st the first person
convicted or charged under it was one of
the leaders of a right-wing party not
surprisingly but the very and then maybe
the first two that were charged were
from that party but the very next one
was a satirical magazine that was making
fun of their statements mocking them
ridiculing and and and and these laws by
being so subjective can't make the fine
distinctions between humorous satire and
straightforward advocacy yeah so my
audience knows I'm not big on the the
globalist ideas here or even the UN I
think it's mostly a forest at this point
but do we need some sort of internet
Bill of Rights I mean this is a new
phrase that we're that seems to be
popping up over the last year or so that
will uniformly protect people in other
country from via for their ability to
say things that are uncomfortable online
and be able to tweet things that you
know you can't say in Germany but you
can't say in the United States I I think
we have to do that on a
country-by-country basis and I am
pleased that there are advocates in
other countries that really strongly
support freedom of speech including for
hate speech I keep putting that in their
quotes because it as I say to that
person at the University of New
Hampshire no there really is no such
thing and by the way there a lot of what
they said to you some people would
consider to be hate speech too so that's
another argument that you could have
made my one regret is at one point when
she said to me I said something about
losing Holocaust family members from how
goes on both sides and then later she
said they're rolling in their graves
over what I'm
I mean try to think like if this if
we're really if we're really gauging the
offense meter yeah I assure you there
was nothing that I said in those two
hours that was more wildly offensive
than that but do I want her jailed
because of that I mean of course not
yeah so I really was heartened at how
much support there is for the American
approach we're often attacked as being
American Exceptionalist and it wouldn't
bother me if we were the only ones in
the in the world that were defending our
free speech principles as long as that
is the right thing to do but it's
interesting that other people having
seen despite the good intentions of
sensorial laws elsewhere how they are
leading to results that no thinking
person should accept and handing over to
these online so here we get to this
question again I'll put it this way Dave
what's the lesser of two evils to allow
these private agglomerations of power
Internet companies decide pick and
choose whose speech is allowed and who's
not and enforcing their own concepts of
hate speech or pornography or
permissible or impermissible nudity to
pick just a few examples that they
enforce would I rather have them have
that enormous power or would I rather
have the government say no we're gonna
check your power to restrict other
people's free speech rights and to me
that's a very difficult yes so that's
okay so that's exactly where we were
before with the universities and that's
where I would say ultimately right now
[Music]
all right we are live on YouTube people
I have just returned from touring with
Jordan Peterson I went directly to Joe
Rogan and now we're gonna do a show
joining me today is neuroscientist
best-selling author and mysterious man
of Internet controversy Sam Harris
welcome back to the Reuben thank you
thank you how is that for any tro for
you mysterious man of internet if it
works as well as anything else in my bio
hat you seem to be somebody that wants
inner peace and yet constantly involved
in these endless i do enough to screw
that up it seems for reasons that i
can't figure out but is that a
scientific test for you possibly well
you know i've just i don't think we've
talked about this but i've pulled back
from social media to a big degree yeah
that is a variable that i mean i
obviously I'd heard that advertised to
me as a problem and yeah I had thought
about it and the abstract is a problem I
know you've gone you know off the grid
for a month or something but just I mean
I I've cut down
I was never using Facebook as anything
other than a publishing channel I never
got into comments on Facebook but I got
hooked by Twitter as you know and I'm
probably spending five minutes a day on
Twitter at most I'm just it's just a
surgical strike on Twitter just put
something out see what's there read a
couple article you know just find links
to articles that interest me so I mean
it's still a way of getting news but to
not to fundamentally not only not engage
but not even know what's going on on
Twitter has been a total reset of my
brain I mean it's it's a it's been
amazingly toxic in a way that I never
appreciated so yeah so I think my
audience knows my feelings on this that
it yeah it's endlessly toxic yet at some
level it's helped to connect all of us I
mean we originally connected through
Twitter these things kind of morph and
changing moments where they're much
worse and then suddenly they're much
better they also help you know help
start revolutions in the Middle East so
it's like not all evil but are you
afraid a little bit of getting
disconnected oh yeah they're like if you
know that you'll miss some of the
zeitgeist well I'm definitely missing
stuff
yeah and I'm I'm still trying to use it
strategically so I'm trying to use it in
precise
the way you just described with there
trying to get connected with people I've
reached out to somebody who's this woman
diakon who just did a documentary I want
to get her on the podcast I tweeted at
her I haven't spent enough time looking
to see if she's even noticed so it's
like I'm not totally paying attention
but the benefit has been just immense
because they I just realized I that is a
kind of it's a kind of hallucination
machine where you begin to think you
need to pay attention to certain voices
that in the real world you would never
see and they and I'm agnostic as to
whether or not these voices are in fact
consequential and you could sort of lose
sight of how your reputation is
unraveling online and you know just
start getting phone calls from friends
saying sorry that's happening to you
which i think is you know that's
happened to some people but yeah you
know for in my experience I maybe
there's some exception to this but
virtually all of my kind of substantial
controversial engagements on Twitter
where I've noticed somebody go after me
and then I've responded and then I
either I've done a podcast in respond
whatever that whatever that the however
that's propagated in my life
the net result has always been like
you're getting back to zero if you're
lucky yeah right it's like the whole
thing is a confection of having been on
social media in the first place and
you're lucky to get back to zero and I
mean the truth is someone like you movie
can name the you know the none of these
people exist in the real world I know
like like I mean they're not it's a you
know and I would never see them just
read in the New York Times for the most
part I certainly never see them in my
life and now it's just it's very strange
to feel like because someone had said
something about you on social media or
you know lied about you or spread an
article that was terrible about you
whatever it is that you then have to
somehow engage and and people you know
right like you know who was it
most recently Robert Wright just wrote
this you know idiotic Wired piece about
me right it's just like there's there's
not a single sentence in the piece that
needs to be responded to yeah I get
inundated with by people think well
listen you really got to respond
this is this is you know interesting and
substantial and it's nothing of the kind
it's like it's his attempt at clickbait
it's his attempt to provoke a some kind
of controversy between us on one of our
podcasts he reached out to me so I just
wrote this about you you know I hope
you'll come on my podcast or I'll come
on yours to talk about fishing yeah and
it's just it's a completely disingenuous
and insubstantial thing and yet paying
attention it is a kind of meditation
it's like it's you've become what you
meditate on yeah become what you pay
attention to and so checking Twitter 30
times a day or whatever I was doing just
built a new mind for me which I you know
I know I'm very happy to get rid of so
yeah I don't know I don't know that I'll
ever get totally off it because for the
reasons you suggest but I mean I I've
cut it down literally by 95 percent yeah
so I saw the interview you did with that
CBS News about a week or two ago and you
talked about how it's kind of making us
all crazy oh no that was an Australian
that was was that Australia's ABC in
Australia yeah so I saw that and you
said something about how it's kind of
making us all crazy and it was making me
think to your point just now that it
seems like we're almost living in two
worlds at the same time right now like
if you walk around staring in that thing
like I'm travelling a lot now so if I'm
like at the airport like I'm looking at
this thing you almost get disconnected
from the actual physical loop oh yeah
you totally do you start ending up in
some alternate world and to me that's a
little bit sort of where we're gonna end
up with with AI with all of these
they're all gonna kind of collide into
one thing that we're gonna end up in the
matrix or something like that yeah well
and you can be buried on your phone
obviously without being buried on social
media so you know I have taken it off my
phone which is a huge the kind of
gatekeeping function but what do you
know about how it changes our perception
of time because that that's actually
where I was gonna start with you because
we just figured out so the last time you
were on the show was July of 2016
basically two years ago which is crazy
and it sort of seems like yesterday to
me and yet it also seems like like 18
lifetimes ago and I think that maybe has
something to do with social media
changing the way we perceive time or so
think well I don't know I don't think
it's just social media I think it's just
I mean it's everything everything is
conspiring to make time go faster it's
you're getting older just the the the
the increase in novelty and just change
its that we have we're seen changes in
culture and technology that are clearly
accelerating so the world is different
over the course of more different over
the course of the year then it's ever
been I think that's that's objectively
true yeah but also yours getting older
so that every year is you know that much
less a piece of your the life you've
lived you know if you're if you're 40
you know at the next year's is 140th of
the time you've been around and then you
know that becomes 150th and so it's
subjectively shorter and yeah I'm a year
for me is like four months long now and
just yeah they just blast by so there
are a couple things I want to hit on
here we'll do a little bit of politics
and but I do want to talk about
consciousness and I want to talk about
your upcoming talks with Peterson and
obviously I've gotten to know his my
pretty well at this point inside
information that I should have at this
point I might I might be able to offer
you a little something and I think maybe
we can set the table for how many events
you do anything we're doing for we're
for the only of four we've spoken about
others but I think four is certainly
enough to see whether we can we can do
this so the funny thing it might be
three too many it might be for too many
you'll find out but the funny thing is
that I didn't know until I mentioned to
him last night when we were in Atlanta I
said oh you know I have Sam on tomorrow
is there anything on your mind that I
could bring up that'll sort of set the
table for this whole thing I didn't
realize that you guys have actually
never met in person know which having
listened to the two podcasts we have you
know you did on computer or on skype or
whatever that that podcast thing you
used that's kind of crazy that you guys
haven't actually sat there and just you
know looked in his eyes and not on this
does that feel weird to you that you're
gonna do all this publicly in that way
no well I've done a bunch of events with
people I've never met you know where
it's a podcast guest or you know some
what I'm sharing the stage with for the
first time and so I've actually I've I
know him better than several the people
I've recently done live events with
I've spoken him on the phone once and
we've done this to podcast so yeah but
yeah no it's it's obviously not optimal
to be having these conversations well it
selects for different things I think
there are people I think it's I think
Terry Gross of fresh air will never do
anything face-to-face I think she does
all of her interviews in even if you're
in Philadelphia I could could be behind
I think she just likes this or the
purity of the pure audio and it could
because the product is audio there's no
video component to it and I understand
that in the sense that if you're having
like it so so if we were just doing an
audio podcast now I mean now as a just a
pure audio podcaster I'm sensitive to
this you and I are having an experience
now we're looking at each other we have
various cues we know we have a sense of
how the conversations going yeah and
which can be misleading you because if
the final product is just audio you can
think there's stuff coming through which
isn't coming through and so when you
don't have any of those any of that
information and you just got the other
person's voice on the line you have a
very clear sense of what you're getting
and if you're not getting what you want
to be getting then you modify what
you're doing in some on some level so
yeah so yeah it's working for me but I
think it's as far as establishing
rapport with someone it's definitely not
ideal so and we've had moments where we
we could have used more rapport probably
yeah all right let's shelve the rest of
Peters head until after what what do you
make of this whole thing somehow the
conversations that we've all been having
often completely independently of each
other right I mean you haven't been here
for two years I've suddenly become like
the zeitgeist thing like you know Barry
Weiss wrote this intellectual dark web
article people think we have a card and
there's a clubhouse and the whole thing
as far as if there is I haven't been
invited right but that that whatever it
is we're all doing the conversations
you're having and I'm having and Rogen's
having and this whole crew of people
seem to be doing something that was very
needed at some level or another yeah
well I think we there's certainly a
diversity of opinion within this group
or
pseudo group about what's going on here
I mean we as you know we have not had a
meeting where we've agreed that you know
what about what this is yeah but is
anything we've had a quite half a
meeting where we disagreed on it yeah
and early that yeah and and did you see
Eric one signs video about just what
what this was and that and it's like so
a hundred percent of what he said on
that video was never anything that he
said to me or that you know it's like
this you know this is how he coined the
phrase in his own mind yeah why I just
brought him up onstage in Tempe at the
improv the night before and I think he
was high on comedy and just like I'm
gonna talk to people right right and so
I'm at da and everything he said very
interesting yeah and as you know I I
love Eric he's fantastic but here he
coined the phrase
on my podcast I think in on earlier
podcast but then it was reiterated in
this a live event we did with Ben
Shapiro right you mean that was odd cast
yeah and I no exaggeration I thought for
like 15 seconds about what I was going
to title the podcast it was just it was
just you know so it was a it was it has
always been tongue-in-cheek and if a
fairly superficial analogy for me and
but it but an interesting one in the
sense that there is the analogy to the
dark web is appropriate in that insofar
as there's this area where a lot is
going on that the mainstream media in
this case is basically unaware of I mean
then obviously there's many people in
the mainstream media and people who
consume the mainstream media where their
lists also listening to my podcast or
Rogen's or watching you so they you know
many people know we exist but people are
have been very slow to appreciate just
how big the audience is I mean Rogen's
audience is just north of you know and
you know but our audiences are absurd
compared to what's happening on you know
CNN for instance but you know I mean
Rogen's audience is like it's like every
episode is the finale of the Game of
Thrones right yeah it's just it's
completely and saying no one knows this
right like he occasionally brags about
how big his audiences but it's my sense
is that the people the New York Times
aren't aware
or people even CNN aren't aware that
they're in competition with me just to
take CNN is the most relevant comment if
you get invited to go on Anderson
Cooper's show tonight and give an
interview you're gonna get six minutes
you know the best-case 12 minutes to try
to make sense and try to not embarrass
yourself within a within a frame that is
really rigid it's not me the time
pressure alone modifies just what kind
of conversation I don't have there and
in primetime you're gonna go out to a
million people at best with Anderson
Cooper and how many are actually
watching the television to me the
televisions on in all sorts of rotations
that nobody's even watching yeah yeah so
maybe you know I count my audience it's
something like a million people and as
hard as you know to get great podcast
metrics but Joe's is probably 10 times
that per episode if not more so I mean
you're talking it so and and in those
cases you're talking about two and three
hour conversations that people are
actually listening to and forget about
what it's like to be the host on a show
like that the the opportunity for
someone else to come on and have a
conversation and and make sense and
correct themselves and go through the
whole warp and woof of a genuine
conversation that isn't unnaturally
bounded by a time limit of I mean I
noticed the difference between a
hour-long radio conversation that gets
ported to put a podcast where everyone
just knew clearly this they had to bring
this in at an hour like even that
defines the conversation and so I think
people are very slow to wake up to how
those two things like a big audience
with an unlimited time for a
conversation changes and also just
different you know incentives with
respect to funding of these things
because you know there's no one no one's
gonna fire Joe Rogan yeah Sam Harris I
gotta fire Cyrus yeah no not well well I
fired my my Twitter director yeah but
it's and so that that part of the
analogy is interesting because it's
allowing for a very different style of
airing ideas and and the substance is
chain
you know and so and I think people value
it I mean you you you know when you're
listening to one of our podcasts that
you're getting a a much less paranoid
much less circumspect much more
open-ended sir a search for sanity and
and and you know got kind of convergence
between you know dudes in some cases
radically different opinions yeah then
you're getting in other media I like
that open-ended search for sanity
because I think we've all tried to
figure out what are the commonalities
here because right we've got I mean you
and been basically disagree on every not
only pretty much every political
position not not everyone but 90% of the
political stuff you and ben shapiro but
of course also the existential stuff and
religion and all that stuff and yet you
guys are basically allies in that you're
defending the ability to have that
disagreement that seems to me to be the
thing that we're all doing like we here
we respect our audiences but more than
that we're respecting the ability for
people to sit here and disagree about
things that we have a couple political
disagreements that i want to get into a
little bit but to me those disagreements
aren't even that important as long as
we're defending the ability to think in
question and and i think that's what
we've all sort of done even though we
all came at it from very different
places yeah and then the master variable
for me is a good-faith disagreement so
it's like we're like I'm actually
concerned to get your position right
yeah and again some of this does I think
boil down to not having a time limit to
it's like I can take the time it doesn't
matter if we like what you know with
Peterson and I we can burn the first
hour
yes understanding one another right you
know or even blunder let me be the first
whole podcast then we do another podcast
would you so it's um it's well whereas
in any other format you just you don't
have the time to wonder whether or not
you're wrong about what you think the
other person just said and then you add
to that there's there's a kind of a
cynical point-scoring
that is just politically motivated that
you know is omnipresent and in
the usual context it you just have
people who are actually not having a
conversation it's just I'm gonna say the
thing that I think it's gonna make you
look bad
in the 45 seconds we have left yeah
that's the situation you're virtually
always in on television and and people
feel it and it's just like that no
wonder we're not making progress having
conversations about hard topics yeah
well I think we're making progress that
reminds me can you just quickly recap
you mentioned talking on your podcast a
couple weeks ago about how when when
Shapiro and Jordan were here that that
Jordan sort of misrepresented a position
your position sort of on truth and that
Ben then subsequently on Twitter
misrepresents I knew contacted both of
them and cleaned it all up and everyone
was good to go can you just recap that
real quick cuz I think sort of also
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is an
author and associate professor of
philosophy at the College of William and
Mary Chris Fryman
welcome to the Rubin report thanks for
having me all right man we're gonna do
philosophy for an hour are you ready
sounds good yeah you are prepared
I feel the jacket shirt combo it's very
philosophy I said give me the Reuben
yeah all right let's talk philosophy
because I think one of the things that I
try to do on this show is I talk about
philosophies more than people ideas
board than people and it seems to me we
live in a time where we don't do a lot
of philosophy and idea stuff well and I
guess that's maybe why why people are
watching this so let's do a little
philosophy 101 okay with you give me
just some of the basics of what people
should understand about philosophy okay
well yeah it's a great question yes I
might take the hour but yeah so I think
you know at the fundamental level
philosophy is about challenging
assumptions I think one thing that makes
philosophy different from other sorts of
academic disciplines is that you can't
really take anything for granted so when
you're you know doing philosophy you
have to justify why killing people is
wrong for example why feeding the hungry
is good and all of these things that we
take for granted at the level of
everyday life philosophy calls into
question and I think that's really
important and so the kinds of
philosophical questions that I'm most
interested in are ones having to do with
moral right and wrong justice injustice
the moral importance of economic
equality these sorts of things and also
the the ethics of public policy so for
example one thing that non philosophical
disciplines can do is make predictions
about what a given policy is likely to
do so while opening the borders lead to
higher unemployment higher GDP something
like that but all things considered they
can't really tell us what the right
thing to do is we say okay suppose it
turns out that opening borders will
slightly increase domestic unemployment
but it also will mean that certain
workers in the developing world will see
their incomes rise by 300% for example
this leaves open the question what
should we do
is that a trade-off that we should make
and that's really what philosophy tries
to answer is what should we do all
things considered alright so in a little
bit we're gonna get to some of your
moral philosophies that you care about
in economic philosophies and immigration
and a bunch of other things in just a
little bit but first I'm curious what
got you interested in philosophy in the
first place yeah that's a good question
so I think it was doing philosophy
before I realized I was doing philosophy
because arguing what's a good-natured
arguing was the family tradition in my
household so ever since I was a little
kid you know my parents and my sister
and I we would argue about religion and
politics and these sorts of things right
and wrong the economy and when I got a
little bit older I started reading
things and philosophy and economics
columns articles and things like that
and I realized that there was this kind
of formal discipline called philosophy
where you could argue about right and
wrong and justice and injustice and if
you were very lucky you could get a job
doing this if I get paid to do this not
a lot of not a lot of jobs not paid very
much either
but it's kind of like saying you know
you can get paid to eat ice cream for a
living I thought okay that's that's a
pretty good gig if I can get it and you
know that was kind of the start of the
trajectory into philosophy yeah you know
it's interesting because I came from a
very similar family in that regard where
we argued about everything from
economics and religion and all of those
things and I guess perhaps it this is
what led you here it's kind of what led
me here as well but we're missing that
these days don't you think like that
must infuriate you as someone that cares
about ideas when you watch the news and
watch all these people that are aren't
arguing from like a principled position
or something like a philosophically
thought-out position but just from like
a party place or a partisan place must
drive you nuts
it does it does because right I care
about ideas I care fundamentally about
good arguments so this is something that
I hope happens to my students in my
classes is they come in with a set of
preconceptions they have you know
they're partisan political believes
everybody does I have my partisan
political beliefs but I hope we can try
as hard as we can to just focus on the
argue
think critically and maybe change our
minds even if it means admitting that we
were wrong or you know finding out that
we have different political or religious
beliefs from our friends you should
really just follow wherever the
arguments lead us do you actually like
it when you find out you were wrong on
something cuz when I've had the moments
on this show and the most famous one is
when I had Larry elder in here and he
just kind of beat me senseless with
facts and you know and we've since
become friends and he was on just
recently and and I love the guy yeah
that it was scary in the moment like
sitting there in the moment of being
beaten is not fun but afterwards when
you go whoa that's what it's about it's
actually pretty cool yes so I don't like
like is it in the moment I don't like
being threatened by because I got a
couple things I'm gonna but but
long-term I think that's right it shows
growth and the funny thing is that what
are we afraid of when it comes to
changing our mind and admitting we're
wrong what's really the harm in that and
I really I like the process of arguing
it's you know a form of recreation or
something like a form of exercise I
think I think was Edmund Burke who said
something like the person who challenged
my adversary is actually my best friend
or something like this so the person
that is willing to argue with you in
good faith and genuinely cares about
getting at what's true rather than what
maybe confirms their prior political
beliefs that's you know that's person
that I want to hang out with yes I want
to talk with one of my best friends
growing up his name Derry Greek so he
was all into Greek philosophy and all
that and he was my intellectual sparring
partner for them from from literally
from 12 years old till well past college
even now and we're on eclis we actually
agree more now than ever before which is
sort of weird because we both had sort
of reverse philosophical journeys or
political journeys but that's actually
what it's all about so tell me a little
bit about some of the philosophers that
have affected you so one of my favorites
is probably John Stuart Mill so he was a
classical liberal he so he's what's
known as a utilitarian and this is a
moral theory that essentially says the
right thing to do is the thing that has
the best consequences the thing that
produces the most happiness for
everybody who's affected I find that
view attractive in moral philosophy but
he was also a he was a
Bosko liberal politically he was a big
defender of free speech free discussion
in particular his book on liberty is
probably the single greatest defense of
freedom of speech
I travel with it you know I'm on tour
right now I travel with it it's a thin
book yeah everyone should have it yeah
that's right
yeah so what okay so you mentioned
classical liberalism
okay everyone knows my feelings on this
do you see any meaningful distinction
between classical liberalism and
libertarianism at this point I think
that libertarianism is probably a bit
narrower than classical liberalism so
but this is a matter of debate I don't
have a very firm opinion on this but
when I think of a libertarian I think of
somebody who says the state should do
the following three things have a court
system have police force and maybe
enforce contracts something like that no
more maybe some kind of very small
social minimum Milton Friedman negative
income tax type thing whereas they think
classical liberals are more friendly to
a more active state but I would also say
that I'm happy to say that libertarians
are part of the classical liberal family
yeah it's funny because I had Dom
Boudreaux in here a couple weeks ago
talking about this and I fall on that
path where the more I go down the
libertarian route I really like that
line of thinking I still think there's
some utility of the state yeah but I
think the more that you have these
conversations for me I'm finding it
harder and harder to defend anything
related to the state which is it I guess
I'm taking a philosophically fair
approach to this because I'm taking in
new information yeah yeah I I'm I'm the
same way so I think that the the best
arguments for something like classical
liberalism or libertarianism is just the
pervasiveness of government failure so
you know you look at where actual
government money goes not just not in
theory but in practice where it goes
what sorts of groups are advantaged and
disadvantaged by the state the
government just doesn't work very well
and so the same reasons why we don't
want the government producing food for
example are also reasons why we might
not want the government in the business
of save running schools right so do you
think it would be fair to say that if it
well if this thing was a slim trim
operation and is financially sensible
and we had people of good moral
character and the gravamen and the rest
of it but you'd actually have no reason
to be certainly libertarian and me
perhaps even a classical liberal you
might actually be more of some sort of
big government Democrat or something
like that I think that's right at least
from my perspective so as I said I'm a
fan of mill and utilitarianism of the
idea that the right thing is the thing
that produces the best results and so I
think in a world in which the state was
run by angels very wise people very
benevolent people and it produced good
results I would be happy to accept a big
activist government a regulatory and
redistribute of state but I think there
are very powerful reasons for thinking
that that's not the world that we live
in so I think that some of my audience
when they hear you talk about Mill and
what's what's best for everyone they're
gonna view that through some sort of
lens of collectivism which is going to
set some bells off so can you unpack
that a little bit right yeah so I for
what it's worth my view is that a system
that produces the most happiness the
most flourishing the most prosperity is
something like a libertarian minimal
state perhaps with a small social
minimum so when you look historically at
collectivist regimes say the Soviet
Union or North Korea something like that
these don't have a good track record of
making people happy when you look at the
the societies that actually make people
happy compared to the alternative they
tend to be liberal limited government
free market civil libertarian ish kind
of states all right so what are their
philosophers that's back did you you're
one for one yeah John Stuart Mill right
up the top I'll give you somebody who
you might not like although you might
not be familiar with them Peter Singer
who's a contemporary utilitarian and a
lot of people I think a lot of classical
liberals and libertarians aren't big
fans of his although I think they they
need not not be fans of his so he's he's
famous for a number of things he has a
number of very controversial positions
on a lot of things but one of his more
famous thought experiments involves you
imagining that you're walking somewhere
and you pass a small child who's
drowning in a shallow
Pond and you can save this child at a
very low cost to you all all that's
required is that you step into the pond
to get your shoes muddy and pull the
child out but this means you'll have to
spend diving all hundred bucks on new
shoes and he says clearly the sacrifice
of a hundred dollars worth of shoes is
worth saving this child and so this
suggests that we have strong obligations
to make personal sacrifices for the
betterment of the world's poor
maybe that's right as at the level of
moral principle for example but I think
a lot of libertarians and classical
liberals worry that what this is going
to mean is we ought to have large
welfare states we ought to have billions
of dollars channeled into foreign aid
and so on and I can understand why they
make that leap but I don't think that
follows especially again if you look at
the track record of whether or not the
government does a good job of helping
the poor and I think it generally
doesn't yeah so and I definitely want to
get to your thoughts on that so do you
view that sort of as like that's sort of
like a micro macro argument that at a
micro level yeah you'd probably do it
like I'm sure if either one of those
we're walking down the street we
wouldn't care that much about our shoes
and able to save somebody but at a
societal level which probably gets well
out of your economic arguments as well
the more that you keep giving over to
society the more that it keeps taking
yeah well so I think is individuals in
their private lives if they do a good
job of say researching which private
charities do a good job of alleviating
poverty in the developing world and I
think there are some then we would have
in some sense in some sense a societal
obligation to help just in the sense
that most people of means have this
obligation to say donate some of their
paycheck to the against malaria
foundation for example but I think that
doesn't justify saying we want the state
in the business of redistributing income
on a global level if only because it
just doesn't do a very good job of it
and oftentimes makes poverty even worse
alright so you are a blogger at bleeding
heart libertarian yes and I've seen the
site before and I checked it out again
before before you got here but I thought
the phrase bleeding heart libertarians
that sort of sounds like what a
classical liberal is right we got a
little a little more heart in essence
we're okay with a little more state yeah
hopefully make sure the people who need
it the most are okay but I think a lot
of people will see those terms at odds
bleeding-heart libertarian ya know and
that's a great a great point too in
light of the conversation about Peter
Singer because they do think that we
have and I think a lot of classical
liberals agree that we have this strong
obligation to uphold political
institutions that work particularly well
for the poor and this isn't job
bleeding-heart libertarians is knew this
isn't just something that popped up in
the last five or six years if you go all
the way back to Adam Smith he has this
this argument about the division of
labor and free trade he says you know
you were sitting at your desk trying to
make pins all by yourself maybe you
could do two or three in a day you have
a division of labor where one person
straighten the wire the other person's
putting a pin on the on the wire and so
forth makes us massively more productive
than we otherwise could be and then
through free trade or everybody's
welfare is increased but he stresses
that this is particularly good for the
poor because he says a society in which
we're very productive and we have this
abundance of material goods is a society
in which these sorts of goods are going
to be a lot cheaper and this is in fact
what we see and so a society in which
the real price of not just necessities
but also things that we might consider
luxuries like smartphones or something a
society that makes those abundant and
cheap is a society that's very good for
the poor so I think a bleeding-heart
libertarian or classical perspective is
hundreds of years old although you
probably we haven't done a good job of
marketing ourselves perhaps yeah how
would you actually define what good is
that's a tough one yeah so that's right
yeah that's that's a big question so
here's the evasive answer is that it
depends on which philosopher you're
talking yeah so some philosophers think
that so Mill has this view that the good
consists of pleasure but it's a
sophisticated view where some pleasures
are of higher quality than others so if
I don't know you have pleasure as a
result of shooting up heroin and that's
equal in intensity and duration to the
pleasure that you get from reading
Shakespeare there's something
qualitatively better about the
Shakespeare than the heroine and so
that's his view is that it's a life of
pleasure but where you have these
higher and lower pleasures other people
other utilitarians think all pleasures
created equal
other people have maybe more complicated
views where a bunch of stuff makes a
life good so its pleasure its knowledge
its living a morally virtuous life and
so on and this is a debate that we've
been having for 200 or 2,500 years yeah
no end in sight I sense I know where you
stand on that but do you want to
elaborate on that a little more well so
I think that yes it's a good cause
you're here yeah I'm here so what what
is good well so I think that good for a
particular person is probably what a
philosopher would call the satisfaction
of your informed preferences so
essentially getting what you want if you
know what it is that you're getting so
for example you might want the liquid
that is in a glass right now because you
have the belief that its water but if
you have the fault if that belief is
false because it turns out to be vodka
or something like that you might have a
desire for what's in there but the
desire is in some sense informed by this
false belief but if you have perfectly
true beliefs about the world and then
you've desired say that cup of water I'd
say well that's good for you to get that
water you're getting what you want yeah
so you basically believe that
selfishness is good no because I think
that a lot of people I think most people
in fact have preferences rational
preferences for the welfare of other
people so I would say you know most can
you make it a selfish argument for that
because the way I've always sort of
understand or at least the way I use
these words now is that by doing what is
good for me that doesn't mean I want to
ransack the entire world right I want to
do good so that it's good for my
community I want to take care of my own
house
so that my neighbor hopefully will be
like I'm next door to someone with a
nice house and we're gonna take care of
their eyes so I view selfish and I guess
that's a little more of an eye on Rann
thing where I view selfishness actually
as a virtue yeah so I think the
difference would be in at say a case
where you're you're walking and see the
child drowning on the shallow pond the
question would be well what is the
reason why you're saving this child and
[Music]
so let's talk about some of the
specifics here so I wanted to go to one
that I think we disagree I want you to I
want you to make the most compelling
case that you can this open borders
stuff yes okay I'm not an open borders
guy this is a I'm not a crazy borders
person whatever that means I don't I
don't think I don't think there should
be no immigration we are a nation of
immigrants that's what's made this
melting pot I think the greatest nation
in the history of the world that's
giving more freedom to more people than
than anyone ever but the open border
situation especially now in 2018 2018
strikes me as particularly tenuous like
take it away yeah good so I think one
thing to keep in mind is what exactly an
advocate of open borders is arguing for
so I think most so open borders is maybe
a bit of a misnomer it's more like
borders or porous borders or something
like that where so the idea wouldn't be
that there's perhaps no checkpoints or
no restrictions on immigration just very
few so I think most open border folks
would be happy saying that if you are a
wanted violent criminal that might
exclude you from immigrating if you have
some particularly deadly contagious
disease and so forth but other than that
for ordinary peaceful migrants should be
able to come to the United States as far
as the argument goes I think there
really two strands one is just that the
the economic benefits of immigration are
huge so the most optimistic estimates
say that we could potentially double
world GDP by opening border so we've
done a pretty good job opening up trade
we've done a much worse job opening up
borders but in terms of the productivity
gains it would be incredible better than
anything else we could do and this goes
back to what I was discussing earlier
with our obligations to the global poor
foreign aid doesn't have a good track
record military intervention doesn't
have a good track record but allowing
people to move from places with low
wages to higher wages is by far the best
anti-poverty tool that we have so if we
were going to get into the nitty-gritty
of some of that what do you actually
have to do then to secure the borders
right because that's really what this is
about so even if if you make every
economic argument that I'm like all
right I can
riddled my way out of that yeah right
like if I'm on board that you still have
to do something to make sure that you're
doing those things making sure that
murderers aren't coming in and all that
and we don't seem very good at that and
I think maybe that's the leap that gets
me to where I can't make the the
secondary part that you're talking about
here yeah so I'm not sure about the
policy specifics I mean something like
the old Ellis Island system seems pretty
good I mean we had a ton of immigration
back then but there still was some kind
of checking mechanism so as far so I
doubt that that involves building a wall
but having some kind of you know
centralized location where immigrants
can come and get documents and things
like that seems seems pretty reasonable
but that's probably the most detail I
could give you on policy ideas right so
then when you go over these borders then
your gut you would want these people to
be governed by the laws of the place
that they were in right Act that's right
yeah yeah so so I would be happy to to
write a ordinarily peaceful migrants to
come in and then apply for US
citizenship just you know make it pretty
easy to do that right is this though a
tough one for a guy that doesn't trust
the government that much because that
that's what's ringing with me here and
when I've heard this argument it's like
all right wait if you don't trust the
government well then why do you think
the government would be able to vet
people properly especially because we
now see what's going on in Europe where
they've vetted people very poorly and
have had very porous borders yeah so
this might yeah so I don't know I think
though if you're a skeptic of the
government so presumably you're a
free-trade advocate you like the other
cross borders you wouldn't be happy with
government's micromanaging trade across
borders because you know skeptic about
how all the government works as am i and
for the same sorts of reasons I'm
skeptical so I think if you're worried
about the government working well that's
all the more reason to get it out of the
immigration regulation business so Mike
I think you're probably right
there's a bad job of a lot of stuff
almost everything and so the standard
here is not going to be perfection but
just what's the best alternative heavily
regulated immigration or lightly
emigrated regulation and I think all
things equal lightly and lightly
regulated immigration will probably be
better
let me give you another argument too so
this again is maybe a more libertarian
classical liberal argument for
immigration but it just seems like
people have a right to move across
borders so for example if you know I
don't know this table for example were
divided by some kind of border and I
said well look I want you to come over
to my side and rent my house from me or
work in my business or join my religious
congregation and you said okay I do want
to do those things and we both agree on
this we agree on the terms and then the
state sort of intervenes is a third
party in this what this philosopher
Robert knows who could call a capitalist
act between consenting adults it seems
like they would be violating our rights
to associate with one another among
three terms and so I think there's a
reason to think that border controls
violate people's natural rights is there
also some inherent problem though that
let's say most of the Western societies
the freest societies got on board this
well then they would end up being
flooded with people where maybe the
economics don't work out because if we
just say I mean if you think about it
like if tomorrow we were dressed like
alright everybody can come and yeah as
long as you're not a murderer or you
know drug dealer you're good to go
that there must be some economic theory
here where we're gonna let in a certain
amount of people your economics are
gonna work out and then we're gonna get
to some odd tipping point where because
freedom is pretty good people go on in
on it yeah so I think there are a couple
things to say so one is just if we I
think that problem to some extent would
be self-correcting so if you think that
a lot of the pressure to migrate is
economic so people are moving from
low-wage countries to higher wage
countries well as you have more and more
people answer about high wage higher
wage countries this would increase the
total number of workers which would
probably start dropping down their wages
and so you would probably see less
motivation to move I think that's one
thing but as a concession to this worry
what I would say is we could do it
slowly so for example if we're really
worried about these effects of
dramatically increasing immigration
overnight what we could do is just say
increase say the limits on immigration
by 10 percent every year or something
like that
and take it slowly and see where it goes
we wouldn't have to push the button open
the borders overnight if we have this
worried yeah what do you think is
philosophically the the soundest way to
deal with the people that are already
here I yeah so I am an advocate of the
view that you don't have an obligation
to obey unjust laws and so I think that
our immigration laws are unjust so I
think people who came here even against
current immigration law I think they
should just um Amnesty pull citizenship
that's that would be my approach to that
huh yeah all right we're not quite there
let me ask you this so you're not a fan
of the drug war no I'm not okay so
suppose we have somebody who I don't
know is in jail for selling marijuana
yeah like this and then suppose that
yeah so the break was a citizen of the
United broke say current immigration or
not immigration current drug laws yeah
do you think that they violated some
moral obligation that they had not to
break the u.s. drug law or do you say
well look it was a bad law so they
didn't do anything
well well partly I think it would depend
on the specific offense so so whether
they were using drugs or selling drugs I
would see a distinction there so okay if
there's someone that and there are
people that are in jail for using drugs
right now for using pot I I think those
those laws are unjust and I would want
to do everything I could to reverse
those laws and reverse the the prison
system the justice system and all that
as far as the dealers
yeah you can't until until we fix these
laws and figure out what actually is
fair and change some classifications on
marijuana and a bunch of other things
it's tough I think it's tough I don't
think you can free drug dealers per se
okay even though you're gonna you don't
think they did something that should be
against the law the people that are
doing the drugs I think you have a right
to do with your body as you see fit but
okay but again if you break a law you
have to like I would change the laws is
what I'm saying but if you break a law
then you have to suffer the consequences
of that
so does that do that all again well but
I'm curious I don't know forgive me for
but so suppose you have a drug user
who's convicted of this offense yeah
they're they're in jail but suppose they
can escape from prison
harmlessly do you think they would be
doing something morally wrong by
escaping footbridge all right so this is
a good little all right we're doing a
little my students know this is great I
mean this is what it's about right so
okay so let's say someone was smoking
weed at home cops bust in they're thrown
in jail for three years year two and
they're gonna pull a Shawshank and get
out of there right do I think they're
morally the question is do I think
they're morally right for doing it or it
can that be morally justified yes so
right so would we morally criticize them
if right they pulled a Shawshank where
they escaped through the wall or
something like that and they don't harm
anyone they just they just leave because
they say I was convicted of something
that ought not be a crime so I don't owe
any morally moral allegiance to that law
and so I'm just going to escape would
you you know hear about this story do
you say I'd be rooting for that okay
yeah I would be rooting for that so
that's kind of my perspective on
immigration that I think that it's an
unjust law and so people just as people
aren't under an obligation to obey the
state with respect to the drug war yeah
I don't think people are under an
obligation told me the state with
respect to immigration right so I guess
our sort of disconnected on this is just
the unjustness of immigration laws
versus drug laws right right so if you
think that the law itself is not unjust
then my argument won't have any kind of
grip on you yeah yeah I'm not saying our
immigration laws are just by the way I
just think that especially now also just
because of terrorism and people move and
just when you see what's going on with
Europe and and because it hasn't just
been people trying to get over for
humanitarian purposes there we know that
there's a lot of migrants and all sorts
of other people and then assimilation
problems and then welfare state problems
like it just seems like it's become this
massive thing that most of Europe would
probably do it very differently if they
could look back eight years ago right
yeah so as far as the terrorism point
goes I mean I think if somebody is is a
one to terrorists or suspected terrorist
that's a perfectly legitimate reason not
to not to allow the men I'm less
concerned about the the assimilation
concern the welfare state concern so as
far as the the assimilation where he
goes I mean a lot of the the evidence
I've seen suggests that the political
values of immigrants and especially
second generation American
is almost identical to the political
political values held by native-born
Americans and as far as the welfare
state concern goes I would say we have
lots of other freedoms that can
potentially increase the cost of the
welfare state and we're okay with people
exercising them so for example you know
I don't know we allow people to choose
their own profession for example in the
United States and so suppose you have a
student who says here's what I want to
do with my life I want to become a
philosopher you say well that's you know
I see career choice not a lot of money
in it who knows maybe you'll end up on
unemployment and this will in fact
increase the cost of the welfare state
because now you have this person on
unemployment because they chose to
become a philosopher with their life we
say well we let them do that we let them
exercise that freedom to choose their
occupation even knowing that this might
increase the costs of the welfare state
and so I think you can make an analogous
argument about immigration if you think
it's a right and important human freedom
then you say well this is sort of a
price of respecting rights and
respecting freedom they sometimes can
impose costs on third parties yeah so if
all these people come here then what
what duty does the state have to make
sure that they don't just get here and
can't do anything and then then more
crime comes and drugs and the rest of it
yeah is there a responsibility for the
state at that point I'm not sure that
the responsibility of the state to
immigrants is different from their
responsibility to citizens so I think
part so I mean there's also a question
of what we would do in the ideal world
versus the real world so you say in the
ideal world of somebody like Milton
Friedman the welfare state is much
smaller maybe you have something like
the negative income tax this isn't the
world we live in we have over a trillion
dollars of redistributed spending every
year I mean I don't so there are two
separate issues so one is this empirical
claim about whether immigrants tend to
consume more in government services than
they pay in taxes and it seems like the
fiscal effect is pretty moderate so some
estimates say they do in fact raise
fiscal costs a little bit others say no
in fact actually they're a net benefit
because a lot of a lot of new immigrants
aren't consuming a lot of government
services and so forth and they're paying
sales tax and things like this
but I think though again this is like
the concession if you really have this
way about the welfare say we could say
well maybe this is not my view but if if
this is what it took for me to get you
over to my side I'll give you this I'll
give you this concession we could say
something like you have a five-year
waiting period before you have access to
unemployment benefits and whatnot I
would take that over board or closure if
those are the only two operating it's
tough being intellectually honest isn't
it because you have to get you have to
concede things every now and again which
you just don't see people doing anymore
so it seems like doubly that's just this
is just a ploy to get you and your
viewers to the Lord on my side so yeah I
don't care so much about the honesty
just get people on the open border side
all right so you've argued that
inequality of income isn't the real
issue but poverty is the real issue
right let's get into the weeds on that
okay good so sometimes you'll hear this
is sometimes philosophers but oftentimes
politicians they'll make statements like
2% of American earners have 40% of that
country's wealth or something like that
and from here we're supposed to infer
that some injustice has occurred because
there's this this large enough quality
and I think I mean there might be an
injustice there but we can't tell
strictly on the basis of the inequality
so there's a philosopher named Robert
Nozick who famously said what matters
isn't so much the income distribution
that we end up with but how we got there
so if somebody has a huge amount of
wealth but they got it through theft or
they got it through lobbying the
government for special privileges this
is very bad this is something that we
shouldn't encourage on the other hand if
we have somebody who has a lot of wealth
because they invented the iPhone and
there are tens if not hundreds of
millions of people who want to buy this
that's totally fine so we can't just
look at the pie and how it's carved up
and say whether it's just or unjust we
have to see that people make their money
by making other people better off by
giving them things that they wanted or
did they take it through fraudulent
means coercive means and I think that
the talk about inequality oftentimes
confuses equality with poverty so is
what we're really concerned with
equalizing income or are we concerned
about making the poll
or better off and I think it's the
latter that we really should care about
so how do we go ahead and do that well
so opening borders I think is the first
step in terms of alleviating global
inequality or I'm sorry global poverty I
think is the best thing that we can do I
think domestically there are a lot of
government policies that really do harm
to the most disadvantaged groups so I
think opening up school choice would be
a great idea I think I think the drug
war would be a great idea I think ending
occupational licensing would be a very
good idea so enabling people to work in
certain industries or start their own
business with a lot less red tape is a
very good and wouldn't barbers be
stabbing people with scissors there are
some states where you have to you have
to get a license to shampoo people yeah
but I shampoo my shampoo my hair every
morning you're doing this unless you
know it's and I probably shouldn't say
that yeah I do
I should myself like you know comb my
hair without a license and so far the
government hasn't come after me and I
haven't you know poked my eye out yeah
so what's your all right so what's your
best argument that when when the people
that don't buy into this and say well we
need these regulations because you're
gonna have people that don't know how to
dye hair are gonna be scalding people's
heads and you know mr. burns is gonna be
dumping nuclear waste into the
Springfield River and all of those
things yeah that's the best argument
against me well so one argument is just
that I don't think regulation works very
well and I don't think so I think the
way that the public views regulation is
probably misguided so I don't think the
regulator's are bad people but I think
if you examine the ways that regulations
are formed and operate in the real world
it's oftentimes to protect the interests
of the industries that they're
regulating so this is what's known as
regulatory capture where regulators
aren't always looking out for the public
interest they're actually looking out
for the interest of people in that
industry so financial regulation is the
case of this you have lobbyists who
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is an
author and associate professor of
philosophy at the College of William and
Mary Chris Fryman
welcome to the Rubin report thanks for
having me all right man we're gonna do
philosophy for an hour are you ready
sounds good yeah you are prepared
I feel the jacket shirt combo it's very
philosophy I said give me the Reuben
yeah all right let's talk philosophy
because I think one of the things that I
try to do on this show is I talk about
philosophies more than people ideas
board than people and it seems to me we
live in a time where we don't do a lot
of philosophy and idea stuff well and I
guess that's maybe why why people are
watching this so let's do a little
philosophy 101 okay with you give me
just some of the basics of what people
should understand about philosophy okay
well yeah it's a great question yes I
might take the hour but yeah so I think
you know at the fundamental level
philosophy is about challenging
assumptions I think one thing that makes
philosophy different from other sorts of
academic disciplines is that you can't
really take anything for granted so when
you're you know doing philosophy you
have to justify why killing people is
wrong for example why feeding the hungry
is good and all of these things that we
take for granted at the level of
everyday life philosophy calls into
question and I think that's really
important and so the kinds of
philosophical questions that I'm most
interested in are ones having to do with
moral right and wrong justice injustice
the moral importance of economic
equality these sorts of things and also
the the ethics of public policy so for
example one thing that non philosophical
disciplines can do is make predictions
about what a given policy is likely to
do so while opening the borders lead to
higher unemployment higher GDP something
like that but all things considered they
can't really tell us what the right
thing to do is we say okay suppose it
turns out that opening borders will
slightly increase domestic unemployment
but it also will mean that certain
workers in the developing world will see
their incomes rise by 300% for example
this leaves open the question what
should we do
is that a trade-off that we should make
and that's really what philosophy tries
to answer is what should we do all
things considered alright so in a little
bit we're gonna get to some of your
moral philosophies that you care about
in economic philosophies and immigration
and a bunch of other things in just a
little bit but first I'm curious what
got you interested in philosophy in the
first place yeah that's a good question
so I think it was doing philosophy
before I realized I was doing philosophy
because arguing what's a good-natured
arguing was the family tradition in my
household so ever since I was a little
kid you know my parents and my sister
and I we would argue about religion and
politics and these sorts of things right
and wrong the economy and when I got a
little bit older I started reading
things and philosophy and economics
columns articles and things like that
and I realized that there was this kind
of formal discipline called philosophy
where you could argue about right and
wrong and justice and injustice and if
you were very lucky you could get a job
doing this if I get paid to do this not
a lot of not a lot of jobs not paid very
much either
but it's kind of like saying you know
you can get paid to eat ice cream for a
living I thought okay that's that's a
pretty good gig if I can get it and you
know that was kind of the start of the
trajectory into philosophy yeah you know
it's interesting because I came from a
very similar family in that regard where
we argued about everything from
economics and religion and all of those
things and I guess perhaps it this is
what led you here it's kind of what led
me here as well but we're missing that
these days don't you think like that
must infuriate you as someone that cares
about ideas when you watch the news and
watch all these people that are aren't
arguing from like a principled position
or something like a philosophically
thought-out position but just from like
a party place or a partisan place must
drive you nuts
it does it does because right I care
about ideas I care fundamentally about
good arguments so this is something that
I hope happens to my students in my
classes is they come in with a set of
preconceptions they have you know
they're partisan political believes
everybody does I have my partisan
political beliefs but I hope we can try
as hard as we can to just focus on the
argue
think critically and maybe change our
minds even if it means admitting that we
were wrong or you know finding out that
we have different political or religious
beliefs from our friends you should
really just follow wherever the
arguments lead us do you actually like
it when you find out you were wrong on
something cuz when I've had the moments
on this show and the most famous one is
when I had Larry elder in here and he
just kind of beat me senseless with
facts and you know and we've since
become friends and he was on just
recently and and I love the guy yeah
that it was scary in the moment like
sitting there in the moment of being
beaten is not fun but afterwards when
you go whoa that's what it's about it's
actually pretty cool yes so I don't like
like is it in the moment I don't like
being threatened by because I got a
couple things I'm gonna but but
long-term I think that's right it shows
growth and the funny thing is that what
are we afraid of when it comes to
changing our mind and admitting we're
wrong what's really the harm in that and
I really I like the process of arguing
it's you know a form of recreation or
something like a form of exercise I
think I think was Edmund Burke who said
something like the person who challenged
my adversary is actually my best friend
or something like this so the person
that is willing to argue with you in
good faith and genuinely cares about
getting at what's true rather than what
maybe confirms their prior political
beliefs that's you know that's person
that I want to hang out with yes I want
to talk with one of my best friends
growing up his name Derry Greek so he
was all into Greek philosophy and all
that and he was my intellectual sparring
partner for them from from literally
from 12 years old till well past college
even now and we're on eclis we actually
agree more now than ever before which is
sort of weird because we both had sort
of reverse philosophical journeys or
political journeys but that's actually
what it's all about so tell me a little
bit about some of the philosophers that
have affected you so one of my favorites
is probably John Stuart Mill so he was a
classical liberal he so he's what's
known as a utilitarian and this is a
moral theory that essentially says the
right thing to do is the thing that has
the best consequences the thing that
produces the most happiness for
everybody who's affected I find that
view attractive in moral philosophy but
he was also a he was a
Bosko liberal politically he was a big
defender of free speech free discussion
in particular his book on liberty is
probably the single greatest defense of
freedom of speech
I travel with it you know I'm on tour
right now I travel with it it's a thin
book yeah everyone should have it yeah
that's right
yeah so what okay so you mentioned
classical liberalism
okay everyone knows my feelings on this
do you see any meaningful distinction
between classical liberalism and
libertarianism at this point I think
that libertarianism is probably a bit
narrower than classical liberalism so
but this is a matter of debate I don't
have a very firm opinion on this but
when I think of a libertarian I think of
somebody who says the state should do
the following three things have a court
system have police force and maybe
enforce contracts something like that no
more maybe some kind of very small
social minimum Milton Friedman negative
income tax type thing whereas they think
classical liberals are more friendly to
a more active state but I would also say
that I'm happy to say that libertarians
are part of the classical liberal family
yeah it's funny because I had Dom
Boudreaux in here a couple weeks ago
talking about this and I fall on that
path where the more I go down the
libertarian route I really like that
line of thinking I still think there's
some utility of the state yeah but I
think the more that you have these
conversations for me I'm finding it
harder and harder to defend anything
related to the state which is it I guess
I'm taking a philosophically fair
approach to this because I'm taking in
new information yeah yeah I I'm I'm the
same way so I think that the the best
arguments for something like classical
liberalism or libertarianism is just the
pervasiveness of government failure so
you know you look at where actual
government money goes not just not in
theory but in practice where it goes
what sorts of groups are advantaged and
disadvantaged by the state the
government just doesn't work very well
and so the same reasons why we don't
want the government producing food for
example are also reasons why we might
not want the government in the business
of save running schools right so do you
think it would be fair to say that if it
well if this thing was a slim trim
operation and is financially sensible
and we had people of good moral
character and the gravamen and the rest
of it but you'd actually have no reason
to be certainly libertarian and me
perhaps even a classical liberal you
might actually be more of some sort of
big government Democrat or something
like that I think that's right at least
from my perspective so as I said I'm a
fan of mill and utilitarianism of the
idea that the right thing is the thing
that produces the best results and so I
think in a world in which the state was
run by angels very wise people very
benevolent people and it produced good
results I would be happy to accept a big
activist government a regulatory and
redistribute of state but I think there
are very powerful reasons for thinking
that that's not the world that we live
in so I think that some of my audience
when they hear you talk about Mill and
what's what's best for everyone they're
gonna view that through some sort of
lens of collectivism which is going to
set some bells off so can you unpack
that a little bit right yeah so I for
what it's worth my view is that a system
that produces the most happiness the
most flourishing the most prosperity is
something like a libertarian minimal
state perhaps with a small social
minimum so when you look historically at
collectivist regimes say the Soviet
Union or North Korea something like that
these don't have a good track record of
making people happy when you look at the
the societies that actually make people
happy compared to the alternative they
tend to be liberal limited government
free market civil libertarian ish kind
of states all right so what are their
philosophers that's back did you you're
one for one yeah John Stuart Mill right
up the top I'll give you somebody who
you might not like although you might
not be familiar with them Peter Singer
who's a contemporary utilitarian and a
lot of people I think a lot of classical
liberals and libertarians aren't big
fans of his although I think they they
need not not be fans of his so he's he's
famous for a number of things he has a
number of very controversial positions
on a lot of things but one of his more
famous thought experiments involves you
imagining that you're walking somewhere
and you pass a small child who's
drowning in a shallow
Pond and you can save this child at a
very low cost to you all all that's
required is that you step into the pond
to get your shoes muddy and pull the
child out but this means you'll have to
spend diving all hundred bucks on new
shoes and he says clearly the sacrifice
of a hundred dollars worth of shoes is
worth saving this child and so this
suggests that we have strong obligations
to make personal sacrifices for the
betterment of the world's poor
maybe that's right as at the level of
moral principle for example but I think
a lot of libertarians and classical
liberals worry that what this is going
to mean is we ought to have large
welfare states we ought to have billions
of dollars channeled into foreign aid
and so on and I can understand why they
make that leap but I don't think that
follows especially again if you look at
the track record of whether or not the
government does a good job of helping
the poor and I think it generally
doesn't yeah so and I definitely want to
get to your thoughts on that so do you
view that sort of as like that's sort of
like a micro macro argument that at a
micro level yeah you'd probably do it
like I'm sure if either one of those
we're walking down the street we
wouldn't care that much about our shoes
and able to save somebody but at a
societal level which probably gets well
out of your economic arguments as well
the more that you keep giving over to
society the more that it keeps taking
yeah well so I think is individuals in
their private lives if they do a good
job of say researching which private
charities do a good job of alleviating
poverty in the developing world and I
think there are some then we would have
in some sense in some sense a societal
obligation to help just in the sense
that most people of means have this
obligation to say donate some of their
paycheck to the against malaria
foundation for example but I think that
doesn't justify saying we want the state
in the business of redistributing income
on a global level if only because it
just doesn't do a very good job of it
and oftentimes makes poverty even worse
alright so you are a blogger at bleeding
heart libertarian yes and I've seen the
site before and I checked it out again
before before you got here but I thought
the phrase bleeding heart libertarians
that sort of sounds like what a
classical liberal is right we got a
little a little more heart in essence
we're okay with a little more state yeah
hopefully make sure the people who need
it the most are okay but I think a lot
of people will see those terms at odds
bleeding-heart libertarian ya know and
that's a great a great point too in
light of the conversation about Peter
Singer because they do think that we
have and I think a lot of classical
liberals agree that we have this strong
obligation to uphold political
institutions that work particularly well
for the poor and this isn't job
bleeding-heart libertarians is knew this
isn't just something that popped up in
the last five or six years if you go all
the way back to Adam Smith he has this
this argument about the division of
labor and free trade he says you know
you were sitting at your desk trying to
make pins all by yourself maybe you
could do two or three in a day you have
a division of labor where one person
straighten the wire the other person's
putting a pin on the on the wire and so
forth makes us massively more productive
than we otherwise could be and then
through free trade or everybody's
welfare is increased but he stresses
that this is particularly good for the
poor because he says a society in which
we're very productive and we have this
abundance of material goods is a society
in which these sorts of goods are going
to be a lot cheaper and this is in fact
what we see and so a society in which
the real price of not just necessities
but also things that we might consider
luxuries like smartphones or something a
society that makes those abundant and
cheap is a society that's very good for
the poor so I think a bleeding-heart
libertarian or classical perspective is
hundreds of years old although you
probably we haven't done a good job of
marketing ourselves perhaps yeah how
would you actually define what good is
that's a tough one yeah so that's right
yeah that's that's a big question so
here's the evasive answer is that it
depends on which philosopher you're
talking yeah so some philosophers think
that so Mill has this view that the good
consists of pleasure but it's a
sophisticated view where some pleasures
are of higher quality than others so if
I don't know you have pleasure as a
result of shooting up heroin and that's
equal in intensity and duration to the
pleasure that you get from reading
Shakespeare there's something
qualitatively better about the
Shakespeare than the heroine and so
that's his view is that it's a life of
pleasure but where you have these
higher and lower pleasures other people
other utilitarians think all pleasures
created equal
other people have maybe more complicated
views where a bunch of stuff makes a
life good so its pleasure its knowledge
its living a morally virtuous life and
so on and this is a debate that we've
been having for 200 or 2,500 years yeah
no end in sight I sense I know where you
stand on that but do you want to
elaborate on that a little more well so
I think that yes it's a good cause
you're here yeah I'm here so what what
is good well so I think that good for a
particular person is probably what a
philosopher would call the satisfaction
of your informed preferences so
essentially getting what you want if you
know what it is that you're getting so
for example you might want the liquid
that is in a glass right now because you
have the belief that its water but if
you have the fault if that belief is
false because it turns out to be vodka
or something like that you might have a
desire for what's in there but the
desire is in some sense informed by this
false belief but if you have perfectly
true beliefs about the world and then
you've desired say that cup of water I'd
say well that's good for you to get that
water you're getting what you want yeah
so you basically believe that
selfishness is good no because I think
that a lot of people I think most people
in fact have preferences rational
preferences for the welfare of other
people so I would say you know most can
you make it a selfish argument for that
because the way I've always sort of
understand or at least the way I use
these words now is that by doing what is
good for me that doesn't mean I want to
ransack the entire world right I want to
do good so that it's good for my
community I want to take care of my own
house
so that my neighbor hopefully will be
like I'm next door to someone with a
nice house and we're gonna take care of
their eyes so I view selfish and I guess
that's a little more of an eye on Rann
thing where I view selfishness actually
as a virtue yeah so I think the
difference would be in at say a case
where you're you're walking and see the
child drowning on the shallow pond the
question would be well what is the
reason why you're saving this child and
[Music]
joining me today is the Milbank Family
Center senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University a
senior fellow at the Center for European
studies at Harvard where he also served
as a professor of history for 12 years
as well as the author of 14 books Neil
Ferguson
welcome to the Reuben report it's
exciting to be here how'd I do on the
intro there I mean I was looking through
your bio 14 books there were 87 other
things I could have credited you for
we've already done an interview here in
just the 15 minutes we've been sitting
here how it was that all right I mean I
could have just yelled like the results
of the bet sir is my feeling about
introductions now justice said he is
Neil but here's Neil all right there's a
ton we got a cover here and we've
already done half of it I think without
the cameras so let's just dive in
immediately to the culture war stuff
because I can tell you've been traveling
a lot half jet-lagged half wide awake
but I can see that's really where your
head's at at the moment so let's talk
some culture war stuff what do you feel
is happening sort of in the gestalt of
the universe at the moment well you
started the university might be where we
should begins as I've spent a lot of my
life in universities you mentioned a
couple of them they're Stanford and
Harvard I was at Oxford before that and
much of my life has been I think
witnessing the gradual homogenization of
academic life especially in the field
like history when I became a historian
back in the 1980s in Oxford and then in
Cambridge it was generally accepted that
there could be conservative historians
and liberal historians and socialist
historians and then some moxie stories
it was really quite a heterogeneous
community Oxbridge in those days and if
you were as I was attracted to the
Conservatives because they were more fun
it was more right but more fun the fun
was the initially attractive thing when
I first got to Oxford in the early 80s
it was clearly the funniest people were
the Thatcher IDEs
the young Andrew Sullivan who was a year
ahead of me at maudlin so this was all
great fun yeah and it led to into
show insight because they turned out
also to be right the historians take Bob
Conquest who was then at the Hoover
Institution one of the few historians
who got the Soviet Union right at the
time who wrote about Stalin's crimes not
long after they were perpetrated I mean
those were the heroes of my early years
but in the course of my career what has
happened has been that one history
department after another has moved
steadily and relentlessly to the
monochrome left and it has become
steadily harder to to be seen as a
conservative I say seen as because I've
never really felt that I'm a
conservative but I've often been
described as one yeah to be seen as a
conservative historian has become
steadily harder and harder and as a
result the culture war to use your
phrase in the Universities has been won
by the left there will really be soon a
handful left of conservatives at
institutions like Harvard and Stanford
and Harvey Mansfield will probably be
the last one at Harvard and and that's
to me deeply depressing deeply troubling
do you remember a moment when you saw
that shift occurring because you're
saying in the in the 80s mid eighties it
was pretty diverse in terms of ideas do
you remember seeing something or did you
see markers that started that you could
start putting together the map of where
this thing was gonna go I think the
definition of defeat in the culture war
is that it's imperceptible you're aware
of it a little bit each year because in
a typical department each year somebody
retires or dies but they're always
replaced with somebody working on let's
say for the sake of argument gender
history so you your colleague was was
lecturing on the history of the Soviet
Union Richard pipes who was at Harvard
and and just lately died one of the
great historians of the Bolshevik
Revolution
you don't ever see someone like that
replaced with somebody like him there'll
always be replaced by somebody working
on gender history Native American
history that that process whereby there
was no replacement of conservative
historians was a more or less annual
event I got accustomed to being in a
real minority a minority of conservative
historians I got accustomed to losing
pretty much every vote being in the
minority on every committee it became a
kind of you you got a climatized to it
and then one day suddenly hit you that
you were practically the last one left
and you know when I moved to Stanford
the revelation was quite startling I was
invited to come to the Hoover
Institution many Hoover fellows have
associations joint appointments with
Stanford departments I had been pretty
successful as a teacher at Harvard my
classes had been very large the students
gave me very powerful evaluations I kind
of assumed that I would come to Stanford
and have some relationship with the
history department and then I was told
oh no no none at all not even a courtesy
appointment and it was clear at that
moment that I had become in the eyes of
the Stanford history department a pariah
somebody who who simply couldn't be
allowed in the building
because of my my conservative leanings
can you explain a little bit more about
how the universities work like that that
that could even happen they're gonna
they're gonna bring you in you're a
fellow there and that you're just gonna
be ignored by the department that you're
an expert in you know it's quite
insulting especially as you mentioned as
I've published rather lots of books
yeah fact rather more than then most of
the department put together and I think
a department with falling enrollments
might have been expected to to want to
have me playing a part but what happened
and it's happened in most departments in
most universities inexorably the left
took over and an implicit rule a tacit
rule was imposed that one does not hire
right-leaning
historians nor does one hire their
graduate students so they to people who
have been my graduate students have
found it difficult to get hired so it's
essentially a straightforward a process
whereby the institution is taken over
one committee at a time and the left has
been good at that for the better part of
a century they've always had how do you
think they saw that how did they have
the foresight to go all right we've got
to take over the universities first I
think that on the right the previous
generation of historians and this was
also true of philosophers and people
working in other fields did not fight
very hard or effectively to promote
their successors in academic life you
need to be mindful of the succession the
left was better at ensuring that it's
protegees got the appointments
ultimately academia is a committees game
it's all about getting to be the chair
of the department to be in charge of the
committee's if you control the process
you control the selection you control
the recruitment and I suppose I'm I'm
such a naive person I kind of in my
youth assumed we were in a broadly
meritocratic world in which if you were
smart and hard-working
then then good things would would happen
and it took me all that yeah I was
completely Knight it took me a while to
cotton on to the fact that in in reality
in academic life as another walks of
life patronage is everything and you can
be as talented as you like if you're not
in the right patronage Network then
you're done and I suppose it's been
thinking about these issues how do
networks capture institutions the that
led me to write that the most recent
book the square on the tower was
actually book number 15 yeah
to try to think about how networks
operate we tend to talk casually about
networks but I came to realize that in
academic life as in other areas you need
to understand quite exactly quite
precisely how networks operate to see
how power is truly wielded we can all
see the hierarchical institutions that
are where power is located right even
universities are clearly not as powerful
as as government's but the critical
point is to understand the disease often
networks that capture institutions that
capture the hierarchies and that's what
happens in academic life and now I think
pretty soon there just won't be
conservatives in university departments
more importantly than that nobody will
be teaching subjects like the history of
the Soviet Union so no students will be
taught about the crimes of Lenin and
Stalin and students like the students I
taught yesterday will not hear from
anybody that there was a religious
motivation to the 9/11 attacks I had a
class at Stanford yesterday I was
allowed to sit in and teach somebody
else's class as a guest professor and it
happened to be a discussion about 9/11
and it became clear to me that the
students had never considered the
possibility that there was religious
motivation to the 9/11 attacks and more
or less except the idea that they were
retaliation for the misdeeds of u.s.
foreign policy in the Middle East what
are called the Howard Zinn theory and
since Howard Zinn's books are more
widely read in the United States than
anybody else's history books we
therefore arrive at a situation in which
there will be nobody in any major
universities saying actually Howard Zinn
is completely wrong and this is not what
9/11 was about so that's what I find
depressing when I say that the culture
was kind of over and the universities
that's really what I mean yeah so let's
circle back because it does bring us to
your 15th book I stand
did decide this idea of networks because
we were talking right before we started
that there's something happening here
with this loose Association of people
that has been coined the intellectual
dark web and I said to you and you
walked in are you part of the
intellectual dark web as if you were
gonna give me a secret handshake or a
special card or when I was asked about
it I denied all knowledge didn't the
assumption that it was secret and then
it turned out to be all over the New
York Times yeah but are you worried you
weren't photographed in the bushes like
the rest of us but I suspect that you
secretly are in the intellectual dark
web well I couldn't possibly reveal that
because it's secret but but you said
something interesting about because of
your level of academic credit that you
thought perhaps that took you out of it
but then christina hoff sommers said
something interesting yeah what Barry
Weiss emailed me and my wife ayaan Hirsi
Ali who's been on your show is
interesting than me is the greatest I
mean we she now let's be tough for you
because millions of people love your
work and everything else but it's like
ion is like transcended she's wonderful
it's the most enormous wonderful
blessing in my life to be married to
somebody who's just way more interesting
than me thank you too so that so we were
both asked by Barry Weiss about the
intellectual dark web and I said look
how can I really claim to be part of
that when I taught for 12 years at
Harvard left of my own volition I'm here
at Stanford can write newspaper columns
and have them published more or less
where I want it would it would be a
little disingenuous to claim kinship
with people like Brett Weinstein who've
been persecuted by the academic left
that I've been attacked I've been
criticized but I haven't really been
driven underground at least not at this
point but Christina Summers said to me
just the other night no it's not about
whether you've been denied a platform or
not clearly almost all the people in the
article that Barry wrote of have plenty
of opportunities to make their views
known it's about whether you are seen to
speak
for people who feel that they have been
silenced who feel that their voices
aren't heard right that's quite a good
definition of what this is about
but you're also right to see that it's a
network as I was reading the article I
was thinking have funny I know all these
people the sole exception of Jordan
Peters no I've never met I sense that's
coming well yeah I hope so I look
forward to it
but I think it's a network of the most
ideal sort it is a truly informal
network of people from right across the
political spectrum because nobody could
call Brett Weinstein a conservative yeah
who have come together spontaneously
informally nobody called it into being
and said I'm forming the intellectual
dark web turn up on Monday at 5:00 p.m.
right and I does it change does it
change the second its name generally a
network so if this is the right type of
network right it's cool kind of diverse
group of people who had all sorts of
different motivations and everything
else once it's sort of named does that
change the way a network has to operate
because I sense that's what the
discussion is about right now yeah
although not I think fundamentally that
the critical thing is when something
ceases to be secret I tell the story of
the Illuminati a network in the late
18th century in Germany that sought to
advance a radical version of the
Enlightenment but covertly as a secret
organization the intellectual dark web
I semi seriously said was was secret
until Barry wrote that right right and
and now that it's out in the in the open
what will happen is that it will grow
because people Andrew Sullivan I was
discussing it with him to said why am I
in it and of course the answer is but
you should be really I mean anybody who
who is engaged in critical thinking
about the whole range of ideas in our
society ranging from the political to
the social and cultural anybody who is
in the debate and is antagonistic to the
dogmas of the left the political
correctness the identity politics the
spurious pursuit of so-called social
justice
if you are skeptical if you are thinking
critically about the dogmas of the left
then you belong in the intellectual dark
web because you're the kind of person
who at some point will be no platformed
who at some point will be taken down who
at some point will be the target of a
hit piece in the new york times one of
the characteristic features of the
intellectual dark web I think is that
most members at one time or another have
fallen foul of the leftist thought
police and as soon as you've had that
experience it's happened to me a number
of times but that is quite
transformative yeah I mean it literally
changed my life it's the only reason
you're sitting here right now I was once
one of them and and I suspect your
experience was like mine you'll kind of
taken aback to be on the receiving end
of a social media mob you're kind of
taken aback to be attacked not for the
substance of anything that you've argued
or written or said you're attacked for
your reputation you're attacked for your
alleged bad faith and each time this has
happened to me I've I've been a little
stunned I was naive
not only was I a believer in meritocracy
I was also a believer that we were
engaged in a rational debate about the
past that's what historians do and that
one made one's case presented the
evidence and then the other side did the
same but I wrote a book a book about the
British Empire know what 15 or so years
ago an argument that their argument of
that book was that not everything about
the British Empire was bad there were
benefits as well as costs to imperialism
and I never had a debate about that
argument
I only ever was attacked by the left for
being an apologist of empire and
neo-colonialist etc and so in that
curious debate that that is central to
the culture war you never really are
engaged with on the ideas all the
evidence it is always about
whether you have bad faith or not
whether you are covertly
yeah racists an Islamophobe are
homophobe that there's a long list of
things that you can be accused of but
those are the most popular ones ones
never really discussing the arguments of
the books ones always discussing the
personality of the author yeah so this
is just sort of simply put the ideas
first people conversation right so in in
a case of vayan I mean to live through
the things that she has lived through
between FGM and her and her and her
friend being murdered and the whole
thing to be called the things that she's
called I mean it flips your very
personhood on its head
which is I mean it's it's so deeply
twisted the episode that for me brought
it into bold relief was the the Brandeis
honorary degree Fiasco when I on was
invited by the president of Brandeis and
this was in 2014 yeah except an honorary
degree in speaker commencement and then
was very publicly and humiliatingly
disinvited under pressure from an unholy
alliance as far as I could see of
leftists and Islamists who set out
online to smear her reputation with the
usual confection of selective quotation
and and misrepresentation and as often
happens in these situations the
university authorities capitulate
without a fight to the left and and they
do it publicly and that that for me was
a that was a moment when I learnt a lot
about what was going wrong in American
academic life and realized that it's
it's the combination of of aggressive
activists on the left and useful idiots
in university bureaucracies so is it
fold is it that they're useful idiots or
is it just is it just sort of blanket
cowardice by on part of some of the
academics but really the the
administrators and the upper brass at
all the schools and the fact that the
donors although this is changing right
now and as we're taping this today I
know it's going to be out in a couple
days
evergreen is now firing a whole bunch of
professors which is exactly whatever it
what all of us predicted basically
because the donors have just had enough
it's fascinating so it's hard like where
it is just cowardice cowardice is the
most powerful force in human history no
doubt and I'm constantly amazed at just
how much cowardice is out there
my wife's experience has shown me that
the the the the difficulty of getting
people publicly to support her work
against Islamic extremism is all about
cowardice fear of being in any way drawn
into into the the real war the jihad
facing the death threats that she has
repeatedly had to face but it's not just
cavitus and there's a good deal of
complicity many university
administrators are themselves
ideologically on the left and feel that
they have a mission to empower the the
leftists in the student body and this is
I think a different thing from from
cowardice so yeah I think I think this
is a fascinating moment in time because
donors alumni look at what is going on
on university campuses as do people who
have not had the privilege of university
education who see it all as complete
madness and ask the question what the
[Music]
so for you for ion it's not just
academic where do you think the bravery
comes in for you I because I can tell
there's nothing that I could possibly
ask you here that you wouldn't give me
the clearest honest answer and and that
isn't always how it is with everybody
obviously as an interviewer but where do
you think that comes from candor has
always been one of my greatest
weaknesses and I think I was probably
brought up in a rather combative family
in a rather combatted part of the world
I grew up in in Glasgow in the West of
Scotland and to a physician and a
physics that's right my mother was a
physics teacher and my father was a
doctor yeah and they were the first in
their families to go to university
my grandfather's had served in the world
wars Scots have a self image of
themselves as being courageous the
Scottish regiments were famous I wrote
about this in my one of my earliest
books the pizzi of War were famously the
sharp end of the British military we
marched towards the sound of gunfire
bagpipes playing that's the self-image
that a small Scottish boy growing up in
the nineteen sixties and seventies was
encouraged to have I remember vividly
the day that 9/11 happened I was sitting
in Oxford where I was then teaching but
planning I'd planned and was intending
to fly to New York very shortly to give
a lecture on 9/12
hmm at New York University indeed I was
booked into a hotel very close to the
World Trade Center and my response when
I saw the attacks was somewhat
bloody-minded
my response was very shortly afterwards
to resign my post at Oxford and go to
New York University and I taught there
for two years in a I suppose a mood of
defiance that the attempt to terrorize
would not terrorize me when I met
a yawn 9 more than 9 years ago now it
never crossed my mind as I fell in love
with her which happened very fast
that this implied some meaningful threat
to my person even when the FBI came to
tell me that there had been a threat
against me something that I'd seen them
do to a yharnam more than one occasion I
never gave it a second thought because
obviously my calling different from my
grandfather's who were called to fight
in real Wars my more much more
manageable calling is to is to protect
her because she's one of the great
heroines of our time an extraordinary
courageous woman who's been through a
hell of a lot and who has never shirked
from saying what she believes is wrong
with modern Islam so it it is second
nature to me to be there with her in
that in that fight in that war that's
what it turns out to beat my warm I
always used to wonder as I was growing
up why is it that my generation isn't
really been called on to fight wars the
way my grandfather's generations were
called on and then it turned up then my
war turned up you briefly mention this
earlier when you're talking about ion
and Brandeis but can you explain this
intersection of Islamism and the left
how why this has occurred this confuses
a lot of people this idea of the
oppression Olympics and you know I've
got plenty of theories on this that
we've knocked out but but what do you
think it is that has attracted something
that is completely totalitarian in
control with another thing that's so
completely to a town I mean I guess
that's the answer right there but well
there are many unholy alliances in in
history and no doubt many people were
gravely surprised when the Ribbentrop
Molotov Pat was announced and
Soviet Union and Nazi Germany formed an
alliance so we shouldn't be entirely
surprised when seemingly odd bedfellows
jump into bears in the case of the
Islamists and the left I think it's
pretty clear to me that the Islamists
are the the leading partner and the
leftists are broadly the useful idiots
because the Islamists have a strategy
it's there in Muslim Brotherhood and
other documents for expanding their
network in the West and part of the
strategy is the kind of partnership that
they have formed on campuses against
against their foes one way in which this
works is that you use the issue of
Israel to forge the pacts with the left
so you get the left's long-standing
animosity towards Zionism and you
essentially say well we entirely agree
with you about that let's let's have an
event about how wicked Israel is and so
that's the gateway drug in to accepting
the next thing is well headscarves are
actually empowering for women don't you
think
and isn't it actually Islamophobia to be
in any way critical of Sharia law so you
play the multiculturalist cultural
relativist card and you again depict any
critics of radical Islam as as in fact
engaged in some kind of Orientalist
project or essentialist project to other
people always talk about other in
academia Muslims and you blur the
distinction between Islam Islamism and
Muslims as people so this has been going
on for a while and the left has broadly
fallen for it and to me it's just
astonishing I remember looking at the
list of academics who had
who had argued that ion should not
receive an honorary degree at Brandeis
and it included professors of queer
studies female professors of Gender
Studies it's incredible you kind of feel
like saying to these people have you
taken a look at what the Muslim
Brotherhood envisages have you read cut
herbs works do you realize that the
project is the permanent demotion of
women to second-class status and
potentially capital punishment for gays
is that something you are aware of and I
can only conclude that they aren't aware
of it and have been very thoroughly
duped as useful idiots usually are so is
that basically because both of these
movements want power so the useful idiot
part of this is that the Islamists are
really just using the left to attain
power and they're doing it all in the
name of diversity and all of these
things and eventually once that power is
attained then for a lack of a better
expression I mean you basically
decapitate them and then you've got they
did it for you they did the work for you
yes I mean I always used to joke with I
on that when we lived in Cambridge it
would be fun if all my enemies and all
her enemies came and protested outside
our house together yeah because after
about 20 minutes they'd they'd fall on
one another and they would her the most
tremendous fight I do think that power
is part of it but if one looks back at
the history of another intolerant
totalitarian ideology Marxism there's a
combination of power and a kind of
idealism one must call it that in the
square and the tower I tell the story of
how the Soviets successfully penetrated
the British establishment by recruiting
spies in Cambridge and the people they
recruited had leanings to the left there
were inspired partly by revulsion at
those aspects of British imperialism or
British class Society that were in many
ways legitimately open
criticism there was an idealism there at
the beginning of guy Burgesses
involvement in Marxism sympathy with
workers during the time of the Great
Depression but those were the useful
idiots that the Soviets cynically
recruited to be spies who whom they
persuaded to betray their countrymen in
what was the single most successful act
of Russian espionage of them all
recruiting these highly educated people
from an incredibly exclusive network the
Cambridge apostles and the related
network that led to Bloomsbury this was
a brilliant strategy something similar
is going on here because I think there
are a great many naive young people who
are drawn to the rhetoric of social
justice I encounter them often people
who say oh there should be limits on
free speech because I don't want such
and such such and such as feelings to be
heard they're naive they have a very
naive view somehow there can be a
circumscribed form of free speech in
know in which nobody's feelings get hurt
that's not the pursuit of power that's
just naivety and the people who know how
to exploit that naivety are both people
amongst the Islamists and people amongst
the leftists who are pursuing power but
you can never really get to power
without the useful idiots without the
naive idealists
who think that they're going to build
utopia with your help yeah and I don't
have to tell you there usually ends up
in dystopia right so and that's that's
something that it's hard to persuade
people off yeah I keep reflecting on the
curious revival of Margaret Atwood's The
Handmaid's Tale which is always taken to
be a vision of what happens when
right-wing people take over America yeah
and to me the amazing thing that is
almost never observed is that something
very like this has happened it happened
in Iran after 1979 and it happened after
the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan
so we don't need to fantasize about
crazy evangelical fascists turning women
into baby machines this has already
happened but it was done by Islam
it was done by people pursuing an
extreme version of Sharia and yet almost
nobody who enthuses about Margaret
Atwood's book realizes that it is
actually really quite powerful
realization of what a theocratic
Islamist regime does to women all right
so I want to shift gears a little bit
here and we can either I'm gonna let you
choose we can either go the historical
route or we can go the present route
what are you feeling first I do want to
do both I think the key to applied
history which is what I've spent my
whole life doing is that you do both
alright and you can't do one without the
other because no you can have no real
insight about the present without the
past so why don't we talk about the
present and I'll try to show why to
understand it you need history all right
very good so there are a couple things
that are interesting that you've staked
out positions on over the past couple
years we briefly right before we sat
down we talked about Bragg's it for a
second so you originally were for we're
against Bragg's is yeah then you came
around for it now it seems to be in this
odd limbo that I think unfortunately
most people in America don't even
understand what's what's going I do
think most people in Britain on but I'm
sure so when I was reading your position
on this at first I thought well wait a
minute as a conservative and as someone
that wants some autonomy over his
country I was somewhat surprised
actually that you weren't for it
originally so can you explain your
original position and then how you
changed on that there were two reasons
why I was on the side of remain remain
in the EU back in 2016 one was pure
personal loyalty to friends David
Cameron was Prime Minister George
Osborne was Chancellor of the Exchequer
and they are friends of mine and I I
felt obliged as a friend to support them
when they decided to stick with the EU
and not to recommend brexit did that
friendship supersede what your feelings
were or was that because you really
trusted that they could get into
anything that swung it okay and I think
the reason that I was willing to get on
board with remain was that I found that
arguments of the brexit ears deeply on
convincing I remember one night sitting
down and reading a lot of stuff by
Daniel Hannan one of the leading
advocates of of leaving and I remember
thinking that this was just
intellectually completely third-class
and unconvincing the notion that Britain
would be better off economically outside
the European Union wouldn't have passed
muster as an undergraduate paper never
mind a graduate of paper so I felt that
the brexit ia's case failed
intellectually because they were
claiming implausibly i thought that you
could have a free lunch that you could
leave the european union and be better
off and that just seemed to me to be
intellectually completely deceitful I
think it would have been harder for me
if they had said honestly this is going
to cost quite a bit but it's worth it
because if we leave then we shall have
the ability to control our borders and
we shall have autonomy at a time when
Europe is pursuing a Federalists course
but that wasn't the argument the
argument was that not the area because
that we're going to get the money
a hearse was the argument I'm going to
get the money that we give to the
European Union and we'll get bill to
spend on the National Health Service
because we will be in fact better off
and that was a lie and I'm not good with
lies it was a clever lie it worked
politically and I give credit to Dominic
Cummings for crafting a message that was
appealing both to conservatives and to
labour voters the Conservatives got
immigration control labor voters got the
National Health Service gets the money
so this is brilliant politically but it
was mendacious I think during that part
and so I I opposed the brexit when it
happened
what struck me in the subsequent months
was that while I had been while I had
been on the side that lost there was a
good reason why we lost and the good
reason was that we went around saying
how much it was going to cost
and I think we were right about that I
think ultimately at least some of what
the Treasury said will true will turn
out to be true about the cost but that
wasn't what people cared about mm-hmm
and when you went into pubs as I did in
Wales in England and in Scotland there
was a question to which you could not
give an honest answer without losing the
debate and I'll tell you what that
question was because I was asked it
multiple times you'd make the case about
the cost nobody was interested in the
cost they would say listen Neil about
the 1.3 million Muslims the Germans have
just let in to Germany because that had
just happened mm-hmm if the Germans give
them German passports can they come here
and the only honest answers of that
question was yes so immigration was the
issue and I think for a significant
number of people in England and Wales
especially was less so in Scotland where
brexit was defeated the realization was
that Britain had lost control of
immigration the people had been promised
net migration in the tens of thousands
and in the 1990s under the Blair
government and they'd ended up with net
migration in the hundreds of thousands
they saw the chaos in Germany they saw
the waves of migration coming on only
from Syria but from all over North
Africa and and even South Asia and they
said and I remember David Cameron using
this phrase get me out of here and that
was that was the driving motivation for
the brexit vote and I think it was
legitimate because I think that Angela
Merkel had made a catastrophic mistake
in throwing open the gates I think it
will have dire consequences for the
future of Germany and of Europe and I do
not blame British voters for saying
forget about the cost of brexit we
really need to get out of this so I take
took the view by the end of 2016 that
you had to you had to respect the fact
that ordinary people had cut through the
crap of the debate and it got to the
heart of the matter and the heart of the
matter wasn't the cost of braixen
which is what I had I think mistakenly
focused on prior to the referendum what
was it like for you as a public person
and you know some of the rights about
this stuff and puts your opinions out
there that to have that realization I
think it's very important if you write
regularly if you are what we call a
public intellectual to be willing to
admit that you've been wrong I think you
have to be prepared to say I was wrong
and I think I was wrong in the sense
that what I wish I had done looking back
was I wish I had said to David Cameron
George Osborne in the spring of 2016
when it was clear that the Europeans
were going to make no meaningful
concession on the immigration issue when
they basically sent an insulting
proposal about what could be done about
migration that was the moment I should
have said to Cameron Osbourne forget it
yeah you should campaign for brexit if
that's all they're going to offer you if
they're so completely oblivious to the
very real concerns about immigration
then you should campaign for brakes
instead of which we stuck with it and
that was that was David Cameron's great
mistake he should have said at that
moment if that's all you've got
I'm going to recommend breaks it to the
voters and it would have saved him too
so so you think it was just a bad
negotiating ploy that he just didn't use
some leverage to say we're gonna have to
walk away from this there was there was
a moment when he should have walked away
and I should have advised him to walk
away so yeah I think one has to
recognize when one's made a mistake with
such consequences the second thing which
is worth knowing about this is that the
people who then inherited power after
the fall of Cameron at nas born were not
the people who had campaigned for and
one on rancid it was people who'd been
on the remain side Theresa May became
Prime Minister I always knew that would
be a disaster I did not have high regard
for her prior to the referendum the
Daily Mail essentially put her in that
position and also Boris Johnson Michael
Gove and others because they bungled the
leadership contest so
we then ended up with the terrible
combination which was a commitment to
breaks it but its execution in the hands
of people who had been remain errs and I
think the result is the worst of both
worlds because right now we essentially
have the psychological reality of brexit
I think British public to a large extent
has accepted that we are leaving
but the executions are total mess yeah
by invoking article 50 early on the UK
and essentially ceded the the power in
the divorce to the European Union and
the concessions have come one after
another ever since then and we now find
ourselves in the odd predicament that I
think Theresa May is saying that brexit
means
you cease to be a voting member of the
European Union but you remain within the
customs union potentially even within
the single market and you accept all the
rules and regulations of the European
Union you just don't have any power if
that's the end game yeah
then it's a disaster so the people that
are trying to stop this now they want to
invoke some some pretty crazy extreme
stuff right I mean there would be some
really very rarely if ever used rules am
i right about this that would actually
allow this to allow the state to occur
well listen I think those games without
getting into all of them I think that
there is a level of complexity in the
discussions now in London that is
bewildering to most ordinary British
people when people start talking about
max FAC and the customs union complex
confusing way because I discuss it with
Douglas Murray and he was even a little
confused it's actually not confusing in
the sense that what is happening is that
Theresa May is trying to get Britain to
accept the realities of belonging to the
European customs union which would
preclude Britain having its own trade
policy with our leaving the European
all right what's going on people I am
caffeinated and ready to roll so we were
going to do this at 7:00 p.m. Pacific
tonight but then some scheduling things
happen I literally just landed from
Philadelphia this morning Boston two
days ago Toronto the day before that
just landed in LA we're taping two shows
today I'm not gonna reveal everything
right now one of the guests is a little
late so we thought we'd do this now
maxing out the time here I have so many
things that I want to share with you
guys there is so much good stuff
happening right now
this tour with Jordan Peterson's been
amazing my return to stand-up there's so
many signs and signals that the things
that we're talking about here are really
taking root I think that this
intellectual dark web article from Barry
Weiss in the New York Times two weeks
ago really really leveled this thing up
and and it's just reached all across
everything and it wouldn't even be just
that it's the good part of the article
that reached across everything it's that
the amount of hysteria and angry people
and misrepresentations of all of our
views and all that the amount of
articles being written about it and
think pieces and all this nonsense it's
like man we must be doing something
right over here that all these people
are just making up this nonsense and to
be on tour with Jordan Peterson we're
literally literally every day there is
another ridiculous hit piece written
about him often I've met the author of
the piece the New York Times when they
came out this week about his enforced
monogamy idea I was in the greenroom on
the first night of the tour I believe in
Toronto two weeks ago with with the girl
who wrote the piece and it's just like
man journalism is freaking dying and
dead and by the way with that in mind
we're getting some new allies in this
space Elan musk has been on a freaking
tear about mainstream media so I think
there's a lot of interesting things
happen the Dali Lama tweeted something
about individualism and coming together
as people I think there's so much cool
stuff happening right now I'm totally
enthused
I'm meeting literally thousands of you
guys you know at these events most of
the theaters that we're doing are about
three to five thousand people I think
the biggest one we did was the Apollo in
London which was 5,000 people I mean
think about that 5,000 people coming to
here a psychologist talk about ideas you
know it's just awesome so I usually go
up there I do about 10 to 15 minutes to
stand up I get the crowd growing we're
talking about lobsters and cleaning your
room and all this crazy stuff and I just
get everybody having a good time and and
the beauty is you can feel it that for
you watching this right now for most
people watching this stuff it's like
you're watching this most likely on your
on your phone or you're on a computer
it's a pretty singular experience right
maybe you're with somebody but usually
you're not watching it a whole group of
people although I have heard that now
some students are watching the show and
there's some groups there's a group in
India that I think gets together on
Sunday nights and watches my show it's
amazing but generally speaking you're
watching this as a solo experience and
you're kind of just we're doing this
right but to be in a room with 5,000
people who agree disagree black white
gay straight all of that stuff all of
that diversity but are just coming
together to hear about ideas and then
hear Jordan talk about why racism is not
good why the alt-right is bad why
cultural Marxism and progressivism are
all so bad and just everybody getting on
board talking about personal
responsibility it's just it really I
feel like my life even from two weeks
ago my life has changed cuz you can't be
around that kind of force for that long
and and not feel something it just it
feels real and honest and and good and I
think we're we're challenging each other
Jordan has made it very clear that
nothing is off-limits during the Q&A so
usually I take some questions from the
crowd that they there there's an app
that they send questions in on but then
I mix it up with some of my own stuff
he's challenged me a little bit on some
things it's been it's been a total
learning experience and very cool all
right so here's what we're gonna do here
so on top of the Jordan Peterson tour
which I'm heading back out on our next
stop is in Houston and the Dallas and

per 20 per show so there's 60 60 slots
if you happen to be near DC or Seattle
or Tempe Arizona which is right by
Phoenix where I'll be with your in a
couple days so anyway so I'm just I'm
just as you can tell I'm just psyched
about what's going on here these shows
we were in we were in London last week
5,000 people at the Apollo Theater it
was just incredible I got out so usually
the way these theater is working on
these are huge awesome old school you
know Phantom of the Opera Theater is
just beautiful beautiful buildings most
of them and they usually have like an
artist's entrance or something but for
the the one in London I didn't know
where the artists entrance was so my
uber just dropped me off right in front
there were out there 2,000 people
outside I got stormed I mean it was
crazy like the amount of people that are
so excited about this stuff and and
everyone talking about their political
awakening and the same that you
were thinking about that I talked about
here about what it's like to evolve
politically and realize that you were
wrong about some things in wanna
more and everyone has like an amazing
life story to tell me and people always
they want to give us stuff everyone
wants to give Jordan personal written
notes or some people have done some
incredible artwork and stuff like that
like it's just been it's been so cool
but as I said before it's that it's that
everyone's coming together people are
looking around and going whoa
you're a Jordan Peterson fan you know
you know Dave Rubin like it's just like
it's like real it really feels like real
real real and cool all right let's see
so I'm gonna take a couple questions by
the way
so we're gonna do the super chat thing
if you're watching right now on the
YouTube we're doing super chat it's real
quick on YouTube I don't know if you saw
this I guess they announced this
yesterday I tweeted about it today but
they're gonna be there experimenting
with changing the feed because we really
want more of that sort of thing where
they're going to they're gonna sort of
rejigger your feed to figure out what
you might want to watch instead of
showing you stuff in chronological order
now call me a conspiracy theorist but if
they don't really like the stuff that
the content creator is putting out there
it seems that they might just hurt you
and everyone else's feed everyone wants
just a chronological feed right you
subscribe to things because you know you
like them and if you don't want if they
put up a clip that you don't like if I
put up an interview that you don't like
you don't watch it but we don't need
youtube or any more of these algorithms
to do more hiding things from us or
promoting other things and we know that
there's just so many ways that that can
be manipulated but they're experimenting
that right now and by the way I'm not
asking the government to come in and fix
the problem I'm using my voice my free
speech I see this on Twitter all the
time people will say see Ruben you're
you don't want any regulation you don't
want the government to come in and fix
anything well now look what happened
with YouTube and the NFL and bah-bah-bah
and no I don't want the government to
come in and fix these things I don't
think the government can fix YouTube I
don't think the government make it fix
the NFL or anything else the government
can't do that much especially the
federal government because it certainly
can't do it well or efficiently so what
you can do and what is your right and
duty as an American is to use your voice
to express pleasure or displeasure or
whatever it else with any company so
when I tweet about YouTube people's out
you can see you don't want the
government of also you can't whine about
it no that's the whole point
you should complain so that hopefully
someone up there some of the higher-ups
go whoa you know there's a bunch of
creators out there and it's not just me
by the way that are complaining and
these guys seem to have some influence
and they're using our platform maybe we
should think about what our
decision-making is here that's what you
do in a free society I can't nobody's
forcing me to be on YouTube right and
they don't have to let me be on YouTube
but as long as they're letting me be on
YouTube I can use my voice to affect the
platform and that's exactly what you
guys can do and by the way one day I
assume and I have a reason to believe
that there's plenty of competition
coming down the pike don't want to say
too much you know what I mean but I just
think there's there's opportunity and
competition and capitalism that's the
answer to all of these problems alright
so here we go
reminder though you guys should click
that Bell on the subscription thing if
you click the bell and I think it'll
give you a couple options like how much
you want to be notified that way you'll
hopefully if they're not manipulating
this thing too much you'll see the
videos and all that bad that being said
our subscriber growth has exploded in
the last month every now and again
suddenly we see these odd anomalies and
then I contact them and they say oh
nothing's going on but people keep
telling me they're being unsubscribed
bla bla bla it's but a bunch of insider
stuff ok reminder one more time and then
I'm gonna dive into some questions any
of you guys that are watching this
either live or or after depending on how
many people jump in we have 20 slots at
each of the three shows in Seattle and
Tempe and in DC and if you screenshot
your tickets that you purchase while you
are watching this we will let you into
the meet and greet after absolutely free
they charge extra for that but we'll do
it for free and I'll say Heidi and all
that good stuff the links to the shows
are down below I've only done one
hour-long show so far it was the Irvine
improv couple weeks ago it was it was
awesome I give you my word but the
manager came up to me after she said
that was the first sold-out standing
ovation she had seen in 18 years of
working there I'm not making this up by
the way I'm a it's a little unclear
right now perhaps there will be a guest
or two from the intellectual dark web
that will join me on these on these
shows but I do about you know an hour
then I do some live Q&A fiddle around if
you guys or all kinds of fun stuff it's
great to just get back to my old life of
doing that it's it's completely
different than what
guys know of me sort of doing the
interview thing I'm also working on the
book again because I've been signing
because people come up to me after the
shows they want me to sign something and
they all have Jordans book so I've been
signing Jordans book which seems unjust
so I finally just because I've been so
busy it's been put on the back burner a
little bit finally really dove back into
it the last couple days so we're working
on that too a lot of good stuff
happening okay
super chat patreon questions let's do a
little something what's an example of a
view that you've been challenged on well
I think the one that everyone knows the
most is from last week's guest larry
elder although this happened about two
and a half years ago when we were
talking about systemic racism way back
when and that's when i still considered
myself sort of more part of the left or
progressive or whatever you want to call
it i was kind of just waking up to a lot
of that stuff and and larry just beat me
senseless there are many clips of this I
think on YouTube one of the clips
someone just took our clip straight up
which we're fine with it has about a
million views of Larry just beating me
that systemic racism meaning the laws
that are built into the system doesn't
exist it doesn't mean that racism
doesn't exist there are always going to
be racists there are going to be bigots
there are going to be people that don't
like black people and people that don't
like gay people and everything uh people
don't like white people and everything
else but you can't you can't change
everyone in a society and if you want to
change everyone who decided you're
probably a pretty bad person actually
but what you can do is make sure that
all the laws are equal so that everyone
has equal opportunity equality of
opportunity you can't get to that where
we're gonna have equal outcome because
some people are gonna be more talented
some people are gonna work harder some
people are gonna be luckier but you want
equal opportunity for everybody and I
would say that the way that you would
deal with so people always say well
alright well what about some historic
and justices and all that sort of thing
well then I would want education to be
focused on let's get it down to the
state level and let's make it slimmer
and trimmer and use money better and not
not you know poor so much money into
federal programs that don't really work
and having everybody just learn so that
they can pass the test without actually
learning and all that stuff so education
I think is where you can make a lot of
movement if you want to get people to be
more
surely equal but watch but Larry doing
that I think you know I've always said
it's it was sort of the best moment and
worst moment of my career at the same
time it was the worst moment because I
went into a conversation not ready not
armed so when I said this thing about
systemic racism and he turned it back on
me I was kind of like a deer in
headlights
so it was my worst moment for that but
it was my best moment because we let it
be uh you know I've told this many times
Tremayne you guys know this but we were
at aura TV at the time we go into the
control room right after the show and
there was a we had a bigger staff at the
time and then one of the producers said
to me you know you guys got to cut that
from the show and I said no we got to
leave that that is a human moment that
is a real moment I don't mind being
wrong I don't mind being humbled and I
don't mind being shown up actually but
it's done the right way you know what I
mean I don't want to be belittled or
attacked or something but he wasn't
attacking me he was attacking my ideas
and my ideas were shaky so I think it
was a good lesson for me and I and I've
heard from literally hundreds if not
thousands of you guys that it was a good
lesson for you guys as well where can
you get this hoodie this is the Reuben
report this is the official Reuben

she's she's great thanks for asking
someone on Facebook are you high no I'm
not I'm I have been drinking a lot of
coffee because it's hard to be on all
these flights and you know last week
when I came back from London we had to
tape a couple shows like that morning
and I was way jet-lagged I didn't sleep
on a 10-hour flight for some reason so
my caffeine levels all right are you
noticing a higher energy is that what's
going on here no I am NOT high and and
even if I was high
I mean I've mentioned this before I
don't smoke weed that often maybe once
or twice a week and I like indica which
is that's the one that takes you down I
don't need to be high to be more in my
head you know I mean I don't need any of
these doors open more I would close a
couple of them if it's possible so I I
do like a hit of indica 11 o'clock at
night and I watch The Simpsons or
Seinfeld and go to sleep so no I'm not
high promise you okay let's see from
Facebook any chance of continuing the
founding fathers slash historic figures
series yeah so first off I was so
thrilled that so many of you like that
all right people we are live on the
YouTube and the Facebook and I am with a
best-selling author a radio host and a
man who once beat me senseless in front
of millions of people larry elder
welcome back to the reuben report round
two well this will be around three how
are you this is so we're at Taraki
through c but if it was rocky no no it's
like Muhammad Ali and Frazier right Ali
lost the first one Frazier I leave lost
the first one one the second one and
then they had to had the big third one
thrilla in manilla this is thriller in
Manila since thriller I wish this was
more like Rocky because in the original
Rocky they it was to a standstill Rocky
one right nobody wins
rocky two rocky finally wins and then
three well at that point you're I think
Ruben the only question is which one of
us is ollie which one was Frazier all
right so you just sat down here but
we've already talked about comic books
about basketball
only black panther yeah about racism
about Trump I think we covered
everything by look all right well let's
do a little bit of in for the people so
I first I just want to jump back to that
original moment because I said it to you
last time you were here which was about
a year ago and when that that moment
where you really beat me senseless about
systemic racism that was about two years
ago already if not more at this point
and so many people I was just in London
two days ago and I did a Q&A and people
were asking me about it I mean that
thing really has there are many versions
of it on YouTube it's just caught fire
and as I said to you last time it was
sort of I view it as my best moment as
and my worst it was my worst because I
came to an intellectual fight without
the proper equipment and it was my best
because we left it in and let it be and
it was a learning moment for me and then
for everyone else well you had a lot of
class for leaving it and a lot of people
would have would have taken it out and
no one would have known it happened and
secondly the older one gets the more
difficult it is for one to kind of
change one's beliefs and for you to do
it at your age to rethink your
assumptions I takes a lot of a lot of
guts a lot of people don't want to do
that and I'd be a pretty depressing
thing don't you think well I agree with
you most people don't want to do it I
think we've fostered here's something
that is allowing people to do it
but most people don't want to do that
you know and it's funny we're in an
atmosphere where just a moment ago I'm
driving in listening to a talk radio and
they could CNN or MSNBC and they're
going on and on about how Trump has now
made lying the currency of the day and
and no one tells the truth any more
facts don't matter and they're talking
about the kinds of lying that Trump does
where he talks about the crowd size and
how much money he has and stuff like
that
the lies of the left are huge lies and
they damage the country the lie that
racism remains a major problem in
America it's a lie the lie that women
make 77 cents on the dollar for doing
the same thing that men do it it's a lie
the lie that rich get rich the poor get
poorer these are lies and these are big
lies that drive the left and drive votes
these are the kinds of things that
matter so when you sit across from a guy
like me and the first time we did it
when I really still felt I was part of
the left I was trying to reform the left
realistically I'm not part of the left
anymore it you know and again the
left/right thing is we talk about all
the time doesn't even have that much
meaning anymore it's really about
authoritarians libertarians and all that
but for all the years that you've been
doing this staking out conservative
positions for how many years publicly a
25 25 years was there a more sensible
left at the time was there a guy you
could sit across from that you disagreed
with intellectually but felt that it was
it was forthright it was honest you just
disagreed with the methodology and the
result sure there were lots of people
that I felt that way with and William F
Buckley had a very good friend John
killin Kenneth Galbraith who was a
left-wing economist they disagreed about
everything there were good friends
believe it or not Antonin Scalia's best
friend on the Supreme Court's Ruth Bader
Ginsburg what it requires is somebody to
recognize that if I have a position
that's different from yours it doesn't
mean that I'm a bad guy it doesn't mean
that I'm evil it means if I see the
world differently it takes a certain
kind of maturity to do that
unfortunately the gun to the place now
where if you don't believe that racism
is a major problem in America if you're
a black you're a sellout if you're white
you're a racist if you say something
negative about the Black Panther which I
just did I got hammered some some guy
told me that well it's because it's a
black person and a black director and a
black hero and therefore you don't like
it
I mean the star is guy named Chadwick
Boseman and I was fortunate enough to be
invited to see the premiere of 42 he was
brilliant
I saw the movie three or four times
I like him so much I saw him in a movie
about Thurgood Marshall which was a very
good movie probably not commercially
successful but it was a very good movie
and I saw him play in the movie with uh
we played James Brown he was very good
the movie wasn't that good but he was
good yeah so he's an intriguing actor
again I don't go to see a movie to not
be happy to waste my time yeah and
you're a comic book guy I mean I said
about comic books is cuz I've got a
whole bunch in the green room here and
you were immediately going on about all
this stuff you love so it's not like
you're walking into that thing to hate
it right and so the criticism is just
bizarre I mean what do you think I am
what do you think I do I get up in the
morning hate myself
gouge my eyeballs out try to claw my
skin color off me that's just and and
and and Dave I feel sorry for people
like that people have often asked me
does it make you mad it doesn't I feel
sorry for you if you are so trained so
indoctrinated to be let's rabbit against
somebody who just has a different point
of view there's a problem with you not
with me you know well on that note I owe
you a public thanks not just because you
beat me senseless and help me get here
but also because everyone knows about
the interview I did with Thomas Sol and
we had been working on for about three
years you sent him a note I don't know
if that was what pushed him over the
edge but I think it was one of the
really one of the big things that I've
been able to do here to bring some of
those ideas back and that's what you've
been doing for a long time he's like
he's like JD Salinger it's hard it's
hard it's hard it's hard to get him we
have to get him out once you get him
he's amazing yeah and I met him because
I was on c-span at the time I had a four
hour live radio show and c-span
broadcasted the entire show and I get a
letter from Thomas Saul it was like
getting a letter from Elvis and it said
my wife and I watch your entire show you
were great you you you laid out all the
arguments very well done and I wrote him
back and we got together several times
since then we become very good friends
yeah so I sense a massive shift
happening in politics right now and
clearly the center of it right at the
moment is with the black community I
don't even like using phrases like that
because I don't like that collective
thing but sometimes you gotta you got to
talk about things in a way that allow
most people to understand them so you
know what is it about two-and-a-half
weeks ago or so Kanye West seven words I
love the way Candace Owens thinks Wow
yeah now do you think that it is as big
a seismic shift
yeah I think it is a game-changer yeah
in the sense that Kanye West has 28
million Twitter followers I don't know
how many Instagram I know how many
Facebook would you add them all together
it's a boatload of people yeah he has
more influence on the way black people
think then Clarence Thomas Thomas Sol
Walter Williams Larry older put together
unfortunately and for him to to say that
and to begin the process of making it
okay for black people to rethink their
assumption they can okay to say I'm not
a Democrat that's a huge thing
ninety-five percent of black voters
voted for Obama Trump did a little bit
better but not a whole lot better if the
Democrats lose 10 15 20 percent of that
black vote
they are toast at the national level
which is why people like me have to be
vilified people like Candace Owens are
now direct threats to the domination of
the Democratic Party people like Kanye
West they've got to be put down they've
got to be demeaned you can't just say
he's got a different point of view
you've got to say something that's
fundamentally fundamentally wrong with
them otherwise how would you get 95% of
people to vote and see the world one way
we have to show them prove to them
convince them that they these guys are
against you that that you're a victory
at and these are victimizers and that's
what the left has done so successfully
and so when you saw the reaction to him
now again I briefly discussed this but I
don't think either one of us know what
his political beliefs are even if he has
he knows what they are but just just not
to hate Republicans not to hate Trump
for that is a big deal
think you know we're in Hollywood you
and I are is there an a-list our doing
it here I have no is there an a-list
actor and a-list actress in his or her
20s or 30s who come out and said I love
Trump none nobody you get some older
ones maybe they've already established
you've set a few things but is there
somebody right now who's hot on the
brink of stardom or just just in stardom
who's come out in favor of Trump know
you'll get a Trump just say basic
conservatives yeah because they'll be
damaging to their career it's not
possible that 100% of them think the
same way I don't think so
there's got to be a few but when they
come out and say something of course not
how'd you get a walk a fame star I'm
sure would you pay up for that bag well
when someone asked me that reporter said
how did that happen I said well this is
what happens when you make a substantial
donation to the Clinton Foundation I
have no idea I know that I'm nominated
all the time because I would get some
sort of inquiry from people telling me
that you've been nominated and nothing
ever happened so I didn't think anything
would happen lo and behold who knows
yeah when you think of the odd levels of
racism in this town like just the way
they do things like just a couple weeks
ago when they boot Cosby out of the
whatever it is the television weekend or
it's a long long ad so then they do
Roman Polanski the same day but it was
so obvious that it was like oh we got to
take care of Cosby now but we don't want
to make it seem like we're just booting
the black guy so where's the white guy
we can get rid of and you know I don't
think anything to do with black or white
I think they realize the hypocrisy I
think they realize if we're kicking out
Bill Cosby because of allegations of
rape yeah and here's a guy who pled
guilty to rape a teenager yeah and we're
celebrating him we have a problem here
so cause we caused them to have to be
consistent they do with with Polanski's
race or Carly's race he had to do with
with the with the bizarre concept of
somebody being booted out because he was
accused of rape and somebody who was
charged with it and pled guilty to it
he's okay I think in their own warped
worldview though if Cosby had been white
and they felt they had to get rid of him
they wouldn't have felt that they needed
to get rid of another white guy maybe I
get it is believe me it's possible but
they've caused us to think this way
right I'm just trying to get in their
minds I'm not trying to get in right in
our minds but okay I want to get back to
what you just said about the reaction to
Kanye because the reaction to me it
seemed it wasn't just people were like
he's wrong because he likes Trump
because you know lists for things that
are sensible it was you know Candace is
far right Kanye's on opioids ten other
smear pieces on both of them etc etc and
I think you're probably very aware of
why that is and you kind of hinted at it
but can you explain why it's always so
overboard
well again anybody who threatens the 95
percent monolithic black vote is an
enemy they've got to be dealt with
they've got to be put down
and black people have been indoctrinated
to believe that racism is this massive
massive problem in the world when in
fact it isn't massive massive problem in
America when in fact it isn't yeah I was
on CNN the last time I was on this Don
Lemon show I reminded them of a 1997
poll that seeing him and Time magazine
did where black teenagers and white
teenagers were asked is is racism major
problem in America I think you and I
might have talked about this and more
more white teams and black teams that
racing there was a major problem in
America and then when the poll asked is
racism a big problem a small problem or
no problem in your own daily lives
ninety percent of the black teen said a
small problem no probably in my own
daily lives that was in 1997
now that was before Obama and a for
Obama got reelected you're telling me
now things are worse now than they were
back then yet our so-called black
leadership people like keith Ellison
people like Louis Farrakhan people like
Jesse Jackson people like Sharpton the
the the the the neighbor observing on
MSNBC ha and CNN if you contracted on
those guys you'd be afraid to leave your
house if you were black so what do you
think is actually going on in the minds
of these guys I know you're not a mind
reader but like is it is it truly bad
intentions or is it moral confusion
political party it's hard it's hard to
say I think some of it is cynical some
of it is is BS recently for example I
just saw that a chapter head of an in in
a a CP chapter in South Carolina wrote a
big Facebook post about being pulled
over and the officer s about drugs and
asking him about why are you having such
a fancy car and he wrote a big piece
Facebook post about it unfortunately the
the officer recorded everything and it
turned out everything the guy said was a
lie this is the chapter head of the
n-double a-c-p in that town in South
Carolina now if racism so bad that you
have to make up stuff man that shows you
the the the call that victimhood has
right now for whatever remember the
young lady the actors from the movie
Django here in on Santa Monica and she
was apparently having sex with her
boyfriend in her car somebody called 911
recorded
she was wrong and a judge made her write
a letter of apology I mean really so
what do you do what do you do I was at
University of New Hampshire two weeks
ago and there were a bunch of protesters
there black lives matter sent a bunch of
people and I kept saying that I'm for
everyone having you know equal respect
under the law and I think you can't say
that's racist I even said black lives
matter because I was I did everything I
could to make it clear that I want us
all to be treated equally with dignity
with I mean you but you know what it's
like when you get some of these
protesters the ones that are not not a
not an average protester who may want to
listen a little bit and then and then
ask a question right when you get the
ones that are just there to to berate
and scream and the rest so one of the
one of the protesters are there a couple
at one point who were saying you know
something like we could be shot when we
get out of here all this hate speech all
of the stuff and I realized even though
I kept saying what I believe to be true
and what I believed to be right there
was almost nothing I can do
right so what do you do for those people
because I think the masses are shifting
a little bit but what do you do for that
you you're not gonna win every argument
you really can't and if somebody is
invested with the idea that the man is
holding me back that officers pull me
over because of my race there's not a
whole lot you can do about it you can
point to studies I mean it's been
studied under Obama in the 20 2013 I
think it was the National Institutes of
justice which is the research arm of the
DOJ did a study what called race and
traffic stops turned out 75 percent of
the black motorists who were stopped
said I got stopped for legitimate
reasons it turned out that you named a
traffic offense speeding driving without
your lights on driving without a seat
belt on driving without proper
registration you name the offense a
black motorist was what was more likely
to commit it and the NIJ report said yes
blacks are stopped more often than
whites are but the reasons have to do
with quote differences in offending end
of quote came out under Obama quietly
nobody talked about it how much of this
then is just a failure of what the
Republicans have done I get you on all
of the things that the Democrats and the
left had sold that are lies I get the
way they they manipulate all these
different minority communities but it
seems to me because there is a
resurgence now right like the first
thing I said to time is soul are you are
you excited that you know
you're having this resurgence he kind of
looked at me like well you know doing
this for 50 years
sort of or that that people now share
the clip of us endlessly and Candice and
Connie and all of this it this does seem
to be coming back but some of this has
to be on the Republicans too right that
it got so bad well yeah I mean the
Republic have done a bad job in in
marketing their brand most people don't
even know that the Democrats opposed at
thirteen fourteen fifteen amendment
sometimes unanimously most people don't
know that as a percentage of the party
more Republican voted for the passage of
the Civil Rights Act in the Senate and
in the house then did Democrats and
there's this myth that what happened is
it was a big switch in the 60s when all
the racists from the South left the
Democratic Party and joined a publican
party when in fact if you look at all of
the Democrats that voted against the
Civil Rights Act in the house and the
Democrats of all of them only to switch
parties became Republicans the first
Republican senator from Tennessee since
reconstruction was a guy named Howard
Baker who was a guy who's in favor of
integration so it's it's a big lie and
Republicans have done a poor job in and
telling the truth the other thing is
Republicans are gentle when they're
called racists they often just don't say
anything or ignore it I hope the moment
goes away recently Mike Kelly from
Pennsylvania a Republican member of the
House squared off with Maxine Waters it
was this bogus report that purported to
show that auto dealers jack over black
people by charging a more interest rates
to get loans when in fact all these
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty this week and joining me
today as a senior fellow at the Mercatus
Center at George Mason University as
well as a professor of economics at
George Mason Don Boudreau welcome to the
Reuben report happy to be here I am glad
you are here I saw you speak about a
year ago in Dallas I want to get the
exact title of the speech right it was
called can we bring sound economic
thinking to Washington that's a tough
task that was a year ago and I don't
think there's much sound economic
thinking or sound thinking in Washington
forget economics for a second these
things don't seem to go together these
days Washington seems to repel something
and it's it's a it's it attracts unsound
thinking yeah well you think it was
always that way or are we in unique time
well we're definitely in unique town
we're unique time so you know I was born
in 1958 so I came of age right when
Ronald Reagan write that you know the
end of the Carter Administration when
even Carter is pushing for directly
accepting deregulation taxes were being
cut airline to being deregulated Surface
Transportation is being deregulated
Reagan gets elected in 1980 Milton
Friedman it has this popular show on PBS
called free to choose Thomas I'll learn
about Thomas soul everything seems very
this world's fine yeah and so in my life
in my life
there was a period in the past when this
thinking was more sound I could quibble
with it yeah but compared to today it
was it was outstanding because it's
definitely it's definitely declined yeah
it's hard to imagine even that around a
time of Jimmy Carter that deregulation I
mean that that Democrats could have had
anything to do with that and yet they
Ted Kennedy was a major force behind
airline deregulation so it was something
it was something I'm not sure what it
was exactly it was something in the air
yeah starting in the late 70s and so you
know I was a young man and I just
thought it took for granted all right
this is fine you know we're winning and
then it culminates in 1989 with the
collapse of the of the of the
Iron Curtain in 1991 the collapse the
Soviet Union and then here we are 2018
and a lot of nonsense is back on the
front burner nonsense is back so let's
jump back though to the 70s for a second
because I watched an interview with you
this morning something happened to you I
believe in 1977 that that woke you up
and I think it sort of is a nice entry
into everything else that you know I
know yeah the most important day what
happened to you in 1977 you can come up
with a couple options now no I don't
date was was January 24th 1977 I
remember it was a I I was in college
only to please my mother my plan was to
drink beer chase girls I did a lot of
the former I wasn't successful with the
latter but I was then I was going to
drop out of college and work at the
shipyard where my parents worked so I
needed a class to fit my schedule I
needed the Monday Wednesday Friday class
so I think this class called economics
didn't know what it was took it and I
had a great teacher and so she drew
supply demand curves on the board she
said look what happens when the
government prevents the price of
something from rising to its market
level it creates a shortage
she says you remember the gasoline
shortages of 1973 yeah I was in those
and I just thought the beauty of this
economic explanation for the gasoline
shortage was so spectacular I wanted to
learn more about the subject and so in
very short order I just fell in love
with economics I'm still in love with it
to this day yeah so tell me what
happened after that so now you have your
spark and what what sort of what
academic pursuits did you have that got
you to where you are well I was very
lucky again she was a really good
teacher and it wasn't a famous economist
at all but she was a very good teacher
she took a great interest in her
students she taught economics as if it
was something relevant to the real world
rather than just a mathematical puzzle
and there was another guy at my so I
went splits called Nicholls State
University in Thibodaux Louisiana it's a
very small school but I had another
professor there who was into Milton
Friedman into Hayek into Ludwig von
Mises into James Buchanan who later
became my colleague at George Mason so
are we go to his office his name's bill
field and he would give me these books
and so I remember just rictus
tearing through these books and it just
made so much sense to me I realized in
reading these books that all my life I
didn't give much thought to politics not
much conscious thought but all my life I
think somewhere deep inside of me was a
classical liberal or libertarian someone
who believed it is it basically impolite
to button to other people's business and
and and and and not only impolite
Minister it's downright it's downright
offensive to do so yeah you just said
two of my buzz phrases so classical
liberal and libertarian now one of the
questions I get most because I define I
say that I am a classical liberal if I
need a look if I need a label on it
that's what I am and people will always
say to me because I talk about many of
the things that you teach about about
free markets and all that stuff and I
believe that freedom is the best way for
humans to flourish
people will say Dave you're really a
libertarian you're just holding on to
this definition of liberalism from a
teen whatever yeah do you see a
meaningful how would you define each one
and do you see a meaningful distinction
I don't see much of a distinction
depends on who you talk to some people
see see distinctions I think what they
both have in common may be distinctions
at the margin libertarians maybe tend to
be a little bit more radical but what
distinguishes classical liberals and
libertarians as I have broadly from
almost any other political group is the
consistent believe that any exercise of
power by the state must meet a huge
burden of proof the the the burden of
proof is not upon the individual to make
the case for his or her freedom its upon
the state to make the case to introdu to
override that freedom and I believe in
libertarians classical liberals as I
think of them believe that that burden
is a real one and it's a heavy one
sometimes it can be met but too often
the reverse is in place people believe
that you have to that the burden is on
those of us who who defend freedom to
make the case for freedom and I think
it's backwards so basically you view it
as sort of a bottom-up way of looking at
things yes right it's it's about the
individual first and the government is
not giving you your freedom it can take
it away however
by instituting all sorts of policies
yeah I'm in this case I am uh I think
John walke was right and John Locke
wasn't the only president John Locke
most famously made the argument in this
in the secondary is in government that
you know human beings have rights and
human beings delegate to the government
powers that you that that those who do
the delegation believe are appropriate
for the government to defend those
rights we can quibble about how
historically accurate that is but I like
I think that perspective is
philosophically correct right no
government gives me or you rights
governments are excellent at offending
rights it's taking them away but but
just because government is the protector
of Rights doesn't mean it gives us
rights just because farmers because we
couldn't live without farmers if no one
grew food and and and and didn't
ranching we would all starve that
doesn't mean that we owe our lives to
farmers one of the great things about
the society that we live in is that it's
a it's what Hayek all the great society
to be distinguished from Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society and that is it
is a society of many many individuals
each specialized in in doing various
things we're all coordinated by the
price system and by the rule of law and
so each of us makes a contribution to
the welfare of others but no one of us
is utterly essential and that's a that's
an it's a really good system I believe
yeah so I want to talk more about Hayek
in a little bit because you do run the
cafe Hayek blog
you mentioned the burden of proof that
the government has to meet to say when
it's right to actually infringe on some
of your rights or basically do things
yeah so this is where I would say the
the classical liberal and the
libertarian positions are a little bit
different I see some utility for the
state although I'd usually want it done
at the at the state level not the
federal level and libertarians it's sort
of hard to pin on when it's enough and
you you alluded to that when you talk to
libertarians how do you get to a place
where where it's not you know I always
make a joke it's like eventually you'll
just be in Mad Max or
the true anarcho-capitalists which I
enjoy talking to but I view it as more
of an intellectual exercise than a
practical yeah I'm very sympathetic to
anarcho-capitalism philosophically yeah
but I'm not a I'm not a blow things up
kind of guy I'm way too much of a
Hayekian to understand that you just
can't replace social institutions
wholesale society has to evolve to
wherever it's going to be if that just
remarks from being a realist I mean you
could blow it up well yes you could but
but history has a lot of really telling
examples about attempts to blow up
societies wholesale and those examples
have never turned out well right in
practice let me say among the people who
will call themselves classical liberals
right
none of them or ever whatever has
expressed any sympathy for Hanako
capitalism among libertarians some of
them will say oh no I believe there's a
role for the government but you do it
people who classify themselves
libertarian so who say at least at least
in principle I believe that a society
could exist without any formal
institution of monopolized coercion and
I am in that ladder ladder yeah I might
be the one classical liberal who will do
it or maybe that Canady by that
definition I'm a little more against
things yeah you know it's really sort of
the narcissism of small differences it
exactly in this little place all right
so what are some of the basic principles
you're a professor what are the basic
principles that people should know about
economics I know I'm giving you a wide
one there but someone watching this that
that's waiting for their 1977 moment
yeah so in no particular order right
number one
scarcity is unavoidable we live in a
world of scarce resources which means
that if you use some resources to do
this good thing you take resources away
from the ability to do other good things
they're both good things but we have to
choose do we want to do this good thing
I do we want to do that good thing
second thing to note in order to make
that decision we want the people
involved who are going to be affected
both by the loss of that which is not
done and by the benefit of that which is
done to express their opinions honestly
how valuable is this thing that we
propose to do and how
valuable is this thing that we propose
to give up in order to do this first
thing and and to do that we you you need
people on the ground who are actually
affected by these decisions to have a
meaningful say you don't want a third
party looking down making declarations
oh I think you should have that and I
think you should not have have that so
any social mechanism that gives each of
us as much of a say as possible in how
we use resources and and and make the
evaluations about what would what will
happen if we use resources in this way
and what will give up if we use
resources in this way that that's
important unintended consequences is
another important concept you know I had
Adam Smith in the wealth of nations
which is rightly considered to be the
start starting point of modern
scientific economics he famously talked
about the invisible hand and this is a
is a sort of an unintended consequences
kind of explanation it's not from the
benevolence of the butcher the brewer
their Baker that we expect our dinner
but from their regard to their own
interest they they don't dislike you
they value as a customer but they are
doing their jobs not primarily to help
you they're doing their jobs to help
themselves and you are buying from them
not primarily to help them but primarily
to help you and your family and in that
way everyone's a better so this is a
good unintended consequence but you have
you have bad unintended consequences as
well one of my favorite examples of a
bad unintended consequence is the
minimum wage you raise the minimum wage
it looks like you're helping low-skilled
workers and you might help some of them
but in fact you're putting other
low-skilled workers out of jobs and
you're keeping them out of the job
market for longer and so economists I
think what makes a good economist which
distinguishes a good economist from a
bad economist or non economist is is a
consistency in asking questions always
asking as compared to what as compared
to what where did that come from how are
you going to pay for that what did this
cost what will be the long-term
consequences down the road beyond the
immediate ones that that everyone can
see so it's just it's just a consistency
and asking those questions you know it's
funny as you're answering the question
and it keeps making me think well this
shows you why politics is so screwed up
because they get up there all
politicians on either side and they
either say $15 minimum wage Bernie or
Trump I'm gonna cut taxes on you or they
you know they love their bumper sticker
stuff yeah but nobody's ever said
unintended consequences in a
presidential debate
so how frustrating must that be as an
economist listening to people who are
not economists who really aren't experts
in much of anything
I don't know that Bernie's ever created
a business or made it anyone make a
dollar off him I'm not aware of it right
but but that must be incredibly
frustrating to hear non pros talk about
the things that you're a pro it is David
you know it's especially frustrating
about it it's not rocket science
I mean I mean I love economics I love my
profession and I really admire the best
among my professional colleagues Milton
Freeman Hayek but it's not rocket
science it's just this consistency of
always understanding that there are
consequences beyond the immediate that
that there's always a cost to something
that no matter how beneficial something
is it has to be weighed against that
cost so these simple the simple
understanding and the consistency in
applying that understanding it's not
difficult but so few people do it so it
is it is frustrating you years ago I
stopped a joke that I stopped watching
the evening people my age used to watch
the evening evening news stop watching
the news I've always threatened to throw
my shoes yeah through the through the
screen because you know the the
reporters they would very much like the
politicians they would report on the
immediate effect oh the minimum wage is
going to rise that that means that
workers will get a raise of you know
whatever the amount is well no it does
it it means that for some workers but it
means also other workers are going to
lose their jobs
some jobs the nature those jobs are
going to change employers aren't just
gonna sit back and say oh well we've got
to pay higher minimum wages so let's
just pay higher minimum wage where's
that money coming from where are those
resources coming from they have to come
from somewhere yeah so basically your
would be that the government's only role
in the economy is to make sure we're not
killing each other pretty much right
like it really it's a total lazy fair if
yes I am a very least if you're a guy if
if property rights are well-defined and
secure and there's a strong case of
government plays a role or can play a
role in helping to define and certainly
helping to secure property rights so
that's where your contract rights right
so that's where you're not in a narco
capitalist right well I'm close to being
here I mean III I'm willing I'm willing
to admit
we're grudgingly giving that to that I'm
willing yes I'm willing to admit that
anarcho-capitalism you know might not be
a Altima defensible position I am not
willing to admit that free markets are
an indefensible position however
property rights come to be however they
are defined however they are enforced
when you have secured private property
rights and freedom of contract which
includes importantly the freedom to say
no right I freed them to not contract
then people are led to pursue there are
people in pursuing their own interests
or obliged to help others out and that's
how this great society that we live in
and it is great continues to grow and
become more prosperous yeah so I
mentioned you right before we started
that you know I've had a political
awakening of sorts and I always say to
people I didn't really move but the left
went so bananas I ended up being friends
with all these libertarians and
conservatives or whatever it whatever it
is even for the differences we may have
but one place I have shifted is that I
am much more where you are economically
now and partly that's because I now run
my own business and have employees and
have to deal with that and I just wrote
two obscenely high checks for taxes for
the year I mean we are in California you
don't want to know how much that one was
and the federal loans even worse and
it's like you're more successful I get
the harder I work the more they want to
take from you and I tweeted something
about that on tax day and a lot of
people were angry at me and said well
it's it's this is the price to pay for
success would you rather be poor and I
didn't want to go on a major tweet storm
and
you wisely are not on Twitter but could
you could you give me something that if
I ever get in that fight again I can say
to people why that's not the right way
to think so let me start off though we
just asked you have you heard the the
story about George McGovern when he
retired from politics he makes no please
so George McGovern he retired from
politics I think I have the details
right he certainly had the major part of
it right he started the B&B you know in
his home state already like where this
is going
yeah and then he encounters all these
regulations you know labor regulations
safety regulations and he admits I can't
run out to whom he admitted is a long
time ago yeah he admits he's you know
I've spent all my I'm not quoting him
I'm yeah going from memory so I spent
all my life pushing for these things I
wasn't sufficiently attentive to the
downside of these taxes and these
regulations yeah and it's easy just you
we feel that we're finding ourselves in
the middle of a generation and maybe
even at the beginning of an era where we
struggled to sit down and have a
difficult conversation oftentimes I
don't believe that echo chambers force
you to interrogate your own beliefs and
censorship doesn't foster personal
growth but I believe that these things
can only be accomplished through
conversation through civil discourse
which is exactly what we're hoping to do
here tonight we're hoping to reestablish
a culture of conversation on this campus
where neighbors can disagree often to
the core of their beliefs and stand out
from that conversation stand up from
that table and walk away and still come
together knowing that we're all part of
the same community that we're all
Wildcats and so with that we invite you
Turning Point invites you everyone here
from the left of the aisle to the right
the front of the room to the back
everyone in here and outside to join in
this conversations in this conversation
and all conversations move forward to
have an open mind open ears and the
willingness to participate in civil
discussion with that I'd like you asked
join me would put your hands together
for the host of the Reuben Porte de
Reuben
thank you guys Wow I gotta tell you guys
I did not think my day was gonna end up
in a hockey rink when I woke up this
morning but here we are any hockey fans
here we have some hockey fans all right
I am wearing a cup because it's a free
speech event Ted you know I asked them
if we're gonna do this at a hockey rink
can I come in on the Zamboni but
apparently you know they didn't the
turning point doesn't have the money for
that kind of thing unfortunately that's
tough look at you guys you all came out
here to a hockey rink to listen to me
talk about free speech that's pretty
cool I'm very excited you guys feeling
good all right there's more outside I
think we have room there let be a seat
back there somewhere I think we could
probably let anymore I mean it's kind of
fitting that this is sort of how we
ended up right I had a hockey rink right
now if you think about it I mean you
know all that all the officers and and
policemen that are here securing this
thing these guys are doing their jobs
doing a great job actually give them a
round of applause for making sure that
nothing crazy gonna happen I guarantee
you you're not gonna hear anything
remotely close to hate speech or
anything like that there actually is no
such thing as hate speech and we'll talk
about that too but you're not gonna hear
any hate out of me I guarantee you you
know Candace Owens who seven words
really put her on the map this week I
love the way Candace Owens thinks from
Kanye and just seemingly has has changed
the world
I actually think putting aside where
your feelings are on Kanye for a moment
I think that him saying that offering a
little oxygen for people that want to
think a little bit differently just a
little bit differently if you don't want
to just take democratic dogma or leftist
dog more progressive Dogma if you don't
want to take that as the Bible you know
as the word from God but you need a
little room to think differently and I
think you guys probably do think a
little bit differently I hope
have I can see some interesting
diversity the left loves diversity
meaning the color of your skin and your
sexuality and all that stuff in your
gender and that's all that's all well
and fine but that's actually not the
diversity that matters the diversity of
the matters is what's going on in your
head what do you actually think right I
mean imagine if I was to look at you
guys and I can just I mean I can look
any of you and think all right white guy
there you must think that black guy
there he must think that asian girl
there she must think that that actually
is the essence of prejudice okay that is
the essence of prejudice prejudice which
means to prejudge and if you look at
someone and think that you know what
they should think because of the color
of their skin or their sexuality or
anything else you actually you're the
one that is acting bigoted I mean that's
that's actually the truth that's sort of
the reverse of how it spun these days
but the only way that we can actually
have conversations the only way that we
can actually figure out what's going on
and figure out how can we really talk to
each other is if you look at people as
individuals not as a collective and this
is kind of the key to everything that's
sort of wrong with society right now
we've somehow figured out that if we
group each other right if we group each
other and we play this really awful game
of identity politics that's really the
reverse of everything that this nation
was founded upon you know think about
this for a second you guys are here
University of New Hampshire I assume oh
so you go to the University here you're
at a great school I guarantee that
virtually every single one of you have
it better than your grandparents or your
great-grandparents virtually every if
really think about it think about your
grandparents for a second think about
your great-grandparents probably didn't
know them I guarantee you what you have
at 19 20 21 years old hell over you
however old you are is is a lot better
it's a world better than the way they
had it no matter what color you are
religion you are anything and this is
what identity politics has put us up
against it's placed us in this situation
where we're grouping people based on
their immutable characteristics so if
you're black you should think this if
you're Muslim you should think this if
you're gay you should think this
this which really as you guys know this
is what intersectionality is all about
the idea behind intersectionality being
that if you take all of these groups you
can kind of put them together like a
transformer or something and that there
will become something stronger but
actually what's been proven and
everything that's happening in society
right now is that they're becoming
weaker they're actually in a sort of
oppression Olympics where they're
competing with each other for victimhood
and and victimhood is not virtue and
that's really important you know what's
virtue you guys it's what the model of
this state is Live Free or Die do
whatever yeah I mean that's what we're
kind of depressing about the fact that
we had to switch menus here I mean the
state motto is live free or die or it
goes live free or go to hockey rink but
that's what virtue is living free or die
figure out what you believe what do you
believe and fight for that relief fight
for that even by the end of this thing
and we'll do a robust Q&A and I'm happy
to hear from any of you guys that
disagree with me on all this stuff
whatever you believe if you fight for it
honestly and and using your mind and
your faculties and not because you
silence people or because you pulled
fire alarms or called in bomb threats if
you fight okay can someone shut off the
robots I don't know how we're gonna do
this
guys I got you we'll get to it do you
think anyone's here for you guys is that
what you think what's going on here guys
[Music]
I like this guy more listen that is guys
guys guys do you think anyone's here for
you do you understand what you're doing
right now hey listen listen listen
guys guys guys look at me look at me you
I mean you can at least look at me there
you go all right look look look look do
you think anyone's here for you do you

guys were the intolerant ones we are the
intolerant ones right you know you can
see all you guys getting real violent on
them you know nobody's here for them but
guys okay seriously shut the up
shut the it's pathetic you're
pathetic human beings really I'm all
about open exchange this is what I do
for a living I will gladly take all your
questions all night long
you are what is wrong with society you
serve right there you are what's wrong
with society and you ma'am you what's
wrong with society I know the police are
happy to kick you guys out well just
refresh me for a sec what were you
saying again cuz I yeah just relax relax
okay I believe black lives matter I
believe every life matters I believe
that we should not be prejudiced towards
everyone anyone and we should not have
laws that are dictated that are
different for anyone we should be
treating everyone equal that is the
beauty of America I'm gonna talk to my
friends right here the beauty of this
country is that people from every walk
of life have come here no matter the
color of their skin or their religion or
whatever they came with look what it
says on the on the Statue of Liberty you
know what I mean she didn't say bring us
your best she said bring us your poor
your huddled masses and you know what's
happened because of the incredible
freedoms that we have given people in
this country everyone look around this
room this is diversity but it's as I
said earlier it's not just diversity of
color its diversity of thought and I'm
gonna come up here I'm gonna talk about
a lot of
things that the Conservatives aren't
happy about and conservative groups
invite me to do that so I appreciate
that you've quieted down and if you
grant me the same respect that I'll
grant you that's how you change things
but that what you just did right there
that's not how you change things it is
how you change things just not change
things for the better anyway how's it
going on this side guys anyone want to
get anything up there their chest so
this scourge of identity politics it
truly it truly is rotting away at
everything that's right with this
country the country was founded on the
idea of the melting pot right that you
come here from wherever you came
wherever you came more people have come
to America to make a better life for
themselves than any place in the history
of the world that is absolutely true
does that mean it's perfect does no does
that mean we don't we've made mistakes
absolutely does that mean that there are
n justices now of course but there is no
place which is why no one ever leaves
any of you guys planning on leaving
America yeah nobody goes even Lena
Dunham she's still here it would be nice
if she left but she's still here okay
nobody leaves and that this is the irony
so you have this set of people now who
go on and on about identity politics and
everything that's wrong with America and
where this evil patriarchy and where
this evil racist society and they demand
at the same time I love this one they
demand at the same time that we should
have open borders so that I guess the
other people can share in the horrors
that are America that is not sensible
you see what I'm saying it's not
sensible people what is sensible is
coming together regardless of what your
differences are in the only way you do
that is if you view people as
individuals that every single one of you
that I can look at you right there
looking at me with the glasses you we
were we were having a moment there
you're looking away from me okay I'll
look at somebody else how you doing
buddy right here the only way I can
judge you I know nothing about you
nothing about you I know nothing about
you but all I can figure out is that if
we had a conversation I could figure out
what you think and why you think it and
hopefully if you thought some things
that I thought were wrong
through civility I could get you to
think differently and perhaps you could
get me to think differently so let's
talk about some of our differences
actually because turning-point
rights meet all of these things and
Charlie has no problem being on stage
with me and we have plenty of
differences I am I'm for gay marriage I
even married a dude I mean that's yeah
I'm gay okay Zippity damn dude I thought
I was gonna get an applause for my
oppression but alright yeah it doesn't
matter it just doesn't matter what you
should want are equal rights so any of
you can marry whoever you want to marry
you want equal rights that's all you
want you don't want extra rights the
conservatives invite me to these places
I'm what I would describe as grudgingly
pro-choice I think it's a horrible
decision to have to make I know two
women in the last year in my life who
had to have abortions or who chose to
have abortions I know this is for the
Conservatives this is this is a bridge
too far and I've had plenty of people on
my show I had a debate with ben shapiro
about abortion and you know I've picked
20 weeks as the I like where this one's
going oh is that rain is that I'm gonna
need a little more on that one yeah is
this a local thing what's going on do
you want to ask me something yeah you
could ask me something see this is this
is what happens every time
truly ma'am if you want to ask me
something I'd love to hear a question
from you no so you don't have a question
is there anything I said that you didn't
like did you not like anything you don't
want to comment on that either you see
what's going on here I really want you
guys to understand this because this is
so consistent we can get some robots and
clones here you know repeating some
stuff and now you have a jar with a
whatever the hell you got in there and
I'm I am seriously willing to have a
conversation with you right now let's do
it let's do it but you won't question me
and you won't tell me you didn't like
anything who's winning here do you think
right now who's changing more Minds me
or you
yeah I think I think I made my point all
right yeah no it's yeah he's got some
moves over here it's not true what they
say about white people can't dance I saw
that that was very impressive
he had that two white guys have two
moves like a shoulder thing and a little
toy but see this is what's happened this
is what has led us here to the irony
this is so ironic you guys don't
remember this but ten years ago when you
guys were whatever you were 10 11 12
years old the Conservatives were the
intolerant side the Conservatives
were the ones that were screaming
against gay marriage and the
Conservatives were the one talking about
all sorts of other stuff that was
actually intolerant this is intolerant
now and you don't get extra credit for
your skin color I hate to tell you so
yeah I mean that's just how it is I I
would love to have a conversation with
you and you want to rattle around a can
okay so that's fine but this is what has
happened you guys the Conservatives the
conservative how many of you actually
consider yourselves conservatives make
some noise make surprised if you
consider yourself a turd let's do it
yeah good for you guys you're gonna have
jobs in the future you're gonna have
cars and family and property and things
and it's pretty good that's sweet all
right how many of you consider yourself
libertarian any libertarians you can you
can do Moyes instead of clapping you're
here I love I mean really fundamentally
I think I'm probably although we're
gonna talk about classical liberalism in
a second I think actually more than
anything I'm a libertarian in that I
want you to live free and I want to live
free and the only exchange that we can
have there is that basically I'm gonna
have my stuff you're gonna have yourself
and you can't just come onto my property
and take my as long as we'd get
that far
that's a pretty good Society and that
means that occasionally people are gonna
say things that upset you that means
that people are gonna do things that
upset you but that's the beauty of this
thing you know there are some societies
where nobody's gonna say anything that
upsets you you know where that is that's
North Korea you don't want to be there
want to be there you are gonna be upset
every now and again but you know what
words are not violence I know that the
left has tried to trick you into
thinking that because somebody says
something that upsets you that you're
either allowed to punch them or silence
them or call in a bomb threat or force a
venue to have to move but that is not
your right you have the right to free
speech and your right to free speech the
whole purpose of your right to free
speech is that you have to respect
someone else's right to free speech now
what you can do by the way is protest I
hope that there are thank you I hope
that there are protesters are or world
protestors out there with as many signs
as they want to have doing their thing
and as long as you do it peacefully and
you don't encroach on anyone else's
rights that's your supposed to do that
in a free society it's beautiful but if
you use your free speech to infringe on
somebody else's you're actually not part
of civil society at all so all right
back to the libertarian so I like the
libertarians I voted for Gary Johnson I
had Gary Johnson on my show he didn't
know his name he wasn't the best
candidate ever not a great candidate he
was the first that ever turned me
against weed because he couldn't
remember a thing I mean he
really was just this would have been the
year 2016 would have been the year for a
Libertarian candidate I mean we had two
of what I would say are the worst
candidates in in at least as candidates
we can talk about Trump in a second but
at least his candidates we had two of
the worst most polarizing candidates
ever and all a libertarian had to do was
come in and understand some basic
and Gary just dropped the ball he just
every interview it was like watching a
muppet right it's too easy to beat up on
him so forget how many of you guys
consider yourselves classical liberals
classical liberals all right a couple
classical liberals they're very
respectful that's what I like so
classical liberalism this is interesting
because people say to me well what's the
difference Dave you say you're a
classical liberal and how is that
different than being on the Left how is
[Music]
all right so one of the things that you
write about a lot is that the idea of
middle-class stagnation is actually
wrong yes we hear this all the time from
politicians for I think my whole life
that I was ever caring about politics
it's always that the middle class is
shrinking and the extremes are getting
bigger
etc etc but you actually take a
different position yeah this
middle-class stagnation thesis is stated
as if it's an established fact with no
arguments against it it's just wrong
I think you were born in the mid
seventies right 76 okay so according to
this thesis it was a it was right around
that time mid 70s
that's okay right so the american middle
class had been chugging along upward it
hits the mid 70s and then it's been
stagnant ever since so ordinary
Americans today so goes the thesis live
no better than ordinary Americans lived
when Gerald Ford was in the Oval Office
and you think is it crazy i mean i have
i'm unfortunately old enough to remember
the mid 1970s and although one's own
personal experiences shouldn't be a
basis for scientific conclusions they're
not irrelevant i know it may come from a
working-class US family i remember how
we lived in the 70s i don't know what
cars were like I remember television was
like what health care was like things
are a lot better today for ordinary
Americans and so I number years ago just
started looking into this this thesis
there are data that you can find that
the people who proposed this thesis
point to that that lends some
superficial credence to the thesis but
something that here just some of the
problems with with these data they
adjust for inflation in ways they vastly
overestimate the amount of inflation
that we've had since the mid 70s so mean
vastly under counting the growth in real
incomes since the 70s a lot of these
data will look at household incomes well
the side the typical population of the
American household has fallen since the
mid 1970s today it doesn't sound like
much but today it's about 11 percent
lower than it was in 1975
but that's actually pretty significant
so the same amount of income in a
household now is spread over fewer
people and so the individual people are
richer meaning we're just not having as
many kids that's we're not having as
many kids with we're becoming wealthier
so that now well maybe not in the last
ten years or so but for much of this
period younger people have been able to
move out of their family their parents
homes at a younger age and start the
households younger older people are able
to continue to live by themselves rather
than move in with their with their
children
the quality of goods and the variety of
goods and services that American
ordinary Americans have access to today
is astonishing compared to what it was
just 40 years ago i sexually spend a lot
of time looking at you know catalogs
from the mid-1970s you know Sears
Roebuck catalog and then you can look at
you know sears.com today and you can
look at the prices that would charge
back that course nominally they were
lower but then you just take those
prices and you divide them by the wage
that the average American earned back
then and do the same thing for the
prices today and divide it by the wage
of the average American earns today and
what you find in almost all cases is
that the amount of time it takes to work
in order to earn enough income to buy a
pair of jeans a shirt a washer and dryer
and your an airplane ticket is
dramatically less today America we don't
have to work as much today as we did
back then in order to get the things
that make our standard of living as high
as it is so today just the people that
believe in this that they just do a
great cell job I mean how did this meme
how did this idea get out there because
you hear this all the time everybody
this is one of the few things that you
hear on both sides of the aisle yes yeah
in fact I and yes I think the a lot Paul
Krugman says it all says it all the time
and I think in a way kind of backfire on
people in the left if they keep saying
it and I thought bleeped it's one thing
that that helped
drum up spa pew low support for Donald
Trump yeah you know middle-class
Americans even stagnating so let's do
something about it let's elect Trump
there's an interesting psychological
thing there because I think maybe most
people think they're in the middle like
they probably think it no matter what
like they if they're not
stitute and if they're not you know
worth 20 million bucks you probably
think basically you're in the middle
yeah so it's a way of making it about
you even if it's actually not the case
yeah you question if I'm not sure
exactly exactly why it caught why this
myth caught on and it has held on with
such tenacity this myth has been going
has been around now for 20 years it
started in the mid 1990s yeah and
there's actually an economist he's now
at Southern Miss mu and Dallas he was at
I'm an economist at the Dallas Fed guy
named Mike Cox and he's the first one
who really started looking into this
well let's let's look at various
measures of living standards let's look
at how much ordinary people are
consuming today compared to in the mid
70s it's a comma let's look at what
happens when we adjust for income using
better inflation adjusters come in what
Mike Cox found and I I my work is
derivative of Mike Hawks is that once
you start doing this this whole
middle-class stagnation thing just
crumbles into dust it's just not true
it's not to say that there are no
problems it's not to say that the middle
class wouldn't be even wealthier had
they're not they've been better policies
in place whatever you think those
policies might be but it is to say that
it's just crazy to believe that an
ordinary American or an ordinary
American family in 2018 has a standard
of living that is indistinguishable from
that of an ordinary American family in
1975 yeah do you know what basically the
economics look like if you're considered
in the middle class right now like the
economic they're really like numbers
that you look at on both sides and go
alright that's what middle class is
because I think that's part of the
problem it is this sort of amorphous
term yes yeah III don't believe that
they're I'm you know the the the the
Census Bureau among others they will
divide household income into quintiles I
don't recall what those numbers are at
the moment but a common definitions you
take the three middle quintile so you
get rid of the top 20% you were at the
bottom 20% you have the middle 60%
that's that's the middle class you know
upper middle middle middle lower middle
but the Census Bureau does something
interesting from time to time yeah so it
divides
household income into different
categories less than 15,000 15,000 and
25,000 on on up to like I think 250,000
and above and it tracks adjusting for
inflation it tracks household incomes
over time and you can in a perverse way
find in these data that the middle class
in America is disappearing right but
it's disappearing into the upper classes
if you look at the percentage of
households in America who are earning in
the lowest percentages right they're
shrinking the only only categories in
which the percentage of households in
the US are increasing or in the upper
income levels and so actually I think
the very lowest it might have ticked up
a little bit like the less than 15,000
but in the great middle they have fewer
households percentage-wise
earning in those categories today but
more earning a hundred thousand dollars
annually and above and so in one sense
yes it's freaky but it's getting richer
there's no evidence that we're getting
poor there's no evidence that it's
stagnating yeah so we talked a little
bit in an ancillary way about taxes
earlier so I'm not an economist but I'm
gonna lay out what I think is sort of a
fair tax system that's consistent with
all the ideals that we've talked about
here and I want you to either I'm gonna
blow your mind or you're gonna tell me
that I'm way off so something like this
this is what I've said a couple times is
that I'm basically for attacks flat tax
you know get rid of exemptions let's say
it's about 15% but we can we can fiddle
with the numbers but let's about 15%
I would exempt everyone making let's say
less than like 40 grand maybe even 50
grand so that they have a little more
disposable income that they can do
things which which I think is good for
them and good for the economy and then
just because I'm still I still have a
little bit of a guilty liberal in me I
would even be willing to do some sort of
progressive tax if you're over say 10
million a year or something like that
even though I know it's not right and
I'm sure you can get rid of that by the
end of this conversation but there's
still a piece of me that says that but
basically saying that for the huge vast
majority of the country
10% little exemptions maybe a little
trickery on the high end I think that's
consistent with the sort of classical
liberal idea of minimal involvement and
an equality of opportunity and what
you're all paying in and hopefully it
would cause a slimmer trimmer government
yeah so some glimmering in your eye and
say yeah I said earlier I think one of
the distinguishing features of an
economist has always asked us compared
to what right as compared to what we
have now I mean that that's it that's
close to perfect right I'll take it
right yes compared to what my actual
ideal would be given that we're going to
have taxes it's not quite my ideal I
would indeed get rid of the the the
progression yeah at that the only part
of me I think that still exists so the
way I look at the way I look at people
who earn those kinds of incomes assuming
the urnament and most of them do they
earn these incomes in the market that
means that these people are especially
good at making life better for ordinary
Americans they're especially good at
creating jobs they're especially good at
at increasing the value of my 401 K but
what would you say when people say but
they don't need a yachts and helicopters
and all that I would say they earn it's
theirs it's not up to me to say what
they they earn it's their money I can't
make an argument against that I know
it's there's you know the your system is
better than what we have now but
definitely if we're going to have income
taxation a flat tax and I'm willing to
have the exemption for the lower lower
incomes flat tax is the way to go not
only does it prevent a lot of political
chicanery you know messing with brackets
and but it's it is economically the
better system when you tax all
income-earning activities at the same
rate then the relative prices of
different types of labour services stays
the same when you have progressive
taxation you create greater distortions
in the economy and that that makes us as
annex a resonance of this economy it
makes us all a little bit less wealthy
than we otherwise we'd be because the
economy has to deal with these
distortions so what do we do about
spending because at the end of the day
that seems at least when we're talking
about this from a government perspective
that it's really all about spent
that you can tax out the wazoo and
regardless of whether that tanks the
economy or or fixes it or whatever that
that's almost irrelevant if you just
keep spending especially because the
amount of debt we have and we know we're
never gonna pay it back which is why
it's probably good that we have a lot of
bombs but that's a whole other
discussion you know because one day if
China calls in the debt you know we're
in a lot trouble but but how do you rein
in spending cuz this seems to be the
thing that all the Trump people right
they all thought he was gonna rein in
spending this is like the opposite pact
and and it's it's I think it's more than
ever before it is it is so I think the
big property question is I don't know
how to do it you can speculate about you
know changing the Constitution put in
constitutional balanced budget
amendments constitutional caps on
spending I'm skeptical of all of those
things government has many ways to get
around these these paper tiger
provisions the problem is the problem is
Americans today look to government and
they and they basically you're spending
other people's money and so if you're
spending other people's money it's easy
to spend my my former colleague Russ
Roberts hid a piece in The Wall Street
Journal many years ago entitled
something like if you're paying I'm
having steak so imagine imagine oh we
all go to a restaurant and you know the
different menu items right well if you
go to a restaurant and you and you're
picking up your part of the tab right
you you you may order steak but that's
because it's worthwhile to you and
you'll have to pay for it but you might
if you have to pay for you might or sick
you might order a less expensive dish
but if it's gonna be shake even so it
couldn't be shared right then based then
the bulk of your extra expenditure is
shared with the people you're going to
dinner with and that's true for every
person at that dinner right and so you
wind up with this bizarre circumstance
where every person acting rationally
winds up ordering too much winds up
asking of the restaurant too much we
wind up asking of our government too
much but we have to pay for the
resources do not fall out of the sky
free they're coming from somewhere and
and because we're spending too much
we're taking resources where they would
be better used and putting them where
really none of us want them to be used
but we all wind them using them and I
know you said before that an antic total
story is not you know proof of a bigger
theory but as you're saying that it
reminds I don't think I've ever said
this probably publicly before my
brothers
a party when I was a struggling comic
and I had no money you know I may be 50
bucks in my pocket I don't know I was
the best man all his friends were in
banking and lawyers and they had all had
money big rollers were at a fancy one of
the one fancy place the Borgata in
Atlantic City the one fancy you know
nice place in Atlantic City and we're
sitting around this huge table at a
really super fancy restaurant and I'm
and all the entrees are 8090 hundred
bucks and I'm looking around like you
know what am I gonna do here I was gonna
get the chicken for maybe fifty bucks or
something I'm sitting with my my
brothers one friend who also was kind of
struggling like I was and we're both
saying are we're gonna get the chicken
for 50 bucks we go around everyone's
gettin steak lobster steak lobster steak
lobster steak lobster it gets to my
friend Josh he turned he's the whole
time he's going I'm getting the chicken
for the waitress says what do you want
he goes lobster and then I just said
state like that like and it's exactly
what you're talking about
you suddenly lose concept of what's in
your pocket somehow it's gonna happen if
the bills gonna be shared then the the
the the the additional cost to you of
ordering steaks that is a tiny fraction
of the actual additional cost of the
steak and that's the problem with with
government today we have people in
Washington spending other people's money
for the benefit of yet other people and
when you do that you just get too much
too much spending we we've I don't know
a better way to say it doesn't sound
very economic I understand it but we've
lost and the ethic of respecting other
people's property once government gets
money once government officials figure
out something that they fancy is is good
and may or may not really be good which
doesn't mean necessarily it's worthwhile
but maybe a good project that doesn't
mean that therefore we should go ahead
and spend money on it there's an
insufficient connection between the
spending and the and and the and the
experience of the cost of the resources
that go into the spending how much are
you think of this do you think is not an
economic problem but a political problem
so that if a politician was to get this
right let's say there's some magical
politician out there who really
understands economics but he knows if he
goes to the Senate so I suspect Rand
Paul's kind of like this I think he
basically gets this man and he does
fight the best fight generally
that I think he can but that they guys
want to get reelected and saying to
people we're gonna spend less on you
even though you know it's it's the best
thing we can do for you actually it's
gonna free you one day and it's not
gonna take the economy and make us you
know slaves to a foreign nation all that
it just doesn't work politically because
it's not the easy answer of a bomb or I
think it's exactly right let's face it
each politician has a time frame that
extends to the next election right so in
the case of members of the House that's
only two years case of the president
that's four senators six that's not a
long time frame anything beyond that
time frame is irrelevant to that person
politically today or to make it relevant
that person has to have an ethic that is
very rare and unusual among politicians
and people with that ethic tend not to
be not to succeed in politics yeah a
handful do manage to get in but very few
so you have people without that ethic
and they're just looking toward the next
election which is that most again the
only non two years away for a House
member and so if the bills coming to two
and a half years from now if the if
whatever other costs are gonna happen
two and a half years from now or or
alternatively if if taking some action
that someone that's gonna have cost
today but but huge benefits no matter
how huge two years for now four years
for now I'm not gonna take it right
because it's it that will do nothing to
get them past that next hurdle which is
getting elected reelected so in a very
depressing sense or in a sort of
dystopian future sense are we in its
certain way are we on a pathway to
destruction no matter what if you think
about it I mean if you take that line of
thinking long enough right so we have a
sort of weak political crew dealing in
ways that are the reverse of how
economically we can be successful pretty
right like pretty much always going off
the off the cliff yeah so I despite all
that I've said I remain optimistic and
I'm not I'm not sure why right I feel
the same way I remain optimistic we we
still have a respect for private
property in the United States we're
still a very entrepreneurial culture we
still
hold politicians to some this is less
now but it's there's some level of
responsibility I say that I'm my
libertarian friends are gonna kill we
were saying I think there's something
there's something there yeah look the
political problem has always been there
I think the cost US Constitution in the
past up until about eighty years ago
Wow

before we did anything because this is
my third event in a row through
turning-point and today partly with the
Iran Institute I was at UMass on Monday
and it was a great event totally
respectful and fun challenging questions
with you guys really just a great
exchange of ideas everything that I'm
that I'm living for at the moment and
then I was at the University of New
Hampshire yesterday live here tonight
yeah well it is closer to died yesterday
is just an absolute circus there they
could not secure a room on campus
because of threats they moved us about
300 students they moved us to a 7,500
seat hockey arena which was I thought
that was in an episode of veep right
just like a faith background or
something and just and screaming and
noisemakers and all of the things that
you guys have come to know these are the
things that are shutting down civil
discourse so I hope tonight that will it
will do it severally we are completely
open you know Your Honor I just
discussed we will we will take any and
all questions that you guys have we have
no plan right now other than to talk it
out and we agree on some stuff some
stuff we disagree on you notice she's to
my right and I in some ways I Bobby's
become somebody that is to the right of
your on Bill which now I'm sure
Huffington Post will call me all right
did you guys see this today at Vanity
Fair another one of these hit pieces I
mean these people are not everyone that
I'm friends with apparently is a Nazi
which you know as a former member of the
IDF so the point is if there are any
protesters here he knows how to use a
gun so be careful so we're gonna talk
about free markets we're gonna talk
about free speech we're going to talk
about all the things that I think you
guys know that we we care about and and
we're excited to be here so I thought
first off I'm gonna throw something kind
of interesting at you I think something
seriously big shifted in the universe
last week because of Kanye West you know
I'm more the Frank Sinatra guy myself
but but Kanye I think by tweeting seven
words I love the way Candace Owens
thinks he offered oxygen to the space
that I think you guys are in and that
were in he just offered a little space
for some other people to think a little
bit differently to look a little more
critically at some of the issues that
we're constantly talking about and and
he's talking about the individual and I
with a second that happened I called you
and I said this is a moment for you guys
because Kanye West is talking about the
individual do you think I'm crazy for
this thought no I think I think we are
at an interesting moment in time I think
that I actually think they laughed and I
know I know a lot of people disagree
with madness I think the left is in
retreat the left is completely and
utterly bankrupt and I think New
Hampshire was kind of evidence of that
when you're completely bankrupt when you
have nothing to say when you have
nowhere to go
you get noisemakers and you make lots of
noise because you can't actually
communicate anymore you all you can do
is yell and shout and scream and you
know you you're like a little child
because you'll completely all you have
is emotion you have no mind anymore and
I really think that the left is
it's not dead obviously because it holds
the universities in a whole mass of
political power still
but the radical the crazy the nutty left
is an illustration of that this whole
thing is in decline and even Kanye West
sees it right so it's gotten to the
point we even some people in pop culture
are looking at these people and saying
no no this this is nuts
the there's not there's no there there
there's nothing there's nothing to hold
on - there's no values there well what
do we do with these people and I think
of all the communities the black
community should be the one at the
forefront of this because they've been
betrayed by the left for generations now
you know since the civil rights movement
where yes the people stood up for them
and and marched with them and and they
deserve all the credit in the world for
doing that but since that the war
poverty has not helped them all the all
the whole welfare state everything that
the government is tried to do to
so-called help them has actually made
them worse off and things are worse I
mean Chicago is probably the best place
in the world right now to see this right
because they are worse off than if
they'd never be in a war on poverty if
they'd never been you know certain parts
of the Civil Rights Act if they've never
been this massive attempt somehow to
help them you know say mother government
is here to help you right that is a
awful awful sign when somebody says that
right to you so I think I think I think
the bankrupt I think they're out of
ideas I don't know if you saw Bernie
Sanders the latest idea is that the
governor's guarantee a job to everybody
everybody gets a job like like if you
can't find a job in the private sector
we'll pay you 15 bucks an hour you can
dig ditches and fill them in right all
day long they can fill they can fill and
and this is a serious proposal we've got
two other Democrats who are running for
president who have endorsed this Booker
and not Camilla Harris the the the
from New York the New York senator yeah
go ban right
I mean this is naughty did you just
announce that they're both running for
president I did and you know that's just
so stupid great that that there's
nothing there's nothing there the real
question is and they were question is
okay so what what now right what what
were places that what fills the void
what what is what is the alternative to
this nuttiness and the idea to Kanye
West is talking about the individual I
don't know what he means by that I see
all kinds of tweets by him some of them
make sense of them completely weird yeah
but if we can start having a discussion
about the individual and what that means
and and there may be what individual
rights mean and and what is
individualism mean and maybe get him a
copy The Fountainhead maybe can read
that then it becomes interesting then
we're talking about the right kind of
things if the alternative is sorry make
America great again
then I'm dubious you know may come I can
eat again there's a big guy I don't know
that that's the answer that I like this
idea of talking about the individual
well look I I don't know that it's the
answer either I don't think look as I
said in my direct message last week I
don't know what Kanye's political
beliefs are at any moment you know all
of these people that are now worshipping
him as a hero they most likely will come
to regret it when he does something
nutty but I think he offered oxygen to a
space that needed a little oxygen you
know a few of us what what Eric
Weinstein calls the intellectual dark
web there's been this group of about
twenty people kind of trying to just say
you know what some of us are on the Left
sam harris some of us are on the right
ben shapiro but we're trying to figure
out what the answers are without
destroying each other and i think Kanye
offered a little air to that but also
what's interesting to me is the way the
media suddenly just went on a complete
rampage against him
and the lead moment in in Twitter
moments was about far right Candace
Owens far right Candace Owens who's had
dinner at my house with me and my
husband I mean this woman she's not a
gracious black by the way not that black
people can't be racist but they're
calling her anti black the way that
they're you know all these hit pieces
run on Kanye did you guys see the the
piece that Maxine Waters released a
statement about Kanye that he should
basically stay in his lame and and and
it's like this is actually the soft
bigotry of low expectations that that
someone dares to think differently and
you say no no we're gonna put me back
plantation where we've kept you yeah
exactly and this has to be thought no it
definitely and and I think it also gives
a you know space now to other people in
the entertainment business that you know
as you know yeah a silent because
they're afraid and he gives space to I
think that minority community that feels
betrayed by the left to speak out
against it and and that they've never
spoken they're not afraid to speak to
that point I almost every day now I get
a direct message on Twitter from
somebody that's a public person either a
musician or an actor or something
telling me that they agree with me but
they won't say it publicly I got
something today from somebody in the
music biz that most of you probably know
saying that they they're afraid to come
out of the closet what do you mean I
mean that was the phrase they used I
mean were you part of friends of Abe the
secret society in Hollywood do we always
talk about that it was before I before I
moved to LA you have to be a secret
society in Los Angeles called Friends of
Abe which was all the directors produces
lighting people everybody in the film
industry who was left of I don't know
Lennon a right of lenders Yeah right you
know right of right of of a leftist
agenda and they used to get together and
there was a coffee shop in Hollywood
where like every Wednesday they would
get you know people would get together
and wasn't that many of them and then
once in a while they have these big
gatherings and I went once in a while
3,000 people and a lot of people like I
know that guy I know you know all these
movie stars they you don't know and they
all stay silent because they were afraid
we're talking about 3,000 people some of
them the biggest some of the biggest
producers in Hollywood some of the
biggest
actors in Hollywood will not come out as
being conservatives of being a
libertarian or being anything other than
the left because they're afraid for
their livelihood but that's why I love
doing these events with you guys because
I truly believe this that we are living
in such a unique time right now where
everything is up in the air the world
truly is yours when you get out of
college like ever there is nobody that
knows what's gonna happen tomorrow much
less than a year from now nobody knows
the Trump has just tossed the chessboard
up the pieces or everywhere and you guys
will be able to make the future and the
funny thing is when I agreed to do some
events with Iran and AR I I got people
telling me that oh you know I'm working
with these these far-right maniacs and
I've got to know you pretty well and
you're constantly screaming about
freedom I mean all you care about the
only thing you care about is freedom and
so it leads me to this I want to do a
little poem let's do it by applause so
that the live stream people can catch it
how many of you at one time were on the
left yeah I could be in that area yeah
and and how many of you would say you're
conservative now how many conservative
yeah it supposed to clap yeah still
doing the hands okay how many of you are
libertarian there's always there's
always one loudly there's a few Chuck
Barry Johnson ladies and gentlemen right
here yeah how many of you are
Objectivist
[Applause]
how many of you are progressives do we
have any progressives here with a little
rule and you you kind of oh we got one
right here and you kind of nodded half a
little bit you're I don't know if you
were just shifting in your seat but
that's great I mean I would love for
progressives to be here and I'd love to
take a question from you maybe at the
end so all right so we have a little
oxygen in this space I do believe
perhaps something has happened where
we're starting to win a little bit I
think that there's their lashing out the
way they are because if they're sort of
like a wounded animal at the end who
you're trying to put your hand out there
and offer them something and they only
know how to strike back so just very
quickly last night when I was at
University of New Hampshire there was a
what you know there's they're screaming
and they're shouting me down and they
got their noisemakers and their
repetitive droning I mean the the chants
they're like robots or zombies or
whatever but there was a woman in the
back who I had been talking about Jordan
Peterson and we'll put him on the map
obviously was the bill in Canada the
trans bill that if you misgendered
somebody you could potentially face a
fine which perhaps could have become a
law and then imprisonment and all sorts
of things and Jordan said I have no
issue with trans people but I don't want
the government to be allowed to tell me
what I can and cannot say I think most
rational people can agree with this and
I told that story and there was a trans
woman in the back and she started
yelling at me and you know telling me I
don't like trans people and all that and
I told her that I want her to have the
same rights as everyone else and live
with the same dignity as everybody else
and and hopefully find someone that
loves her in life and can find goodness
and all that stuff and I said is there
anything that I just said there that
would lead you to believe that I'm
transphobic or a bigot or anything and I
could see it in her she didn't know what
to do so she basically just yelled that
she hated me or something to that effect
and we have the video of this and maybe
we'll release it I don't want to make it
about her because I think you know the
other guys often are attacking people I
don't want to attack people I want to
attack ideas but I but I thought it was
a good example of where we're at at the
moment which is there ain't much left
but now my question for you is how do
you show people that they can get out
and that they can realize that freedom
and limited government and free markets
and all of that
truly is the answer well first before
you say that I just want to support what
you said because I think it's really I
mean there really is a backlash against
these people and and you can see it
I think Berkeley is a great example of
this right last year Ben Shapiro tried
to speak at Berkeley and and tifo went
nuts and everybody went nuts and it was
shut down and the University did nothing
this year the university said no we
believe in free speech we're actually
gonna let everybody speak I mean you'd
think they got that earlier but you know
maybe it took a few riots and this year
but real spoke and yeah the university
has spent six hundred thousand dollars
to protect Tim six hundred thousand
dollars so a little Orthodox Jew could
give it up each do you realize how
insane that is but in an odd way you
went to Berkeley and I went to Penn it
was you know and I don't think they
spent six hundred thousand but they it
was a lot of security well it was wrong
it was fine but it happened and the
point is that I think even
administration's that some of these
universities are figuring out that maybe
the wrong strategy is to just let this
run amok and and that's a good sign how
do you do it how do you convince people
and this is the key because the key is
to have an alternative to have an
alternative to what the left is offering
and there has to be something positive
that you have to inspire people with and
I think that positive has to be at a
personal level I think I think politics
takes care of itself I don't think that
debate at the end of the day and a
challenge at the end of the day and the
discussion at the end of the day needs
to be at the political level the real
question is do you as an individual want
to be able to make decisions for you do
you value your life do you value your
life enough to be to one to live your
life to the fullest and be able to make
decisions about who you sleep with and
who you marry and about what kind of
business you want to start and what kind
of profession you enter without getting
permission right so once you leave
college do you get to make decisions for
yourself is your life valuable enough to
be able to you to be able to make those
decisions for yourself that is really
the key question and if the answer is
yes I want to make decisions for myself
then everything else follows easy
from that and yes I have the tool to
make those decisions my mind we all have
this reasoning capacity we all have the
tool to make decisions and to live well
for ourselves then everything else flows
from that then it means that but out
right but out of my life leave me alone
which is all basically what we're asking
politically is let the government be
there to protect us from people wanting
to intervene in our lives with force and
other than that leave us alone
because we can take care of ourselves so
I'm gonna make your own blush here for a
second I've told the story once or twice
I think I said it to you to your face
what last time you did my show but he's
not just saying this this isn't just
stuff he's saying he's really telling
you something on the human level that is
very true and I know it because I heard
it from him and it changed my life so as
some of you may know we were on Ora TV
the Reuben report was on or a TV for a
while after we left the Young Turks and
the show that's when the show really
started blowing up and bigger the show
got the more that the network wanted
from us and and some of their failing
shows they were kind of letting skate by
and I couldn't really understand that I
thought you need to be giving us more
now so that we can expand but instead
they wanted to take more from us and I
had never met you before before you had
been on my show you came in we sat there
for an hour and your own talked about
rational self-interest and why you
should fight for the things that you
believe in and that you shouldn't just
give of yourself endlessly and
everything else that you just said and
we finished that interview I walked
right into the control room and my team
was in there and I said to them guys I'm
gonna leave here and I hope you'll come
with me and fortunately the guys that I
wanted to come with me came with me and
from that moment of two months later we
launched independently and my life
completely changed and the show has
blown up since then and I've used those
ideas I mean the way that I've even
built my business has been with these
principles so I know that these are real
things these aren't he's not just
sitting here saying take charge of your
life as if as if it's some like you know
mumbo jumbo it's something that's real I
know and I'm saying it because it
affected to me this is like a thousand
times more important to politics
I mean what's really important what you
an individual do with your life whether
you take responsibility for it whether
you really understand that you got one
shot at this
there's no we play every second you live
you don't get again right never waste a
second in that sense it's about living
life to the fullest and making the most
of that life and not just you know it's
hard for when we're this big that we
[Music]
in case you've been hiding under a rock
or if you just don't have Twitter bless
your heart Kanye West made his return to
the platform and proceeded to crack the
internet with seven dirty words which
would have put even George Carlin to
shame last Saturday Kanye tweeted I love
the way Candace Owens thinks if you
don't know Candace Owens she's a black
conservative woman who originally went
under the YouTube moniker red pill black
Candace caught fire online around the
summer of 2017 and my interview with her
in which we discussed her evolution from
a lefty to a conservative is one of the
moments that really put her on the map
it was the first time that she had been
able to explain herself in her own words
in a long-form conversational setting I
don't want to rehash the whole thing
right now but Candace is no stranger to
controversy and you may remember that
infamous debate that I had with Candace
and Blair white late last year the whole
thing was a debacle I make no bones
about it but hashtag save Dave trended
on Twitter so Who am I to complain 2018
has already been a huge year for Candace
as she was hired as communications
director for Turning Point USA the
largest conservative college group in
America since then she's been touring
the country with Charlie Kirk talking to
young people particularly young black
people as why they should embrace the
victor mentality rather than the victim
mentality this is included directly
attacking the black lives matter
movement as well as democratic policies
which Candice argues has decimated the
black family and the black community
just last week Candice Charlie and I
spoke at Berkeley to a wild crowd I'm
proud to say that we had agreements and
we had disagreements and even though our
styles are different no doubt Candis
certainly goes for the jugular more than
I do I always enjoyed doing events with
her and seeing her evolve politically
something I know a bit about myself
she's learning as she goes and as she
said to me in our interview if I had
swallowed the red pill then she had
snorted it beyond any of the politics
though Candice is a friend and our
differences don't define us they
actually bring us together all right
back to Kanye for a second beyond the
headlines I don't know what ton about
him although I'm obviously aware enough
to recognize what a transcendent
cultural figure he is
not only is he hugely successful in the
music world he has a hugely successful
fashion line and is married to Kim
Kardashian who has her own Empire you
may not like the guy for whatever reason
but make no mistake he is an absolute
mogul I may not like or even respect the
influence that celebrities have over
culture these days but Kanye is truly
someone who can move people's minds with
what he raps or with what he tweets this
is exactly what happened with these
seven words immediately after Kanye's
tweet in support of Candace the internet
went ablaze Twitter moments lead story
was about Kanye support for far-right
Candace Owens Candice was called anti
gay and racist something I'm still
confused about as she's had dinner here
with me and my husband at our home where
her anti gayness never seemed to leak
out as for Asus there's nothing like a
white lefty telling a black person who
doesn't think as they demand that they
do that the black person is the actual
racist against their own race irony is
truly dead folks on Monday this week
Kanye refused to back down despite
hysterics from the media he tweeted out
a bunch of videos by another former
Rubin report guest best-selling author
and Dilbert creator Scott Adams in
essence these videos were Scott talking
about what a freethinker Kanye is that's
it next thing you know the usual
suspects like BuzzFeed mediate The Daily
Beast and others were labeling Scott
Adams as far-right we've seen the script
a million times before with anyone who
dare challenge leftist orthodoxy be it
Candice Scott Colin Moriarty Jordan
Peterson or even little ol me when
mainstream media has moved so far left
that this wide collection of people are
all smeared with the same charges of
far-right racism you know that the
Overton Window hasn't just shifted it's
shattered the authors of these pieces
aren't journalists they're activists or
as Candace says they aren't journalists
their hit men to recap we have a new
player in Candace who is fearlessly
saying how she believes that the
Democrats have used the black community
for decades and that the victimhood
mentality of the left is the root of
this problem this by the way is similar
to what plenty of other conservatives
have been saying for years and yes this
includes even black
conservatives like my former guests
Larry elder and Thomas soul the voices
of black conservatives and others
espousing similar ideas has been largely
ignored by the mainstream media however
and that is exactly why everyone is
freaking out about Kanye's tweets he
just gave oxygen to a set of ideas that
the Democrats and the mainstream media
don't want you to hear and since they've
controlled the narrative for so long
they've relied on the usual smears of
racism homophobia and bigotry instead of
strengthening their own ideas your ideas
get fat and lazy when you don't have to
work them out because you've owned the
narrative for so long this is where the
modern left finds itself right now if
Candace's views are far-right then that
means that about 40% of America if not
more falls into that category I do want
to address a different lurking danger
here however I know Candis and I believe
her to be forthright and passionate as
she figures this all out I obviously
don't know Kanye nor any of his
political beliefs so we have an
interesting match here where Candis is
now the rocket and Kanye is the jet fuel
if Candis doesn't do the intellectual
work to really figure out what she
believes and why she believes it all the
while being under the insane microscope
of the media that's gonna be praying for
her to fail well then the rocket will be
faulty and this experiment will blow up
what if Kanye says something absolutely
crazy tomorrow which is not only
possible it's probable or something
that's counter to everything else that
Candice believes he's been known to stir
the pot and I can only assume that
something like that will happen either
intentionally or by mistake
does her rocket ship run out of fuel in
mid-flight where does that leave this
incredible momentum over the past year
when I've talked to people like Eric and
brett weinstein jordan peterson ben
shapiro larry elder Thomas Saul and many
others what I'm most impressed by is how
complete their outlook on politics and
more broadly on life is they don't jump
from conclusion to conclusion depending
on the political climate they try to
really understand what they
fundamentally think so as new issues
arise their responses are complete
rather than conflicted this is something
I've really tried to incorporate into my
thinking and something that I know many
of you are trying to do as well
this
we'll also be Candace's challenge now
and I think she's up to it but only she
can decide that for herself it blows my
mind that every conversation we have in
this room seems to become more and more
relevant as time goes by for all I know
we'll have Kanye in that guest seat soon
enough whether he is just rocket fuel to
boost ideas or is he the rocket ship
that will get us to the solutions
remains to be seen but make no mistake
the issues around free speech political
correctness and the uncomfortable truths
that might be the answers to those
questions have just been levelled up are
the players ready for the next level
we'll soon find out
[Music]
joining me today is a national security
expert the best-selling author of
defeating jihad and a former albeit
brief strategist to president Trump dr.
Sebastian Gorka welcome to the Rubin
report thanks Lambie David I'm happy to
have you here sir first off that voice
you have a very have you ever done any
voice-over work at all
it's don't tell anybody but it's my
dream when I wrote defeating jihad and I
asked about the audio book I said I'm
gonna get to do the audio book write to
my publisher you can do the prologue
then we'll get a pro I was crushed all
right so the next book coming out in
June why we fight I'm sorry if you're
listening Margie I'm doing voiceover so
I really can't believe that so first up
we have already spent a good amount of
time talking about Star Wars so I am
very impressed your green room and that
post I'd never seen that in the quarry
poster before yeah I'm the LP so I'm
impressed that is the original 1977
poster I wonder do you think because
we're obviously gonna talk a lot about
national security and foreign policy and
all that do you think any of your
thoughts related to foreign policy have
anything to do with Star Wars because I
do think at some level some of the way I
view the world has been shaped by some
of the lore and yeah I'm not sure if
it's cause and effect but but absolutely
in terms of good and evil I mean totally
I mean the first three movies are about
good versus evil before they become this
social justice warrior absurdity so yes
I mean but as much as being the son of
people who lived under Nazi and then
communist dictatorship these things kind
of flowed together so Star Wars and
growing up under the child of people
escaped from dictation right there yeah
all right so you are in California
because you were talking to a couple
conservative groups here in California
people don't believe that conservative
groups could exist in California but I
mentioned to you before we just had
Governor John Kasich on he was talking
with Arnold Schwarzenegger at some
conservative groups here in California
so there it seems like something is
happening in California I don't live
here but I come in and out to do these
events as something's happening so
something clearly is happening the
energy I felt at the the events here is
it's like the energy I feel at events in
Virginia or elsewhere like Texas and
there's a commonality whoever you speak
to they keep mentioning the same things
they talk about the gas tax they talk
about sanctuary cities they talk about
the burden on businesses when you get
these things repeated enough times you
realize something is happening in
California who knows where it'll go but
this this isn't the state I used to say
you know the People's Republic just lost
forever I'm not so sure anymore
really so do you think this could be
something that could happen as soon as
our next our gubernatorial election
that's coming up now or do you think
this is sort of long term maybe
presidential election 2020 year all I'll
say is the following with the election
of Donald J Trump to president the
political rulebook has been shredded
burnt buried and the Donald Trump jumped
up and down on it it's gone so so any
past expectations any trend lines are
irrelevant I mean I traveled with the
President to we flew on Air Force One to
Youngstown Ohio back in June and this is
steel Valley right this is the heart of
a blue-collar Democrat manual laborers
and we we arrived at the stadium
and the president was in the back I was
you know doing selfies with you know the
crowd who do love the crowd selfie I've
seen many polls what does it cost me you
know they want a selfie yes sure why not
yeah so I got to engage with these
people and I realized that in this
stadium around twenty twenty-five
thousand people everybody was either a
former registered Democrat their parents
their grandparents or all Democrats and
then what happens when the president
went when the First Lady Melania comes
out of the stage it erupts the building
erupts with chants of the USA drain the
swamp and this is democrat territory now
if that can happen in youngstown our
Youngstown Ohio who knows what can
happen in California yeah so I want to
talk a little bit about your history and
your parents and growing up that I'm
just mentioned but as long as we're on
the on the first part of the Trump
portion of this let's just keep doing
that I heard you at the turning point
USA event in December give a speech
which I really thought was wonderful and
you described Trump as the ice breaker
and what I've been saying around here is
that I view him as the bull in the china
shop we wanted a panther to knock over a
few things but we got the bull and I
think that really it's really the same
analogy that we're using there so can
you just yeah I don't further on that a
little bit so the United States was
covered for at least 30 years in this
massive permafrost layer of ice which is
political correctness and it had frozen
over the media education politics all of
it to the extent that by the Obama
administration
federal government was telling you who
could use which bathroom right so just
insanity and then along comes a guy who
the first day I met him in summer of
June 15 in his office in Trump Tower the
first thing I knew about this man is
he's the Kryptonite of political
correctness I mean he couldn't care less
about what the New York Times or CNN
says about a given issue so along comes
this man layer of ice frozen over the
country BAM slams into it like an ice
breaker and smashes through the ice so
he breaks a pathway for for the nation
to to open up that sea lane and my
argument to conservative audiences is
that this is great this is monumental it
wasn't going to be the patter patter
never have one it had to be the ball it
had to be the icebreaker but if you know
your physics of ice breaking you can
send that you know thousands of tons
worth of ship in there with its tungsten
how rides up on the ice slices through
it but if you don't have the flotilla
behind it that comes up and keeps that
passageway open what actually happens in
real life is you send one ship in breaks
a path almost instantaneously the ice
comes around the bow andreen its itself
right around the ship and reseals so
this is the moment in the conservative
movement well we have to get serious of
about what does it mean to be a
conservative in the 21st century what's
the role of government how does a
national security look so on and so
forth
Donald Trump is the catalyst now we have
to do the heavy lifting of ideology and
politics and policy yeah do you think he
will years from now when we look back be
anything other than the catalyst like
how do you how do you consider his ideas
compared to traditionally conservative
ideas because just in the last couple
months after signing the omnibus thing
you know right now when we're take we're
taping this a few days before we're
gonna air it but there there's a big
mess in Syria we're not sure you know if
there's gonna be more intervention or
not he seems to be doing some things
that are probably a little more big
government than perhaps you want
horst certainly than his base seems to
want so where do you think he fits
actually between catalyst and and the
flotilla so first things first
I hate Able's personally IIIi think
labels is lazy thinking and in the case
of Donald Trump very relevant and then
they have no application our credit
Monica Monica Crowley my friend with
this the weekend after the election was
David horowitz's was it a restoration
weekend yeah in Florida yeah which was
either going to be awake or the party
that was and Monica gave a great speech
in which he said look everybody
misunderstands who this man is he was
never an ideological candidate because
you simply cannot put him in a box
because of what he does whether it's his
attitude to gay marriage whether it's it
just he's what it's just a mixture he
was never an ideological candidate he
was an attitudinal candidate and she
nailed it now what does that mean look
at the last 40 years this guy's 71 years
old he's not going to change he is
is what has he done for the last 40
years as a professional he's been
committed to one thing excellence
whether it's a golf course in shopton
whether it's a skyscraper in New York
its excellence and all he's done is he's
taken that concept and tried you know
translated it into excellence for
America once more and that doesn't fit
into neat neoliberal neocon paleo calm
it just doesn't fit
he's about getting stuff done and being
the best but so how do you link that to
what the general conservative movement
is now I get what you're saying about
labels and I say it all the time the
labels now especially because of Trump
the labels are all the brothers at this
point but the thing that I'm struggling
to fully grasp about the Trump thing is
how does this connect to you know when I
see it you right now you have a huge
split right we've got the the Trump base
and then you've got the never Trump errs
and these people are that should be kind
of lining up they can't quite get there
and how do you connect those things like
how do you connect what yeah but the
never Trump is a pathological I mean
pathological when when Bill Kristol you
know who's all obsequious and all he a
genus to me in the green room at Fox
when he tweets out actually tweets out
in a choice between the deep state and
president Trump I choose the deep state
yeah bill you're not a conservative
you're a subversive right okay get out
of the tent get out of the tent so
that's never going to happen
the broader question of what is
conservative me today we can't answer
that because have you seen a good
article a really good article which
understands first principles founding
principles about what Trump ism is or
should be I haven't I've seen a lot of
people who think they know what they're
talking about but who've never met the
president so I think with a lot of work
to be done but it's not going to be done
by conservative establishment
individuals if the NRA is not going to
tell you who Trump is right and the
Inara is not going to revitalize the
conservative establishment right this is
a new year it's exciting but we have to
get to work to define what it means
so that to me is why it seems so obvious
that you're so passionate about this
that nobody else was going to do it and
I think that's also that's sort of what
Monica was saying and it's sort of what
Horowitz has been saying for a long time
even when he sat right there
that no one else was gonna break through
and now it's imperfect but at least
there's me you know be brutally candid
you know I grew up in the UK to
Hungarian parents of escape communism I
went through the the private school
system in the UK stiff upper lip and all
that stuff for the debating Club so the
president's style is not exactly the
style I'm used to right I get to get
used to it and I understand what people
of issues the biggest people biggest
thing people have issues with on the
right are his tweets I get it
but guess what who was going to defeat
Hillary wasn't Jeb Bush yeah wasn't even
say at a cruise none of them were going
to the only person who could cut through
[Music]
all right so I want to shift a little
bit to foreign policy because I think
that's sort of one of your one of your
would you say that's one of your main
strengths love my my claim to fame was
kind of terrorism and stuff like this
but but really deep Donna I'm a strategy
wonk
yeah grand strategy is my thing okay so
we'll talk we'll talk in the lens of
strategy then so as we're taping this
right now I mentioned earlier it's gonna
it's gonna sit on the shelf for a couple
days so I don't want to get too lost in
anything that happened today but at the
moment it's a little upside down in
Syria you know there might have been
strikes already from when we're taping
this hungry just had elections in your
Wikipedia that I referenced earlier it
says you worked for the guy who just won
you apparently you never worked for him
you know with his party I wasn't Victor
lorta bonds advisor yeah which is what
it says on Wikipedia at least what's
your general thoughts on foreign policy
strategy like what is a sensible policy
and and his Trump applying that view
first things first
the great irony of our nation is that we
are the most powerful nation the world
has ever seen and until recently we have
been the dumbest and most a strategic I
mean we haven't done we haven't thought
or acted strategically since about 1989
November the 9th with a burning wall
fell and and this is you know how have
we acted what would you say that since
then it's just 90s was just this kind of
confused what is national security about
there lurching for the snooze button
just who are the threat is it China is a
weapons of mass destruction is that you
can Slavic it was just a mess and then
we had 2001 and 9/11 and we had just
neocon disasters it's not an accident
these guys were former Trotskyites
because they're so naive the way they
look at the world that we're going to
create democracy at the end of a gun
barrel in a country with 36 languages
that defeat Alexander the Great and the
British Empire and the Soviets it
couldn't be stupider if you tried so you
know we've done some very very foolish
things because we haven't stuck to the
basic
strategy at the end of the day is about
one thing it's about prioritization
based upon interests right you've got to
say some things are more important than
others and guess what some countries are
more important than others and in a
postmodern secular world you're not
allowed or no all countries or Vanuatu
is important networking wrong it's not
that everyone loved the people Vanuatu
but no it's not a geostrategic import to
the country of America so number one we
have to prioritize and I think this
administration I doff my cap to Nadia
shad low HR McMasters deputy
she held the pen in the meetings that I
was in on the new national security
strategy of America and I'd tell you
David it is the first document of that
name in 30 years that deserves the name
national security strategy every
administration has them this is the
first one that says this is what we
stand for these are our values these are
our friends these are our enemies and
this is what we're going to prioritize
prior to that it was laundry lists of
well we're gonna have to Front Wars
we're gonna save the whales and you know
no so you have to prioritize and finally
this administration is about America
first
we are not isolationist nor are we
interventionist this is really annoys me
that if you're a conservative for 20
years you were given two options button
a invade other people's countries and
occupy them mm-hmm
button B B you know around Easter and
close the you know the curtains on the
Pacific and the Atlantic and say we
don't care about anybody else well guess
what it's the most powerful nation in
the world there is a large palette of
options - there's got to be something in
the middle area it's about being smart
and it's about our interests and it to
summarize the president's approach this
isn't official but I like it we have
numerous former generals an active
generals from the marine corps of the
highest level of the administration
showed the droid Chiefs chief of staff
secretary defense an interesting thing
is they all come from the same Marine
Corps division not just a Marine Corps
the same division and that division has
a motto no better friend no worse enemy
that's America first
so when you see someone like John Bolton
being now part of the cabinet and if you
were to look on you know not that you
can get truth out of Twitter but the day
it was happening you know everybody's
saying this is gonna start World War
three and but you know just the general
hysterics and now John Bolton is
definitely suspect more of a neocon than
you're comfortable with is that I don't
think it's fair to call him a neocon and
I don't think he's ideologically driven
if you watch the videos that he you know
we recorded of his speeches 20 years ago
he was sounding very much like Trump
we're American we have interest you want
to work with us fine if you don't
there's a problem so and I think it's
very telling that within 40 minutes of
the president's tweet about John coming
on board massive Alton gave an interview
on Fox and they asked him about what he
gonna be like as a national security
adviser and he gave a very interesting
answer he quoted Dean Acheson and the
the the doyen of foreign policy in
America and I don't if his true story
but John said Dean Acheson was once once
asked how do you have such a good
relationship with the president who
serve and Dean Acheson said well it's
very easy we may disagree on policy
issues but at the end of the day I never
forget who was elected president and it
wasn't me that's a John Bolton 2.0 he
understands that unlike his predecessor
HR McMaster he's not there to lecture
the President or foist
his version of what you should do on to
the commander-in-chief he's there to be
an honest broker and provide a palette
of options because guess who gets to
decide the person who was elected
president so I am very excited about
John I'm as excited about Mike Pompeo
coming from the CIA to the State
Department
the we are in very good hands David so
how do you make sure if it's between the
pure isolationists and yeah and the
neo-cons are some writing something like
the nation builders something like that
how do you make sure that not everything
that you do outside of our borders
becomes something much bigger I mean
look we're still at war in Afghanistan I
don't think anyone knows why I mean can
you can you tell me why we're at war in
Afghanistan can anyone tell you why why
we went why we went to
pianist on in October one is the only
reason we should be there today
nothing's changed okay the idea that
girls go to school I love it I get it
and that people can listen to music
freely and the Taliban won't execute you
my parents lived under communism like my
father suffered under fascism he
protected his fellow Jewish classmates
during the occupation of Budapest I get
it I don't like those kinds of systems
but there's only one reason we were
there to make sure that that piece of
land mass would never ever again be used
to execute mass casualty attacks in
Manhattan in Washington or in a field in
Pennsylvania
end of story it's not about building a
Ring Road around Kabul they're not even
the Soviets could finish it's all about
building hospitals I'm sorry you never
make the ideal the enemy of the good
what the president does is he looks at
things as questions of possibility you
cannot be a massively successful realtor
in the toughest market in new you are in
the world which is New York real estate
if you have a filter that distorts
reality I mean either this square
footage is worth X or it's not worth X
according to the market and that's how
he approaches these issues so
Afghanistan it's only important to make
sure bad guys don't use it again to kill
Americans in America so yeah so you
would say or at least if you were if you
had to guesstimate basically what he
believes you would say that he believes
that still keeping us there at the
moment is still accomplishing yeah oh I
don't have to guesstimate on you though
yeah so you believe that as well because
it just seems unclear that he will he
will never I tell you right this 71 year
old man who is now the most powerful man
in the world will never ever ever buy
into a nation-building scenario anywhere
outside of the United States not
happening for the next seven years
end of story and the idea that you have
my followers on Twitter tearing their
hair out that bolton's going to have us
invade Syria guys get a grip on reality
and stop talking about crisis actors and
tinfoil hat garbage it's not gonna
happen while the president's the
president well that I tweeted something
to that effect the day of the Bolton
thing because it also reminds me that
people don't understand basic
deterrence that you have to bring in
people that you know talk a big game so
that per North Korea's hello yeah right
the man who was going to take us to war
what did he do I think the success in
North Korea today has in a large part
being part have been thanks to his
tweets because that's how you deal with
dictators you make fun of them they hate
that
and then you ridicule them right and
then you do what you scared them
oh and lo and behold they want to
negotiate for the first time in 65 years
well isn't that interesting do you think
there's any chance he would ever give up
his nukes about three percent because at
that point what leverage does he ever
left right so that well you still think
it's worth having the talks to figure
out what we can absolutely because
what's happened for the last twenty five
years
escalation escalation escalation II we
we have given into nuclear blackmail
since Bill Clinton so yeah we have to at
the end of the day we have to remember
1953 was not a peace treaty 1953 in
Korea was a ceasefire in an armistice
mhm that is actually a war that's just
simply been frozen for 65 years would be
nice to have a little bit of a peace
treaty or something yeah how much of
what's happening in the world right now
do you you must be thrilled I assume
with everything going on at the UN that
Haley has basically walked in there and
John Bolton 2.0 yeah yeah I mean she
strikes me as I almost wonder did Trump
really know what he was getting with
Holly yeah did anyone think anybody did
yeah we're way did you know her at all
where do you think that that come I
don't know as a friend she found herself
she found herself and more power to it
what what usefulness do you see in the
UN at this point because it seems like
truly it seems like the most corrupt
should be pushed into the river I mean
really well the building's basically
other now they're gonna quote that and
go you see he was calling for her I'm
right I think to be knocked into the
room look the idea was a good idea in
1945 in San Francisco that let's have an
organization that stops us from killing
60 men
in people again but when you lock in
dictatorships like China and Russia in
to the Security Council with veto power
and then you create this this empire of
un organizations I mean it has there
been a year in the last 20 years that we
haven't seen a UN scandal whether it's
money for oil whether it's UN troops
raping children in Africa have we seen
it one year without un scandal I don't
think so so try and reform it if you
can't question the validity of what it
does forget I'm not talking about you
know the the the the children's rights
organizations and food food security I'm
talking about its main mission which is
stability and safety it's failed
abysmally yeah what do you make of the
endless obsession with Israel that
something like 47 of the last 51
resolutions are against Israel usually
voted on by countries I'm sorry but that
alone is a reason to dissolve the UN I
mean what a lack of moral compass
what an utter bankruptcy of the morality
that there are nations in the world that
actually still have slavery going on
slavery where we're basic human rights
for individuals are not guaranteed based
upon sex based upon lifestyle choices
and you're going to lambast Israel the
only real democracy in the Middle East
yeah i think i think you know i mean
that that in and of itself is reason
enough to question the nature of the UN
so is the u.s. sort of in an odd
position where it's like if we don't do
anything nothing can get done sort of
and that that then puts us endlessly in
these Quagmire's or at least in these
positions where we can either watch the
world burn or get involved in things
where we may end up adding to the
burning in the first place like for
example you know with Russia going into
Crimea you know they gave up their
weapons right they gave up the weapons
they said all right NATO's gonna take
care of us but what that really means is
the United States is gonna take care of
you and I'm not saying we should have
gone in
and done anything there but that we're
in this endless situation now where it
is either us there there is no
international fighting but but again
very super careful not to get caught in
a binary dichotomy you can absolutely
say a world without American leadership
is a more dangerous world because it was
for the last eight years look I mean we
had a government that actually said
we're going to lead from behind which is
an oxymoron you cannot lead from behind
we're going to have strategic patience
which means we do nothing and allow
others to act what happened you name it
from China building fake military bases
on fake islands to Isis to Russia
invading it was just a disaster
Egypt we back the guy the other guys
then we back the so yeah to say that a
world learn American leadership is is
more dangerous is true but that doesn't
mean that we have to fix everybody's
problem and that's that's where smart
strategy comes in where you say but we
have a moral duty to espouse certain
values but that doesn't mean we are
responsible for all human beings because
because the American Revolution says the
opposite each nation is responsible the
citizens are responsible if you don't
like your system do something about it
because guess what we did against the
most powerful empire in the world so
again it's about finding that the happy
medium in the middle and being smart
about it
and again without being callous being
realistic right there are trosset e's
everywhere from Rwanda to Yugoslavia
bara American taxpayer is gonna pay for
fixing all of them are we responsible
are they responsible for what's
happening in their country sure are the
timezone we could perhaps help them
uh-huh but it's a balance like to
balance all right so let's shift back to
your book yeah so defeating jihad it
seems to me that the the main sort of
narrative on this is not that we can
defeat it but we should live with it
that there's a degree of it with which
we should just live which is don't carry
knives in London
and it's you know we're gonna put up
more barricades so the trucks can't be
driven into buildings or into shopping
centers or just down the street and
killing people that we can't really
defeat this ideology we just have to
manage it yeah I suspect you do not
agree with that premise no because we've
defeated ideologies before you can't
look Vera idiot to run around with you
know swastika armbands today I get it so
Nazism hasn't disappeared but we have
made it so enough Emma that if you walk
down the street with a Nazi flag you
will be rejected by society instantly
the same thing with the KKK right sadly
not with Che Guevara for the hammer and
sickle right right right but but there
are ways to defeat ideologies or to put
them in a box where they're laughable
and and everybody
shuns them we have to do the same thing
with jihadism this is my argument this
is the conclusion of the book we have to
be as effective in dealing in amaizing
the message of Gia because very simply
put killing jihadis is great but at the
end of the day body-bags is a metric not
a good metric it didn't work in Vietnam
doesn't work today because guess what if
you've got a recruiting pool that's
massive that is recruit new jihadis so
what's your victory condition your
victory condition is when the life style
of jihad is no longer sexy from Brussels
to San Bernardino how do you do that you
make a laughingstock you discredit that
value system not a slimy no white
skinned Catholic isn't gonna do it right
but we helped President Sisi
we helped King Abdullah of Jordan will
help MBS in Saudi Arabia with MBS the
historic things he said I mean massive
about Israel in just the last few weeks
yeah that's how we win because sooner or
later enough people say those guys are
losers that's how we win well but you
only do that if you get to talk about it
truthfully you've got to be able to talk
about the Quran or jihad means the
history of the religion because if you
can't talk about it honestly you never
going to treat it accurately yeah we're
not very good at that though well thanks
I political correctness right I mean
imagine if you know you're your doctor
and you've got a patient that comes in
with your third stage
you know lymphoma but your hospital
administrator because it's a scary word
is bad the use of the word cancer you
can't say it right it's just not allowed
yeah and then you have to tell the
patient what well you know you're
dehydrated go home drink some water and
take some aspirin what happens your
patient they die it's the same thing if
you can't diagnose a geostrategic
issue accurately however much money you
throw at it you will not solve the
problem so are you concerned at all that
just even if it's purely because of the
way the media frames things that perhaps
Trump is not the right person to lead
the fight against this that for whatever
whatever he's gonna say about jihad or
radical Islamic terrorism or the rest
that even if he said everything the
exact way that you wanted it he said
cleanly and clearly and correctly
defined all of that that he may not be
the right messenger on this just because
of the filter it has to get through to
get to reality he's not the right
messenger domestically because of what
political correctness has wrought in our
country but he is absolutely the right
messenger internationally watch the
video of his Riyadh speech don't watch
him watch the fifty-three Muslim Arab
heads of state and their body language
because man did he guys you got a
problem in your mosque in your societies
the extreme is that you have to deal
with it it was tough and you think
they'd be all negative and arms crossed
they were beaming right ceecee abdullah
we're going over finally a guy who
understands our problem and what is
giving us tough love so yeah he is
[Music]
joining me today is a national security
expert the best-selling author of
defeating jihad and a former albeit
brief strategist to President Trump
dr. Sebastian Gorka welcome to the Rubin
report thanks Lambie baby
I'm happy to have you here sir first off
that voice you have a very have you ever
done any voiceover work at all it's
don't tell anybody but it's my dream
when I wrote defeating jihad and I asked
about the audio book I said I'm gonna
get to do the audio book write to my
publisher you can do the prologue then
we'll get a pro I was crushed right so
the next book coming out in June why we
fight I'm sorry if you're listening
Margie I'm doing it was over so I really
can't believe that so first up we have
already spent a good amount of time
talking about Star Wars
I am very impressed your greenroom and
that post I'd never seen that McQuarrie
poster before yeah I'm the LP so I'm
impressed that is the original 1977
poster I wonder do you think because
we're obviously to talk a lot about
national security and foreign policy and
all that do you think any of your
thoughts related to foreign policy have
anything to do with Star Wars because I
do think at some level some of the way I
view the world has been shaped by some
of the lore and oh yeah I'm not sure if
it's cause and effect but but absolutely
in terms of good and evil I mean totally
I mean the first three movies are about
good versus evil before they become this
social justice warrior absurdity so yes
sure I mean but as much as being the son
of people who lived under Nazi and then
communist dictatorship these things kind
of flowed together so Star Wars and
growing up under the child of people
escaped from dictation right there yeah
all right so you are in California
because you were talking to a couple
conservative groups here in California
people don't believe that conservative
groups could exist in California but I
mentioned to you before we just had
Governor John Kasich on he was talking
with Arnold Schwarzenegger at some
conservative groups here in California
so there it seems like something is
happening in California I don't live
here
but I come in and out to do
these events something's happening so
something clearly is happening the
energy I felt that the the events here
is is like the energy I feel at events
in Virginia or elsewhere like Texas and
there's a commonality whoever you speak
to they keep mentioning the same things
that they talk about the gas tax they
talk about sang free cities they talk
about the burden on businesses when you
get these things repeated enough times
you realize something is happening in
California who knows where it'll go but
this this isn't the state you know I
used to say you know the People's
Republic just lost forever I'm not so
sure anymore
really so do you think this could be
something that could happen as soon as
our next our gubernatorial election
that's coming up now or do you think
this is sort of long term maybe
presidential election 2020 year all I'll
say is the following with the election
of Donald J Trump to president the
political rule book has been shredded
burnt buried and the Donald Trump jumped
up and down on it it's gone so any past
expectations any trend lines are
irrelevant I mean I traveled with the
president
- we flew on Air Force One to Youngstown
Ohio back in June and this is steel
Valley right this is the heart of a
blue-collar Democrat manual laborers and
we we arrived at the stadium and the
president was in the back I was you know
doing selfies with you know the crowd I
do love the crowd selfie I've seen many
problems what does it cost me they want
a selfie yes sure why not yeah so I got
to engage with these people and I
realized that in this stadium about
twenty twenty-five thousand people
everybody was either a former registered
Democrat their parents their
grandparents or all Democrats and then
what happens when the president when the
first lady Melania comes out of the
stage it erupts the building erupts with
chants of the USA drain the swamp and
this is democrat territory now if that
can happen in youngster now we
Youngstown Ohio
who knows what can happen in California
yeah so I want to talk a little bit
about your history and your parents and
growing up that I just mentioned but as
long as we're on the on the first part
of the Trump portion of this let's just
keep doing that I heard you at the
turning point USA event in December give
a speech which I really thought was
wonderful and you described Trump as the
ice breaker and what I've been saying
around here is that I view him as the
bull in the china shop we wanted a
panther to knock over a few things but
we got the bull and I think that really
it's really the same analogy that we're
using there so can you just yeah I don't
further on that a little bit so the
United States was covered for at least
30 years in this massive permafrost
layer of ice which is political
correctness and it had frozen over the
media education politics all of it to
the extent that by the Obama
administration federal government was
telling you who could use which bathroom
right so just insanity and then along
comes a guy who the first day I met him
in summer of June 15 in his office in
Trump Tower the first thing I knew about
this man is he's the Kryptonite of
political correctness and he couldn't
care less about what the New York Times
or CNN says about a given issue so along
comes this man layer of ice frozen over
the country BAM slams into it like an
ice breaker and smashes through the ice
so he breaks a pathway for for the
nation to to open up that sea Lane and
and my argument to conservative
audiences is that this is great this is
monumental it wasn't going to be the
path the path that could never have won
it had to be the ball it had to be the
Icebreaker
but if you know your physics of ice
breaking you can send that you know
thousands of tons worth of ship in there
with its tungsten how rides up on the
ice slices through it
but if you don't have the flotilla
behind it that comes up and keeps that
passageway open what actually happens in
real life is if you send one ship in
breaks a path almost instantaneously the
ice comes around the bow andreen it's
it's off right around the ship and
reseals so this is the moment in the
conservative movement well we have to
get serious of about what does it mean
to be a conservative in the 21st century
what's the role of government how does a
national security look
so on and so forth Donald Trump is the
catalyst now we have to do the heavy
lifting of ideology and politics and
policy yeah do you think he will years
from now when we look back be anything
other than the catalyst like how do you
how do you consider his ideas compared
to traditionally conservative ideas
because just in the last couple months
after signing the omnibus thing you know
right now when we're take we're taping
this a few days before we're gonna air
it but there's a big mess in Syria we're
not sure you know if there's gonna be
more intervention or not he seems to be
doing some things that are probably a
little more big government than perhaps
you want Horst certainly then his base
seems to want so where do you think he
fits actually between catalyst and the
end the flotilla so first things first
I hate labels personally IIIi think
labels is lazy thinking and in the case
of Donald Trump very relevant and then
they have no application our credit
monitor Cattrall in my friend with this
the weekend after the election was david
horowitz's was it a restoration weekend
yeah in Florida yeah which was either
going to be awake or the party that was
and Monica gave a great speech in which
he said look everybody misunderstands
who this man is he was never an
ideological candidate because you simply
cannot put him in a box because of what
he does whether it's his attitude to gay
marriage whether it's it's just he's
what he's just a mixture he was never an
ideological candidate he was an
attitudinal candidate and she nailed it
now what does that mean look at the last
40 years this guy's 71 years old he's
not going to change he is who he is
what has he done for the last 40 years
as a professional he's been committed to
one thing excellence whether it's a golf
course in Scotland whether it's a
skyscraper in New York its excellence
and all he's done is he's taken that
concept and tried you know translated it
into excellence for America once more
and that doesn't fit into neat
neoliberal neocon paleo corn it just
doesn't fit he's about getting stuff
done and being the best but so how do
you link that to what the general
conservative movement is now I get I get
what you're saying about labels and I
say it all
the labels now especially because of
Trump the labels are all the brothers at
this point but the thing that I'm
struggling to fully grasp about the
Trump thing is how does this connect to
you know when I see you right now you
have a huge split right we've got the
the Trump base and then you've got the
never Trump errs and these people are
that should be kind of lining up they
can't quite get there
and how do you connect those things like
how do you connect what like that the
never Trump is a pathological I mean
pathological when when Bill Kristol you
know who's all obsequious and oleaginous
to me in the green room at Fox when he
tweets out actually tweets out in a
choice between the deep state and
president Trump I choose the deep state
yeah you're not a conservative
you're a subversive right get out of the
tent get out of the tent so that's never
going to happen
the broader question of what is
conserved you mean today we can't answer
that because have you seen a good
article a really good article which
understands first principles founding
principles about what Trump ism is or
should be I haven't I've seen a lot of
people who think they know what they're
talking about but who've never met the
president so I think there's a lot of
work to be done but it's not going to be
done by conservative establishment
individuals if the NRA is not going to
tell you who Trump is right and the
Inara is not going to revitalize the
conservative establishment right this is
a new year it's exciting but we have to
get to work to define what it means to
be a conservative so that to me is why
it seems so obvious that you're so
passionate about this that nobody else
was going to do it and I think that's
also that's sort of what Monica was
saying and it's sort of what Horowitz
has been saying for a long time even
when he sat right there that no one else
was gonna break through and now it's
imperfect but at least there's me you
know be brutally candid you know I grew
up in the UK to Hungarian parents of
escape communism I went through the the
private school system in the UK stiff
upper lip and all that stuff and a
debating Club so the president's style
is not exactly the style I'm used to
right I get to get used to it and I
understand with people of issues the
biggest people biggest
people have issues with on the right I
his tweets I get it
but guess what who was glad to defeat
Hillary wasn't Jeb Bush yeah wasn't even
senator Cruz none of them were going to
the only person who could cut through
that miasma who could break through the
ice of political correctness was this
rank outsider from Manhattan and whether
you like it or not he to say for Asafa
Kalihi was the necessary but not
sufficient cause of victory you don't
have to like it but it had to be him
with that start we tried to do Marquess
of Queensbury rules for 30 years where
did it get us where did it get us Mitt
Romney wrong guys right so it had to be
Donald Trump now we have to backfill
what it means yeah and that seems to be
where I think you and so many of these
other people that are either part or
formerly part of the administration so
you had a very brief stint at the
administration first of all even some
look right years from now they'll go my
god he was there for longer than
everybody else but a pretty brief stint
7 months first can you just tell me how
you got involved because you had only
you just mentioned you only met him a
little bit before the election in the
first place and then and then sort of
what happened that had you leave because
that rule really tie into the media
which I think were very much aligned on
what's going on with the media right now
so a summer of 15 I get a phone call
from a guy called corey levin dosti that
i'd never heard of and he said candidate
Trump is prepping for the big full GOP
presidential debate on national security
he'd like to talk to you said sure so I
took the plane flew to New York went to
Trump Tower it was just the three of us
in Donald Trump's office and we had this
incredible blue sky discussion on
national security issues you name it
from the Civil War up to the middle east
and nuclear weapons all kinds of topics
how knowledgeable did he seem about
things because this is one of the parts
that I think people we have no handle on
like does he really
really interested yeah but not a guy
that you're gonna debate what happened
in Karbala in the ninth century but but
but really interested in this stuff and
with opinions and and half way through
this discussion and he was sitting
closer to me than you are and qualities
over here and he there's a classic
trumpism he goes just stops the
conversation Cory I like this guy
let's hire him and that was it and he
asked me to help right it wasn't part of
the campaign but I became an advisor
wrote policy papers that he used in the
briefings and and we stayed in touch but
I never joined the campaign and then as
things progressed and he the field
whittled down to what it did I kept
meeting general Flynn at events I was a
participant just in the crowd I kept
bumping into general Flynn and I'd known
him from when he was director to dia and
eventually we just he pulled me in and
by October the month before the election
I know if you're familiar with the
system and in the presidential election
the last two runners get support from
the federal government before the
election and they get offices near the
White House to create transition teams
to prep and so Hillary got one story and
and the president got another story this
building and I was pulled into the pen
hilarious it's in the same building oh
yeah and you cut if you talk in the
elevator right so I got pulled in and
asked to work on the National Security
Council transition team for general
Flynn and my wife who has a background
in the issues was pulled in to work on
the DHS team and so I became part of the
official transition team and up till the
very last moment the week before you
know maybe the week of the inauguration
I was going to be doing counterterrorism
stuff for general Flynn in the NFC and
then Steve Madden who knows me yeah
reaches out in the last minutes of new
they're gonna come work for me and the
office of the chief strategist is
strategist to the president and that's
how you know at 12:01 on Johnny xx I
became a deputy assistant to the
president
yeah so the second that happened
basically the media just went bananas on
you I mean every store I mentioned to
you that right no no the act when they
went bananas was it even before that
it's very interesting they didn't they
didn't go bananas until the the travel
ban dropped and I realized things were
not going well in terms of communicating
the travel ban mm-hmm so I said to Steve
and I said to Sean guys I've done a bit
of media in the past I can be the face
of this stuff if you want I mean we've
got the NFC communications team but I'm
prepared to go and CNN and debate these
guys and so they threw me into the the
you know the the fire and I loved it and
the left went nuts they're just
absolutely worth insane yeah and it was
what once I was very representing the
president on television that out came
the hit pieces and the lights yeah so
let's talk about that a little bit
because I see this happening to almost
everyone that I have any degree of
respect for I see it happen I see it
it's coming it's coming to me now too I
mean I see this to almost anyone that I
think is trying to be somewhat honest
yeah the endless attacks I mean you know
there were just a endless slew of things
that you're an anti-semite and all of
this craziness I mean at the turning
point event that I saw you speak at you
get one of the strongest defenses of
Israel that I've ever heard but they
almost take everything and do the
complete reverse of it
what do you make of that tactic
specifically where it's literally the
reverse of what the truth is it's not
just like we're gonna take a line and
make it seem a little different we're a
new sign that's absolutely you know
you've got a big viewership i I know
you're why I'm no longer a progressive
thing is got ya having millions of views
now and and I'll open up a little bit
despite the size of your audience um I
have a reputation for being a scary dude
and being a hard-ass that's fine but
after the seven months that I went
through and my family went through every
time every few weeks I have the same
emotional response and it probably
surprises your others as a human being I
want to try and understand how another
human being
who's never met me who knows nothing
about me or what my family has been
through can write what they wrote about
me will say what they say about me it
leaves me speechless that you can have
such venomous hatred for somebody and
pedals so egregious sets of lives and
and you not only call yourself a
journalist but you actually think you're
a human being I was attacked
and that's fine because I'm a
politically commissioned officer of the
President I'm a proxy I was a proxy for
Steve I was a proxy for the president I
understand that that's okay but hey why
don't we debate the policies they never
wanted to never wanted to bait the
policies it was ad hominem attacks and
lives and secondly it's okay to attack
me but guess what
sort of can't attack my wife it's not
okay to attack my dead mother's
reputation and it's not a kid attack my
teenage high school-aged son either
these people are reprehensible and
they're out of control David and they're
not learning that doubling down so
that's the part that I'm concerned about
right now that it see people always ask
me I did an event in Irvine last night
and and the question I'm getting more
and more now is is this thing turning
around now I sense my sense is that
there is something brewing against it
there's something brewing finally and I
think any of us in this space are a
little piece of it but to me it's gonna
get a lot worse before it gets better
[Music]
all right we are live on the YouTube
sorry about the delay there people the
amount of things that go into pulling
off one of these shows is well we could
probably do a show on that at some other
time I am live with the one and only
Colin Moriarty thank you thank you for
being here
thank you for having me yeah I was
thanking you for being here that's
usually the way it goes I interviewed
you last time so I guess I'm actually in
the same exact setup so yeah no it's
good to be here I I'm trying to say no
far less than people asking me to do
shows and I always say yes to you so
you've actually got me back into the
motion about doing like a few things in
the next few weeks oh it's awesome to be
here thank you so much yeah and
congratulations by the way on your
continued success oh well
congratulations on your continued
success as well well it's funny the way
that you just did that because you did
interview me in these two chairs for
your podcast which I hope most of my
audience's listen to and for those that
haven't I think they should if they want
to just get a different more insight or
take on what's going on in my mind and
some of my history I actually think it
was probably the best interview I've
ever done which is total credit to you
oh I think you got me to open up about
things that I don't talk about that much
and periods of my life that I that are
long gone and and all that stuff so oh
you're very welcome
you have hosted in that chair yeah but
I've hosted in that chair which is weird
too I interviewed my dad in that chair
this way so it's all it's being here's a
little confusing so thank you for being
you thanks for having me all right
there's a ton I want to do you know I
always say at the end of a good
interview that if I didn't look at my
notes once that's a good one every now
and again I have to look because I need
to know something chronologically or a
specific number or something
I'm not even bringing notes to the table
today because you've been doing this for
a while we met about a year and a half
ago you were just some guy with some
gaming site yep and you tweeted
something now actually I'm telling this
story slightly backwards because I had
had you on our show first when I thought
you were just the gamer again right I
just thought you were some video game
guy we were doing a YouTube week thing I
saw your handle on Twitter no taxation I
was like this guy's kind of kind of
interesting he looks like a hipster but
he seems to be a conservative I don't
know what to make of this and I had you
on and we do this
about an hour I thought we were gonna
talk about Super Mario Brothers the
whole time and you go into just an hour
of extremely well thought out cogent
politics and and your beliefs and I was
really impressed and I said to you I
think I said it on air I was like you're
gonna be a star in the world of politics
and thank you yeah and immediately you
were on with Glenn Beck and a whole
bunch of other stuff but something else
put you on the map and I know most of
the people know it but let's just recap
it for three minutes go sure on
International Women's Day which was just
passed again and I stayed off a Twitter
that day because everyone was asking you
know I I didn't want to insult anyone
else again but I tweeted out just a joke
about my girlfriend
peace and quiet peace and quiet hashtag
a day without a woman yeah and it was a
joke for you know my girlfriend who's in
ER nurse she had just gotten back from
an overnight shift so she was getting
into bed I showed it to her like an you
think this is funny yeah just like yeah
that's funny and then with the bed and I
got up took us you know tweeted it got
up went to work and then all hell broke
loose and obviously it was a with the
years hindsight with like some time to
think about it now I mean it was clearly
a political hit and I understand that
and you know I'm sorry if it hurt people
but that wasn't the intention obviously
and are you really sorry no not really
no I mean I know I know you you're a
good guy you like to apologize for
things like you don't want to hurt
people and all that but but really like
you said a joke yeah you're in bed with
your girlfriend yeah not auntie woman
you know no not that day anyway
yeah but the no I'm not sorry for the
people that got faux offended by it but
if there was some person in Lincoln
Nebraska that really was mortified and
had to stay in bed for a few days I
really do apologize about that but
anyway my whole kind of world blew up at
that point
I quit the company I found it and
started a week later my new company CLS
Colin's last stand and it's just been a
whirlwind of the year I mean it's just
been a wild year of learning and
figuring things out and failing and
succeeding and trying and it's been you
know 60 70 80 hour weeks I haven't had a
day off all year yeah I was reflecting
on that a few days ago to my girlfriend
even when we go to Vegas pretty often
and even when we were there last time I
was just working in the hotel room the
entire time I was there so I believed it
because for the amount of times that we
try to get together and I'm like I could
bump free for the taps our clear and
you're like I got 15 minutes this way
and bah-bah-bah but I thought it was I
wanted to
start with that story because I think
it's so relevant so much that has
happened since then in our first
interview when you did that YouTube make
sure you basically predicted that this
type of thing was gonna happen to you
one day that you would step in something
politically and that then it would all
blow up and all that and I think there's
a link to everything that's going on
right now with with this Kanye stuff
which we're gonna talk about and a bunch
more but it's so it's been up basically
a nutty year for you but you survived
and I think it's important to really
acknowledge that because even something
like the International Business Times
they wrote a piece about you in the
midst of all this where they talked
about your racist tweet right very can
you repeat the tweet again it was a
peace and quiet hashtag a day without a
woman so no no no hint of racism there
and you're the one to help me get in
touch with them and it but it was up
there for a day and you know the damage
was done yeah it's it's all just
transparent clickbait and this kind of
desire to destroy and you know I've been
trying to take a step back from that
precipice myself in the way I treat
others and have really been cognizant
about that the entire year that I've
been doing CLS because I don't want to
contribute to that I want tribute to the
reason into the knowledge and to the to
kind of the step-by-step process by the
way you and I reach our conclusions as
opposed to insulting and kind of getting
into the muck I don't I'm not super into
that so yeah but we all kind of get
sucked in every day that's right like
the best of us do it I try so hard not
to and then somebody does something so
ridiculous it's usually an author or a
journalist that writes one of these
crazy things about someone I know
calling you racist you know calling
Jordan Peterson this or Shapiro this or
Sam Harris that and I'm like I know
these people these are my friends you
you don't do research you don't do any
of the things that a journalist is
supposed to do but this just seems to be
proliferating throughout everything
right now it is but I think the Kanye
situation in just other situations kind
of parallel to it that are obviously
much smaller it's a sign that people are
not or there's large swaths of people
that are not necessarily buying into it
I think the major thing that the far
left in the United States is making a
mistake with right now is assuming that
because someone like me I don't like
Donald Trump I mean I'm very vocal at
that I don't like him I don't think you
should be President
I'm a conservative I don't think he's a
real conservative and that just because
I don't like him I like them yeah
there's no way in hell you know and
there's a huge swath of us that want
nothing to do with them
yeah and but also we're a little
uncomfortable with the way conservatism
is gone or the way you know kind of I'm
not really into a socially conservative
things and stuff like that like there's
a new way forward multiple ways forward
and so that's their big mistake so they
in sultanate and they and they slander
everyone but they're not really getting
new inherence by doing it they're
actually just isolating themselves and
isolating other people from them yeah
and so that's actually kind of good for
us and along in the long term and the
midterms it's gonna pay off for the for
the Democrats and the left but I don't
think long term it's gonna be a winning
strategy you know it's funny I know
we've talked about it a little bit I'm
not so sure that conventional thinking
on this midterm thing is right because I
think the left has gone so bananas the
media has gone so crazy the left hasn't
come up with one new idea they've just
doubled down on identity politics in
from every level from Bernie on down
it's just double down double down but I
don't know that there's anyone out there
who voted for Trump or even if you were
an independent that voted for a Gary
Johnson or whatever else that anyone
that didn't yeah but I don't know that
anyone that did that is gonna go you
know what in the year-and-a-half
putting you know if you can get over
tweets Trump tweets and stuff like that
I don't see how you could possibly be
like I'm gonna vote I'm gonna suddenly
vote for identity politics I'm suddenly
gonna vote for collectivism and leftism
what may happen is that they just won't
vote in which case the outcome that
you're predicting will happen but all
right I think because of some of the nra
stuff I think this Kanye thing the
general attack on free speech and
hysteria I think even actually may go
the other way I honestly haven't heard
anyone else say that but there's
contrarian Dave I guess no I mean geez
man I mean you were I don't think you
were we've talked about this in the past
but I don't think you were one of the
people that predicted that Trump was
necessarily gonna win but you predicted
that it was much more possible I think
you were on Rogen that day yeah I guess
yeah you know I think even it was the
more Nate Silver kind of school thought
of being like he has a third of it she
like won one in three times he'll win
which is much more than the 2% or
something on Huffington Post gave yeah I
don't know if midterms are always bad
for the incumbent party and it's always
for the most engaged part
so it's all gonna be about the real
Republicans in the real Democrats I have
no investment in it especially in
California I really could care less
about what's happening I would say but
as a California guy and we watch this
state kind of plummet into the depths of
hell I mean you were from you lived in
San Francisco when we first met just
about a year and years oh yeah for ten
years excuse me I know it's hard I just
wet saying San Francisco I mean you know
what happened I just went I spoke at
Berkeley a week and a half ago I had
dinner in San Francisco in the in a
seemingly nice area there were tent
cities that we were driving by on major
streets there were homeless people
everywhere I saw someone actually
ejecting something on like a corner side
thing I believe literally our car got
broken into while we were outside of a
nice restaurant right in front of a
Chase Bank broken into stole stole all
my stuff yes I mean they're not gonna do
anything I mean obviously they're not
even you know even filing a police
report well the guy wasn't my car it was
the couple who sponsored the events car
so they did file a report but people
then on Twitter when I put the picture
up we're like how could you leave your
stuff in your car in San Francisco
everyone knows that I didn't even
realize that it was such an epidemic but
it's a massive epidemic and on top of
that there's this app that tells you
where humans are pooping on the streets
of San Francisco yes I mean I'm not
making this up up no no nice double
entendre thank you I know San Francisco
when I moved to there in 2007 I had
interned there in 2004 too but I lived
there full-time starting in 2007 there
was a charm to the city it was still
bohemian it was still it was post Comair
a pre-recession there was still
something special going on there and
obviously the wealth disparity there has
not you know and I'm not really one to
harp about that but that's obviously
destroyed the city there's 200,000 more
people living there than when I moved
there no real new infrastructure lots of
Byzantine laws where buildings can't be
higher than three or four storeys and
lots of neighborhoods but wait wait wait
Colin I'm a simple guy so you have to
explain this I thought progressive
politics which that's the home oh yeah
oh yeah I thought that was there a fixed
wealth disparity no no it's it's it's
totally that's why you know and it's
touching Oakland and Alameda and and
saying not so much San Jose I guess but
parts of the valley where it's just San
Francisco just kind of fell apart and
before my very eyes and it's very sad
there's a lot to love about that city
and it's just yeah
progressive politics have taken it over
but more than that it's just you know
the tech industry is kind of ruining
things you're seeing an in Venice
actually to where I'm in I live in Santa
Monica now and snapchats in Venice and
you see it's amazing you see literal
tags everywhere spray-paint tags have
just you know snapchat snapchat
snapchat go home and stuff like you're
seeing kind of small things like that
happen there so it's a complicated
situation but California overall I mean
I love the idea of splitting it into
multiple parts and stuff like that so
that you know there are more Republicans
in California than any other state well
there definitely is a nascent Republican
or conservative or libertarian movement
here you know I had John Kasich in here
just a couple weeks ago and that's yeah
he was thanks he was here too with
Schwarzenegger to meet with California
conservatives to kind of figure out how
do we how do we step back from the abyss
right now that this state is going into
and most likely I mean it's pretty sad I
love LA you know from the day I moved
here a little over five years ago I have
loved it here every day and I've been
successful here and I've met tons of
great people and it's like man Gavin
Newsom who was the the mayor of San
Francisco who is as left of left of left
of left he could be the governor here I
mean so he could get worse than it is
you know he'll make Jerry Brown look
look moderate or make them look you know
something else Jerry Brown's the worst
by the way just the heat-seeking missile
that any public office whoo-hoo because
whose governor and then like Attorney
General mayor of Oakland then governor
like it's just like any open office
there's gonna be like the local
librarian or something in San Francisco
yeah would you before California really
splitting yeah I mean people are
grumbling about it now yeah absolutely I
think California you know we're from the
East Coast states are a little smaller a
little quaint they're a little more
colonial in their size the states out
here California is too big I mean what
is it like 1/6 of the country's
population in one state there's a bunch
of voiceless people here and I don't
blame them for wanting I'm one of those
voiceless people we were just talking
about taxes before the amount of taxes
that I paid last years is astronomical
would any people throw up in their
mouths of their if they knew you know
and it was revealing the numbers that we
paid in taxes and it's not cry me a
river here but I can I can honestly tell
you that I paid in taxes because I just
wrote the check you know a week or two
ago more basically than I made in almost
any year of my life until the last two
years that I ever made ya know I think
that that's what we're dealing with
absolutely yeah it's terrible I mean
success comes you know my accountant was
trying to talk me down being like it's
just a matter of success like relax you
know and I'm like I appreciate that I
respect that but to be robbed by the
state in such a gratuitous way and I get
nothing in return for it literally
nothing I don't know like what their
what they're doing with that money it no
it's super sad and I was telling people
on Twitter that you know with the
uncertainty that comes with owning a
business especially in California you'll
again also 1.5 percent of gross receipts
you owe to the state no matter if you I
think you made a profit or not which is
fantastic I would love to hire an editor
I'd love to hire someone full-time when
I looked kind of funny one of my major
things when we hire two people that
still work there that I never got to
work with one of my major things was
like let's pay them well let's pay them
fairly and give them security and give
them something that they can rely upon
and I'd like to do that for an employee
of mine as well but now they have their
hands in my pockets and I just don't
know yeah I don't wanna bring someone on
for six months promise them the world
and then be like it's not working out
yeah and a lot of that comes from
financial and you know the kind of
financial uncertainty with living in
California I was making life I have no
idea why I'm really here you know I go
live in Alaska or something I do the
same exact thing I'm doing you know so
yeah I thought it was just so that every
now and again we could play contra
together well I love and you're right
about the mist like that the our Mis
schedules I often when I'm around where

fiving I'm going to a meeting here are
you available yeah from 1:00 to 2:00 it
never works out so you're one of the
reasons I'm here usually like I'm in the
Dagobah system and I can't make it there

evolving

more and more common this year has seen
riots at UC Berkeley an attack on
speakers at Middlebury College
protesters blocking a talk at Claremont
McKenna College students taking over
Evergreen State College approach and
protest of professor Jordan Peterson
over his refusal to use gender-neutral
pronouns off campus we have seen violent
clashes at political gatherings and
protests by white supremacists over the
removal of Confederate statues what is
the cause of these incidents what can we
do to address them and to protect
freedom of speech and the free society
that depends on it our panel is going to
be discussing these questions for us
today and many more so without further
ado please join me in welcoming Onkar
got a yes mean Mohamed and Dave Reuben
[Applause]
all right thank you guys we are live
streaming on my channel right now so
first off can you make some noise for
the people that are watching this at
home with a porn tab open right next to
them can you make some noise I always I
always just assume people are watching
my show and if it ever gets boring they
just click over to pornhub I don't
that's just my thoughts on it all right
we are we are very excited to to be here
I was at Berkeley two days ago and I
survived that so if I survive Berkeley I
sense I can probably survive Dartmouth
you guys you guys look nice this is like
a good everyone smiling look at you all
very respectable and smiley you're all
well-dressed alright I think we're gonna
have fun here you know it's funny I I
flew in from from LA last night and I
flew to the Boston Logan Airport and I
was supposed to take one of these tiny
little Cessna like four-person planes
and I was not happy but I was gonna do
it Yasmine actually did do it she's
still in a state of shock as you can see
but my flight got delayed so I ended up
taking a car and I took an uber for it's
about a two-hour drive to get here and
right when we passed into New Hampshire
there's the sign live free or die and I
lived in LA where the California state
motto is pay taxes and be quiet
so I'm excited to be here live free or
die we were all talking about what a
great phrase that is what what a great
place this is and you guys are out of
grade school so all right we're gonna
talk about free speech we're going to
sort of share your guys stories a little
bit we're gonna do about an hour of that
and then we're gonna do about an hour of
Q&A with you guys I thought first just
for for people you've been on my show
we've been trying to get you on card but
your agent is very difficult to work so
for people that don't know each of you I
thought maybe we could just do a quick
little little bio each and yeah I'll let
you go first
okay well Jacob did a good job of giving
a bit of background so born and raised
in Canada but in a very conservative
fundamentalist Orthodox Islamic home so
kind of
in a bubble living in Canada but not
really you know in my own home life was
was very conservative and I went to
Islamic schools and and like Jacob
mentioned I war ended up getting pushed
into a marriage with a man who I
discovered was a member of al-qaeda and
when I was married to him I was wearing
the club which is the full black
everything gloves and socks and and had
a daughter with him and then eventually
got away and went to university and when
I was there I just took a course called
history of religions because it was
gonna be focusing on the three Abrahamic
monotheistic religions and I thought
well I'll have one-third of that content
down for sure so I just took it to be
like an easy course not knowing that it
was gonna completely change the
trajectory of my life when I took that
course is when I discovered that a lot
of what I had been told about the Quran
being completely different from all
other religions and it's so divine and
it's the literal word of God and there's
nothing like it on this planet I
discovered that actually it was just
plagiarized a lot of the stories come
from Judaism and Christianity and and
pagan stories before that and so it just
took away all the divinity and that led
me down my path to the heathen that I am
today the non-believer and and yeah so
then I started writing a memoir after
the famous Sam Harris and Ben Affleck
clash on the Bill Maher show I started
to write a memoir and then I had people
contacting me from all over the Islamic
world telling me how much they related
to my story and so then I kind of fell
into speaking out more mostly because
people in those countries cannot speak
out and so I felt compelled to
considering I'm in a free country that I
should
you know I should at least do that
that's that's why I'm here today yeah
well I'm glad you're here and it's nice
that you're not in the McCobb and I see
your beautiful hair
unkar so I'm a philosopher so I'm gonna
just give you my background sort of as
it relates to free speech and why I'm
very interested and passionate about the
issue and it I was a graduate student
during the Salman Rushdie affair when
there was a fatwa put on his head
and that and the West's response to that
fatwa was incredibly pathetic and it
really showcase for me that very few
people understand what free speech is
and are willing to defend it and that is
when I started getting really interested
in the issue of free speech because I
thought it's very precarious in the West
now and then 9/11 I was already working
at the Iran Institute and that and again
I mean obviously it was a momentous
event but the response to it and the
inability to even think that it might
have something to do with Islam and that
we're facing a movement that I would
term Islamic totalitarianism the
whitewashing of that and the inability
for people to speak on this that they
were shouted down and we were at the
Institute shouted that when it did a lot
of events and so on after 9/11 it that
further conquer ties for me that this is
the issue for the new millennia that if
free speech goes were finished and the
Danish cartoons which came a time in
five years after 9/11 and still people
can't face the issue and you've got
newspaper or editors and so in hiding in
fear for their lives and nobody in the
West no government really will stand up
and defend them and again the Institute
did a lot around that so this is an
ongoing issue and maybe we'll talk about
some of these events in more detail that
it's this is a right that the West
thought tremendous amount to secure the
right to freedom of speech and it's in
jeopardy it's in jeopardy
today and it's if that goes if you can't
speak you can't change the culture for
the better yeah and you know for the
record we've been talking about this
stuff over dinner and throughout the day
and we have some differences and we're
gonna get into our differences of
opinion and hopefully when when we do
the Q&A you guys a little challenge us
on on some of the differences that you
might have with us but but the free
speech on college campus since we're on
a college campus I thought that would be
the right way to start I I view this
basically as the single most important
issue of the day I mean I've been
bouncing around college campuses now for
the last year and the I think the number
one question that I get from you guys is
that you are afraid often to speak not
only within your peer group because you
don't want people to call you a bigot or
a racist because you may believe in
small government or low taxes or
something like that
but that with your own professors you're
afraid to challenge them because of what
the blowback might be to any of you just
quickly by show of hands or applause
Danny of you have that fear here I'm
wondering how much yes that's wow that's
about half of you right there so that's
that's kind of interesting to me that
that on college campuses I mean this is
the place this is the place where not
only are you supposed to learn history
you're supposed to learn how to think
and how to critically think and all that
but you're also is supposed to be
challenged and you're supposed to
challenge people too and I find it so
amazing consistently that so many
professors these days apparently seem to
be afraid to be challenged when that's
exactly what they should be trying to do
with you guys you are a teacher what do
you make of this phenomena I think it's
really sad it's like you said as as a
college instructor it's not teach it's
not telling students what to think it's
it's it's teaching them how to think you
know and there's this big controversy
about safe spaces these days and things
that you shouldn't talk about because
you're gonna trigger students and I
think that the entire university campus
is a place you know it shouldn't be a
safe space you know this is the place to
criticize and to argue
to question and that's the only way that
we can learn it's the only way we can
expand our minds I mean I grew up being
told that questioning something is the
devil whispering in my ear that if I
don't just do what I'm told and and
accept what I'm being taught then that's
evil right and so when I what's
happening these days is is really well
it's triggering to me so one of the
things we talked about this afternoon
was that you are shocked at someone that
has lived through what what
totalitarianism and what
authoritarianism actually does what you
lived through it and what clothes you
could wear and what thoughts you could
have in what in what people you could be
friends with etcetera etcetera
you're sort of I don't want to say
depressed but you you find the fact that
so many of these people on college
campus are so against so many of these
freedoms now you find it shocking is
that is that even the right adjective
yeah yeah it's it's yeah it is it's
depressing because I feel like what is
the end goal like what are you what are
you aiming for when you hear people
talking about shutting down speech and
burning books it's like what what are
you looking for you're looking for
Sharia law like what is where is this
going to lead but I don't think that
they think that far ahead they're just
you know I don't know I don't so it
seems to me that I try not to impugn
people's motives it's one of the things
I talk about on the show a lot I don't
want I don't believe that all the people
of the left are evil I think that the
ideology is bad leaders often are bad or
corrupt or have ideas that I think are
wrong but I don't think that the average
person or the average student that's on
a college campus that has those ideas is
evil what's the best way do you think to
counter some of those ideas or wake up
people who may not be evil but are just
mistaken
yeah I mean I think a lot of it is it's
a product of the education that you're
receiving and it's very one-sided and
particularly in the human
so all the sciences history economics
that deal with man if you look at the
history of the 20th century the it's
dominated by Marxist socialists and I
mean now what is the progressives that
was in the late 19th early 20th century
and it's one line of thought it does not
anywhere come close to all the views you
should be thinking about entertaining
discussing arguing about I mean part of
the reason I went into philosophy I was
already interested in Iran didn't
objectivism but the idea that that's all
I would read and that's all I would hear
I went to a university where it had a
lot of different viewpoints in
philosophy and I want to hear all the
theories all the viewpoints and there's
very little of that now that happens in
colleges and it's it's a crime against
you guys it's a crime against students
to do this distance I would never just
teach objectivism even though I think
it's right to students and no don't hear
about Plato don't you know about mark
I mean we read Marx in my classes I
don't think he's right about anything
basically but you have to know some of
the arguments and if you're gonna have a
view of your own you have to be over the
counter to the other arguments and if
you never hear them and if it's somehow
taboo and you're gonna shout them down
as they're racists or bigots just
because they disagree there's something
really has gone wrong with education and
it's that's what I think has to be
turned and it has to come in part from
the students damat like we want
something better than what we're getting
in the classroom yeah it's also
interesting to me how so many words have
flipped meaning I mean if I was to look
at you guys and I can see people that
are white and I can see people that are
brown and I can see girls and guys and
people of different ages and all that
and if we were to look at you only based
in those ideas that actually as I always
say this is prejudice that is prejudging
I don't expect because I look at you
that I know what any of your political
thoughts are or ideas are and yet we're
sold this idea of diversity constantly
as if this is how we should be looking
at each other that oh here we have black
people here they should think of
certainly Muslim people should think a
certain way white people should think a
certain way whatever it is this
actually it's the antithesis of the
American project it's completely the
reverse of Martin Luther King Junior's
most famous phrase about his children
being judged by the content of their
character not the color of their skin
and yet somehow this is like actually
caught fire with a certain set of people
yeah identity politics as is racism
basically it's the racism yeah it's
unfortunate and it's really insulting to
because people the ayaan Hirsi Ali when
she did her interview with you actually
was talking about how people look at her
and she's a black woman immigrant and
the progressives will look at her and
assume right away that she's a victim
and that she's being oppressed by this
horrible American society etc etc and of
course she is not she is an amazing
woman she's a survivor you know she's
she doesn't want those kinds of she
doesn't want anybody's pity mm-hmm
so she gets to define who she is other
people don't get to define it for her
but people are just looking at diversity
of identity versus diversity of opinion
or diversity of thought how do you think
victimhood got so sexy to people the
idea that victimhood is virtue or the
idea that because you were born a
certain color or a certain sexuality or
whatever that's outside of the
mainstream that somehow that gives you
extra Authority I mean I think that's a
philosophical viewpoint and it a lot of
it comes from religion that religion
plays up victimhood and if you just
think in Christianity think of Jesus in
the Sermon in the Mount
it's the meek and the poor and not on
the poor materially the poor in spirit I
mean we would have called it now now
losers that's who's gonna inherit the
earth
it's and that sets it up that the if you
don't have something if you don't have
intelligence if you don't have wealth if
you don't have a real soul you're poor
in spirit that's what gives you claims
to things all claims against whom the
people who've made something of their
spirit who the people who are strong in
various kinds of way intelligence and so
on and there's a real pact
Kachina the victimhood is you can think
of victims in two kinds of ways you're a
[Music]
we're live on location at Stanford
University and joining me today is an
economist author scholar senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution and living
legend dr. Thomas all welcome to the
Rubin report well thank you good to be
with you I feel I have to get the
gushing out first that way we can focus
on the book I don't know that there's
anyone on this mortal coil who's writing
and thinking has influenced me more than
you so this this is truly an honor for
me and I just have to get that out right
at the beginning I just hope I haven't
miss laser yeah we'll find out I'll let
you know at the end so first I thought I
want do a little bit on your history and
I want to focus on your new book but I
was curious if you have a sense of the
sort of Renaissance that your writing is
having right now with young people
because when I tweet it out that we
finally had you on the show and we've
been trying to make this happen for
quite some time I mean thousands of
responses and I had tons of people just
says please tell him this tell him this
my awakening was because of dr. Tsao all
this are you noticing something
happening right now because of the
unique police work I only know what
people tell me that's even true at
Stanford yeah I only know what my
research is sisters televisions all
right well I will certainly accept that
well take my word for it then so I want
to talk a little bit about your history
for a bit and then we'll then we'll move
on to your new book born North Carolina
yes
grew up in the Bronx Harlem in Harlem
sorry in Harlem tell me a little bit
about some of your formative years well
you know I thought about as I was doing
the research for the first chapter where
I get into the Bur sort of thing now had
my my parents lived a normal lifespan I
would have been the sixth child in the
family they died young and so I was
adopted in infancy and a family as it
only traces an only child in a home with
four adults and in terms of what what I
found in the research on birth order
clearly that was a huge advantage
and so their misfortune was my good
fortune and moreover the family in which
I was raised moved to New York which at
that time had a foster period
educational system that in North
Carolina and foster period of what it is
today
were you always interested in education
I mean even as you know I got a kid a
little kid there was nothing in my
background that will put me there
but fortunately when in Harlem knows a
kid named ready that members of the
family had run into before I ever
arrived from North Carolina on it and he
was a very came from a highly educated
family and they immediately saw the
implications if they could get him to to
sort of mentor me and now I had I had
met Eddie on my own chances I would
never have seen any significance he was
just a vision one of the people I passed
by but of course the other the adults
understood what the future was like and
then thinking about things that kids
don't think about despite the great
worship which a child talkers these days
and so but so he took me to a public
library and I had no idea what a public
library was I was eight years old and I
saw all these books and I had no idea
why we were there when I don't have any
money to buy one book and so what am I
gonna do with all these you know
hundreds of books up on the shelf
and he very patiently walked me through
the whole thing
and again I was very reluctant to take
out a library cause hiding to watch what
all this is about that but he talked me
into it
and I said I bought a couple of books
and really had I not encountered him the
entire rest of the story could not have
been the way it was I mean at some point
I would have learned what a public
library was but by that point it would
be too late yeah I mean when you start
getting in the habit of reading when
you're eight years old
that's a different ballgame than if you
have to wait till you're a teenager it's
too late now
dare I ask if you have any recollection
what you might have taken out of the
library at eight years old one of the
books was the Doctor Dolittle
books I don't know if you know what
those are I think he could talk to the
animals yeah Alison Wonderland
and the rest of them but the I came in
on May and there wasn't school wasn't
open until September so I had no one to
play with and I was just bored to tears
and so I started reading really for the
first time and I got the habit of
reading and on that you know that made
the rest possible yeah were there any
other formative things that happened to
you over those those younger years yes
the same the same fellow it was very
knowledgeable but all about the school
system so when I finished elementary
school and they assigned me to a junior
high school in a very bad neighborhood
he told me that you you can get
transferred and I in fact got
transferred to a much better school
had I gone to that other school I again
the story would have been entirely
different and I one of the one of the
themes of the early part of the book
here is that there are there a whole
number of things that have to come
together and if you don't have all of
those prerequisites then all the
whatever good qualities you have don't
matter and I mentioned illiteracy that
you know in the middle of the 20th
century something like 40% of the adults
in the world we're still illiterate and
so it doesn't matter what their native
talent or any of that came along you
can't read there are a whole lot of
occupation you just simply can't get
into yeah so it's pretty clear from all
the reading of yours that I've done you
put basic education basically is number
one right I mean is that the number one
thing that you can do as a human being
get educated
I guess although I wouldn't carry it too
far because some of the most disastrous
notions in the world who come from
highly educated people with I'm sure
high IQs so perhaps critical thinking
with a little education though I am I
will settle for almost any kind of thing
it's so really that it is oddly rare so
one of the things that I found out that
was sort of amazing about your history
you briefly mentioned it right before we
started you were a Marxist at one time
in your life most people will find this
hard to believe but it is true
but it's not that unusual
most of the leading conservative
thinkers of our time did not start off
as conservator you got a couple like
Bill Buckley and George Will but I mean
Milton Friedman was it was it was a
liberal and a Keynesian a Hayek was a
socialist Ronald Reagan was so far left
at one point the FBI was following him
you know so so there's a huge movement
from the left to the right as people get
older yeah I'm I'm well aware as I
mentioned to you earlier as a former
progressive I understand that that
movement in the modern sense
do you remember sort of what you were
thinking what appeal to you at that time
about Marxism yes I mean there was no
alternative being discussed my first job
was as a Western Union messenger and I
would come home on some nights I would
take the Fifth Avenue bus which cost all
of 15 cents in those days but I figured
I'd splurge now and then and I would
drive it would go away up Fifth Avenue
pass all these Lord and Taylor and all
these fancy places and then across 57th
Street pass Carnegie Hall and down
Riverside Drive now it's sort of the
Gold Coast area and then yes I came
across this long viaduct and it turned
into 130 Fifth Street
suddenly there were the tenements and I
wondered why is this
I mean it's so so it's so different and
then nothing in in schools or most of
the books seem to deal with that and
walks dealt with that so it's it's it's
like winning in an election when there's
only one person running so then what was
your wake up to what was wrong with that
line of thinking facts well we could
probably end the interview right there
facts and specifically my first
professional job I was a summer intern
at the new US Department of Labor and I
realized from dealing with these people
that the US Department of Labor one of
my biggest concern was about minimum
wages it has been for a long time and so
my first night well this is good because
all these people look poor and he'll get
a little higher
and come and so that'll that'll be
helpful and then it's like studied
economics ever gonna see well there's a
downside they may lose their jobs
completely sort of is that and so I
tried when I was at the Labor Department
I tried to talk about that to them and
eventually I came up with some test of
it and when I came up with this test how
we might test this I was waiting to hear
congratulations you said I've had this
and I can see these people were stunned
I said oh this is idiot has stumbled on
something that will ruin us all and I
realized the US Department of Labor had
its own agenda and interests and that
did necessary not necessarily mean that
then that whether four people lost their
jobs or minimum wages when it got higher
pay was their highest priority yeah how
much longer did you last know that would
know that was really the turning point
yeah and then I began to see that all
these government agencies more knots
they have their own institutional
incentives and and you cannot say that
the government is will step in and do
what's right for these people or what
not because they'll do what's right for
themselves so I think a lot of people
watching this and I know because I've
been so open about my own sort of
awakening are going through this right
now they're realizing that the things
that they've been taught for so long are
not the the truth and are not based in
fact when that happened to you and you
started telling other people not just
the people you were working with be it
family and friends what kind of pushback
did you get because it was sort of
radical ideas in a way that you were
talking about that well I find I didn't
feel any need to do a lot a lot of
proselytizing it was enough for me that
that I was now beginning to understand
things I hadn't understood before and
you've noted in the book I have a
mission minimum wage studies and really
they're they're they are incredibly
flawed there's a whole chapter on
numbers and the other thing getting back
to my personal development I mean I left
home when I was 17 no high school
diploma no excuse no job experience and
I discovered that there was not a huge
amount of demand for people like that
but in retrospect decades later when I
do research I realize that in 1948 the
unemployment rate for black 16 and
17-year olds was nine point four for
whites the same age it was ten point two
and those numbers are much smaller than
we were used to in recent decades and
there's no serious racial difference in
fact the blacks and at my age bracket
we're doing just slightly better and of
course one of the things that the
minimum wage law does is that it it
creates unemployment raised it to
multiples of what it was 1948 was that
was a special time because the minimum
wage law was passed in 1938 and in the
intervening ten years there was huge
inflation and the law hadn't gotten
changed and so for all practical
purposes there was no minimum wage law
but had we had these wonderful liberals
insisting that I be paid a living wage
that would support a family of four I
would have been unemployed and I don't
know what that would have let him write
it would probably would not have led up
to everything else so when you wouldn't
when you think about these wonderful
liberals as you just said you know I
think there's sort of two lines of
thinking one is that you know the road
to hell is paved with good intentions I
try not to be super highway it's a super
highway exactly I try not to besmirch
their intentions but then I think there
are people that are either can have
confused thinking or have ulterior
motives
or else what do you think it is as
someone that is so based in fact and
we're gonna get to have plenty of that
fact in a moment what do you think the
thinking is the flaw in the thinking oh
I think it's the idea that you don't
have to check a good-sounding idea
against what actually happens the whole
19th and there are people to this day
who think that the 1960s was just a
great period and and I'll say to them do
you realize how many good trends they're
there the murder rate among black males
had gone down had been going down for
two decades you know by 18 percent in
one decade 22 percent a nice decade and
in 1960
suddenly takes a u-turn straight up and
that was not peculiar to blacks or even
to the United States
Pinker's book about about violence and
you know that throughout what the
Western world the homicide rates did a
u-turn in the 1960s so the question is
what actually happens when you put your
wonderful ideas to work do they produce
the kind of thing you thought they were
gonna produce or do they produce all the
opposite in many areas and they produce
lots of offices yeah I'm glad you
mentioned Steven Pinker I had him on the
show a few weeks ago and I think he's
you know he's one of the clearest
thinkers we have and you know his new
book enlightenment now is that things
are trending more positively
but even hearing that is is very hard
for a lot of people well honey depends
on what your baseline is Pinker is much
more optimistic than I am I I happen to
be very pessimistic about the future but
I hope the optimists are right do you do
you think you're a pessimist by Nature
no but I think having study of so many
things that sounded so good and ended up
so bad it makes me doubt especially when
they're people who are anxious to spout
off with very little study of what
they're talking about yeah we've got a
lot of that these days do you think that
has ramped up or yeah I think social
media seems to amplify things but do you
think it's always been that way about
just sort of this endless pontificating
of people that really don't know what
they're talking about well there's
always been that as long as they've been
human beings but the question is the
magnitude of it and the ability of
various institutions to shut out any
other viewpoint of which the
universities are the worst examples yeah
that I mean when I when I when I see the
riots when charles murray shows up and i
haveno charles murray
I mean if you can demonize Charles where
you can demonize anybody yeah I mean and
I listen to see what are they gonna
quote that he said I've never heard a
single quote of all the books the man
has written and they never quote
anything he said and a lot of what he
said is a direct opposite of what they
claimed he said that tells you a little
bit about state we're in right now so do
you so this
this thing that's happening on college
campuses right now that everyone seems
to think is freezing free speech and and
it seems to be speeches speech that's
generally thought of as right so it's
conservatives libertarians further
people on the right than that you're
saying that's really not a new
phenomenon you you were kind of well it
was not that bad in the nineteen fifties
when I was a Marxist and when Senator
Joe McCarthy was Kara was tracking down
anybody on the Left but I said whatever
I felt like where I felt like it and I
got no such blowback that's really
interesting so McCarthy is talking about
all this stuff but you had no problem
no being at okay here in Washington I
was in Cambridge yeah so--but yeah so
you do think if something has gotten
worse now oh no there was a number of
things you add vanilla diseases for
example well going down at a very steep
rate it was either syphilis or gonorrhea
that was one half as prevalent in 1960
as it was in 1950 that the brilliant
idea was to bring in sex education you
see to avoid unwanted pregnancies and so
on and venereal diseases skyrocketed
unwanted pregnancies teenage pregnancies
skyrocketed it's amazing that so many
people on the Left are able to just
ignore any facts they go against their
theory yeah an image it just does not my
my old mentor at the University of
Chicago enjoy Stiegler organ however
that economists have very little
influence and what what they say makes
very little difference and he was giving
a talk at the Hoover Institution once he
said thanks to the years of dedicated
work by Tom Sowell the next minimum wage
increase will be five cents or less than
it would have been otherwise well that's
what's interesting to me is because as I
as I preface this with you I think that
the writings that you've done all these
years in these books they're becoming
culturally relevant maybe in a way that
they weren't I don't even want to say it
this way but maybe in a way that they
didn't weren't economically relevant do
you understand the point there that I
think there's a cultural relevance to
all the things that you've done for
these last you know forty some odd years
that
seem so actually powerful and impactful
to me right now
which is incredible well when it comes
to impact that's a difference the story
entirely I mean long ago I stopped
accepting invitations to testify before
congressional committees it's an
absolute waste of time they have made up
their minds and they just want to be
able to say they've heard all points of
view and then it pretty much stops there
that's right and I remember once Kenneth
Clark was I was debating him and he was
beside himself because my said suppose
it's sinister influence in Washington
this during the Reagan administration I
told him it might have my influence in
Washington is all you have to worry
about very fortunate bad yeah I have had
I can't think of anything that happened
any different that if I had never said
anything to anybody
you're being very humble saying no I'm
just realistic I'm gonna die I can't I
can't find it I can remember testifying
before one committee and the audience
was so around that the Chairman had to
back bang the gavel that the key to shut
them down and and they put some little
tiny thing in it in the law they were
building and and I would bet the rent
money that that provision is gone now
because there are so many people who
didn't why I was saying that if you're
gonna help up for kids
then give the money to the kids are you
know from provided for wherever they go
don't turn it over to the institutions
because they they will then use it in an
entirely different way are there any
examples where the money is turned over
to the institution whatever the
institution might be where it really
does work are there any aberrations in
most the must there must be some where
by law of averages but is not prevalent
yeah so a couple times you've mentioned
liberals and one of the things that I
talked about on my show often because I
[Music]
what would you do about our school
systems oh my goodness I'll try out you
try to be rational do try yeah there
they are so awful but the public has no
idea what I'm reading a book about
schools and the woman who's writing a
Diane rabbit just talking about how
teachers have due process before they
can be fired now when you look into the
facts of it right down here and I think
there's a certain they cost a half a
million dollars to fire one incompetent
teacher you know you don't have a big
enough budget you know and right and the
in New York yes when I call the rubber
room there's the teachers who are so
incompetent that the principal's don't
want them in the classroom yeah and they
get paid full salary and they show up
and they accrue a pension rights and so
forth and the last time I forget how
many millions of dollars are spent a
year in New York paying for teachers who
don't teach and in fact don't do
anything but show up at the same time as
if they were teaching and they read
magazines or whatever they feel like
doing and this this force goes on at a
time when they don't have enough money
to provide the kids with decent supplies
so how do we scale back this I mean you
can talk we can talk about it through
the lens of Education but in any and in
a area where the government has taken on
a bigger role than it's supposed to I
think one of the things you hear all the
time is it's sort of too late I think a
lot of people think it's too late to
take back no government power no you you
heavens uh during the Reagan
administration that was the only time I
know of when the Federal Register grew
smaller that is where they compile all
the laws that have been passed in a
given time so it can be done it's not
it's not it's not it's not and that's
not easy but it can be done someone
wants although some issue is said Reagan
was discussing and someone say you know
it it's complicated he said it's not
complicated it's just not easy to do I
mean right now we I
I one of the big forces out here it
talks about affordable housing and
they're pointing Blue Ribbon committees
to look into why there's no affordable
housing and I think that's that's like
appointing a blue-ribbon committee to
explain why the ground is wet after a
rain I mean it's very simple if you
prevent people from building housing and
the population is growing you're gonna
have a housing shortage yeah and you
won't have affordable housing it's
really you know economics one during the
first first two weeks they're not very
good at taking economics 101 I don't
think so so would your answer it be in
almost every case to just scale back
government scale back regulation is the
president what they don't know there was
some things that government is necessary
to do so what are those type of things
that you owe for security first of all
having having dependable laws up some
people think that if you're for free
markets that means you don't think the
government should do anything no you can
the free markets don't operate except
within a framework of laws that's wholly
different from having them operate with
politicians jumping in unpredictable
times to suddenly pass some new
legislation yeah what can we do right
now I mean so really this would be about
just sort of electing more libertarian
minded politicians then I mean is that
really the only way we can change things
do you think no I think the main thing
people have to know what the facts are
themselves if everyone knew what all the
facts were I think you'd have an
entirely different set of people elected
I I can't believe that either of the
presidential candidates in 19 and 2016
would have would have been the
candidates if you had an informed public
how much of this do you think is part of
a media's fault that's one of the things
well the media are mostly uninformed no
no they're not
uninformed they are misinformed hmm and
and and they simply do not check the
facts on the large issues are small yeah
what what can we do to fix that do you
think I mean I suppose this no no I know
you know writing books like this well
but I think more fun
mentally the public that votes has to
itself become informed and not be so
easily stampeded by slogans and a few
numbers thrown around like you know
women make X percent of what men make
and so on yeah and when I was started
studying that some years ago for example
I found out that young young female
doctors made much less money than young
male doctors not to seem like very odd
and it's right but when you're looking
into it you discover that young male
doctors work an average of 500 hours a
year more than young female doctors and
they get paid for the 500 hours but but
there's no reason why the women and men
should be doing the same thing their
circumstances are different so are there
any laws that are in place right now
that you believe are discriminatory one
way or another tort towards any
community or against any community I
would have to write a larger book to
cover them all the minimum wage law is
absolutely devastating the policy of
saying that you cannot have more kids
from one ethnic group disciplined in the
school and from another is nonsense I
mean
groups are different from each other and
umpteen ways and then this helis have
the presumption that they are the same
except for the way their they're treated
there's nonsense that's never been true
and I don't know why we would think it's
true here today so I do sense that some
of what you just said there is bubbling
up into the national consciousness evil
from black conservatives now people that
feel that they haven't been represented
fairly or that the the you know the
so-called leaders of the black community
that are on television all the time are
actually preaching the complete reverse
of everything that you've said here yeah
do you sense that there is some sort of
growing conservative movement well no
there was a community there was a time
when when that that community would
consisted of me and Walter well yeah I
know all they used to say we with the -
it should never fly on the same plane
otherwise the whole movement will
disappear that goes down well I
mentioned to you before we started that
Larry
Eldar caused my awakening because I was
a progressive and I said something to
him about systemic racism non-air man he
beat me senseless with facts and I had
to go back and reassess what was wrong
with my thinking well you know anyone in
one of the in one of the chapters there
I have a little section about the era of
apartheid under South in South Africa
and I had that in there because there's
so much argument of how much racism is
there so forth I said let's test this
hypothesis in a setting where there's
absolutely no doubt it
and that's apartheid in South Africa
with a government where blacks are not
allowed to vote and so forth and you
then apply the economic principle and
you find that the economic principles
apply in South Africa that there are
some occupations see blacks weren't
allowed by law to be insane occupations
more than the same percentage and in
some occupations couldn't be hired at
all and some of those occupations where
they couldn't be hired at all illegal to
hire them at all there were more blacks
hired than there were whites because
there are economic factors that come in
and you don't just pass law and that
automatically produces the results you
want
yeah can you go into some of the
economic factors that you mentioned
there because I thought it was sort of
interesting about the types of jobs that
I had and why that would affect well
it's it's no it's the competitiveness of
the industry and a competitive industry
discrimination and then in the sense
that we that we use for
anti-discrimination laws it costs the
discriminator as well as the others now
insofar as that price can be evaded by
the discriminated he will he will
describe for example minimum wage laws
let when you have a minimum wage law you
have more people applying for jobs in
those categories then there are jobs
available because the Razr were Asian
the wage rate causes more people to
apply and employers to hire fewer
because they're more expensive and so we
have a chronic surplus now if you've got
a chronic surplus in an industry it
costs nothing to discriminate but and
and but but if you have a competitive
market then of course it does cost
something for every person that you
discriminate against was qualified
you've got to hire somebody else and you
to raise that pavé kept raised in order
to get people in so I show how
competitive industries have much less
discrimination than say regulated public
utilities so I was wondering when I was
reading it if you were ever going to
talk about how now technology is also
changing this so we see a lot of these
movements for $15 minimum wage and I
know why you don't think that's a great
idea but even now where we see
McDonald's and some of these other
places just replacing people with yes
and computers this has been happening I
don't know when I grew up in Harlem when
you went into a movies here this is a
little neighborhood movie theater in
Harlem there would be a kid who would
walk by hot rock down the aisle with you
with a place light show you to you to
see you see and so now now that we have
so many compassionate people who wanted
want people to be paid a minute a living
wage you actually stumbled down the
charge that down the aisle to your seat
the best way you can yeah because
they're not gonna pay that kind of money
you know that's unrelated to
productivity yeah what would you say to
the people I hear a growing movement of
people saying well this is why we need a
universal basic income because
technology is going to force for so many
people out of the work place
oh and that has been and that is that
always been made for centuries and it
has been proven wrong for centuries I
would ask the question what has happened
we've moved in that direction already we
have lots of people who can live off the
welfare say and not and not and not have
to had to be productive and are they
better people as a result of that one of
I saw some time back and I haven't
followed this that young people is
suicide rates among young people were
among the negative consequences of the
1960s people you you you've taken all
meaning out of people's lives and so
they find all kinds of crazy things to
do drugs whatever and then again it's
not peculiar to the United States as you
find us in Britain other countries and
so again people who say this almost
never look at any facts about what's
happened as we expanded the welfare
state that people behave better
no you know I mean what I want one of
the one of the things that moments that
I remember very well when I was I was
back in the school in Harlem for some
reason maybe doing research and I looked
out the window and I said said you know
I when I was a teenager I used to walk a
dog my dog in that Park and look look so
horror came over the students faces
because that was a different world and
so and and when I tell them that I used
to sleep out on a fire escape on hot
summer nights go who who could afford
air-conditioning and they think I'm a
man from all people did that all over
New York they did it in Washington they
did it in North Carolina relatives were
in Washington used to go down and Haines
point down near the Jefferson Memorial
on hot summer nights and sleep there so
you know sometime after midnight when
they didn't win it when there was heat
wouldn't be so bad they'd go home at
that time you'd be out of your mind to
do that today it'd be too dangerous
yeah so how do we sort of untie some of
this so my sister right now lives on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan not too far
from Harlem and she's in a half rent
stabilizer rent-controlled building and
a 10 1/2 market price she's on the
market price so she's paying that
two-bedroom in New York City I don't
even want to tell you how expensive it
is but then there are basically half of
the building that's paying next to
nothing and that of course incentivizes
people not to get off the dole because
if you're living in a nice area on the
Upper West Side very cheap why in the
world would you ever get off the dole
how do we start solving these problems
and I know I know facts is your is your
bedrock and yes but but what can we do
to get people to understand some of this
stuff because it's C it seems so basic
to understand if someone was giving you
something that you didn't earn again
there's always hard to this again this
is common one of this and in Europe and
they England especially it's a special
problem because you you have the Hat you
have this place with where where the
you're in is subsidized and say you're
in London and job is a disappearing in
London and they are opening up in
Manchester now if you go to Manchester
you know you know you
a waiting list for that kind of job and
if you stand in London you're unemployed
but your rent is low and so Peter so you
slow down the movement of people you
slow down the turnover of people in
these apartments but again most people
who talk about this don't even talk in
terms of if this than that they talk
about it is this is how the world ought
to be well heck I got any of all kinds
of things to how I think the world ought
to be but unfortunately most of those
things involve a cost a trade-off do you
think there's a system or a government
that's doing it better doing freedom
better than we're doing it here for all
the flaws that we have in this in this
system is anyone doing it better than us
although there may be marginally so but
I think most of the Western world is
less free that than it was say 30 years
ago 40 years ago by what measurements do
you view that oh just the amount of
regulations things you could use and
also by consequences either I was
reading up Milton Friedman's he and his
wife had a joint autobiography and she's
looking at one point she says she's
looking back on the days when she would
ride the IND subway in Manhattan and
what a joy it was and she said in those
long-gone days and the IND subway goes
through Harlem and Oakland Freeman and
his wife and they were still quoting
used to go dancing at the Savoy Ballroom
very few people want want and you know
the famous theme song of Duke Ellington
take the A train the a train goes right
through Harlem on the I in these line
and so Friedman who was only five foot
two had no fear of being mugged or even
a costume and go there they were and
this was common it wasn't where there
was a black actress who used to get
finished with play and her socializing
afterwards and at one o'clock in the
morning she said she would be taking the
subway up to a hundred and 55th Street
and st. Nicholas Avenue by herself and
what I'm walking home
nobody does that these days
and so you have to look wanted what are
the facts how did they change and and
and you don't simply say the other thing
is that they're saying the No Child Left
Behind thing with bush yeah yeah there
are kids who go to school to raise hell
and a handful of those can prevent the
whole class from learning anything now
the logical thing would be to separate
those kids out and that ones who wanted
to learn something learn something you
can't do that because the ideology says
no and again so and so you sacrifice
whole generations of poor and minority
kids for this ideology and this utopian
notion yeah and we end up in an odd
dystopia probably you know I'm favor you
can say the best is the enemy of the
good and of course it would be better if
everybody could be educated at the same
time it can't be done so as someone that
has survived the the arrows and and the
the venom that the left can throw at you
because I see a lot of this these days I
see you even what they say to me I find
I get a lot of email from people saying
well how can I be brave enough to do it
and I think it's particularly a unique
situation for minorities that consider
themselves conservative or libertarian
or a little bit to the right
so I mentioned larry elder before and of
course you and my friend david webb and
i you know there there are some more
black conservatives than perhaps there
used to be oh no question about what
would be if someone's watching this
right now and just needs that little
extra bit of courage to start saying no
no no no you you have to look look at
this circumstances
I mean I've advised some young people do
not go into to indication in public
schools because the odds are so stacked
against you and people can write bad
references from you for you between
specially when you're young and you and
what they say about you is all that
there's someone sees now by the time I
was teaching at some of these schools
I remember one place where the
department used to threaten one of my
colleagues
he would
right good Rabb references form I had I
had you know I publish stuff while I was
still in graduate school I had Milton
Freeman and joy stay with the right
references for me what this guy said
there another department wouldn't
wouldn't matter a bit but but most
people don't don't have that situation
yeah and so you have to pick you yet to
pick your face so I want to time is
limited here I want to mention one thing
that you say right at the end of the
book that really what we need more than
anything else perhaps is common decency
yes and we've kind of lost that isn't
common anymore I mean when I was going
to school and we'd have fights on the
schoolyard grounds when once one guy was
clearly beaten whoever was the toughest
kids in the crowd would simply step in
and stop it the other guys he said you
want to fight you can fight me yeah that
we need in the public square now yes yes
but but with it would I mean the pool is
only so much the police can do if he if
you don't have common decency that the
the cops have are not not going to be
able to handle it especially when
everyone is second yes I love it when
people who have never fired a gun in
their lives say why did the cops fire so
many kindness now at one time I taught
pistol shooting in the Marine Corps it
doesn't surprise me in the slightest of
a shot that fired so many things under
those conditions but people you people
can't be knowledgeable about everything
but they can be knowledgeable about the
extent of their own ignorance even if
they have PhDs sir this has been a true
honor and a pleasure and I know I can
see it in your eyes even the sort of
humility that you have in humbleness but
you you've affected so many people and
are still continuing to affect so many
people and I hope that we might have
just given that a little extra bump
today so I'm truly honored that you took
your time well thank you boys
[Music]
you
[Music]
we're live on location at Stanford
University and joining me today is an
economist author scholar senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution and living
legend dr. Thomas all welcome to the
Rubin report well thank you good to be
with you I feel I have to get the
gushing out first that way we can focus
on the book I don't know that there's
anyone on this mortal coil who's writing
and thinking has influenced me more than
you so this this is truly an honor for
me and I just have to get that out right
at the beginning I just hope I haven't
miss laser yeah we'll find out I'll let
you know at the end so first I thought I
want do a little bit on your history and
I want to focus on your new book but I
was curious if you have a sense of the
sort of Renaissance that your writing is
having right now with young people
because when I tweet it out that we
finally had you on the show and we've
been trying to make this happen for
quite some time I mean thousands of
responses and I had tons of people just
says please tell him this tell him this
my awakening was because of dr. Tsao all
this are you noticing something
happening right now because of the
unique police work I only know what
people tell me that's even true at
Stanford yeah I only know what my
research is sisters televisions all
right well I will certainly accept that
well take my word for it then so I want
to talk a little bit about your history
for a bit and then we'll then we'll move
on to your new book born North Carolina
yes
grew up in the Bronx Harlem in Harlem
sorry in Harlem tell me a little bit
about some of your formative years well
you know I thought about as I was doing
the research for the first chapter where
I get into the Bur sort of thing now had
my my parents lived a normal lifespan I
would have been the sixth child in the
family they died young and so I was
adopted in infancy and a family as it
only traces an only child in a home with
four adults and in terms of what what I
found in the research on birth order
clearly that was a huge advantage
and so their misfortune was my good
fortune and moreover the family in which
I was raised moved to New York which at
that time had a foster period
educational system that in North
Carolina and foster period of what it is
today
were you always interested in education
I mean even as you know I got a kid a
little kid there was nothing in my
background that will put me there
but fortunately when in Harlem knows a
kid named ready that members of the
family had run into before I ever
arrived from North Carolina on it and he
was a very came from a highly educated
family and they immediately saw the
implications if they could get him to to
sort of mentor me and now I had I had
met Eddie on my own chances I would
never have seen any significance he was
just a vision one of the people I passed
by but of course the other the adults
understood what the future was like and
then thinking about things that kids
don't think about despite the great
worship which a child talkers these days
and so but so he took me to a public
library and I had no idea what a public
library was I was eight years old and I
saw all these books and I had no idea
why we were there when I don't have any
money to buy one book and so what am I
gonna do with all these you know
hundreds of books up on the shelf
and he very patiently walked me through
the whole thing
and again I was very reluctant to take
out a library cause hiding to watch what
all this is about that but he talked me
into it
and I said I bought a couple of books
and really had I not encountered him the
entire rest of the story could not have
been the way it was I mean at some point
I would have learned what a public
library was but by that point it would
be too late yeah I mean when you start
getting in the habit of reading when
you're eight years old
that's a different ballgame than if you
have to wait till you're a teenager it's
too late now
dare I ask if you have any recollection
what you might have taken out of the
library at eight years old one of the
books was the Doctor Dolittle
books I don't know if you know what
those are I think he could talk to the
animals yeah Alison Wonderland
and the rest of them but the I came in
on May and there wasn't school wasn't
open until September so I had no one to
play with and I was just bored to tears
and so I started reading really for the
first time and I got the habit of
reading and on that you know that made
the rest possible yeah were there any
other formative things that happened to
you over those those younger years yes
the same the same fellow it was very
knowledgeable but all about the school
system so when I finished elementary
school and they assigned me to a junior
high school in a very bad neighborhood
he told me that you you can get
transferred and I in fact got
transferred to a much better school
had I gone to that other school I again
the story would have been entirely
different and I one of the one of the
themes of the early part of the book
here is that there are there a whole
number of things that have to come
together and if you don't have all of
those prerequisites then all the
whatever good qualities you have don't
matter and I mentioned illiteracy that
you know in the middle of the 20th
century something like 40% of the adults
in the world we're still illiterate and
so it doesn't matter what their native
talent or any of that came along you
can't read there are a whole lot of
occupation you just simply can't get
into yeah so it's pretty clear from all
the reading of yours that I've done you
put basic education basically is number
one right I mean is that the number one
thing that you can do as a human being
get educated
I guess although I wouldn't carry it too
far because some of the most disastrous
notions in the world who come from
highly educated people with I'm sure
high IQs so perhaps critical thinking
with a little education though I am I
will settle for almost any kind of thing
it's so really that it is oddly rare so
one of the things that I found out that
was sort of amazing about your history
you briefly mentioned it right before we
started you were a Marxist at one time
in your life most people will find this
hard to believe but it is true
but it's not that unusual
most of the leading conservative
thinkers of our time did not start off
as conservator you got a couple like
Bill Buckley and George Will but I mean
Milton Friedman was it was it was a
liberal and a Keynesian a Hayek was a
socialist Ronald Reagan was so far left
at one point the FBI was following him
you know so so there's a huge movement
from the left to the right as people get
older yeah I'm I'm well aware as I
mentioned to you earlier as a former
progressive I understand that that
movement in the modern sense
do you remember sort of what you were
thinking what appeal to you at that time
about Marxism yes I mean there was no
alternative being discussed my first job
was as a Western Union messenger and I
would come home on some nights I would
take the Fifth Avenue bus which cost all
of 15 cents in those days but I figured
I'd splurge now and then and I would
drive it would go away up Fifth Avenue
pass all these Lord and Taylor and all
these fancy places and then across 57th
Street pass Carnegie Hall and down
Riverside Drive now it's sort of the
Gold Coast area and then yes I came
across this long viaduct and it turned
into 130 Fifth Street
suddenly there were the tenements and I
wondered why is this
I mean it's so so it's so different and
then nothing in in schools or most of
the books seem to deal with that and
walks dealt with that so it's it's it's
like winning in an election when there's
only one person running so then what was
your wake up to what was wrong with that
line of thinking facts well we could
probably end the interview right there
facts and specifically my first
professional job I was a summer intern
at the new US Department of Labor and I
realized from dealing with these people
that the US Department of Labor one of
my biggest concern was about minimum
wages it has been for a long time and so
my first night well this is good because
all these people look poor and he'll get
a little higher
and come and so that'll that'll be
helpful and then it's like studied
economics ever gonna see well there's a
downside they may lose their jobs
completely sort of is that and so I
tried when I was at the Labor Department
I tried to talk about that to them and
eventually I came up with some test of
it and when I came up with this test how
we might test this I was waiting to hear
congratulations you said I've had this
and I can see these people were stunned
I said oh this is idiot has stumbled on
something that will ruin us all and I
realized the US Department of Labor had
its own agenda and interests and that
did necessary not necessarily mean that
then that whether four people lost their
jobs or minimum wages when it got higher
pay was their highest priority yeah how
much longer did you last know that would
know that was really the turning point
yeah and then I began to see that all
these government agencies more knots
they have their own institutional
incentives and and you cannot say that
the government is will step in and do
what's right for these people or what
not because they'll do what's right for
themselves so I think a lot of people
watching this and I know because I've
been so open about my own sort of
awakening are going through this right
now they're realizing that the things
that they've been taught for so long are
not the the truth and are not based in
fact when that happened to you and you
started telling other people not just
the people you were working with be it
family and friends what kind of pushback
did you get because it was sort of
radical ideas in a way that you were
talking about that well I find I didn't
feel any need to do a lot a lot of
proselytizing it was enough for me that
that I was now beginning to understand
things I hadn't understood before and
you've noted in the book I have a
mission minimum wage studies and really
they're they're they are incredibly
flawed there's a whole chapter on
numbers and the other thing getting back
to my personal development I mean I left
home when I was 17 no high school
diploma no excuse no job experience and
I discovered that there was not a huge
amount of demand for people like that
but in retrospect decades later when I
do research I realize that in 1948 the
unemployment rate for black 16 and
17-year olds was nine point four for
whites the same age it was ten point two
and those numbers are much smaller than
we were used to in recent decades and
there's no serious racial difference in
fact the blacks and at my age bracket
we're doing just slightly better and of
course one of the things that the
minimum wage law does is that it it
creates unemployment raised it to
multiples of what it was 1948 was that
was a special time because the minimum
wage law was passed in 1938 and in the
intervening ten years there was huge
inflation and the law hadn't gotten
changed and so for all practical
purposes there was no minimum wage law
but had we had these wonderful liberals
insisting that I be paid a living wage
that would support a family of four I
would have been unemployed and I don't
know what that would have let him write
it would probably would not have led up
to everything else so when you wouldn't
when you think about these wonderful
liberals as you just said you know I
think there's sort of two lines of
thinking one is that you know the road
to hell is paved with good intentions I
try not to be super highway it's a super
highway exactly I try not to besmirch
their intentions but then I think there
are people that are either can have
confused thinking or have ulterior
motives
or else what do you think it is as
someone that is so based in fact and
we're gonna get to have plenty of that
fact in a moment what do you think the
thinking is the flaw in the thinking oh
I think it's the idea that you don't
have to check a good-sounding idea
against what actually happens the whole
19th and there are people to this day
who think that the 1960s was just a
great period and and I'll say to them do
you realize how many good trends they're
there the murder rate among black males
had gone down had been going down for
two decades you know by 18 percent in
one decade 22 percent a nice decade and
in 1960
suddenly takes a u-turn straight up and
that was not peculiar to blacks or even
to the United States
Pinker's book about about violence and
you know that throughout what the
Western world the homicide rates did a
u-turn in the 1960s so the question is
what actually happens when you put your
wonderful ideas to work do they produce
the kind of thing you thought they were
gonna produce or do they produce all the
opposite in many areas and they produce
lots of offices yeah I'm glad you
mentioned Steven Pinker I had him on the
show a few weeks ago and I think he's
you know he's one of the clearest
thinkers we have and you know his new
book enlightenment now is that things
are trending more positively
but even hearing that is is very hard
for a lot of people well honey depends
on what your baseline is Pinker is much
more optimistic than I am I I happen to
be very pessimistic about the future but
I hope the optimists are right do you do
you think you're a pessimist by Nature
no but I think having study of so many
things that sounded so good and ended up
so bad it makes me doubt especially when
they're people who are anxious to spout
off with very little study of what
they're talking about yeah we've got a
lot of that these days do you think that
has ramped up or yeah I think social
media seems to amplify things but do you
think it's always been that way about
just sort of this endless pontificating
of people that really don't know what
they're talking about well there's
always been that as long as they've been
human beings but the question is the
magnitude of it and the ability of
various institutions to shut out any
other viewpoint of which the
universities are the worst examples yeah
that I mean when I when I when I see the
riots when charles murray shows up and i
haveno charles murray
I mean if you can demonize Charles where
you can demonize anybody yeah I mean and
I listen to see what are they gonna
quote that he said I've never heard a
single quote of all the books the man
has written and they never quote
anything he said and a lot of what he
said is a direct opposite of what they
claimed he said that tells you a little
bit about state we're in right now so do
you so this
this thing that's happening on college
campuses right now that everyone seems
to think is freezing free speech and and
it seems to be speeches speech that's
generally thought of as right so it's
conservatives libertarians further
people on the right than that you're
saying that's really not a new
phenomenon you you were kind of well it
was not that bad in the nineteen fifties
when I was a Marxist and when Senator
Joe McCarthy was Kara was tracking down
anybody on the Left but I said whatever
I felt like where I felt like it and I
got no such blowback that's really
interesting so McCarthy is talking about
all this stuff but you had no problem
no being at okay here in Washington I
was in Cambridge yeah so--but yeah so
you do think if something has gotten
worse now oh no there was a number of
things you add vanilla diseases for
example well going down at a very steep
rate it was either syphilis or gonorrhea
that was one half as prevalent in 1960
as it was in 1950 that the brilliant
idea was to bring in sex education you
see to avoid unwanted pregnancies and so
on and venereal diseases skyrocketed
unwanted pregnancies teenage pregnancies
skyrocketed it's amazing that so many
people on the Left are able to just
ignore any facts they go against their
theory yeah an image it just does not my
my old mentor at the University of
Chicago enjoy Stiegler organ however
that economists have very little
influence and what what they say makes
very little difference and he was giving
a talk at the Hoover Institution once he
said thanks to the years of dedicated
work by Tom Sowell the next minimum wage
increase will be five cents or less than
it would have been otherwise well that's
what's interesting to me is because as I
as I preface this with you I think that
the writings that you've done all these
years in these books they're becoming
culturally relevant maybe in a way that
they weren't I don't even want to say it
this way but maybe in a way that they
didn't weren't economically relevant do
you understand the point there that I
think there's a cultural relevance to
all the things that you've done for
these last you know forty some odd years
that
seem so actually powerful and impactful
to me right now
which is incredible well when it comes
to impact that's a difference the story
entirely I mean long ago I stopped
accepting invitations to testify before
congressional committees it's an
absolute waste of time they have made up
their minds and they just want to be
able to say they've heard all points of
view and then it pretty much stops there
that's right and I remember once Kenneth
Clark was I was debating him and he was
beside himself because my said suppose
it's sinister influence in Washington
this during the Reagan administration I
told him it might have my influence in
Washington is all you have to worry
about very fortunate bad yeah I have had
I can't think of anything that happened
any different that if I had never said
anything to anybody
you're being very humble saying no I'm
just realistic I'm gonna die I can't I
can't find it I can remember testifying
before one committee and the audience
was so around that the Chairman had to
back bang the gavel that the key to shut
them down and and they put some little
tiny thing in it in the law they were
building and and I would bet the rent
money that that provision is gone now
because there are so many people who
didn't why I was saying that if you're
gonna help up for kids
then give the money to the kids are you
know from provided for wherever they go
don't turn it over to the institutions
because they they will then use it in an
entirely different way are there any
examples where the money is turned over
to the institution whatever the
institution might be where it really
does work are there any aberrations in
most the must there must be some where
by law of averages but is not prevalent
yeah so a couple times you've mentioned
liberals and one of the things that I
talked about on my show often because I
[Music]
one of the things that most amazed by at
the moment is how the ideas and issues
that we're talking about every week here
on the Rubin report are relevant not
just in America but all over the world
the amount of email I'm getting from you
guys across the globe whether it's
Sweden Australia Brazil hungry or Japan
is actually staggering it really seems
to me that there has been a reawakening
as to what being a free human being is
all about you are in charge of your own
life and if you start with this simple
premise you can accomplish anything
while the discourse on social media may
seem more toxic than ever I see a
growing dynamic group of people coming
together through ideas and conversation
regardless of where they were born or
the color of their skin
we're partnering with learn Liberty
again this week and our guest is Rajshri
Agarwal she was born in India to a
traditional family only moved to America
where she now teaches about capitalism
at the University of Maryland where she
is the chair and professor of
entrepreneurship
she believes that capitalism provides
maximum freedom and happiness to all
people regardless of race religion or
anything else the ideas of freedom that
once sparked in her as a young child are
the same ideas that she's now helping
further by teaching minds of young
people today that is what freedom is all
about if you want to join me in
spreading these ideas of freedom and
individuality in person I'll be joining
Jordan Peterson on his twelve rules for
life tour for as many dates as I can
possibly fit in we kicked off the tour a
couple weeks ago at the beacon in New
York City where the energy in the room
was absolutely bananas I'll be traveling
with Jordan to the UK to speak in London
at the Apollo Hammersmith theatre on May
13th and then on May 14th I have the
incredible honor of speaking at the
Oxford Union hopefully I'll get to meet
as many of you guys as possible and I
also promise to down as many pints as
possible I'm also working on an
Australian tour and hope to have some
more info on that for you guys soon you
know I've mentioned on the show lately
that the endless hysteria of the left
and the politically correct craziness
that were caught up and was eventually
gonna drag me back into stand-up comedy
and this finally came to fruition this
past Sunday at the Irvine improv the
show was billed as an evening of stand
up and sit down
as I did about an hour of stand-up and
then Bob Saget joined me on stage for
about 45 minutes of a sit-down
it was awesome meeting so many of you
guys out there in the show was a huge
success the manager of the Improv even
told me that it was the first sold-out
standing ovation she's seen at the club
in her 18 years we're gonna announce
travel dates for upcoming stand-up gigs
pretty soon and I hope that you guys
will join me for at least a two-drink
minimum and plenty of laughs and finally
after years in the making we taped our
interview with dr. Thomas soul yesterday
on location at Stanford University in
San Francisco we flew our whole team up
there and rented a studio to make it
happen it was truly a personal and
career highlight for me and I can't wait
to share our sit-down with you next week
big thanks to our supporters on patreon
who make interviews like this possible
so all these announcements aside whether
you're in the US India Oxford San
Francisco or anywhere else we're all in
this fight together keep fighting for
what you believe in and I'll do the same
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is
the Rudolph pilla moan chair and
professor of entrepreneurship at the
University of Maryland as well as the
director for the ED Snyder Center for
enterprise and economics Rhodri Agarwal
welcome to the Rubin report thank you
for having me Dave I feel we're gonna
have a very good talk because we've
already sort of had the interview before
we started we've been doing it already
I'm looking forward to this because we
did meet once before we were at a
conference in DC that was sort of
focusing on academia and free speech and
we spent a couple of minutes talking and
what I thought was interesting yeah I
don't think you knew who I was before
ending that I didn't know who you were
beforehand and they sort of brought me
there to talk a little bit about how
YouTube plays a part in reaching young
people and technology and all that and
you were very interested in that so we
didn't really focus on free speech
together but we focused on how
technology is shifting the conversation
so just very quickly to start why are
you interested in how technology is
affecting the conversation related to
free speech capitalism the whole thing
so I'm not interested in technology per
se but I'm interested in technology
because it represents the manifestation
of the human mind at work ultimately
what is technology technology is better
machines but what are machines
ultimately whether they're fast
computers or whether they're the
industrialized age engines or whatever
you call it right they are ways for us
humans to make our lives easier by using
machines so technology ultimately is a
way for humans to communicate better to
live better lives and to use their mind
in doing so yeah so I study innovation I
study technology because it enables us
to be the best we can be by using our
mind I was very proud when you walked in
here because you study innovation and
entrepreneurship and this is my garage
that we turned into a studio so I
thought yes and think about all of the
creativity that went into it right not
just by you but all of the things all of
the the techniques the machines that
we're looking around it was someone's
mind that had to come up with it first
so creativity which is at the heart of
individual enterprise is what I love and
that's what I study all right so that's
what we're gonna spend most of this hour
talking about and you know when we do
these shows with Liron Liberty they
always send me just a quick one-page bio
on everybody and I really loved yours
there was a bunch of quotes in there
that I that I want to quote directly to
you but you should know that when they
asked me to write that bio I dish that
out in about 15 minutes at 4:30 in the
morning oh look at you patting yourself
on the back but first let's talk a
little bit about your history because
you have an interesting history you were
born in India and you lived there for
that for your first 21 years talk a
little bit about that well I was born to
a very very traditional family Hindu
family my father was your typical rags
to riches on the
he embodied enterprise and he in fact
I'll tell you about this one story I was
in fifth grade and I came home so upset
because the history lesson that I had
just heard was all about how the United
Kingdom Britain came in and just
plundered this golden peacock that was
India and look at all the nasty things
that they did to us and how oppressed
and victimized we were and my father who
is a very much a traditional Orthodox
Hindu at that time said no actually
Britain did more good for India than
they did bad and it's like huh what do
you mean by that and he went on to talk
about why before that it's true that
India was rich but what did rich mean it
meant that the kings and the traders
were rich but there was a very feudalist
economy at that time and of course they
were also very balcan eyes because each
of these kingdoms were fighting with
each other so one of the things that he
talked about is how the advent of the
British you know they bought the rule of
law they bought infrastructure they gave
us English as a language you know often
people my husband says oh wow you talk
better English than I do and it's like
yes that's because I was educated in
English as well yeah but at the same
time that he was such entrepreneur in
his mindset he was very traditionalist
in his views of how women should be and
so when I was 12 years old he said to me
the right and the responsibility of
finding a husband for you is mine don't
you forget that and of course any woman
in his family couldn't work because that
was a slap on his face in his ability to
provide for us but if you think about it
at 12 years old I'm being told that the
two biggest decisions any individual can
make for themselves
will you marry and what you choose to
work in and I and I and I tell you know
I'd like to think that those two
decisions under grid everything that we
do both at work and they're not work
life that we live
if those are taken away from you what
does that mean
about you as an individual you as a
person
so between 12 and 18 I had to navigate
that distance because at 12 years old I
was a daddy's girl
I said of course that just please do me
a favor find me a husband who lives in
Bombay because I can't even bear the
thought of being in a city that's
different from you and at 18 I had to
see for myself that I couldn't renege on
that decision so between 18 and 21 was
really my discovery of who I wanted to
be and at 21 I left India two suitcases
in my hand left everybody that I loved a
very generous inheritance my father did
not speak to me for seven years Wow I
mean there's there's so much there of
your formative stuff that leads you to
where you're at right now when you came
home that day in fifth grade you learn
something in school and then you hear
something different from your father who
you obviously respected and admired and
had as you said rags to riches had
provided a good life for you guys how
did you go back to school after that I
mean did you go back and start arguing
with teachers is that even these arguing
with teachers I've in fact I'd remember
my science teacher saying Rajshri why do
you ask so many wise pretty sure that's
not what a science teacher is supposed
to say that's right that's really
fascinating so you picked up and left
yes and and left an inheritance all this
you you get to America just tell me a
little bit about that initial experience
so for me this was freedom it was you
know I had lived in India especially in
the generation that I was in a woman
didn't a girl or a woman did not live by
themselves right they got they stayed
with their parents so they were married
and then they went to their husband's
house so the concept of really being
yourself and having the responsibility
to make your own choices is both
liberating but then I
also realize I can't blame my parents
for my mistakes anymore
indeed five years later when my mom or
six years later when my mom came to
visit with us my husband said you know
what is the one biggest difference that
you see in your daughter and this will
tell you a little bit about my
personality there too she says to him
she's become very responsible wow that's
fascinating action and she's uses this
as evidence she says you know our her
father used to give her a very generous
allowance but we were we would marvel at
the fact that this kid would go through
this allowance within ten or twelve days
and then she'd say I'd like more and
then her father would sometimes give it
and sometimes there's no that's all
you're gonna get so then she'd come to
me or she'd come to her brother or I
started to tutor because I often said I
own my own bread and butter but my
father provided we might put with the
chance but one of the things that she
said was now she looks at me and she
realizes just how responsible I've
become that we're before money would
just flow off of my fingers and I
wouldn't give it a second thought
I had become so much more responsible in
my thinking and I think she was talking
a lot more about than just money in
India I was rebelling mm-hmm
because I was fighting against something
I came to the United States I didn't
have to fight against anything so I had
to figure out who I was and what I
really wanted to be yeah and it allowed
me to thrive yeah so you mentioned you
didn't talk to your father for seven
years after that had it how did the
reconciliation at it or was it a
reconciliation in fact one of the things
that I really really treasure is you
know for the I was a daddy's girl
and I did want his approval and after I
got my PhD I remember this one
conversation that I had with him where I
was this prodigal daughter he was just
finally talking to me again I think he'd
given up on the fact that I would be
this person that would ultimately come
home with my tail between my legs and
say you know you were right I was wrong
he just completely given up on that
and so he was listening to me and of
course I was trying to impress him so I
was talking to him about all of these
achievements as a young assistant
professor I'd received a couple of
awards I was getting to go to these
prestigious conferences and he's
listening but there's silence on his
side and the more I'm talking the more
he's silent and then finally I just gave
I had nothing more to brag about or talk
about and I wasn't getting me I'm so
proud of you from him and so there was
this uncomfortable silence after which
he says it's a phrase in Hindi which
roughly translated says if a peacock
dances in a forest who sees so who cares
and his point to me was you can be all
of the peacock you are but if you're not
next to me it doesn't mean anything so
that was the harshness that we started
off with even in the reconciliation but
my last visit with him paradoxically was
when I was asked to give a keynote in
India this was immediately after India's
liberalisation it was thriving as an
economy that we now know it to be and so
I was asked to give a keynote at an
academic conference on entrepreneurship
and economic growth and so on my way to
this conference I stopped by and ten
years after I have done my PhD I'm
finally talking to my father about my
research and connecting it to his own
entrepreneurial spirit and him being a
serial entrepreneur and I can finally
see the pride in his eyes you got I got
there and then at the keynote at the end
of this thing when you go to India you
realize that when you give a speech
they'll give you a present so in front
of about 500 people they give me this
present that I open and believe it or
not it's a peacock seems bidding seems
yes there's so much there and it's so
obvious hearing the story how it led to
all of the things that you're teaching
about now and care about the concept
between the battle between sort of
traditionalism yes
and then the
tripping Oriole spirit is really a
fascinating one because he obviously had
that yes he built something for himself
built a good life and then still wanted
that piece of sort of the old world and
I think we all kind of struggle with
that in a way maybe that's what the
struggle of Western civilization is and
I actually think that this relates to
often the need to think and integrate
one's psychological growth with one's
growth in the material and in the riches
realm so one of the things that I think
my father was as a paradox unfortunately
and I think that caused him as well as
me so much of this angst between us is
that at the same time that he applied
his intellect into the economic realm he
psychologically did not necessarily
realize that you know part of the reason
he was successful is because he was able
to make his own decisions which also
meant the freedom to make your own
mistakes and learn from your mistakes so
while he allowed that there as far as
his family was concerned there was this
very protectionist I need to take care
of you right but that I'm realizing this
as a parent is not very conducive to
your children's growth because what you
really need to give them are the tools
to make their own decisions as opposed
to telling them you know this is the way
you should do it yeah and ironically had
you not broken away and been free
although although he may have been very
pleased with your life and who knows
what your life would be and maybe you
maybe you would be happy in some ways it
wouldn't have led you to all this so you
had to directly I have to do that yes so
so one more thing about India before we
move on to everything else you're doing
I told you right before we started that
I get a ton of fan mail from India I
think there's some really interesting
political things happening right there
that seem to be driving people to
watching shows like this just give me
one thing that we should know about
India right now that maybe we don't know
as
which i think is probably probably
everything because India never comes up
in the news really yes so so I I can
talk about India right now a little less
than I can talk about the India that I
grew up in and why growing up in India
actually fostered my entrepreneurial
spirit okay so we can do it a little bit
a little bit of that right and I think
that that is one of the aspects this
definitely selection at play right I do
think that across every culture people
individuals are born tabula rasa some
cultures are much more conducive to
having the entrepreneurial spirit bloom
and as a result you see people go so
much farther but there are other cults
and other cultures stifle it but as
individuals I think we all have the same
proclivity to be the persons that we can
be but one of the things that I will
always credit in my education in India
is the focus on thinking and critical
thinking and intellectualism so the
concept of a nerd growing up for me was
unheard of because the coolest kids were
also the ones that participated in
science and elocution debates you know I
was always at the forefront I wasn't so
much of a sports person but I was very
much in debates in elocution
competitions and science competitions
and so on and that was cool that was a
United States right so the concept that
there's a nerd and a nerd is socially
awkward was was unheard off for me I'll
give you another example you know my
brother was the one that first talked to
me about Iran and of course in that
journey that I was telling you about
where I had to find my own identity
reading Atlas Shrugged was really the
pillar of strength and helped me
identify my own sense of life but the
way I read Atlas Shrugged you'd find
very funny is in colleges in India if
you're a guy and you want to impress a
chick you carry at least in my time a
paperback novel of Atlas Shrugged in
your back pocket
because that means that you're
intellectually you're thinking now I was
also said it was also said that's so
fascinating right and it's also said
well if you're young then you believe in
these views but then you grow up and you
grow over it
I have never grown over it I think that
that aspect of the mind the ability to
think through decisions is one that I
will credit the Indian culture and my
father for endowing in me yeah well
you'll be happy to know as I mentioned
to you before that you know I was at the
[Music]
all right so everything that we spent
the first 30 some-odd minutes talking
about it sort of leads to academic
integrity yes it sounds like to me that
these that we need not only the the
students to have some integrity but the
administrators the professor's
everything else everyone at the
University all together do you think
that's a fair assessment
absolutely in fact I think that we often
confuse the terms academic freedom and
academic integrity would we really care
about his academic integrity first and
foremost an academic integrity really
means that I'm not gonna sell my soul or
my ideas based on the highest bidder I
believe that you know and this is again
the search for truth that requires
integrity and then of course I have the
freedom to collaborate with people
including donors on areas where we find
mutually beneficial relationships and
win-win trade yeah so one of the things
that you talked about I referenced it
earlier in one of these quotes that you
really focus on is upward mobility yes
and it I think it's particularly
interesting right now because if you
listen to some of our political leaders
it seems like we've sort of completely
lost the ability that we you know we're
separated by class and all that you come
from a place where upward mobility was
very hard it's gotten less hard as
they've embraced as India has embraced
capitalism first I guess in the most
broad sense tell me why you think upward
mobility is so important but more
importantly what's the state of it in
America right now so I actually think
that we in the United States focus on
upward mobility as if this was a major
problem in the u.s. other countries are
becoming more market oriented than the
United States the United States still
stands as the one place where you really
really have the ability to be upwardly
mobile and I think that is the greatest
asset that the United States still have
and I'm very proud to
all this country my country of choice so
let's sit in that idea for a second
because I totally agree with it and it
seems to me that all of the people who
say that's not true are missing that our
laws here allow you to do whatever you
want with your life it doesn't mean that
you are gonna do it it doesn't mean that
it's gonna be handed to you yes but as
you just said as an immigrant that came
here that has become tremendously
successful you're living proof that you
can do it
absolutely and that still holds in fact
in some ways I think we so take these
laws for granted that we don't know what
the rest of the world is out there so my
daughters have grown up and been born in
the United States but I think that their
biggest learning moments come when they
leave the country and see things even in
India today as they as it exists they
see the disparities of the things that
they can take for granted versus in
India but you still have to fight with
the corruption you still have to fight
with the status aspects the United
States is very status free relative to
most other countries including India and
there's a dignity to human labor here
that is often missing in many other
cultures that is the aspect that I care
about when I care about upward mobility
and you know what let's be honest out
here I did not have the kind of
privileges that my daughters do I could
be mourn the fact that you know I came
from a country or from a traditional
family values that I had to the family
tradition there was such that I had to
have this fight that for sure defined me
positively but also caused some
psychological scars and of course my
hope is that my daughter's don't go
through that and I could go there and
say you know what the level at which
they're starting off is so much higher
than the level I'm starting off and
aren't they privileged and look at all
that I didn't have or I can focus their
minds and their ideas at you know you
may start here but the different
of your achievement is not your level
but where you end do you find it
fascinating that people are constantly
attacking that they are they attack
people that have a little bit more to
start which is the whole point of life
you want your children to have more the
only way the only way that it would be
fair it is not because I can't be raised
to their level right the only way to do
it is to bring them down to the level
that I started and how is that fair yeah
right and so again by focusing on the
level that one starts with as a measure
of an individual's achievement I think
is not necessarily focusing on their
individual effort and there are a lot of
people even in India you know as I said
to you my father went from rags to
riches and there were a lot of people
that there were my friends that were
quite rich and they had a very
entitlement mentality you know what I
don't think that they're any happier
then I was even when I was poorer so
this comes back to the point that you
the quote that you had i can't just
measure a person's success by their
economic riches you also happiness which
is what I care about is a state of mind
it's a state of consciousness that has
to be earned self-esteem when combined
with the sense of I'm materially at a
place that I'm comfortable or rich but
more than that psychologically and
intellectually I feel like I've made
something of myself I think Dad is
something that is so much more inspiring
to go after money
you know it's neither used to say money
is the reward not the reason and I
completely agree with that yeah it's so
interesting because I've been thinking
about this a lot lately because
obviously the show is kind of catching
fire and I'm doing okay
financially and we're building something
good and I'm traveling a lot people say
nice things to me all the time and I've
been thinking about that and people keep
saying well you're gonna get some big
offer from one of these networks or
something but but I love this like I'm
actually happy now like I'm doing what I
think I'm supposed to be doing and I
don't know where that road
but looking at everything holistically
it's not just about money it's about
doing something that gives you value and
all that but we seem not to focus enough
but that's the point right I get so much
joy so again to that quote that you were
talking about for me the journey is the
destination you know whether I I feel
younger today than I did when I was 20
years old and what's the big difference
I feel like I have earned the
self-esteem not recognition outside
because people you know and you know
this you meet a lot of people and they
come to you and say hey Dave you're so
great but who is saying you're great
makes a big difference to you hearing
whether you see what I mean so there has
to be a sense of do I believe that
you're saying I'm great for the reasons
that I value and if that is there then I
will take external adulation as a
positive if not it's Hollow
it's empty so self esteem is truly what
one should be striving for yeah do you
think at some level capitalism and maybe
the Western world in a wider sense is
suffering from success at the moment
that it almost seems like because we've
been so successful we're now going to
that place that we mentioned earlier
where we're just fighting over little
differences where then there's a lot of
people right now I mean if you talk
about socialism on college campuses
you'll you'll sell out the room you know
and if you talk about fortunately I find
when I go and I mostly talked to
libertarian or capitalist or whatever
groups you know we're doing quite well
as well but that the ideas that are
completely contrary to everything you've
just said seem to be gaining some
momentum so I don't think they're
victims of our success
I think we're victims of the fact that
we have never really sat down and
thought seriously about the reasons for
our success and by eschewing that
intellectual thought and ideas that
under underpin our success we have
actually sold our success short how
should we have done that do you mean uh
that our politicians should have talked
about it more or you mean
more in academia I think it starts from
K through 12 education actually I think
that we have taken this concept we we
have short-circuited our mind in K
through 12 education all the way through
college and this comes back to your
example of the faculty adviser that does
not want to be challenged by their
students when you have the mentality as
a teacher whether it's in K through 12
or as a professor in academia where I
know what is best and I am going to tell
you what it is as opposed to facilitate
your learning process we are not
training our students how to think
anymore we're not giving them the
ability to learn in the manner that they
do I'll give you another example
memorization cut off as a huge negative
today but you know Sir Anthony Leggett
who was annabelle or it was a Nobel
laureate and a professor at Illinois
which is where I was give this inspiring
speech to middle schoolers one day and
the theme of it was the more you know
the more you know what you don't know
knowledge is a building on process you
have to learn first to then learn what
you need to learn again and so fostering
that spirit in students will then allow
you to go back to first principles so
it's not about being an expert on any
area but it's about any area that you
choose to go in there don't just look at
the outcomes don't just look at the
success factors and then try to emulate
the symptoms if you will or the the
things that accompany success go down to
the very fundamental levels of what are
the ideas and what are the first
principles that enable success to begin
with it's interesting because this seems
to be a place where maybe technology has
harmed us because it's like instead of
having a holistic and integral view of
really knowing what you're talking about
well what do we do we google it so you
know you know
you'll get there right maybe yeah there
we go yeah but you but you'll get just
the quick answer instead of going to the
root of what your is where I'd say again
technology is a tool it does not absolve
us of our responsibility on how we use
the tool
I'm actually a huge fan of Google yeah
Google Scholar has made my life so much
easier I remember being a doctoral
student having to go through Lockwood
Lockwood library in 6 feet of snow in
Buffalo weather right if I wanted an
answer to a question now Google Scholar
allows me to do it in seconds know what
microfiche is exactly and I had to do my
data gathering yeah but but the point
out here is I can use Google Scholar to
get just an amazing amount of knowledge
at my fingertips how great is that
I mean I am so thankful to technology to
do that but that does not absolve me of
the responsibility of saying here is all
of the pieces of information in fact I
would say this age of information
technology the need of the mind to have
judgment and to discern across all these
pieces of information is that an
all-time high
yeah so obviously you teach and you talk
about entrepreneurial spirit and
entrepreneurship one of the things that
I think is fascinating related to
technology right now is that Peter Thiel
is leaving Silicon Valley because he
feels that collectivism leftism cultural
Marxism maybe you have some other
phrases for whatever that is has sort of
crushed the ability to think so that
there isn't the creativity coming out of
Silicon Valley that there used to be
which is why we don't have that many new
apps anymore we don't have that many new
breaking technologies and he is a
capitalist and he's ironically moving to
LA to become freer which is sort of
where people don't think of us as a
capitalist Haven here in California yeah
and LA specifically do you find that
fascinating that that Silicon Valley
seems to lean so far left and yet is
supposed to be the place of innovation
you know now that you're saying that I
just made a connection that I never
thought of my
represents exactly that if you think
about it right he was very free market
oriented as it came to the economic
realm and being entrepreneurial in terms
of creating new products and services
and economic riches but when it came
time to thinking he was very
traditionalist and I think that that
bifurcation this mind-body dichotomy if
you will is what's plaguing a lot of
people right now so I am NOT an expert
on Silicon Valley i have noticed of
course that a lot of people so facebook
I just I just saw Mark Zuckerberg say
something to the effect of you should
have economic regulation on social media
it's like huh the whole reason why you
were successful it's because you did not
have any barriers to entry the best way
to keep a monopoly is to have government
regulation because again that's the use
of force right if I cannot go into an
industry because there is prohibition so
think about uber and what Hoover had to
deal with in the taxicab industry think
about when Airlines was not what we know
it because they were just that regulated
carriers right yeah that's imminent
monopoly and the best way for
entrepreneur who has achieved success
but now no longer wants to continue to
own their success is to say let me
create barriers to entry through
government regulation so I can be
protected by any entrepreneur such as me
right those days ago right right to then
come and infringe on what I have it's
almost as if he's trying to protect what
he has yeah think maybe you think you
know it's so funny also how these things
change because you know 15 years ago
before over when I lived in New York
City basically my whole adult life and
people would complain relentlessly about
the cabs they're all broken down their
drivers aren't friendly they don't pick
you up if you're a certain color etc etc
then uber comes around fixes a lot of
these problems by ingenuity and now
people are saying you see what they did
they put the cabs
of business the same people who were
upset the first in Boston it's even
worse in Boston every uber or lyft ride
has to be has to pay five scientists
sense of a surcharge and every you know
a fraction of that I don't remember
whether it's two cents or three cents
but you know it adds up when millions of
right goes to the taxicab industry
that's incredible to the industry that's
actually being replaced by the time
doing better sir yes yes exactly so that
just so then is there a flaw in
capitalism there somehow because that
there's probably some cronyism that's
allowing the politicians to write these
ridiculous laws phony ISM is not about
markets cronyism is about statism
cronyism is not capital as a network it
is government regulation at work and it
this comes back to you know Dave you're
successful I take pride in watching your
videos simply because I enjoy it
but there I'm sure is a bit of envy to
about gee I wish I could be as eloquent
as Davis and and as the five hundred
thousand people that watch the day Rubin
show you know Wow wouldn't I love to
have that kind of an impact now that
send me on my part there are two things
I could do it can either be a positive
driver of my energies I could say I want
what Dave does has but I don't have and
that can put me on a growth mindset
entrepreneurial mindset what is it that
I need to do in order to achieve those
success factors going back to first
principles what are the reasons behind
their success and what can I do to
emulate or do differently than they or I
can say no I want what Dave has but I
don't need to earn it I don't need to do
that so let me get the government to
take some of what dave has some of
Dave's sponsorship right and that's what
income inequality and redistribution is
all about I'm taking some of your
viewership and I'm going to be four
those people - now listen to me so
that's where we're using government
force whether it's income redistribution
or any kind of yardstick of value where
we re distributing we're saying we're
gonna take it from you and that actually
negates your viewers rights right
because now if I have the government
saying that then some of them would be
forced to not watch you but watch me
yeah on the other hand there's jealousy
by the way the difference between envy
and jealousy one of my colleagues just
told me recently envy is when I want
something I don't have jealousy is when
I want to keep something that I have but
I'm being threatened against right again
positive or negative if I feel jealousy
because I feel threatened about what I'm
about to lose I can go ahead and say
what is it that I need to do in order to
keep it or I can create barriers and say
you can't have it through the use of
force the same principles that work at
cronyism at both sides of the yardstick
so when we talk about relative poverty
in the United States as an income
inequality by the way coming from India
I know what true poverty is we in the
United States the minimum level of
poverty here is so much better than the
rest of the world so if we care again
it's about envy these rich people have
what I don't have and I should get them
or on the rich end of the spectrum I
have this as a wealthy person regardless
of whether I got it out of an
inheritance or because of prior
entrepreneurial thinking it's being
threatened but I want to keep it for
myself so the best way for me to do that
is to lobby the government and erect
barriers to entry on both sides the use
of governmental regulation to respond to
envy and jealousy is a negative not a
positive driver of economic growth so
where do you where do you draw the line
or where is the starting point then of
what government is supposed to do a
government has a legal monopoly on force
as it should because you and I in a
civil society cannot focus our my
in our effort on creating value if we're
always gonna worry about somebody
looting or taking things away from us
right so I am NOT an anarchist
I believe in governments I believe in
the rule of law I believe in the
protection so there are basic functions
of the government that absolutely are
essential beyond that keep the economy
away from the realm of the government
because the government's only ability to
do something is to say you in your best
judgment think you should go eh
I am Telling You you need to go B you're
forcing the mind do not think or act on
their best judgment yeah so it's
interesting in the in the case of uber
and what you were describing in Boston
and the pennies going back to the to the
cabbies who have nothing to do with it
that actually is because of regulation
and that the only way to eliminate that
and let new businesses thrive is let
them thrive just let's just unleash them
let them know all right so there's a
couple more things that I want to do
with you and you had a for questions
about personal leadership then you asked
a lot of your students and I thought
that these were really great yes
and it really this I think sort of puts
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is
the Rudolf P Lemone chair and professor
of entrepreneurship at the University of
Maryland as well as the director for the
ed Snyder Center for enterprise and
economics
Rhodri Agarwal welcome to the Rubin
report thank you for having me Dave I
feel we're gonna have a very good talk
because we've already sort of had the
interview before we started we've been
doing it already I'm looking forward to
this because we did meet once before we
were at a conference in DC that was sort
of focusing on academia and free speech
and we spent a couple minutes talking
and what I thought was interesting yeah
I don't think you knew who I was
beforehand and I didn't know who you
were beforehand and they sort of brought
me there to talk a little bit about how
YouTube plays a part and reaching young
people and Technology and all that and
you were very interested in that so we
didn't really focus on free speech
together but we focused on how
technology is shifting the conversation
so just very quickly to start why are
you interested in how technology is
affecting the conversation related to
free speech capitalism the whole thing
so I'm not interested in technology per
se but I'm interested in technology
because it represents the manifestation
of the human mind at work ultimately
what is technology technology is better
machines but what are machines
ultimately whether they're fast
computers or whether they're the
industrialized Age engines or whatever
you call it right they are ways for us
humans to make our lives easier by using
machines so technology ultimately is a
way for humans to communicate better to
live better lives and to use their mind
in doing so yeah so I study innovation I
study technology because it enables us
to be the best we can be by using our
mind I was very proud when you walked in
here because you study innovation and
entrepreneurship and this is Mike
Raaj that we turned into a studio so I
thought yes and think about all of the
creativity that went into it right not
just by you but all of the things all of
the the techniques the machines that
we're looking around it was someone's
mind that had to come up with it first
so creativity which is at the heart of
individual enterprise is what I love and
that's what I study
alright so that's what we're gonna spend
most of this hour talking about and you
know when we do these shows with we're
in Liberty they always send me just a
quick one-page bio on everybody and I
really loved yours there was a bunch of
quotes in there that I that I want to
quote directly to you but you should
know that when they asked me to write
that bio I dished that out in about 15
minutes at 4:30 in the morning oh look
at you patting yourself on the back but
first let's talk a little bit about your
history because you have an interesting
history you were born in India and you
lived there for your first 21 years a
little bit about that well I was born to
a very very traditional family Hindu
family my father was your typical rags
to riches entrepreneur he embodied
enterprise and he in fact I'll tell you
about this one story I was in fifth
grade and I came home so upset because
the history lesson that I had just heard
was all about how the United Kingdom
Britain came in and just plundered this
golden peacock that was India and look
at all the nasty things that they did to
us
and how oppressed and victimized we were
and my father who is a very much of
traditional Orthodox Hindu at that time
said no actually Britain did more good
for India than they did bad and it's
like huh what do you mean by that and he
went on to talk about why before that
it's true that India was rich but what
did rich mean it meant that the Kings
and the traders were rich but there was
a very feudalist economy at that time
and of course they were also very balcan
eyes because each of these kingdoms were
fighting with each other so one of the
things that he talked about is how the
advent of the British you know they
bought the rule of law they bought
infrastructure they gave us English as a
language you know often people my
husband says oh wow you talk better
English than I do and it's like yes
that's because I was educated in English
as well but at the same time that he was
such entrepreneur in his mindset
he was very traditionalist in his views
of how women should be and so when I was
12 years old he said to me the right and
the responsibility of finding a husband
for you is mine don't you forget that
and of course any woman in his family
couldn't work because that was a slap on
his face in his ability to provide for
us but if you think about it at 12 years
old I'm being told that the two biggest
decisions any individual can make for
themselves
will you marry and what you choose to
work in and I and I and I tell you know
I'd like to think that those two
decisions under grid everything that we
do both at work and they're not work
life that we live if those are taken
away from you what does that mean about
you as an individual you as a person
so between 12 and 18 I had to navigate
that distance because at 12 years old I
was a daddy's girl I said of course that
just please do me a favor find me a
husband who lives in Bombay because I
can't even bear the thought of being in
a city that's different from you and at
18 I had to see for myself that I
couldn't renege on that decision so
between 18 and 21 was really my
discovery of who I wanted to be and at
21 I left India two suitcases in my hand
left everybody that I loved a very
generous inheritance my father did not
speak to me for seven years Wow
I mean there's there's so much there of
your formative stuff that leads you to
where you're at right now when you came
home that day in fifth grade you learn
something in school
and then you hear something different
from your father who you obviously
respected and admired and had as you
said rags-to-riches had provided a good
life for you guys how did you go back to
school after that I mean did you go back
and start arguing with teachers is that
even as always arguing with teachers
I've in fact I'd remember my science
teacher saying Rajshri why do you ask so
many wise pretty sure that's not what a
science teacher supposed to say that's
right that's really fascinating so you
picked up and left yes and and left an
inheritance all this you you get to
America just tell me a little bit about
that initial experience so for me this
was freedom it was you know I had lived
in India especially in the generation
that I was in a woman didn't a girl or a
woman did not live by themselves right
they got they stayed with their parents
so they were married and then they went
to their husband's house so the concept
of really being yourself and having the
responsibility to make your own choices
is both liberating but then I also
realize I can't blame my parents for my
mistakes anymore
indeed five years later when my mom or
six years later when my mom came to
visit with us my husband said you know
what is the one biggest difference that
you see in your daughter and this will
tell you a little bit about my
personality there - she says to him
she's become very responsible Wow
that's fascinating action and she's uses
this as evidence she says you know our
her father used to give her a very
generous allowance but we were we would
marvel at the fact that this kid would
go through this allowance within ten or
twelve days and then she'd say I'd like
more and then her father would sometimes
give it and sometimes says no that's all
you're gonna get so then she'd come to
me or she'd come to her brother or I
started to tutor because I often said I
earned my
bread and butter but my father provided
we might put with the jam but one of the
things that she said was now she looks
at me and she realizes just how
responsible I've become that we're
before money would just flow off of my
fingers and I wouldn't give it a second
thought I had become so much more
responsible in my thinking
and I think she was talking a lot more
about than just money in India I was
rebelling mm-hmm because I was fighting
against something I came to the United
States I didn't have to fight against
anything so I had to figure out who I
was and what I really wanted to be yeah
and it allowed me to thrive yeah so you
mentioned you didn't talk to your father
for seven years after that how did the
reconciliation at it or was it a it was
a reconciliation in fact one of the
things that I really really treasure is
you know for the I was a daddy's girl
and I did want his approval and after I
got my PhD I remember this one
conversation that I had with him where I
was this prodigal daughter he was just
finally talking to me again I think he'd
given up on the fact that I would be
this person that would ultimately come
home with my tail between my legs and
say you know you were right I was wrong
he just completely given up on that and
so he was listening to me and of course
I was trying to impress him so I was
talking to him about all of these
achievements as a young assistant
professor I'd received a couple of
awards I was getting to go to these
prestigious conferences and he's
listening but there's silence on his
side and the more I'm talking the more
he's silent and then finally I just gave
I had nothing more to brag about or talk
about and I wasn't getting the I'm so
proud of you from him and so there was
this uncomfortable silence after which
he says it's a phrase in Hindi which
roughly translated says if a peacock
dances in a forest who sees so who cares
and his point to me was you can be all
of the peacock you are but if you're not
next to me it doesn't mean anything so
that was the harshness that we started
but even in the reconciliation but my
last visit with him paradoxically was
when I was asked to give a keynote in
India this was immediately after India's
liberalisation it was thriving as an
economy that we now know it to be and so
I was asked to give a keynote at an
academic conference on entrepreneurship
and economic growth and so on my way to
this conference I stopped by and ten
years after I have done my PhD I'm
finally talking to my father about my
research and connecting it to his own
entrepreneurial spirit and him being a
serial entrepreneur and I can finally
see the pride in his eyes you got I got
there and then at the keynote at the end
of this thing when you go to India you
realize that when you give a speech
they'll give you a present so in front
of about 500 people they give me this
present that I open and believe it or
not it's a peacock seems bidding seems
yes there's so much there and it's so
obvious hearing this story how it led to
all of the things now you're teaching
about now and care about the concept
between the battle between sort of
traditionalism yes and then the
entrepreneurial spirit is really a
fascinating one because he obviously had
that yes he built something for himself
built a good life and then still wanted
that piece of sort of the old world and
I think we all kind of struggle with
that in a way maybe that's what the
struggle of Western civilization is and
I actually think that this relates to
often the need to think and integrate
one psychological growth with one's
growth in the material and in the riches
realm so one of the things that I think
my father was as a paradox unfortunately
and I think that caused him as well as
me so much of this angst between us is
that at the same time that he applied
his intellect into the economic realm he
psychologically did not necessarily
realize that
you know part of the reason he was
successful is because he was able to
make his own decisions which also meant
the freedom to make your own mistakes
and learn from your mistakes
so while he allowed that there as far as
his family was concerned there was this
very protectionist I need to take care
of you right but that I'm realizing this
as a parent is not very conducive to
your children's growth because what you
really need to give them are the tools
to make their own decisions as opposed
to telling them you know this is the way
you should do it yeah and ironically had
you not broken away and been free
although although he may have been very
pleased with your life and who knows
what your life would be and maybe you
maybe you would be happy in some ways it
wouldn't have led you to all this so you
had to directly I have to do that yes so
so one more thing about India before we
move on to everything else you're doing
I told you right before we started that
I get a ton of fan mail from India I
think there's some really interesting
political things happening right there
that seem to be driving people to
watching shows like this just give me
one thing that we should know about
India right now that maybe we don't know
as Americans which i think is probably
probably everything because India never
comes up in the news really yes so so I
I can talk about India right now a
little less than I can talk about the
India that I grew up in and why growing
up in India actually fostered my
entrepreneurial spirit okay so we can do
it a little bit a little bit of that
right and I think that that is one of
the aspects it's definitely selection at
play right I do think that across every
culture people individuals are born
tabula rasa some cultures are much more
conducive to having the entrepreneurial
spirit bloom and as a result you see
people go so much farther but there are
other cult and other cultures stifle it
but as individuals I think we all have
the same proclivity to be the persons
that we can be but one of the things
that I will always credit in my
education in India is the focus on
thinking and critical thinking and
intellectualism
the concept of a nerd growing up for me
was unheard of because the coolest kids
were also the ones that participated in
science and elocution debates you know I
was always at the forefront I wasn't so
much of a sports person but I was very
much in debates in elocution
competitions and science competitions
and so on and that was cool that was
that's right so the concept that there's
a nerd and a nerd is socially awkward
was was unheard off for me I'll give you
another example you know my brother was
the one that first talked to me about
Iran and of course in that journey that
I was telling you about where I had to
find my own identity reading Atlas
Shrugged was really the pillar of
strength and helped me identify my own
sense of life but the way I read Atlas
Shrugged you'd find very funny is in
colleges in India if you're a guy and
you want to impress a chick you carry at
least in my time a paperback novel of
Atlas Shrugged in your back pocket
because that means that you're
intellectually you're thinking now I was
also said it was also said that's right
and it's also said well if you're young
then you believe in these views but then
you grow up and you grow over it
I have never grown over it I think that
that aspect of the mind the ability to
think through decisions is one that I
will credit the Indian culture and my
father for endowing in me yeah well
you'll be happy to know as I mentioned
to you before that you know I was at the
students for Liberty Conference and I
met several students from India who were
there that are involved with Iran
Institute consider themselves
Objectivist and all that and it seems
that some of those ideas at least are
thriving there so yes yes that brings it
into the modern day okay so as I
mentioned I really loved your bio and
there were a couple of great quotes in
there some but I want to read one
directly to you you said my passion is
upward mobility integrated across
intellectual psychological and economic
I care deeply about growth achievement
for me is measured not by the level you
have attained as much as the road you
have traveled for me the journey is the
destination and I care deeply about
integrity as in the whole of a person
rather than the individual parts and I
thought there's obviously a lot there
but it seems to me that this is sort of
what we're missing these days we've got
people that are just screaming at each
other all the time that everyone's
pretending they're an expert in
everything nobody sort of listening you
know I've been travelling with Jordan
Peterson a lot who's talking so much
about what I think is such simple stuff
in a certain way although he's quite
brilliant at it you're talking about
personal responsibility and being a full
person and I thought that that was
really what you were getting to hear yes
so what's the question so the question
is well I guess I sort of know why you
came to believe yes but we seem to have
a real lack of an ability to be a full
integral person these days I think in
part it really relates to this
entrepreneurial mindset and a growth
mindset and for me personally that is a
perspective that is in some sense
selfish let me explain why what I mean
by that and I mean selfish in a very
positive way Here I am right now an
endowed professor I'll just give you an
example of it right and I get to mentor
a lot of young minds and many of them
come to my office particularly PhD
students with this mindset of I know so
much it is true I know a lot but think
about the interaction between a student
and a professor where if the professor
says I know everything you're my student
and you're gonna learn from me it's a
one-way street it's the student
benefiting from the professor with that
mindset but how is the professor
benefiting from it where is my learning
where is my growth so in this
conversation one of the ways that I
approach this relationship is I say you
have
start this conversation thinking of each
other as intellectual equals I may know
more than you but especially in the
realm of research which is creating new
knowledge I need you to have an
questioning mind because what happens if
you're saying something that I want to
challenge and after all in academia
we're in the marketplace for ideas if I
challenge you and your mind immediately
shuts down because you say Oh
Rhodri said this she's the expert
professor she knows everything and
you're not gonna challenge me then
you're not allowing yourself to learn
but more importantly if I know that
about you I'm gonna shut myself down and
I am going to censor myself from
expressing my ideas because I want your
mind to be open so now we both knows and
we've both silenced ourselves so this is
just one example of where I think that
this um this focus on growth and
unlearning is actually very liberating
and in that sense very selfish for me
because now it becomes a two-way street
I'm not just teaching I'm also learning
how do you get over the concept that
selfishness is somehow evil that I think
a lot of people believe this inherently
[Music]
of all the polarizing issues in politics
today and yes there are many the climate
change debate is right at the top of the
list climate change seems to be one of
the you're either with us or you're
against us topics usually debated by
people immediately taking a partisan
stance rather than a well-thought-out
position this past year I actually lost
a good friend who told me that she could
no longer be associated with people who
even debate climate change and I'm
someone who's had such conversations on
this very show I think the most hate
that I ever got for a Rubin report
episode was when I had Alex Epstein
author of the moral case for fossil
fuels and for a sit down
Alex's argument isn't against manmade
climate change specifically instead he's
more focused on how to increase human
prosperity with what we have now
essentially his argument is although
climate change could be real fossil
fuels still have many net benefits for
our society after endless tweets emails
and messages from angry people Alex did
a follow up video on YouTube himself
where he answered around a hundred
viewer questions engaging with people
who have different views is exactly what
the battle of ideas is all about on the
flip side of the debate
I've also sat down with Michael Mann a
climatologist and the author of the
famous the hockey stick and the climate
Wars who's a thought leader in the
climate change debate I've discussed
climate change to some degree or another
with believers in manmade climate change
like sam Harris Michael Shermer and
Richard Dawkins as well as some with the
more skeptical views such as Andrew
Clavin steven crowder and ben shapiro
and for the record not one of these
guests believe the exact same thing as
anyone else i just mentioned right there
I find climate change to be a really
interesting discussion because it often
shows how one's thinking works in other
areas as well
generally speaking Democrats are those
on the left see climate change as
man-made and believe that governmental
action is the best or in some cases the
only way to reverse its negative effects
Republicans are those on the right
generally believe that something is
happening to the environment though
there is some debate as to whether it's
man-made
but regardless believe that the private
sector is better left to deal with these
issues of course there are outliers on
each side such as
my former guests California Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Mike
Shellenberger who wants the private
sector to be more involved in solving
climate issues and at the same time
there are also Republicans and people on
the right who deny manmade climate
change at all the science debate on
climate change is an interesting one and
one in which I'm happy to have what
interests me more though is how the
government should or should not be part
of the solution to whatever the problem
may be you know my feelings on this that
the government is rarely the solution to
anything actually at this point I think
the government is usually the problem in
the first place and I'd always rather
exhaust private options before turning
to the government especially the federal
government ironically this should be the
position of the people who hate Trump
why would you want to keep giving the
government more power when you hate the
guy in charge but at the end of the day
it's not governmental power that they
have a problem with it's that they only
have a problem with governmental power
when it's not their guy at charge
fortunately there does seem to be a
younger generation that is tackling
issues like climate change in the
environment in a totally new way it
seems to be based not only in scientific
facts but also in an understanding of
how a limited government should work my
guest this week is Benjy backer
president of the American conservation
coalition the group is dedicated to
finding new ways to look at old problems
as its mantra States they are committed
to efficient effective conservative
environmentalism as for me I'm a
believer in the science behind climate
change and the funny thing about science
is that it doesn't care whether you
believe in it or not for me the real
debate around climate change is how to
go about finding solutions without
giving more power and more money to the
government whether you believe in
climate science or not whether you want
more government regulation or less or
whether you believe the private sector
can find a solution or not we're all
stuck on this little rock together so
until Alan musk a private businessman
gets us all to Mars let's try to figure
out how to solve some of our problems on
this pale blue dot while we still have a
chance
[Music]
joining me today is the founder of the
American conservation coalition an
organization committed to efficient
effective conservative environmentalism
hashtag green GOP Benjy backer
welcome to the ruben reports great to be
here i feel you are long overdue
even though 20 years old you didn't have
a lot of time to get here but you know
you got here we've met a couple times i
kind of found out about you a couple
years ago we're gonna talk about what
kind of put you on the map in the
political world and got your activism
going and all that but it's good to have
you here i like that you you dressed
ready for the part oh yeah you gotta
gotta look good to feel good alright so
you have a really interesting story of
what got you in this mix but first i
thirst thought I'd like to ask my guest
just kind of tell me a little bit about
your upbringing yeah Emily that kind of
thing yeah so I grew up in a family of
five completely non-political very close
family we traveled a lot together
youngest I had two older sisters my
parents were actually entrepreneurs they
started a business when I was I want to
say ten which was a software company
based on mortgages and really started to
take off but it was during the recession
and it was a really bold move for that
time mine it really paid off and they're
now retired and kind of lived the
American dream which was a really cool
thing to be brought up by yeah what
about the politics at home were you guys
always kind of conservative or didn't
talk about it so actually you've got
really different views my sister is a
liberal one of them and then one of them
is more just not into it very much my
parents are conservative but they never
told us really about their views they
wanted us to decide for ourselves
obviously their morals and values I
think played into how I feel about
things but it was never forced upon us
or they were not adamant about politics
or volunteered or donated to my
knowledge two campaigns so I really
wasn't talked about in the house you
know they'd have the debates on or they
you'd have the news on but nothing
really more than that so I was able to
figure out my opinions for myself when I
was a little bit earlier than most
people when I was ten but yeah what kind
of pain
there's a ten-year-old have well I was
watching that John McCain Obama debates
which at ten years old yes at ten years
old I found it really interesting and I
wanted to figure out where I stood on
the spectrum of what I support John
McCain or what I support I think Senator
Obama at the time yeah and so I looked
up online kind of just a basic outline
of what each side believed in and I
figured out that I was conservative and
so for that couple years I kind of I I
forced my parents to put signs in our
yard for John McCain I forced them to
put bumper stickers on our cars
what are you various what did your
parents think about this their tenure
like all right well support you in
whatever you do they were very I mean
it's it's I think that they were
surprised and now I don't know if any
parent thinks that their ten-year-old
kid is gonna get super interested in
politics because it doesn't relie affect
you at ten years old it doesn't really
affect you until after college really so
that was kind of a surprise to them but
they were supportive they let me you
know research as much as I wanted to and
again they allowed me to put the signs
in the yard the bumper stickers on my
rip stick you know that type of thing so
it was a pretty cool time and then I got
injured and decided to volunteer because
I couldn't play sports no all right so I
wanna I want to get to that in a sec but
wait I just want a picture this ten
years old you're watching me you guys
soon you're watching with your folks
probably er yeah right okay you go
online to figure out the issues what
mattered to you at ten years old that
you said at the end of it okay I'm a
conservative or I'm gonna vote for
McCain well my pet my parents were
always really fiscally conservative with
just how they spent money you know we
were never like in a really really tough
position when I was super young but we
always were saying you know buy the
cheapest product you can save as much
money as you can and that was something
that I was brought up with so that
really mattered to me and knowing that
the government could take away my
parents hard earned money and knowing
that the government could come in and
and harm my dad's business by putting a
ton of restrictions that kind of struck
me pretty harshly and then also my
family we were raised on family values
right you know close-knit family it
it kind of happens that way so those two
things were kind of the main drivers I
would say yeah it's just hard to imagine
a 10 year old baby but it's at but it's
pretty cool and it explains why you're
here right now so okay what put you on
the map and when I found out about you
and I think nationally when people found
out about yeah and now this makes sense
now that I know that this was brewing a
ten year ago 2013 you're 15 years old
yeah what happens yeah so I had been
active in politics for three years
before that and what does that even mean
well I was gone
carry on Scott Walker's campaign Senator
Ron Johnson s campaign I helped out Mitt
Romney as well in 2012 and people
believe it started throw up but could
people even believe it like here's this
12 year old kid 11 year old kid working
on these campaign it was actually really
funny the first campaign ever worked on
did let me use the phones at first
because they could you know we need to
try to do it twelve-year-old on the room
you can tell us like hi is Michael dress
there like yeah but like who are you and
why are you 12 and why are you calling
me from a congressional office right
crystal campaign and so people were
actually really surprised conservatives
were really supportive they're like whoa
look at this 12 year old kid is
volunteering for us and the left is like
why is this 12 year old and cheering for
them so it was pretty funny again I was
injured so I needed something to do in
like any twelve-year-old
I decided to volunteer for politics so
yeah it was a very interesting dynamic
because this is also hilarious that an
injury got you into politics what kind
of injury was an ankle injury that the
doctors couldn't figure out I was like
crutches for a year and a half
Wow gained a lot of weight it was during
middle school which does not help
because those are the worst years for
that anyways and so then again I went
into congressional office and they
didn't want me to do the phones they
don't want me to go door-to-door cuz
imagine a 12-year olds coming to your
door like hey you should vote for X Y or
Z like I might why should I trust a 12
year old right so this is a very
interesting dynamic at that age so all
right so now what puts you on the map
yes a 13 year 15 years old something
happens yes so in high school early on
in high school and middle school
teachers had really
come out for me for my political views
because I was trying to make local
headlines for my activism especially in
the recall election for Scott Walker in
2012
so tell me that tell me a little bit
about what your opinions were in what
your teachers were yes I was a really
pro scout Walker guy I was I actually
ended up becoming close with his family
and and a great guy but I even better
policies you know I talked to a lot of
teachers who were sick of being forced
to join unions and sick of starting out
with $30,000 base pay when senior senior
teachers were making $100,000 with
benefits and it took them 40 years to
get to that level even if they're a
better teacher so people were really
kind of sick of that but it was a very
small minority because the unions really
had a lot of brainwashing in the state
and I'm sure in other states as well and
so my view is that Scott Walker is
really helping out the state because he
helped balance the budget and he kind of
freed the teachers up and helped their
pay become more of a fair shake but they
the teachers did not like that the
majority of them I mean most people know
of the huge uprising that happened the
protests were there are thousands of
people death threats to every Republican
in the state legislature and the
governor and so the teachers would leave
school they protested they take leave
they would cry in class I mean it was it
was pretty insane yeah and then you know
you have me over here bold little Benjy
know when I was there and saying who
Scott Walker they did not like that at
all so they would say pretty disparaging
things to be in class in front of my
fellows like what kind of things would
they say to you they attacked my family
for being business owners and saying
that they were lazy and saying that they
assumed that my parents golf every
Friday by the way my parents don't know
how to golf so that's not true I don't
even know how I golf and so that was
that was one thing that that that they
would always say and they would call me
a racist or weird for being in politics
at such a young age
what's that like for for a kid of that
age I'd be dealing with that it's one
thing to be outspoken but I out your
teachers your authority figures are
attacking you publicly in school I
actually in a minute
because at first I was pretty taken
aback and I was kind of sad about it
but my parents really pushed me on and
said you're doing the right thing and
just kind of block out as the
Millennials say block out the haters
yeah so I didn't really care that much
as long as it didn't affect my grades or
how my classmates viewed me because I do
care about the people that I am friends
with so so that was kind of frustrating
but after a while I just kind of got
used to it because it would happen in a
class every single quarter of every
single semester of every single year 7th
grade until til I started coming out
nationally about this issue did it ever
affect your grades because I could see a
teacher in a subjective class maybe not
map where it would be tough to screw
with your grades but a social studies
teacher where you're writing an essay or
an English teacher or something actually
harming your grade it did actually my
lowest grade ever was in a social
studies class in middle school
I've never gotten anything really below
like a high B level and there I got a
d-plus Wow in that social studies class
it's middle school so at that point is
middle school so it didn't really matter
per se but you could say you can see
that there was a trend going and that
I'd be worried in the future years
whether or not that it would affect me
and in other classes I don't think it
did as much which is good but in that
class I did see I mean it's a pretty
obvious correlation between me getting
good grades in every class since that in
every class before then and then getting
a d-plus in that class right weird and
also probably not a coincidence that
social studies is the class that you
were probably talking about this right
the most right did you did you try to
fight the teacher on that did your folks
get involved or anything oh we actually
I actually ended up switching schools
Wow I mean it's incredible yeah so so
that was that was a big change it
actually ended up being for the better
because the school is switch to is one
the feeder school so the high school if
I was going to so I ended up making
better connections there but it was an
annoying change that shouldn't have been
necessary it was a teacher who had a
history of these types of behaviors not
just on politics but on other things so
so it's interesting because you were
fighting the unions which in your
estimation was actually Pro teacher
because you thought the union
were too powerful meanwhile you have
teachers fighting you which is really
only feeding your initial premise right
in the first place yeah so that was
really it really enhanced my opinion on
the subject it made me really want to to
push further because I could tell that
some of these teachers were really
worried about their job or their job
security because they knew that they
could actually be held accountable now
and some of the senior teachers knew
that oh I actually have to perform well
to get paid well I don't my age isn't
just the deciding factor yeah so I think
that that's why people came out so
strongly in certain areas so some people
just didn't really understand the full
scope of the situation and call them
down once they figured that out but some
I think were really worried about their
their future pay because they had kind
of just been relaxed for the last 20
years since their pay had gone up right
so basically they weren't doing a great
job and rice isn't just unique to
Wisconsin this is happen all over
America where you have these teachers
that have been at it forever I've kind
of given up or are not working that hard
anymore but they're protected by the
unions their salaries keep going up they
get great benefits etcetera etcetera
that's what you're fighting and you're
seeing the the fruits of what happens
with that as they're cracking down on
you so what actually put you on what was
the specific incident that that put this
all in motion yeah so I kind of took all
the information that I had of all the
experiences that I had gone through and
wrote it up in a blog for Freedom Works
it ended up going to Drudge and then
Todd Starnes at Fox wrote something up
about it
Town Hall had something it started to
get in that space and then eventually
Megyn Kelly's show reached out to ask me
to come on and talk about it so that
kind of put me on the map there and then
I started to be invited to conferences
to speak about my experience and kind of
how other young conservatives shouldn't
be scared to speak out in the classroom
even if their teachers or other fellow
students come after them
it wasn't easy because it was my
sophomore year of high school actually
my fresh end of my freshman year of high
school and the after that Fox News
interview I received death threats
people were threatening me at school
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay we are live on the YouTube
everybody has it gone people man there
are so many things that I have to tell
you we're gonna do a lot here I've got
about an hour things have just ramped up
to sort of crazy levels 99% of it all
good there's just a lot of cool
announcements that I'm gonna make today
I want to tease a couple things that we
have upcoming my travel schedule has
completely bananas the next two months
are probably gonna be the craziest two
months of my lives my lives my life so I
have many lives of my life I just did a
really awesome interview through learn
Liberty that we're posting next week
that was just great I'm still vibrating
a little bit because it was just like
one of those ones where you just you're
kind of just right there with the guests
the entire time and we talked about all
the all the stuff that that I'm
constantly talking about on here
alright cool so we've got about an hour
here's what we're do we're gonna do some
Q&A so if you are on patreon you guys
get first dibs but we will take
questions if you want to throw some
questions in the facebook comment
section but if you're first dibs on
patreon which we already have some
loaded up I have a fancy iPad right here
and then we will also take questions via
YouTube super chat so I think you guys
know how to use that already throw in a
couple bucks it boosts your comment up
because obviously the comments section
and a live YouTube chat can be quite
bizarre yeah so you can go ahead and do
that and then I want to give you a
couple updates on things first off more
than anything else what I want to tell
you about is I am finally making my I
would consider this really my official
return to stand-up comedy this Sunday
April 8th at the Irvine improv which is
outside of LA right here about an hour
away from LA I am I am headlining and
it's just me people just me I'm gonna do
probably about an hour maybe there'll be
a special guest maybe not we'll see
about that we'll do some some crowd
interaction play with you guys some Q&A
all that good stuff
but basically so I think some of you
guys know this so I did stand-up in a in
New York City for about 12 years and I
had I lived that life that I lived the
good parts of it the bad parts of it the
struggling Road comic the guys standing
out on Times Square corners for
literally six nights a week for
sometimes two hours a night handing out
tickets no matter what the weather was
middle of storms we were out there doing
it sometimes perform for four people I
had sort of ups and downs of success at
one time I think I was the youngest
comic ever passed at the Comedy Cellar
at least that's what I was told the
Comedy Cellar sort of the it Club in New
York City
and did it for about 12 years then I
kind of shifted away from it the last
like six years or so I've been in LA
about five years started going more down
the political route I was always kind of
doing political stuff we stand up anyway
but obviously what I'm doing now is not
sort of strict stand-up so I'm getting
back in I did a gig about a month and a
half to go at the Comedy Store here in
LA and it's funny like I don't need it
that much so it was really freeing and
good so I've just wrote up a ton of new
stuff gonna try to blend in some old
stuff and just kind of see what happens
and I'm psyched to do it so it is at the
Irvine improv on April 8th I'll probably
do about an hour or so and you will
truly see like someone working through
everything and I think it'll be really
cool if you dig what I do so we've got
the link right down below for tickets I
think there's some tickets still
available it's about a 400 C Club from
what I understand I haven't been there
yet actually but I had Bob Saget here a
couple weeks ago who told me it's one of
his one of his favorite clubs in the
country so I'm super psyched for that
and that's one thing that I wanted to
tell you okay couple other things so
here's a big one because you guys have
been asking me about this literally for
years and I know I say literally a lot
but I literally mean this for years you
guys have been asking me when is this
thomas sowell interview happening about
a year ago we were told it was gonna
happen and then we were having trouble
coordinating I believe that he is 87 I
mean either 86 or 87 years old so he's
not traveling a ton so we are going up
to Stanford next Tuesday a week from
yesterday people we are going up to
Stanford we are renting a studio at
Stanford University we're flying up the
whole team up there and we are doing an
hour hopefully an hour plus an interview
with Thomas all I know he's been making
the rounds a little bit he did I think a
phone interview with Ben Shapiro and one
or two
other people but we are doing a live
full-on unedited video interview I am
beyond beyond beyond beyond thrilled to
do this I think he's probably the most
requested guest that we've had on since
we've been doing this show I think the
basic foundational principles that he's
talking about about classical liberalism
and libertarianism in role of government
and role of the individual and all that
stuff that you guys know I love I think
he is basically the the Jedi master of
all of it and he's been talking about
this stuff for 40 some-odd if not longer
years so I'm thrilled to be doing that
and just quickly you know shows like
that so we're going up to Stanford so we
have to fly our whole team up there so
fly a bunch of people we're renting a
studio for a couple thousand bucks
there's obviously other expenses related
to travel and all that we can do that if
truly the only reason we can do that is
because of the support that you guys
give us on patreon so that is a big
shout-out thank you to those of you that
support us on patreon or whether it's on
paypal or however else you do it which
you can go to patreon.com/scishow burn
report if you want to support that but
we'll never make the money back through
YouTube Rev on what it'll cost the
thousands of bucks it'll cost to rent
the studio and all that so I just want
to thank you guys for that I'm super
psyched to do it I couldn't be happier
to spend a couple thousand bucks on
something like that that we're gonna do
all right let me jump into a couple a
couple questions here and then I'm gonna
give you some other some other cool
things that are happening all right
super chat no question just want you to
keep up the good work I shall my friend
patreon how can we get this crazy world
back to a place of talking real issues
and not defending ourselves against
hateful comments because we're talking
about facts and not emotion I mean this
is really kind of the issue of our time
right and this is where social media you
know it's like it's just a tool you can
either use it for good or you can use it
for evil look how did you guys find what
I do here well I'm able to reach you
because of YouTube I'm able to reach you
because of Twitter and Facebook and all
those things but at the same time the
the endless amount of fighting and hate
it just seems to be ramping up and
ramping up and ramping up and I have a
very dedicated group of anonymous trolls
that really do not like me they pop up
usually on YouTube and Twitter more than
Facebook because Facebook is a place
where generally
have to have a real picture and be a
real person but yes there are there
there seems to be this sort of subset of
humans right now who are not trolls in
the sort of good way of trolling there's
a way to control and make memes and mock
people and be funny and silly and
subversive that's actually kind of cool
and if you get it they can insult you
and it's like a compliment and I get
some of those sometimes I share those
those memes or videos when people are
kind of mocking me or whatever it's all
good there's this sort of other set
though of people most of them are
anonymous but not all of them who just
want to watch the world burn
to quote Alfred from The Dark Knight
when he was talking about the Joker to
Batman they just want to destroy
everything they just want to fight with
everybody they want to upset everybody
they want to trigger everybody and I
think that unfortunately because for
whatever reasons our brains seem to go
to be more affected by negativity than
positivity although I think we should
all be working on it I certainly am we
seem to be focusing on those people and
they're really ruining the conversation
and by the way I'm not really I'm not
even mocking or belittling people for
anonymity online I have actually no
problem with anonymity online and for
those of you that are actually trying to
engage with ideas that are you know
dangerous ideas or whatever you want
talk or even not even that dangerous but
just ideas that you're afraid if you say
something about healthcare you're gonna
get fired I mean that's the
ridiculousness of where we're at at the
point or if you say if you come out as a
conservative or something you're gonna
have trouble at work or whatever it is
so I'm not mocking anonymity in that
regard well I think what I would say is
that if you use anonymity as like this
bludgeon to relentlessly attack people
and to only add evil into the discourse
I think you're actually a big part of
the problem right now but I know you
don't care if you're watching this in
one of your those you're one of those
people you're probably doing it at this
right very second so I think we have to
figure out a way look my Twitter bio
says Twitter is not real life Twitter is
not real life social media is not real
life what's real is being with people
talking directly to people really
exchanging ideas and that
but we're living in a time where that
that social media stuff it's leaking
into reality and I did a TM about this
about a year ago I said you know that
real life is becoming social media that
it's it's becoming all the trolling and
the hate and the anger and it's breaking
up friends and marriages and all this
stuff and we've all had to deal with
this but I would say the best thing that
you can do is stand for what you believe
in that's it
like there there's no magic answer to
this other than any of you I suppose if
you're watching this and you dig what I
do what you probably like is that I'm
here and I'm expressing ideas with
people that I sit across from and I tell
you what I think and I share my thoughts
for better or for worse or whether
they're correct or wrong or debatable or
whatever you want to say but not enough
people are doing that these days and I
suppose when I started this show a
couple years ago if there had been many
more people doing that I probably
wouldn't have seen an avenue to go ahead
and do it like if there had been this
great national discourse about ideas and
we were really honestly dealing with
things and all the problems especially
that I was seeing at the time with the
left and all that if that had really
been happening well then I probably
wouldn't be doing this I don't know what
I would be doing but you know here we
are so say what you think I mean it will
and I say this all the time but if you
are afraid to say what you think right
now it will not magically get better
down the road so say what you think
you've got to fight for what you believe
in because don't leave it for other
people to fight for what you believe in
all right a couple other things that I
want to tell you before I get back into
the to the questions here which are
loading up pretty quick okay so April
8th Irvine improv link in the
description right down below we've got
Thomas Sol next Tuesday we're taping it
next Tuesday it'll be up a couple days
later in San Francisco and then as most
of you probably know at this point I am
going on tour with Jordan Peterson so
I'm opening with Jordan we've started we
did one in LA at the orpheum and we did
one last week at the Beacon Theatre
which is this gorgeous 3,000 seat
theater in New York City it was a
surprise that I was going to be there
and the PA guy came on he said you know
shut off your earphones no flash
photography and now the host of the
Reuben Porte and before he could even
say my name the crowd went bananas I
have never experienced any
like that before it was particularly
cool because my folks were in the
audience and I'm warming up the crowd
getting everybody going these people are
super excited the line was around square
block in New York City it was down
Broadway down 73rd down up as it were up
after dam and back up whatever that is
73rd and 74th over there
but a full square block over there it
was just the energy was amazing so I
will be opening up for Jordan I'm doing
11 of the first 12 events so if you're
going to any of those and you can check
I think on Ticketmaster or you can check
on his website what the dates on all of
those are I'm doing 11 of the first 12
including the UK I'm not doing Detroit
no offense Detroit I would love to do it
at the Fillmore theater I've been there
before it's a gorgeous theater but I've
got a conflict related to actually doing
this show so I can't do that and then
Jordan tacked on about an another 20
dates I'm gonna do as many of those as
possible we're trying to figure it out
with my schedule at the moment but I
hope to meet as many of you guys out
there as possible I've been meeting you
guys all over all these stops that I'm
doing everywhere and it's it's really
been it's really cool I mean it really
is cool like people are waking up I
think in in big numbers to the craziness
so it's very exciting so I will be with
Jordan Peters and it's just been awesome
I mean spending time with Jordan and
it's like man I will tell you I will say
this now and I'm sure it's the exact
same thing I will say at the end of the
tour this man is is there's no
here they got everything that this guy
says publicly is the same exact stuff
that we talked about privately I had
dinner with him right before the event
in New York City and we did two hours
there were agents there and and a bunch
of other people and his daughter and his
wife and few others I mean we did two
hours of cultural Marxism and
post-modernism and all that right at the
dinner table then I go to the event with
him in the car we get up to the green
rooms up there we're talking about it
the whole time he that needed five
minutes of alone time just to get his
thoughts sorted out and then just goes
so it's awesome so most of them are
gonna be me warming up the crowd at the
beginning then Jordan giving his lecture
and then me coming out and sort of
facilitating the Q&A with the audience
it sounds like some of them might
actually be sit-downs where we're both
there the whole time and all its kind of
Q&A I'm on the on the 12 rules for life
but we don't have a exact
plan on that yet but I'm just super
sighted excited there's great energy
around it and I think that this whole
crew of people that you know as it's
become to be known the intellectual dark
web whether it's the weinstein brothers
or Sam or Ben or Jordan or whoever else
it is a lot of us are trying to do more
public events and and live podcasts and
things like that I'm potentially working
on an Australia trip that sounds like
it's coming together so there's just a
lot of cool stuff on that front
so I hope to meet as many of you guys as
possible okay here we go
patreon can you please have somebody on
to discuss psychiatric drugs and their
connection with mass shootings also what
is your personal opinion on the matter
thanks ed I love your show Dave yeah so
I do want to do this so look hey we
obviously are gonna do more on guns this
is becoming the discussion of the day
and we have to touch on it more and I
want to touch on a more I want to learn
more about it truly about you know I
know a lot about the laws that we have
but I honestly I don't know a tremendous
amount about the differences from all
the guns and it's pretty clear that most
of the people online including some of
the pros on this don't know much of a
difference either when everyone's
talking about semi automatics and all
this different stuff so I absolutely
will do more on guns I agree with you
that we need to have the mental health
discussion on this we are not discussing
it enough if you go I think by the very
definition if you go to a school or a
church or a temple or a mosque or a mall
or wherever it is and you shoot and
murder and maim innocent people by
definition there is a psychological
condition there does having certain
weapons make it easier to kill and
injure a lot of people very quickly it
does but we have to have an honest
discussion in a holistic sense and
unfortunately we're just not doing that
at all I got into a little Twitter
kerfuffle yesterday with Michael Ian
Black who I've had on the show before
who's a progressive a lefty you know
when I had him on I I obviously didn't
agree with a lot of stuff he said but I
was happy to sit there and listen to his
ideas but he sent out you know what I
think was in effect basically a crazy
tweet yesterday blaming the NRA for what
happened at you
tube but before he even had any concept
of what had happened cuz it was right as
it was all unfolding and calling the NRA
a terrorist organization I mean this
this is what is destroying the discourse
in this country and we've got to all
kind of reel back and realize that the
whole point of living in a free society
is that you're supposed to disagree with
people and you're supposed to argue and
get to a place that you can just
maximize freedom for as many people as
possible if your starting position is
the NRA it's a terrorist organization or
ban all guns or on the other side that
everyone should have tanks we got a real
problem there right we got a big chasm
there we got to get this thing to be a
little bit more manageable so I
definitely want to have those
discussions and yes it seems that a
disproportionate amount of the shooters
do seem to be on these drugs right it
just it just does seem to be that way
obviously there's not going to be a lot
of discussion about that on mainstream
media because so much
go watch mainstream media for a while
and Counting how many of the commercials
are for these very drugs so we have to
have some discussion about that too so
yes I promise you that I will get in on
that okay there's no Jesus there's a lot
here okay you're defending my liberal
principles is now a conservative
position quote is one of my favorite
starters in political discussions now
thanks I think it's probably the most
quotable thing that I've said in the
last couple years that sort of resonates
with people if you are a liberal and you
want liberalism really means
live-and-let-live as you guys know
without getting into a whole classical
liberal thing briefly if you believe in
the individual and that you should live
your life as you see fit that's the
foundational principle of liberalism if
you believe that we should judge as
groups and we should be caught in an
[Music]
joining me today is the founder of the
American conservation Coalition an
organization committed to efficient
effective conservative environmentalism
hashtag green GOP Benji backer
welcome to the Rubin reports great to be
here I feel you are long overdue
even though twenty years old you didn't
have a lot of time to get here but you
know you got here we've met a couple
times I kind of found out about you a
couple years ago we're gonna talk about
what kind of put you on the map in the
political world and got your activism
going and all that but it's good to have
you here I like that you you dressed
ready for the party oh yeah you gotta
gotta look good to feel good alright so
you have a really interesting story of
what got you in this mix but first I
just thought I'd like to ask my guests
just kind of tell me a little bit about
your upbringing yeah Emily that kind of
thing
yeah so I grew up in a family of five
completely non-political very close
family we traveled a lot together
youngest I had two older sisters my
parents were actually entrepreneurs they
started a business when I was I want to
say ten which was a software company
based on mortgages and really started to
take off but it was during the recession
and it was a really bold move for that
time mind it really paid off and they're
now retired and kind of lived the
American dream which was a really cool
thing to be brought up by yeah what
about the politics at home were you guys
always kind of conservative or it didn't
talk about it so actually you've got
really different views my sister is a
liberal one of them and then one
is more just not into it very much my
parents are conservative but they never
told us really about their views they
wanted us to decide for ourselves
obviously their morals and values I
think played into how I feel about
things but it was never forced upon us
or they were not adamant about politics
or volunteered or donated to my
knowledge to campaigns so it really
wasn't talked about in the house you
know they'd have the debates on or
they'd you have the news on but nothing
really more than that so I was able to
figure out my opinions for myself when I
was a little bit earlier than most
people when I was 10 but yeah what kind
of opinions does a ten-year-old have why
was Washington John McCain
Obama debates which 10 years old yes at
10 years old I found it really
interesting and I wanted to figure out
where I stood on the spectrum of what I
support John McCain or what I support I
think Senator Obama at the time yeah and
so I looked up online kind of just a
basic outline of what each side believed
in and I figured out that I was
conservative and so for that couple
years I kind of I I forced my parents to
put signs in our yard for John McCain I
forced them to put bumper stickers on
our cars
what are you various what did your
parents think about this they're 10
you're like all right well support you
in whatever you do they were very I mean
it's it's I think that they were
surprised and I I don't know if any
parent thinks that their 10 year old kid
is gonna get super interested in
politics because it doesn't really
affect you at 10 years old it doesn't
really affect you until after college
really so that was kind of a surprise to
them but they were supportive they let
me you know research as much as I wanted
to and again they allowed me to put the
signs in the yard the bumper stickers on
my RipStik you know that type of thing
so it was a pretty cool time and then I
got injured and decided to volunteer
because I couldn't play sports no all
right so I would I want to get to that
in a sec but wait I just want a picture
there's 10 years old you're watching me
you guys soon you're watching with your
folks probably er yeah right ok you go
online to figure out the issues what
mattered to you at 10 years old that you
said at the end of it ok I'm a
conservative or I'm gonna vote for
McCain well my pet my parents were
always really fiscally
be conservative was just how they spent
money you know we were never like in a
really really tough position when I was
super young but we always were saying
you know buy the cheapest product you
can save as much money as you can
and that was something that I was
brought up with so that really mattered
to me and knowing that the government
could take away my parents hard earned
money and knowing that the government
could come in and and harm my dad's
business by putting a ton of
restrictions that kind of struck me
pretty harshly and then also my family
we were raised on family values right
you know close-knit family it kind of
happens that way so those two things
were kind of the main drivers I would
say yeah it's just hard to imagine a ten
year old is but it's at but it's pretty
cool and it explains why you're here
right now so okay what put you on the
map and when I found out about you and I
think nationally when people found out
about you and now this makes sense now
that I know that this was brewing a ten
year ago 2013 you're 15 years old yeah
what happened yeah so I had been active
in politics for three years before that
and what does that even mean well I was
gone
carry on Scott Walker's campaign Senator
Ron Johnson scam pain I helped out Mitt
Romney as well in 2012 and people
believe it started throw up but could
people even believe it like here's this
12 year old kid 11 year old kid working
on these campaigns actually funny the
first campaign ever worked on did let me
use the phones at first because they
could you know we need to try to do a 12
year old on the pill you can tell us
like hi is Michael yes yeah they're like
yeah but like who are you and why are
you 12 and why are you calling me from a
congressional office through a channel
campaign and so people were actually
really surprised conservatives were
really supportive they're like whoa look
at this 12 year old kid is volunteering
for us and the left is like why is this
12 year old and cheering for them so it
was pretty funny again I was injured so
I needed something to do in like any
twelve-year-old I decided to volunteer
for politics so yeah it's a very
interesting dynamic because this is also
hilarious that an injury got you into
politics what what kind of injury was an
ankle injury that the
doctors couldn't figure out I was on
crutches for a year and a half Wow
gained a lot of weight
it was during middle school which does
not help because those are the worst
years for that anyways and so then again
I went into congressional office and
they didn't want me to do the phones
they didn't want me to go door-to-door
cuz imagine the 12 year olds coming to
your door like hey you should vote for X
Y or Z like I might why should I trust a
12 year old right so this is a very
interesting dynamic at that age so
alright so now what puts you on the map
yes 13 years 15 years old something
happens yes so in high school early on
in high school and middle school
teachers had really come out for me for
my political views because I was trying
to make local headlines for my activism
especially in the recall election for
Scott Walker in 2012 mom so tell me that
tell me a little bit about what your
opinions were and what your teachers
were yes I was really Pro Scott Walker
guy I was I actually ended up becoming
close with his family and then and a
great guy but I even better policies you
know I talked to a lot of teachers who
were sick of being forced to join unions
and sick of starting out with $30,000
base pay when senior senior teachers
were making $100,000 with benefits mm-hm
and it took them 40 years to get to that
level even if they're a better teacher
so people were really kind of sick of
that but it was a very small minority
because the unions really had a lot of
brainwashing in the state and I'm sure
in other states as well and so my view
is that Scott Walker is really helping
out the state because he helped balance
the budget and he kind of freed the
teachers up and helped their pay become
more of a fair shake but they the
teachers did not like that the majority
of them I mean most people know of the
huge uprising that happened the protests
were there are thousands of people death
threats to every Republican in the state
legislature and the governor and so the
teachers would leave school they
protested they take leave they would cry
in class I mean it was it was pretty
insane yeah and then you know you have
me over here bald little Benjy going out
there and saying Scott Walker they did
not like that at all so they would say
pretty disparaging things to be in class
in front of my like what kind of things
would they say to you there
my family for being business owners and
saying that they were lazy and saying
that they assumed that my parents golf
every Friday by the way my parents don't
know how to golf so that's not true
I don't know how I golf and so that was
that was one thing that that uh that
they would always say and they would
call me a racist or weird for being in
politics at such a young age what's that
like for for a kid of that age I'd be
dealing with that it's one thing to be
outspoken but I hope your teachers your
authority figures are attacking you
publicly in school I actually had a
minute rank than me because at first I
was pretty taken aback and I was kind of
sad about it but my parents really
pushed me on and said you're doing the
right thing and just kind of block out
as the Millennials say block out the
haters yeah so I I didn't really care
that much as long as it didn't affect my
grades or how my classmates viewed me
because I do care about the people that
I am friends with so so that was kind of
frustrating but after a while I just
kind of got used to it because it would
happen in a class every single quarter
of every single semester of every single
year seventh grade until til I started
coming out nationally about this issue
did it ever affect your grades because I
could see a teacher in a subjective
class maybe not math where it would be
tough to screw with your grades but a
social studies teacher where you're
writing an essay or an English teacher
or something actually harming your grade
it did actually my lowest grade ever was
in a social studies class in middle
school I've never gotten anything really
below like a high B level and there I
got a d-plus Wow in that social studies
class its middle school so at that point
was middle school so generally matter
per se but you could say you could see
that there was a trend going and that
I'd be worried in the future years
whether or not that it would affect me
and in other classes I don't think it
did as much which is good but in that
class I did see I mean it's a pretty
obvious correlation between me getting
good grades in every class since that in
every class before then and then getting
a d-plus in that class right not weird
and also probably not a coincidence that
social studies is the class that you
were probably talking about this
right most right did you did you try to
fight the teacher on that did your folks
get involved or anything oh we actually
I actually ended up switching schools
Wow I mean it's incredible yeah so so
that was that was a big change it
actually ended up being for the better
because the school switch to is one the
feeder school to the high school that I
was going to so I ended up making better
connections there but it was an annoying
change that shouldn't have been
necessary it was a teacher who had a
history of these types of behaviors not
just on politics but on other things so
so it's interesting because you were
fighting the unions which in your
estimation was actually Pro teacher
because you felt the unions were too
powerful I mean while you have teachers
fighting you which is really only
feeding your initial premise right in
the first place yeah so that was really
it really enhanced my opinion on the
subject it made me really want to to
push further because I could tell that
some of these teachers were really
worried about their job or their job
security because they knew that they
could actually be held accountable now
man some of the senior teachers knew
that oh I actually have to perform well
to get paid well I don't my age isn't
just the deciding factor yeah so I think
that's why people came out so strongly
in certain areas so some people just
didn't really understand the full scope
of the situation and call him down once
they figured that out but some I think
were really worried about their their
future pay because they had kind of just
been relaxed for the last twenty years
since their pay had gone up right so
basically they weren't doing a great job
and rice isn't just unique to Wisconsin
this is happen all over America where
you have these teachers that have been
at it forever I've kind of given up or
are not working that hard anymore but
they're protected by the unions their
salaries keep going up they get great
benefits etc etc that's what you're
fighting and you're seeing the the
fruits of what happens with that as
they're cracking down on you so what
actually put you on what was the
specific incident that that put this all
in motion yeah so I kind of took all the
information that I had of all the
experiences that I had gone through and
wrote it up in a blog for Freedom Works
it ended up going to Drudge and then
Todd Starnes at Fox wrote something up
about it
Town Hall had something it started to
get in that space and then eventually
Megyn Kelly's show reached out to ask me
to come on and talk about it
so that kind of put me on the map there
and then I started to be invited to
conferences to speak about my experience
and kind of how other young
conservatives shouldn't be scared to
speak out in the classroom even if their
teachers or other fellow students come
after them
it wasn't easy because it was my
sophomore year of high school actually
my fresh end of my freshman year of high
school and the after that Fox News
interview I received death threats
people were threatening me at school
because some of the teachers that I had
called out which I never named their
names but I called them out they were
popular with the students so people
weren't happy about it
so it was it was not an easy time for my
family either
yeah I want to focus on that a little
bit but I think because everyone gets
this these days and rice is one of the
themes of what we do here is everyone's
just like afraid to say anything because
they don't want a deal they don't want
to deal with just the hate they get on
Twitter and you got plenty of that and
that's how I found you after this but
but the other stuff like you had to go
to school the next day so literally what
what is that like well I I don't have
ever said this publicly but I carried a
knife at a school so he's so scared with
my life and I didn't tell my parents I
had a friend give it to me that was
worried about my safety it was a pretty
hard time because no matter if people
think I was doing something right or
wrong I think part of the problem with
our culture and it was the same way for
years ago or five years ago is that if
someone's doing something you don't
agree with you're just gonna completely
attack them wholeheartedly without any
respect for what they're doing or their
opinions or anything like that and so I
was honestly scared for my life you know
I couldn't go anywhere I got my bike
stolen when I bike to an ice cream shop
and I live in a very safe place and it
was somebody from my high school that
just really didn't like me you know I'd
be walking my dogs and someone would
flip me off and say after you Benjy
backer you know suck up whatever what
about your family at that time because I
know you said your folks were always
backing you and telling you right do
what you believe in was there any
repercussions for them or their business
or anything like that no their business
was fine I think you know most most
adults who knew what was going on
treated me with a lot of respect I think
it is mostly the young people who who
were a little bit ignorant about what
was going on so my parents didn't have
any negative repercussions that I
no of again they might have been not
telling me because they didn't want to
make it any worse for me because they
don't know that I care about them so
that was that was a tough time for them
though because they live through their
kids and having something like that the
constantly going after our people
constantly going after your son is not
the greatest thing in the world
especially when they know that what
you're doing is right so they were
coming by biggest supporters at the time
telling me to keep pushing on and you
know again bluff the haters and just
kind of and do what you think is right
because at the end of the day people are
gonna realize it eventually and I had
tons of people come after or come up to
me and years afterwards and apologize
and realize that what they did was
immature people who said the worst
thanks to me or told me to kill myself
or whatever those people would come up
to me and say I'm really sorry because
people mature they start to realize that
that's not OK dialogue even if you
totally disagree to someone so yeah
sadly we have a lot of people who don't
mature these sounds but that is that is
not right here though what about the
support you got from you guys I mean
where your where your friends that
supported you willing to publicly
support you because that's enough see
that's another there's there are certain
things that's why I think this is so
interesting there are certain trends
with all of these whether it's you
taking an unpopular but principled
position or it's a guy like Brett
Weinstein at Evergreen there's all these
different people that come out come out
I mean it's a coming out in the way that
the same tactics happen every time and
in this case the idea that your your
friends or whatever won't back you
publicly but privately probably had no
problem doing it yeah I had friends who
came up to me or text me saying I
support you and I feel terrible for what
you're going through but I can't
associate myself with you and those
friends ended up trying to associate
with me later on in a way those are the
worst ones right because it's like if
someone just tells you to go after
yourself it's like big deal ok whatever
but the friends it's like am i your
shield am i you know gonna be like am i
the guy that's supposed to just be out
there while you sit quietly and do
nothing you're not helping me right yeah
I had one really good friend named
Brandon who supported me through it all
and would come over every this death
threat stuff started to happen right as
summer started which was
the worst time is in high school as a
freshman you don't really do anything
during summer so you're just like at

won't came to see no further ado Dave
and you're on alright thank you guys
you probably heard our mics this is just
for the for the feed so we're gonna try
to talk as loudly as possible
first off I'm very excited to be here I
just had my first-ever police escort to
a bathroom so I guess that means I've
met it you live now now you've live now
I've lived I mean there are police out
there I usually only do these events
either with 20 police officers or a
former IDF soldier so we've got does not
know Krav Maga you do not know problem
we're in a lot of trouble all right well
thank you guys for for coming out we're
gonna talk about ideas and we're gonna
talk about free speech we're gonna talk
about the role of government first off
we are putting this on my youtube
channel so can you crazy conservatives
Republicans Objectivists whatever you
consider yourselves can you make some
noise for the people watching
[Applause]
all right very well I'm actually shy I
mean I recognize a lot of you guys from
some of the the events through a RI and
and turning point that I've done lately
so it's just amazing to me that for as
as crappie as everything seems on
college campus these days you guys are
out here to talk about ideas Your Honor
I had about an hour in the car to do
this I think we've already given this
the talk to each other we're really open
right now we're willing to kind of take
this in any direction we're gonna try to
push and pull on each other a little bit
but we don't really have an agenda here
but I think originally this was set up
to be about about limited government
which is one of your big things I'll let
you kick it off and then we'll see but
we want you guys to interact we're gonna
do about 45 minutes of us talking and
then we're gonna do questions totally
uncensored from you guys so you're on
take it away
sure and and I'm gonna swivel a little
bit because you all over the place so
yeah the role of government so you know
we were talking in the car coming in
here and one of the interviews that dave
has done recently with Steven Pinker and
I don't know if you've read his latest
book enlightenment now let me just
endorse it right now you know the things
I disagree in the book but the book is
phenomenal and everybody everybody in
the planet should be reading this book
he's endorsing a big lefty by them yeah
big lefty right and one of the things
that pink identifies easy he goes
through a whole series of chapters we
tells us how good life is right now on
planet earth it's never been better
and he's absolutely right life
expectancy poverty rates a hunger all of
these things we're in a better situation
today than we've ever been before and he
identifies the cause of that and the
cause he says is basically human
ingenuity ideas the application of human
reason in solving problems now how is
this related to the role of government
because you ask yourself what kind of
environment allows for the thriving of
human reason what kind of environment
allows
for ideas not just to be thought of but
then implemented in reality and brought
into existence and what you realize
quickly it in if you study the history
this is exactly what happened is that
for ideas for people to come up with
ideas for people then to implement ideas
to make them a reality they need to be
free they need to be free you can't have
it when the Catholic Church is telling
you I don't know the Sun goes around the
earth it doesn't work the other way
around you you can't have it when some
autocrat tells you what to think or what
to do what business you can open or what
business you can't open you need to be
free free to think sometimes ridiculous
ideas that fail but then you fail that's
okay
but for the successful ideas to work
people have to have the freedom to try
them and to go out and do them and then
so freedom of what right because freedom
is a would everybody loves right
nobody's against freedom but freedom
from what well freedom means freedom
from coercion freedom for force freedom
from Authority and if you think about
what that means it really is the concept
that the founding fathers described as
individual rights wights really other
recognition that each individual is
should be free free from coercion free
to live their life as they see fit free
to think and to speak and to act as they
see fit as long as they're not harming
other people they have the right to
pursue the rational values necessary for
their own existence and they like and
therefore what the only role of
governor's I see it is to make that
freedom a reality and to make that
freedom reality what we need is to it's
the extract force when we get together
to make sure that you guys you know this
is why we have the police here right
don't attack me because of what I'm
saying right that's it
so we need freedom from force so they're
all the government is basically that
it's to guarantee that we can say what
we want to say do what we want to do and
otherwise leave us alone so police and
military and the judiciary and that kind
of environment is what fosters the kind
of creativity that has made
and and the the the production that has
made this world such an amazing world so
yeah it's it's simple so I love that one
of the things he said there was freedom
to think because you guys are in college
this is where you're supposed to learn
how to think and unfortunately what's
happening obviously on most college
campuses these days is that thinking is
sort of becoming an outlier in in what's
going on so it's interesting he
references your own references Steven
Pinker's book steven pinker again as I
said he's a lefty I think he would
probably say he's a progressive who
would disagree with you on virtually
every political topic and that's what I
think is so cool about what's happening
these days and I think it's probably why
you guys watch my show or you're
involved in in this whole thing that's
happening right now the example I like
is if you take two guys that I'm sure
you guys are familiar with ventia puro
and Sam Harris these guys disagree on
literally every political topic there is
from forget political topic they
disagree on the most existential
questions of the universe right whether
whether God exists and the value of
religion to abortion to taxes to
literally just down the line what
whatever you attack did the whole thing
get their allies now because there is a
massive realignment happening that if
you will agree on defending free speech
defending someone's ability to think and
live their life for themselves that in a
pluralistic society we're actually
supposed to disagree on those things so
I think that's a beautiful thing right
there but unfortunately we're sort of
only seeing tolerance one way these days
yeah and and and that the beauty of this
alliance is two things one is this idea
of freedom freedom of speech freedom of
thought but the second is that the
standard for truth is reason the reason
is the way in which we communicate
reason is the way in which we deal with
one another it you know it's not my god
versus your God and my revelation versus
your revelation no even if you're
religious like let's say Jordan Peterson
maybe is nobody's actually sure maybe
even though maybe even Jordans not
exactly sure well I'm going on tour with
them so there you go you'll find out
yeah but you know at the end of the day
the standard is reality the standard is
right and and the beauty of Steven
Pinker in his book is well yeah I think
there's some inconsistencies there some
ways in which he abandons reasons but he
venerates the idea of reason of reality
based thinking of facts and the same on
many issues ben shapiro right even when
we talk about politics or whether
there's a disagreement on politics we
agree that the standard should be what
is true what is actually in reality but
that that's why I think there's
something actually special going on here
and if you look here right we've got the
young Americans for liberty this is a
libertarian organization obviously
Turning Point USA a lot of their their
main guys or Trump supporters you're
you're not a trump supporter as an
understatement I voted for Gary Johnson
and I should be judged accordingly Gary
Johnson by the way he is the first
person that actually ever made me
question whether we'd should be legal or
not because the man could not remember
anything true but but this shows you
that there's a diversity of idea
happening right now on what I would say
is basically the sort of center-right
basically that I we could get into some
of our political differences I'm happy
to do that but that you guys are here
and that no matter what we say right now
you came because you wanted to hear
about some diverse ideas and
unfortunately I you know I offer this
all the time my next six months year
basically is full with speaking gigs and
not one is from a Democrat organization
or a left organization or a progressive
organization you know I'm gay married
that should have I'm not even gay I just
did it for the cred but but that should
have some cred with these people you
know I'm I'm pro-choice
you know we could go down the list I'm
for some social safety net that I know
we disagree on plenty of those things
that should get me some cred with the
left but unfortunately there there's a
real corruption in there in the side
that is always preaching about tolerance
and what I'm finding and I find it more
and more is I talk to these people who I
have massive disagreements with I'm sure
some of you guys saw Ben Shapiro on my
show where we we disagreed about
abortion and the death penalty
bunch of things but yet you guys invite
us here so that actually does say
something that's that's a real credit to
you and and we just aren't seeing this
on the left do you think it was always
like this
on the left because you I think for
young people and even for me it was yeah
sort of new I don't think it was always
like this on the left I think the left
was better in the past I think I think
the left indeed in many respects that
left was better than the right on the
issue of free speech and the right was
actually a press of a free speech for a
very long time so you're talking about
Berkeley 30 yeah I mean suddenly if you
go back to the 60s and sit but since
then and and and before the 60s there
was it there was definitely a sense in
which the left was much more open to new
ideas and look you know I think you're
more positive on the right than I am
because because you know so if you win a
CPAC this last year and it was a speak
at CPAC who spoke about who is some Cato
the Cato Institute and he said some
positive things about immigration you
would think he just said we should kill
all babies or something the room
exploded they booed him they try to get
him offstage and many of the people are
in that auditorium would have shut him
up if they could have done its I think I
think we were a little too you know too
positive about the rule is some people
on the right I I mean I was at an event
just before the election in Chicago and
this is this was like everybody was over
65 I was like a tea party group and I
was on stage and I said something
positive about immigration I I'm very
positive about immigration you can ask
about that and oh my god these 65 year
olds were standing up and cursing me and
yelling at me and try to get me off the
stage so there's a sudden intolerance
unfortunately Minoo I think it dominates
the left and it's in certain parts of
the right on certain issues and it's
it's scary because because again I mean
I think this group realizes this once
you lose the ability to speak that
basically once yet once your silence
they're basically limiting what you can
think and once you do that there were
right for authoritarianism it really is
the end of what we call Western
civilization which I think America's
still the
cannava still struggling to remain the
beacon of a dis is the issue of our time
there's no more important issue and this
is why this coalition has come together
yeah it's because this is the most
important issue I can think of is the
issue of free speech it Trump's
immigration warfare politics any of
these other issues if you can't speak
then you can't think and if you can't
think it's over I'm curious how many of
you guys saw just in the last couple
weeks the amount of articles from Vox
and salon and and all the usual players
who were sort of mocking the the free
speech fighters did you guys see that
yeah you know we'll do some of this by
applause just so the people at home can
get it did you guys see those articles
yeah I know you don't want to applaud
those articles specifically so that was
a little weird I suppose but I thought
that was really interesting that
suddenly and these again and you may be
right that I've been a little too easy
on elements of the of the right when it
comes to you know right for me it's like
I come from the left so when I see the
right when I see these the race realists
or these people that want America to be
a white state or it to me that is so
ridiculous and they have no
institutional power and they're they're
a bunch of true racists not the way that
racism is thrown at you guys
or at us yeah so to me those people
aren't even worth thinking about or even
it's just irrelevant so but perhaps you
you may be right that I've given them a
little bit of a slide there but what I
would say is it's interesting to me that
suddenly in the last couple weeks
there's been this push on the left media
to mock the free speech people the very
people who will defend these ridiculous
organizations like so on and and Vox to
to print these usually awful things I'm
sure many of you guys saw the articles
written about Jordan Peterson in the
last couple weeks yeah everyone's
nodding and it's like yeah I mean I find
it will defend their right to do it I'm
on the barricades I mean literally on
the barricades and you know I find it
interesting that they they get micro
aggressed I guess or they find offensive
certain things that we say yeah oh by
the way we have a room of puppies
against any of you
offended by any of the hate speech up
here tonight and cuddly teddy bears just
get something alive scares you but you
know but they can they can go after
Jordan Peterson offend him misrepresent
him or misrepresent Iran or missives and
me and we're not we don't we I get AG
rest I mean I get you know I get
triggered and nobody cares right what
about me
right you can insult me and there's like
if I say something on about about them
oh my god they're so sensitive but they
feel complete no problem insulting and
and really being violent against us and
we're supposed to just take it now let
me just say something about this left
right I think one of the reasons I'm
sensitive it in terms a more critical of
the right is because I'm perceived as a
member of the right and Iran is
perceived as belonging on the right and
and my and and I don't want to be I
don't want to be associated with Donald
Trump
I don't want to be associate with some
people on the right so when people right
like Sal Honda's often Trump's Iran
cabinet right I make a special effort to
make it clear that there's no
relationship between anybody on Trump's
cabinet and what Iran really meant so I
am much more sensitive to the nonsense
on the right because people want me to
belong I don't believe I'm on the left
or on the right I'm you know I think
we're like on a slightly different
dimension so I'm I'm clearly much more
sensitive about the right and I also
think I mean that's a whole lot of
question I also I think the right
there's a certain danger there as well
but yeah all right and I also you know
as I'm sure many of you guys have seen I
think these labels are getting
increasingly meaningless left right I'm
sure if we polled all of you guys that
your political opinions would be all
over the place and that's what it's
supposed to be that is what freedom is
supposed to be it's not supposed to be
ingrained into a political party but as
I saw all these articles about about
free speech and and you know they were
supposedly putting out polls that you
know students are more tolerant than
ever and then if you actually read them
it was that they were just intolerant of
racist speech which of course is insane
because they label everything they don't
like racist so it doesn't quite work but
by again by applause which is a little
bizarre how many of you on campus here
have been afraid to either say what you
think politically to a friend or a
faculty member or in class or anything
like that I know it's a weird thing to
I'm not sure if you heard about this but
the 2016 election was completely bananas
Trump and Hillary were actually only
part of it as there were other
characters from Bernie and Jeb to Marco
and Ted the election also caused the
implosion of the mainstream media and
set us on a path that has hashtag Magga
racing towards hashtag resistance with
the rest of us caught right in the
middle
Ohio Governor John Kasich was one of the
more moderate voices in a campaign
season that was short on moderation as a
fiscally conservative socially liberal
Republican I see Kasich as someone who
has some of the right ideas but whose
timing just wasn't right for the madness
of 2016
Kasich steam reached out to us a couple
days ago and we have him in studio today
totally unscripted and unedited with no
advanced knowledge of the topics or
questions I think this is exactly the
way we need to be hearing from our
politicians and I hope that this
interview helps deal us in on these
conversations in the near future
[Music]
joining me today is the author of the
new book two paths America divided or
United a former Republican presidential
candidate and the current governor of
the great state of Ohio Governor John
Kasich welcome to the Rubin report
that's a really good television voice
house thank well we were just sitting
here you were kind of normal and that
you were like dude you know it was like
Ted Baxter very good ah Ted Baxter I
like the reference that did not go over
me well you know I like of course
everybody else watching their little he
is but that's okay they could google it
some of my millennial people won't get
it but they should google who Ted Baxter
is that would that would be good for
them so first what I wanted to start
with you I'm incredibly excited you're
here and it's interesting because your
people reached out to us about four days
ago they said the governor would like to
come in and then we quickly set this up
nobody said oh we have to talk about
this or we can't talk about this you sat
down here about two minutes ago and you
said whatever you want to do is fine and
I feel like that is partly what's lost
in politics right now that we're gonna
just do this well it's not just lost in
politics I see it lost in a lot of
things you know I mean I met with this
big car company and like they had these
guys come in to see me and it was like
they were totally scripted and you know
so I think you know life is having fun
life is you know being able to to be
real and the reason why we wanted to do
this is I actually kind of saw part of
one of your shows and this media is
really amazing a lot of people don't get
it and I'm starting to get it and I have
some people around me who say this is
really a way to keep your voice out
there you know that's what I want to be
able to have a constructive positive
voice to help our country and this is
another avenue that i'm glad no one else
has found it yeah in my profession yeah
so we can be a first mover which I I
really I really like and I like the fact
that we can actually have a conversation
longer than just a couple sound bites
yeah do you ever worry that because
we've lost the ability to do this that
the sound bite world is what's causing
so many of the
well that was what happened in a
campaign it was all you know we didn't
do it but these other campaigns and I
had advice from some people who had run
before make sure you get your little
thing out there so you can blow up the
television Morning News and you know and
it's like tricks you know mm-hmm that's
not a good thing and look people I saw I
saw thing on the side yesterday it said
email me please we have to talk yeah I
think the look I I didn't have a
smartphone for a long time I have I've
had an iPad and I got it in the very
beginning but I didn't have a smartphone
and people would laugh at me but I
didn't need this stuff during the day
you know I didn't need to have
basketball scores or look at the weather
25 times or you know some kind of
headline in the news or my emails
because I have people that can you know
tell me if there's a crisis they tell me
I go okay well let's see what it is but
I got my smart phone and now the best
thing about it is that I can text but I
find that when I text you know what it
does is it creates a laziness right you
don't have to go through a conversation
yeah now don't you think
look you have a cup you have a show here
where people talk this is what you think
about it don't you think this is a
problem I mean I think that resetting
our ability to talk and actually think
and and sit across from somebody and
make some eye contact and really try to
understand what they think I think that
is almost the most important thing that
we've given up in these last couple
years it was the trade-off between all
these devices and the immediate response
so what do we do about it
this I mean I honestly think that you
come in here right now and you're people
being brave enough to say yeah it's not
like I have my people you know these are
people that work around yeah kind of
support me and help me they're friends
and but this whole you know sort of
funny we were you go on these shows on
regular television which I think are
really important and you get you know
two million people to see you but if you
are like hanging out with Logan Paul
that's 16 million subscribers it's like
and you know the funny thing about it
is that people can't see it really now
but that's not really true because I
think probably you're in demand now and
you can go out and make talks and people
show up to see you yeah but it's kind of
an invisible world to those who were
kind of hooked on television right you
understand what I mean by that I do so
how do we how do we bridge that I don't
know but you know what's I think it's
called what's news it was really
fantastic and there were a couple of
million views and and I liked it you
just have to keep doing it it's part of
why I wanted to be here
I mean I look you I pull up here you've
got a studio in your garage yeah it's
it's cool it's neat and you know you
don't have to go very far right yes like
commutes about 10:00 you know that way
the hard thing has got to be getting
compelling guests there's got to be a
hard thing to do how do you go about
doing that
well fortunately a lot of people are
coming to this medium now and a lot of
the guests that you asked me right
before we started all these books here I
mean most of the I think well virtually
every single one except the Carl Sagan
but are there any of them that are
interesting there's a lot like they're
very boring and I know there's some
great books there by by many of my
guests from Steven Pinker and Sam Harris
and Scott Adams and yeah plenty of I see
you have one here on John Adams so I
have it we did a president's week a
couple weeks ago John Adams so you're
getting you're getting good over the
cone we're getting was it was it you
know what a lot of times when I am with
the press I'm actually curious about
them and they don't like it when I'm
asking them stuff okay it must have been
hard in the beginning right Owain it's
hard to build anything I mean you know
you know that but I one of the things
that I consistently tell my audience is
it's cool that a lot of the beliefs that
I have you know I fall a little more
within classical liberalism and
libertarianism a lot of the beliefs
about doing things for yourself and I've
built this business with the same ideas
that I try to talk about here
some of which I think we're gonna get to
and it's kind of a beautiful thing not
if I keep not if you keep going yeah all
right let me ask you a couple of
questions as long as you're here so I
thought just first I thought we just a
little bit about growing up what kind of
family you grew up in I feel like people
never do that in politics anymore we go
to immediately what everybody kind of
mocks me because I say my father was a
mailman and so the people write that and
they're like
cynical and all that but
I grew up in a town that was over I mean
I don't think I ever met a Republican
not in my town my Uncle Harry was a
Republican they say we didn't listen
much to him he's a great guy but you
know it was blue-collar and you know is
sort of these some of these people you
would define as kind of the Trump people
you know who felt they've been left
behind so you know as a result of that I
guess I that's why I'm a populist but a
positive populist not a negative
populist positive that we can do it we
can together we can we can rise and
that's a great place to come from
because you really have a sense you have
a sense of people you know and it's not
just the upper crust we respected the
upper crust I can remember saying to my
father one time daddy what about the
rich he said well we don't hate the rich
we want to be the rich you know and so
it was great god-fearing conservative
Democrat good values faith was a was a
part of my early childhood which I
normally drifted away from when I went
to college you know it's like Augustine
he says you know I needed I know I need
to be committed to God but just not
right now I have a couple parties to go
so you know we all drift away and I've
drifted I'm not drifted I've come
roaring back into that but common sense
right
freewheeling sometimes it puts people
off a little bit the way I am because
I'm pretty direct and but the other
thing is I was telling somebody the
other day that you know I don't want
people to be confused about my positions
on anything and so if somebody says well
I think it's blue and I might say well
no I think it's red and they most people
would expect me to say okay well
consider that and I'm like no no I just
don't think that and I think to some
degree people don't get it so it takes a
little bit of time for people to come to
understand me yeah
all right well that's what we're gonna
do here for the next hour oh you
mentioned a couple interesting things
there so you didn't grow up in a
Republican family personnel and you just
use the phrase conservative Democrat
yeah so one of the things I talk a lot
about here is that it seems to me before
we get into your party that the
conservative Democrat or the Blue Dog
Democrat or sort of the moderate down
there a lot of them were buddies of mine
in Congress you know great friends do
they really exist anymore I think this
is I think this young man in
Pennsylvania is Blue Dog Democrat from
what I can see now he got elected at 33
I think I was 30 so he's kind of
old-timer yeah but no I think that I
think in both parties it's really hard
if you're Republican you got to fear the
right and if you're a Democrat you fear
the left and it just pulls everybody
apart you know that though but but
you've managed to kind of work through
something that's sort of centrist right
somehow well I don't know what that
means you know one guy once told me the
only thing that goes down the middle of
a road are yellow lines and dead skunks
okay and I'm I'm not a but I'm a common
sense person well I guess so look I look
at an issue and say okay what do we do
about it and we look at a problem how do
we fix the problem but I'm not really
going to have an ideological force
that's pulling me back but the same time
being a conservative I want to see what
the solutions are without having to
bring bureaucracy or government and and
I'll tell you why that is it's because
government inherently is so subject to
political considerations that people
have a hard time make calling a spade a
spade it's like no no I got all these
pressures and I don't like that and so
when you go to government you can get
trapped but you get trapped with big
business to big business you know you
try to like I need this prescription you
know and somebody out here is telling me
oh no no it costs too much you know big
things like that all have always
bothered me
you know big institutions whether it's
government I grew up my dad was in a
Union I always liked unions but you know
the problem with the unions is when the
union boss is not representing a worker
and so big institutions don't throw me
where am I kind of unpredictable see
because you kind of labeled yourself a
little bit ago you said well I'm this
and that if you ask me what I am I'll
say I'm a conservative but then you will
say well but why do you think this or
that and
because I don't think we need to be
stuck right being stuck in life is
really depressing all right so tell me
about what does being a conservative
basically mean to you then if government
is a last resort yeah not as a first
resort but but I also don't think it's
like no government you know how do you
decide where that's that new user do use
judgment and you listen you have good
people around you think about things and
we're trying to price something right
now in our state somebody wants access
to stuff in our state okay it would it's
a good thing it's a good thing what they
want but I don't know what the price of
the value of it is okay so I can't just
look at what governments have done to
determine the value because I don't have
a you know I don't have a whole lot of I
don't invest a lot in that I want to go
out and talk to a variety of people and
business to say what do you think this
is worth okay and so how do I do that
people that come in and they talk and
they argue for certain things but at the
end I have to decide so I just used as
good a judgement as I can yeah do you
have a certain leeway when it comes to
sort of thinking for yourself as a
governor that maybe the Senators and the
congressmen can't have because they have
to all cannot that you don't have to
come together and work with people know
if they have to do it from with people
outside their state with massively
competing interests and things like that
I was offering budgets against
Republican presidents I mean just do
your job I mean why would you want to be
why would you want to have a television
show where you don't make it real why
would I want to be in politics no matter
where I am and not make it real I mean
what would I be there for it's really
stupid right they mean it there's if
you're not there's a lot of people there
for that well I don't want to be I don't
want to be casting aspersions or judging
them only for me why would you do that I
mean so we had a decision on Medicaid
expansion right in Ohio you know that
you know Medicaid expansion of course
right so I was really Jen Brewer in
Arizona did it which really was
kind of shocking to me but I was really
the first big state big Republican
governor who expand it was it hard no it
was a piece of cake if I'm gonna get
money that's not gonna put me in a
straitjacket from the federal government
if I can use that money to heal to help
heal or helps help to help the mentally
ill so they're not sleeping under a
bridge or living in a jail or if I can
help people who have drug addiction to
get treatment and get off of it if I can
have a lower uninsurance rate why
wouldn't I do that and because people
are gonna yell at me and fight with so
what who cares I mean I care I don't
want them to not I don't want him to be
angst in fact in my State of the State
address I was I made a talk that really
had almost nothing to do with policy it
all had all to do with basically
philosophy and the meaning of life
they say was the only State of the State
speech delivered by Governor in the
history of the world where the name camu
was discussed you know but I and I
didn't mention that because I don't want
to jab anybody in the eye but the
decision to do that to help people it's
just it's such an easy decision do you
find you have a little bit of an extra
freedom right now because you can't run
for re-election i yeah i oh now there's
a lot of talk of 2020 which I want to
end the after viewer look I mean
probably so but I've always been very
independent you know I was a military
reformer I was offering my own budgets
against President Bush I would talk on
corporate welfare reform couldn't find a
Democrat with a searchlight and the
Republicans or any other way no I've
always pretty well felt that you know I
you got to do what you have to do and am
I more free now I may be a little bit
but but I think would change I mean I
don't know what is that I would reverse
I wouldn't say well we're not going to
do this Medicaid thing yeah now if you
got us into a point where we were you
know fiscally at risk I would have to
stop it I've told everybody that but now
I don't really think so but I am having
probably more fun now
you know having a lot of fun yeah I mean
I can tell but I've been having fun you
know I ran for re-election and I and I
never even used the word Obama running
for re-election never talked about it I
just talked about a record and it was
fun and it was positive look here's the
thing
and we all need to know this we all need
to be healers in one way or another we
need to heal our family and our friends
and strangers I'm not that great a guy
okay but I know that that makes sense
and I know that it's right so it's just
a cool thing to think about and that's
why politics is so boring to me because
it's all these all these calculations
and all this crap why don't we just do a
job let's think about how to pull to
pull the country together let's make
sure that we can help people to be
lifted let's not tear somebody down
Elizabeth Warren wants to tear down all
these rich people I don't know why or
Bernie or whatever I work with Bernie it
it's you don't need to tear people down
we need to just build people up and and
put them together yeah did you ever get
into any of those philosophical
discussions with Bernie because the
class war nothing I see I see as
extremely dangerous no I know I know I
wouldn't have a conversation with Bernie
Ben Bernie and I were in the house
together he was you know really kind of
in another orbit they all thought he was
and yet you know the country's kind of
moved towards him and I think a lot of
young people are you know the one thing
that is concerning to me and I have
great faith in the Millennials and Gen
Xers but I'm not sure they understand
the consequences of losing a
representative democracy there seems to
be with some of them some appeal towards
an authoritarian figure of you am i
right on that I think you have me yeah I
haven't studied it but I've got that
sense that's not good or that you know
maybe socialism will work look and a
free enterprise system ichael novak the
great philosopher theologian said that a
free market system that is not under
laid with a set of values is bankrupt so
you have to have values you can't just
be in it to make money there has to be
something else there
where do you think those values come
from oh I think they I think that they
the easy thing to say politically easy
thing to say is they come from mom and
I'm not sure if you heard about this but
the 2016 election was completely bananas
Trump and Hillary were actually only
part of it as there were other
characters from Bernie and Jeb to Marco
and Ted the election also caused the
implosion of the mainstream media and
set us on a path that has hashtag Magga
racing towards hashtag resistance with
the rest of us caught right in the
middle
Ohio Governor John Kasich was one of the
more moderate voices in a campaign
season that was short on moderation as a
fiscally conservative socially liberal
Republican I see Kasich as someone who
has some of the right ideas but whose
timing just wasn't right for the madness
of 2016
Kasich steam reached out to us a couple
days ago and we have him in studio today
totally unscripted and unedited with no
advanced knowledge of the topics or
questions I think this is exactly the
way we need to be hearing from our
politicians and I hope that this
interview helps deal us in on these
conversations in the near future
[Music]
joining me today is the author of the
new book two paths America divided or
United a former Republican presidential
candidate and the current governor of
the great state of Ohio Governor John
Kasich welcome to the Rubin report
that's a really good television voice
house thank well we were just sitting
here you were kind of normal and that
you were like dude you know it was like
Ted Baxter very good ah Ted Baxter I
like the reference that did not go over
me well you know I like of course
everybody else watching their little he
is but that's okay they could google it
some of my millennial people won't get
it but they should google who Ted Baxter
is that would that would be good for
them so first what I wanted to start
with you I'm incredibly excited you're
here and it's interesting because your
people reached out to us about four days
ago they said the governor would like to
come in and then we quickly set this up
nobody said oh we have to talk about
this or we can't talk about this you sat
down here about two minutes ago and you
said whatever you want to do is fine and
I feel like that is partly what's lost
in politics right now that we're gonna
just do this well it's not just lost in
politics I see it lost in a lot of
things you know I mean I met with this
big car company and like they had these
guys come in to see me and it was like
they were totally scripted and you know
so I think you know life is having fun
life is you know being able to to be
real and the reason why we wanted to do
this is I actually kind of saw part of
one of your shows and this media is
really amazing a lot of people don't get
it and I'm starting to get it and I have
some people around me who say this is
really a way to keep your voice out
there you know that's what I want to be
able to have a constructive positive
voice to help our country and this is
another avenue that i'm glad no one else
has found it yeah in my profession yeah
so we can be a first mover which I I
really I really like and I like the fact
that we can actually have a conversation
longer than just a couple sound bites
yeah do you ever worry that because
we've lost the ability to do this that
the sound bite world is what's causing
so many of the
well that was what happened in a
campaign it was all you know we didn't
do it but these other campaigns and I
had advice from some people who had run
before make sure you get your little
thing out there so you can blow up the
television Morning News and you know and
it's like tricks you know mm-hmm that's
not a good thing and look people I saw I
saw thing on the side yesterday it said
email me please we have to talk yeah I
think the look I I didn't have a
smartphone for a long time I have I've
had an iPad and I got it in the very
beginning but I didn't have a smartphone
and people would laugh at me but I
didn't need this stuff during the day
you know I didn't need to have
basketball scores or look at the weather
25 times or you know some kind of
headline in the news or my emails
because I have people that can you know
tell me if there's a crisis they tell me
I go okay well let's see what it is but
I got my smart phone and now the best
thing about it is that I can text but I
find that when I text you know what it
does is it creates a laziness right you
don't have to go through a conversation
yeah now don't you think
look you have a cup you have a show here
where people talk this is what you think
about it don't you think this is a
problem I mean I think that resetting
our ability to talk and actually think
and and sit across from somebody and
make some eye contact and really try to
understand what they think I think that
is almost the most important thing that
we've given up in these last couple
years it was the trade-off between all
these devices and the immediate response
so what do we do about it
this I mean I honestly think that you
come in here right now and you're people
being brave enough to say yeah it's not
like I have my people you know these are
people that work around yeah kind of
support me and help me they're friends
and but this whole you know sort of
funny we were you go on these shows on
regular television which I think are
really important and you get you know
two million people to see you but if you
are like hanging out with Logan Paul
that's 16 million subscribers it's like
and you know the funny thing about it
is that people can't see it really now
but that's not really true because I
think probably you're in demand now and
you can go out and make talks and people
show up to see you yeah but it's kind of
an invisible world to those who were
kind of hooked on television right you
understand what I mean by that I do so
how do we how do we bridge that I don't
know but you know what's I think it's
called what's news it was really
fantastic and there were a couple of
million views and and I liked it you
just have to keep doing it it's part of
why I wanted to be here
I mean I look you I pull up here you've
got a studio in your garage yeah it's
it's cool it's neat and you know you
don't have to go very far right yes like
commutes about 10:00 you know that way
the hard thing has got to be getting
compelling guests there's got to be a
hard thing to do how do you go about
doing that
well fortunately a lot of people are
coming to this medium now and a lot of
the guests that you asked me right
before we started all these books here I
mean most of the I think well virtually
every single one except the Carl Sagan
but are there any of them that are
interesting there's a lot like they're
very boring and I know there's some
great books there by by many of my
guests from Steven Pinker and Sam Harris
and Scott Adams and yeah plenty of I see
you have one here on John Adams so I
have it we did a president's week a
couple weeks ago John Adams so you're
getting you're getting good over the
cone we're getting was it was it you
know what a lot of times when I am with

sure that we can help people to be
lifted let's not tear somebody down
Elizabeth Warren wants to tear down all
these rich people I don't know why or
Bernie or whatever I work with Bernie it
it's you don't need to tear people down
we need to just build people up and and
put them together yeah did you ever get
into any of those philosophical
discussions with Bernie because the
class war nothing I see I see as
extremely dangerous no I know I know I
wouldn't have a conversation with Bernie
Ben Bernie and I were in the house
together he was you know really kind of
in another orbit they all thought he was
and yet you know the country's kind of
moved towards him and I think a lot of
young people are you know the one thing
that is concerning to me and I have
great faith in the Millennials and Gen
Xers but I'm not sure they understand
the consequences of losing a
representative democracy there seems to
be with some of them some appeal towards
an authoritarian figure of you am i
right on that I think you have me yeah I
haven't studied it but I've got that
sense that's not good or that you know
maybe socialism will work look and a
free enterprise system ichael novak the
great philosopher theologian said that a
free market system that is not under
laid with a set of values is bankrupt so
you have to have values you can't just
be in it to make money there has to be
something else there
where do you think those values come
from oh I think they I think that they
the easy thing to say politically easy
thing to say is they come from mom and
[Music]
allow me to tell you the classic
children's tale of Chicken Little
otherwise known as Henny Penny as the
tale goes little Henny was outside one
day when an acorn fell from a tree and
hit her on the head because of her
naivete and simplemindedness Henny
foolishly began to believe that the sky
itself was falling down around her she
spent the rest of the day trying to
convince others like goosey loosey and
turkey-lurkey that the sky was most
certainly falling and the world was
surely coming to an end in most versions
of the story the trip does not end well
for Henny and her hysterical friends
after they meet the sly Foxy Loxy I
don't want to give everything away
though so either read the story for
yourself or check out the classic season
6 episode of The Golden Girls in which
they reenact the tale I mention Henny
and Lucy and Turkey and foxy not just
because they're great names to say but
because it seems that just about
everyone is telling us the sky is
falling these days between Trump Russia
North Korea we've got about half the
country that's in total freakout mode
every day this freak out takes on a new
urgency one day the world is ending
because America left the Paris climate
Accord another day it's because of the
net neutrality reversal and another day
it's because Trump holds his water glass
with two hands this endless hysteria is
not only being amplified by the media
but it's actually being poked and
prodded by them as well
blue cheque verified journalists on
Twitter who work for news organizations
which really are nothing more than
partisan activist outlets want to keep
you clicking on their articles and
videos and they know that the best way
to do that is to convince you that not
only is the sky falling but it's gonna
land directly on your head what if and
just hear me out on this one
this outrage Factory is completely wrong
and the world isn't coming to an end
just yet crazy I know but I think that
it actually might be true this doesn't
mean that things are perfect but they
are pretty damn good this is the
position of my guest this week Harvard
psychology professor Steven Pinker
Pinker argues despite our world of
perceived horror and chaos people are
living longer happier healthier and
freer
lives right now more than any other time
in human history this doesn't mean we
don't have work to do but if we don't
stop and smell the roses we might toss
away all the goodness humans have
created for the prospect of a utopia
that will never appear this is why I'm
so proud of the work we've done here on
the Rubin report I truly believe that
the conversations were having are at
least some part of the antidote to the
craziness right now if those of us who
care about enlightenment principles like
science reason and natural rights can
make our voices louder than this cliff
we seem to be about to go off of might
just turn into a bridge to a better
world Henny Penny story took a drastic
turn when she met Foxy Loxy who tricked
her and her friends to go to his lair
well in real life we've got a Wolf
Blitzer in a Situation Room if the sky
is falling maybe just changing the
channel is all we have to do to survive
the day joining me today is a Johnstone
family professor in the Department of
Psychology at Harvard University as well
as a New York Times bestselling author
whose new book enlightenment now is for
sale right now Steven Pinker welcome to
the Rubin report thank you I am I am
thrilled to have you here I think I have
emailed or called or contacted or pigeon
messaged everyone related to you or that
knows you in any way to get you here and
here I am right here you worked it goes
to prove that a little positivity I
think can make some things happen so
true yeah all right lot I want to talk
to you about I thought before we dive
into the book and and all the the things
that you teach and write about and all
that I just I like hearing a little bit
about people's history and where they
come from and growing up and all that
you are Canadian and I've had a lot of
Canadians on lately I find there's
something about Canadians in general
that I like what is it about Canadians
that leads to a certain Pleasant
disposition well we're so reasonable or
so yea polite yeah sometimes people say
think the motto of Canada is peace order
and good government yes and it's a
country that is that has been diverse
for for quite some time
Quebec where I grew up has
english-speaking community in a
french-speaking community and we've we
didn't begin with a revolution unlike
the United States negotiated our way to
independence we were part of the British
Empire in the British Commonwealth and
kind of have that British Reserve and
politeness yeah so that we have we have
some things going for us
couple of things going for yeah at least
until at least all the Americans end up
moving up there if things keep going
this way although we might build a wall
yeah all right you guys may end up
building the wall exactly tell me a
little bit about growing up your family
what kind of family you grew up in I I
grew up in the english-speaking section
of Montreal it was pretty segregated
when I grew up I grew up in a Jewish
english-speaking community which was
known for producing among others Leonard
Cohen who is a contemporary of my
mother's mhm the author Mordecai Richler
who was a contemporary of my father's
William Shatner Burt Bacharach Wow the
Saul Bellow status versus childhood in
Montreal so it's a small community that
has a number of people that were proud
of yeah what do you make of that that so
many I mean that's a pretty diverse
interesting group of people right there
and I'm sure there are others yeah I it
it may just be that having many cultural
influences both Canada's really cut
dominated by the United States it really
is the 800-pound gorilla next door yeah
so is the American influence the British
influence the French influence perhaps
is just being in a cosmopolitan diverse
community not helped with that and of
course the the Jewish influence although
it was not I didn't grow up and none of
the people that I mentioned grew up in
an ultra-orthodox community high grew up
in Oulu in Agra with a reformed temple
we didn't take God all that seriously
but we did take Jewish identity
seriously yeah I don't remember a moment
in which I decided oh I'm an atheist I
just was not a big issue one way or
another do you find that to be sort of a
standard thing with most secular Jews I
think that's sort of at least the ones
that I've been talking to on this show
that
think are sort of out there more that
seems to be a thing that there's an
ethnic identity or a cultural identity
that's separate from the belief part
absolutely and I think that's more true
of Judaism than it is of say Catholicism
where the belief really is stipulated in
Judaism is a bit of a kind of Don't Ask
Don't Tell as long as you have a thought
as long as we pay the laws and rituals
right if you keep the Sabbath if you
have you know mats on Passover then
you're a good Jew and what you believe
is just not as important what one rabbi
said to my wife rebecca goldstein
another secular Jew mmm well known a
secular humanist writer when she talked
about her novel 36 arguments for the
existence of God a work of fiction which
is kind of a great and she spoke at a
Jewish Community Center and I was a
little worried whether there'd be some
pushback from the rabbi who introduced
her own afterwards he went over he said
you know there's nothing in Judaism that
says you have to believe in God you just
can't believe in more than one of them
that's I mean that's pretty perfect you
think there's a there's an inherent
problem they're sort of disconnecting
God from reason if it really is well
just for the longevity of it let's say
oh yeah yeah it's a good question I
think that may have been part of the
explanation for why I mean there's so
many secular Jewish intellectuals kind
of immersed in argument dispute ation
particularly about morals and ethics but
without a but it was all argument
disputation it wasn't a catechism that
you had to recite it wasn't a set of
beliefs that you I have to have so there
was a tradition of disputation that's
what the rabbi's were famous for right
at the pill pull the hair splitting and
and maybe that was a contributor as well
but I went to public schools I went and
in fact when you go to public schools in
Quebec when I in my childhood met you
had two Protestant schools because it
was divided along religious lines they
were Protestant schools and Catholic so
history singing Protestant meant I'm
Catholic basically everyone else yeah
putting the Muslims and the Jews and
Chinese and so on there's a bizarre
system yeah how's how he just hadn't lis
unconstitutional in this country and I
got I got I actually got a pretty
serious Protestant religious education I
sang hymns we said the Lord's Prayer
every day I learned about
for Jesus so they had the Jews in the
Muslims and everyone I mean yeah in the
getting a Protestants yeah and at one
point I remember I was you know eight or
nine in my and I absolutely didn't even
belong to a temple I said so it's my
mother one of my friends said that that
Jews aren't supposed to believe in Jesus
my should I not believe in Jesus anymore
he sent me their Hebrew school so fast I
made my head spin hilarious and my
teachers because they couldn't hire
Catholic teachers either and virtually
everyone in Quebec is among the
francophone community are Catholics it's
actually hired Algerian and Tunisian and
moroccan jews to teach French to the
Jewish and Protestant kids of Montreal
the parson Kizza Montreal did not learn
French from native québécois we learned
it from Egyptian and Tunisian immigrants
I thought it was I'm pretty sure I know
the subject of your next book I mean it
sounds like there's just so much
richness just in that or at least
there's a little comedy in there so I
think it sounds like your family was
kind of on the intellectual side or at
least that the county was red house was
full of books and magazines my my father
was had a law degree but didn't practice
when I was a child he was a and handled
some little bit of real estate did sales
before starting a law practice pretty
late in life my mother was like most
mothers of the 50s and 60s a homemaker
but then found a career when she was
kind of getting bored when it became a
guidance counselor and then a vice
principal of a high school and and my
mother Roslyn Pinker very intellectual
an intense reader knows everything
intellectually very engaged yeah and my
sister Susan is a columnist for The Wall
Street Journal certain have been a
couple of books went on sex differences
one on face to face contact my brother
Rob I worked for the Canadian government
for several decades as a policy analyst
and
an administrator so how much of the
intellectual pursuits that you all have
do you think is is biological versus
just learned experience yeah this is one
of the themes that keeps coming up
around these conversations and then it
is was a topic of my book the blank
slate in the modern denial of human
nature yeah the blank slate being the
metaphor that I argued became kendama
Natan intellectual life largely for
political reasons yeah can you explain
that a little bit for the people that
don't know the book yeah so the the
blank slate the modern denial of human
nature just was released in 2016 with an
afterword was about the idea that that
there is no such thing as human nature
that we are blank slates written on by
our parents by by the culture by
education and that there's no innate
human traits or ways of learning and
thinking it's it's you can program a
human however you want and I agree that
it was popular in the 20th century for
political reasons one of them being that
it seems like the ultimate way to
achieve equality you know for all zero
then zero equals zero equals zero and so
we all have to be equal right
I already this is a mistake in the book
that equality is really a legal and
moral principle to treat everyone
equally it's not really the belief that
we're all clones room like slates
and a lot of the book tried to both lay
out the science of human nature but also
to explore the political and emotional
and moral baggage and coloring and to
try to clarify it and so the difference
between equality of treatment and
equality of of our biological endowment
was a major theme that also of course
enters into discussion of sex
differences to where one of the reasons
that certain intellectual factions
certain parts of feminism want to deny
that there are any sex differences they
think well that will make it impossible
to discriminate because there's nothing
to discriminate them on we're all
exactly this born exactly the same right
and I do that's a big big mistake
there's first of all there is a lot of
evidence that men and women aren't
identical in all traits yeah I mean I'm
not a scientist but I
I think there is a lot of everything I
think anyone who's had a son and a
daughter has been in a heterosexual
relationship yeah anyone who's listened
to gossip about anyone talking about
anyone else yeah men and women aren't
really not this is not exactly the same
but I think the myth that they're the
same was introduced for political
purposes namely that would make
discrimination irrational right because
there's no nothing to discriminate on
and I argue that that you know that's
just a error in logic I strongly believe
in gender equity that no one should be
prejudged because they're a man or a
woman partly because of a scientific
fact that there's a huge overlap between
the sexes in any trait you want to look
at so you can't predict an individual's
traits just knowing that they're a man
or a woman but they the policy we should
be fair doesn't require the false belief
that were the same that we are single
what's the best have you heard any
argument for that belief that you
thought made any sense or you just for
which belief or the idea that that this
that these genders are equal like when
that windy because you must hear this
from other academics right I mean we
know that some of this stuff is being
taught at schools yeah well there are
you know there's no doubt that there are
there's a normal enormous overlap
there's no doubt and and some of the
differences between the sexes are pretty
small and and subtle so in say
mathematical ability which was one of
the most controversial claims about sex
differences it it could it went to a
huge firestorm when Larry Summers the
president of Harvard mentioned that
differences between the sexes might
explain why the number of engineering
professors at Harvard and MIT work
wasn't 50/50 down the line male/female
yeah
this is very much like the the James
d'amour situation with with Google it is
exactly I mean it's almost it's almost a
replay yeah and and it isn't easy in
fact it would be hard to say that men
and women are better at math in general
it's you have to even drill down to
certain sub components like mentally
rotating three-dimensional objects that
men are clearly better at but women are
better at word problems in arithmetic
and math so it's a so some of the
pushback is that in fact the science is
often complicated
you can't make us sweeping across the
board generalization yeah and then the
other kind of pushback for people who
defend the blank slate is well yeah
that's true of you know 2002 when your
book came out but society is changing
and you know more women are consuming
porn and more women are having multiple
sexual partners and maybe the difference
is saying sexuality aren't due to human
nature but just due to our culture at a
particular moment that may become
obsolete that seems incredibly dangerous
to me to view it that way
well maybe although you know you could
in some ways it's actually highly
progressive and even correct because you
could have said you know 70 years ago
women you don't want to go into the
professions they they want to stay home
with the kids and housework and that's
what makes them complete and satisfied
and happy and they'll be all you know
neurotic and anxious if they start to
become lawyers and doctors and we know
from the course of history that you know
if that's not true that when as soon as
the doors open women did pour through
the doors and so that would be an
example where too strong a claim of
biological differences would have been
refuted by the facts of history so it's
not a slam dunk I mean it is something
that has to be examined on a
case-by-case basis are you shocked at
how difficult it is to talk about all of
this without getting yourself yourself
or any of the people that talk about it
into hot water yeah because the amount
of nuance that you have to go through
here as I can see you're you're quite
well-versed at you're probably the best
at it it's a lot to make sure that
somebody can't pinpoint that one line
but then they're gonna just you know
drag you for exactly right well and the
reason that I wrote the blank slate was
it wasn't so much I have a chapter on
gender but the point wasn't just to
review the literature on gender
differences it was also to say okay so
what how does it matter for our public
debates mhm
and I also documented in the book how
even when the book first came out there
was a history of people being deep
platformed and shouted down and called
you know all kinds of nasty names for
for the view that were not blank slates
and I said well look this is based on on
emotion based on bad politics not based
on the facts so I kind of I don't know
if I'm gonna say defended myself but
I've laid out all of these political
controversies so I wasn't blundering
into it naive I was actually that was
actually the subject of the book right
sometimes though that that can't fully
defend you there all right and in fact
both Larry Summers and Jamie d'amour
yeah they almost could have taken their
speeches and in case of Larry Summers
partly did from the chapter on gender in
the book so I managed to escape some
trouble that people who then repeated
the arguments got into trouble for yeah
so it's interesting you sort of laid out
a case beforehand to defend yourself you
did like sort of a preemptive strike
exactly where someone both of those guys
I know James I know James personally
needs been in here or it's like he sort
of stumbled into this thing and then the
the reaction the way it sorted out it
just becomes this bigger beast that you
end up fighting when you were just
really trying to talk about science well
the science I I wasn't just talking
about the science cuz I was talking
about first the science then what are
the political and moral implications
which I thought got confused
feeding back on people trying to
shoehorn the science into a politically
[Music]
alright let's talk about the book right
here in front of me enlightenment now
I've been kicking around this phrase on
Twitter that's called a little traction
that we are now in the unlighted
because it seems like we're in this
endless stream of constant stupidity and
some of it seems social media related
and we touched a little bit on that on
part one and when I'm saying it I'm
saying it a little tongue-in-cheek and
actually this book is sort of the answer
to I think what I'm calling the
Enlightenment that there are so many
good things happening right now and it's
very hopeful and optimistic and I always
tell people I'm an optimist otherwise I
couldn't do this you know I mean I I
feel that we there's a chance we can
make things better so first off let's
just do some one-on-one stuff here what
are enlightenment values to you well I
characterize them in the subtitle of
book as reason science humanism and
progress reason that we should analyze
our situation our predicament using the
most rigorous logic that we can and
rather than relying on Dogma Authority
traditional scripture not for social
media for social media although at least
throwing ideas out there is as long as
they get evaluators as long as they get
criticized right science namely that we
should test our hypotheses seek deep
explanations and the science provides us
not just with gadgets and cures for
disease although it's important that it
does that but also defines our human
condition that that concepts from
science like evolution like entropy like
the whole naturalistic worldview that
the laws of nature do their thing
without caring about us these are things
that we have to understand as the most
basic facts about our existence so the
audience's part has to be part of our
world to you then humanism is the idea
that it's human beings and other
sentient animals that deserve our moral
concern as opposed to they say the glory
of the tribe or
following carrying out religious
dictates or the faith or some messianic
age that it's just do people live long
healthy happy stimulating lives that's
what we should care about and promises
that if we use a reason in science to
make people better off well maybe we can
gradually succeed yeah so it's funny
when I when I was reading this and the
only word that like dinged a little
something in my head was progress and I
think it's partly because of the way
progressives have used progress that
progress in and of itself you want to
progress meaning have more and more
opportunity for people more and more
equality for people I think that's a far
cry from what I think the progressives
are doing right now because that that's
the most subjective one of any of those
terms right well I I have the wisecrack
that progressives hate progress look at
the people who denied that we've made
progress it's often the people who
politically label themselves as
progressive who can't stand the idea we
made progress because they want to say
that every aspect of our current society
and institutions as you know corrupt and
racist and controlled by the by the 1%
and everything is getting worse and
worse and worse
ironically because the whole point of
being a progressive presumably is that
progressive activism is not a waste of
time but it actually brings benefits and
which actually has sort of the catch-22
of progress in general that you have to
acknowledge it but in a weird way you
need to not acknowledge it to keep
furthering it yeah so there is an
optimum amount and one has to keep in
mind the two ideas that we've made
progress but we've got huge challenges
ahead of us and just a very simple
example extreme poverty the bare minimum
that you that you need to feed your
family has been has been falling and
that's it's got to be an example of
progress in a couple of hundred years
ago you could say that probably ninety
percent of humanity was lived in extreme
poverty now it's less than ten percent
that's amazing yeah a lot of that
happened just in the last thirty years
but another way of stating the same fact
is that seven hundred thirty million
people live in extreme poverty now
that's the same fact ten percent of 7.3
billion seven hundred
that's an awful lot of miserable people
now those are the same class described
in two different ways and we got to be
able to think in both ways and let's try
to get it to zero now that's not a crazy
romantic utopian starry-eyed goal that
is one of the UN sustainable development
goals the predecessor the Millennium
Development Goals for poverty was
reached five years ahead of schedule so
the new goal in which is to eliminate
extreme poverty everywhere by 2030
probably a little too optimistic but but
not not completely crazy and maybe it'll
be instead of 0% maybe it'll be 2% and
maybe it'll be 2040 but still it's an
amazing aspiration in the first place
yeah how much of this do you think and
this a little bit gets back to the blank
slate but how much of this do you think
the way you view progress whether the
acknowledgement of progress or that you
sort of need to feel that we've made no
progress to kind of fuel yourself how
much of that do you think is just
hardwired and the way we look at the
world I think some of it comes from
certain cognitive biases one of them
being the availability heuristic named
discovered by Daniel Kahneman and Amos
Tversky namely the human mind generally
estimates probability and risk by
calling examples from memory if you've
just seen a tornado on the news then you
think that tornadoes are a major cause
of death and the fact that you know
falls off ladders kill many more people
than tornadoes doesn't register because
those don't make the news and and we
don't net naturally calibrate for how
many opportunities there are for bad
things to happen how big the world is
how many people there are we just
remember the examples and that's what
drives our intuitions and when you have
the news media reporting everything that
goes wrong everywhere then you can come
away with an impression of the world is
falling apart because all the parts of
the world that aren't falling apart
never make the news yeah that's one
there is also a we are I think
tuned to dwell on the negative probably
because bad things can hurt you a lot
more than good things can help you so
there is something adaptive in a natural
environment to you know be on the
lookout for
and kill you so that's just a survival
and that's I think it's a part of the
survival instinct there are there other
things too like the there's always
implicit competition between different
elites in society the academics the
journalists the politicians the
businesspeople the religious the
military you know they're all different
kind of power centers and they all kind
of compete with each other for prestige
and an influence and if you say society
is declining it's corrupt it's a mess
it's horrible
kind of a way of each one of these
groups can kind of feel superior to the
others the academics could say look what
the businessman the contrarian a
businessman can say look what the
politicians are doing to the country and
the challengers can say look at the
incumbents are doing and so it's it's
kind of a backhanded way of social
one-upmanship yeah do you sense that
right now we're at a unique position to
bring back more enlightenment values
like it seems to me that because of
Trump because of social media that just
everything is sort of upside down right
now this again has been a theme with a
bunch of I guess that everything is sort
of on the table and that there's great
opportunity we don't know which way it's
gonna go but there's great opportunity
for good ideas there's a great
opportunity for bad ideas obviously I
know which way we're both hoping this is
gonna yes but do you think that we
actually are in a unique moment right
now I know everyone always thinks that
they're always there they're always in a
tense moment right but do you think
there's something unique right now well
it's this way I just think that it's
kind of like inequality of a reset of
reason maybe growing that at the top
there's so many areas in which we become
so much more irrational and reasonable
like evidence-based medicine used to be
your doctor had a hunch and operated are
you gave you a drug and there's no
reason to think they would actually work
and now therapies are a value a to do in
big studies or a data-driven policing
one of the reasons that the crime rate
went down so dramatically starting in
the 90s is that the police started to
gather block by block data and where the
violence was occurring they kind of
collapsed on those areas like a ton of
bricks make sure that you know one gang
member
it just suffered a an injury wouldn't be
roaring for a revenge saying you know
we're watching you and that really drove
down the rate of crime by a lot hmm in
in sports sabermetrics and Moneyball
much more rational analysis
there's the effective altruism movement
how can we allocate charity and
volunteering so it actually does good as
opposed to just giving people a warm
glow so that all of these areas but at
the same time you get these nutball
conspiracy theories and the fake news
and the politicized denial of science
such as vaccine safety and climate
change so the question is how do we let
the standards of rationality make use
wouldn't trickle-down make it so that
that it's kind of second nature for
everyone to just not think in certain
ways because they've just been proven to
be obviously ridiculous yeah how do you
do it I mean I think that's a good I may
not be the one to you know to change a
whole society I do it by appealing to
the kind of people who watch this show
kind of people who read my books in the
hopes that it will kind of spread out
from there and we know it's not it's not
that it can't happen there are certain
bad ideas that at one point are taken
seriously and then they just drop off
and like no one talks about them ever
again you know like just you know my
lifetime when I was a kid there's a
debate over racial segregation you know
should should black students be admitted
to the University of Mississippi I mean
you just couldn't have that debate
anymore even among the farthest right or
the right yeah that's just no longer an
issue should women be allowed to to work
and in earlier decades and centuries it
was slavery or women's suffrage and
superstitions like you know alchemy or
human sacrifice so it's not hopeless
that sometimes what happens is that at
any given time there's a range of
reasonableness but that that Center
drifts so that some things that were at
the tail end of ridiculousness
even the conspiracy theory mongers and
the most benighted
can no longer take us seriously yeah how
much of this is just sort of our or the
discussion around all this is just about
our lack of patience because actually
when the when the publisher sent me the
the book I said enlightenment now and as
you guys had the font now he's bigger
than enlightenment and I thought that
was kind of interesting because we live
in a time of immediate reaction to
everything and selfies and likes and
people just don't have patience anymore
attention spans are incredibly short
that we want more now but some of these
things are just the long game yeah I
think that's it that's exactly right we
also we have amnesia for how things were
not so long ago yeah that's a point that
I make repeatedly even though there are
you know there there's a horrific war
going on now in Syria but we forget some
of the horrific wars that were going on
in the eighties and nineties yeah what
can we do to stop that amnesia cuz I
think that's a big part of this yeah and
I think the culture of journalism should
should put events of the day into some
context now I mean going back to you
know hundreds of years the American
Revolution but even just you know what
was like in the 1990s what was likely
the eighties because likewise who the
economy people are so nostalgic for the
early areas with strong unions and
predictable wages and factory jobs but
you know that was also the era of
double-digit inflation eighteen percent
inflation if you could pay the rent this
year you didn't know whether you could
pay it next year because it it could go
up by and you kind of forget about those
days long lines around the block to
their gasoline so the fear that we'd run
out of heating oil and we feel freeze in
the winter you high rates of poverty
among elderly people that have been
brought down by Social Security so are
just a commentary should look back
they're not ancient history but recent
history yeah what are some of the other
things that are that are hopeful right
now are there are other markers in
society or in science or politics are
there any other trends that you're
seeing right now that you think are
leading us to some positive places well
often you get pleasant surprises
you actually look at trends instead of
headlines mm-hmm and you and I were
talking about just off-camera about a
recent survey that showed that contrary
to the fears of a millennial generation
being intolerant of free speech and then
for that matter the society as a whole
and especially university campuses if
you actually this course this new study
anyway you actually plot the data we ask
people should people who are espousing
controversial beliefs at least be able
to save them it's actually been going up
it's higher among the college educated
than the the less college educated it
spans a range of controversial positions
it's true for Millennials as well as
baby boomers and so that what I myself
even experienced as a kind of dread and
foreboding about a whole generation
being intolerant of competing news turns
out to be probably overblown there a lot
of examples like that and there are
other positive developments I mean the
high school students protesting are
ridiculous gun safety laws that kind of
something that we couldn't have
predicted so recently the the me2
movement has had a lot of excesses and
you know I think that there's much to
criticize on the other hand it's not
okay for women to be preyed upon by
their bosses and that has suddenly
become an issue and probably the society
will on the whole change for the better
because of it I wasn't planning on going
here but since you mentioned it what
would it be a humanistic enlightened way
of looking at guns right now oh yeah
well some of it has to start with with
good data because a lot of our
stereotypes of just you know may be
right might be wrong you know on the
right they believe you have concealed
carry laws then that will reduce crime
on the left there's if we control guns
that will reduce homicide so we got to
be humble and try to get as many studies
as possible to know what will really
make a difference and what won't but in
general the idea that that we're better
off if we're we individually are not the
kind of judge or jury and executioner
right that one of the great advances of
civilization was that you out
justice to a disinterested third party
namely the court system rice and that
the idea that safety comes from
individuals defending their interests
with guns his will in fact almost
certainly has led to high rates of
violence
do you fear though that we couldn't wear
that we often give too much power to the
state I mean I think in in some areas we
do but I think the idea that people
should have guns so that they should
resist the the government you know the
kind of David Koresh and Idaho cults
that is a terrible idea the idea that we
should resist the government with with
guns I mean that's what they do in you
know in Congo that's ivali huh we have
this thing called democracy yeah so if
the government becomes too repressive we
speak out against it we vote we petition
we form organizations the idea that
we're gonna shoot back at the police I
mean that that's nuts
yeah what do you think of the state of
our democracy in general because I think
we're breaking off into these different
factions now where I mean I think some
people genuinely think that you know
this hashtag resistance that were under
this horrific authoritarian regime we
think we don't even have to get into
trumpet specifically if you don't want
but what do you think of just sort of
the the the systems that are in place
the branches of government all of the
the documents that founded this are they
doing all right at the moment so so you
know there are a lot of we by any
standards of world history we live in
fantastic freedom yeah you know I could
say that you know Trump is a and
he's a fascist and I don't worry about
being put in jail and that's a real
something to take yeah not to take for
granted if I said the equivalent in
Turkey I would be put in jail or in
Venezuela is that a little bit of the
short memory on some of the other things
why you need to know history because I
think that all the time I see these guys
all over Twitter vidiians it's amazing
yeah you can say whatever you really can
and we should not take that for granted
it's partly history but also partly
comparisons across countries and then
history remembering fascism and
communist
and looking at regions today like like
turkey and Venezuela and Russia there's
that it the what's not so healthy is
like gerrymandering that obviously
subvert a subversion of democracy the
effects of lobbying and campaign
contributions from the the wealthiest
that can't be a good idea the fact that
our elections dragged on for a year and
depends so much on on a cash is a
problem and there are government
bureaucracies that have gotten too big
and too too many regulations that don't
actually do anything beneficial I don't
think that means that's a call for just
reducing regulation you know that with a
meat cleaver because some regulations
really have done done good we've got
cleaner air we've got less poverty but
we should at least analyze what
government programs are cost-effective
and which ones are just a nuisance and a
drag yeah and even having that
conversation then gets people crazed
where I personally I come from it from a
little more of a libertarian perspective
and I would usually say that these days
we've got people like Alan musk that can
get us to Mars and that can help clean
the environment and green energy and all
of those things where I know there's
just another set of people that think
well we just can't leave it to the
industrialists we have to leave it to
the government that's at least a place
where we can have some respectful yes
agreement that's a that's a great place
to that's the conversation we should be
having and I my views that there has to
be a mix of policy and regulation and a
private enterprise I and and all and
with all the creativity and innovation
and bottom-up diversity that so an
example would be one thing that the
government can do and that private
[Music]
joining me today is a Johnstone family
professor in the Department of
Psychology at Harvard University as well
as a New York Times bestselling author
whose new book enlightenment now is for
sale right now Steven Pinker welcome to
the Rubin report thank you I am I am
thrilled to have you here I think I have
emailed or called or contacted or pigeon
messaged everyone related to you or that
knows you in any way to get you here and
Here I am and here you are worked it
goes to prove that a little positivity I
think can make some things happen so
true yeah all right a lot I want to talk
to you about I thought before we dive
into the book and and all the the things
that you teach and write about and all
that I just I like hearing a little bit
about people's history and where they
come from and growing up and all that
you are Canadian and I've had a lot of
Canadians on lately I find there's
something about Canadians in general
that I like what is it about Canadians
that leads to a certain Pleasant
disposition well we're so reasonable or
so yeah
alight yeah sometimes people say think
the model of Canada's peace order and
good government yes and it's a country
that is that has been diverse for for
quite some time
Quebec where I grew up has
english-speaking community in a
french-speaking community and we we
didn't begin with a revolution unlike
the United States and we negotiated our
way to independence we're part of the
British Empire in the British
Commonwealth and kind of have that
British reserve and politeness yeah so
that we have we have some things going
for us a couple of things going yeah at
least until at least all the Americans
end up moving up there if things keep
going this way well the way we might
build a wall yeah right you guys may end
up building the wall exactly tell me a
little bit about growing up your family
what kind of family you grew up in in
the english-speaking section of Montreal
in Monroe it was pretty segregated when
I grew up I grew up in a Jewish
english-speaking community which was
known for producing among others Leonard
Cohen who is a contemporary
my mother's mhm the author Mordecai
Richler who was a contemporary of my
father's William Shatner Burt Bacharach
Wow
the Saul Bellow spitters person his
childhood in Montreal so it's a small
community that has a number of people
that were proud of yeah what do you make
of that that so many I mean that's a
pretty diverse interesting group of
people right there and I'm sure there
are others yeah I it it may just be that
having many cultural influences both
Canada's really couldn't dominated by
the United States it really is the
800-pound gorilla next door yeah so is
the American influence the British
influence the French influence perhaps
is just being in a cosmopolitan diverse
community know that help with that and
of course the the Jewish influence
although it was not I didn't grow up in
none of the people that I mentioned grew
up in an ultra-orthodox community high
grew up in a in a reformed temple we
didn't take God all that seriously but
we did take Jewish identity seriously
yeah I don't remember a moment in which
I decided oh I'm an atheist I just was
not a big issue one day or another do
you find that to be sort of standard
thing with most secular Jews I think
that's sort of East the ones that I've
been talking to on this show that I
think are sort of out there more that
seems to be thing that there's an ethnic
identity or a cultural identity that's
separate from the belief part absolutely
and I think that's more true of Judaism
than it is of say Catholicism where the
belief really is stipulated in Judaism
this is a bit of a kind of Don't Ask
Don't Tell as long as you have a though
as long as we pay the laws and rituals
right if you keep the Sabbath if you
have you know mots on Passover then
you're a good Jew and what you believe
is just not as important what one rabbi
said to my wife rebecca goldstein
another secular Jew mm-hmm well-known a
secular humanist writer when she talked
about her novel 36 arguments for the
existence of God a work of fiction which
is kind of the great I said and she
spoke at a Jewish Community Center and I
was a little worried whether there'd be
some pushback from the rabbi who
introduced to him afterwards he went
over he said you know there's nothing in
Judaism that says you have to believe in
God you just can't believe in more than
one of
that's I mean that's pretty perfect do
you think there's a there's an inherent
problem they're sort of disconnecting
God from reason if it really is well
just for the longevity of it let's say
oh yeah yeah it's a good question I
think that may have been part of the
explanation for why I mean there's so
many secular Jewish intellectuals kind
of immersed in argument dispute ation
particularly about morals and ethics but
without a bit but it was all argument
disputation it wasn't a catechism that
you had to recite there wasn't a set of
beliefs that you I have to have so there
was a tradition of disputation that's
what the rabbi's were famous for right
at the pill pole thing here splitting
and and maybe that was a contributor as
well but I went to public schools I went
and in fact when you go to public
schools in Quebec when I in my childhood
meant you had two Protestant schools
because it was divided along religious
lines they were Protestant schools and
Catholics so interesting Protestant
meant on Catholic basically everyone
else yeah who do Muslims and the Jews
and Chinese and so on there's a bizarre
system yeah how's how he just hadn't lis
unconstitutional in this country oh my
god I got to I actually got a pretty
serious Protestant religious education I
sang hymns we said the Lord's Prayer
every day I learned about the life of
Jesus so they had the Jews and the
Muslims and everyone in the getting a
Protestants yeah
and at one point I remember I was you
know eight and nine and I actually
didn't even belong to a temple I said so
it's my mother
you know one of my friends said that
that Jews aren't supposed to believe in
Jesus should I not believe in Jesus
anymore after you sent me their Hebrew
school so fast made my head spin
hilarious and him my teachers because
they couldn't hire Catholic teachers
either and virtually everyone in Quebec
is a francophone community or Catholics
it's actually hired Algerian and
Tunisian and moroccan jews to teach
French to the Jewish and Protestant kids
of Montreal the parson Kizza Montreal
did not learn French from native
québécois we learned it from Egyptian
and Tunisian immigrants how bizarre it
was I'm pretty sure I know the subject
of your next book I mean it's
like there's just so much richness just
in that or at least there's a little
comedy in there so I think it sounds
like your family was kind of on the
intellectual side or at least that the
county was red house was full of books
and magazines my my father was had a law
degree but didn't practice when I was a
child he was a and had a little bit of
real estate did sales before starting a
law practice pretty late in life my
mother was like most mothers of the 50s
and 60s a homemaker but then found a
career when she was kind of getting
bored when I became a guidance counselor
and then a vice principal of a high
school and and my mother Roslyn Pinker
very intellectual an intense reader
knows everything intellectually very
engaged yeah and my sister Susan de is a
columnist for The Wall Street Journal
certain have been in a couple of books
one on sex differences one on
face-to-face contact my brother Rob so I
work for the Canadian government for
several decades as a policy analyst and
an administrator so how much of the
intellectual pursuits that you all have
do you think is is biological versus
just learned experience yeah this is one
of the themes that keeps coming up
around these conversations and and it is
was a topic of my book the blank slate
in the modern denial of human nature
yeah
the blank slate being the metaphor that
I argued became kendama Nate and
intellectual life largely for political
reasons yeah can you explain that a
little bit for the people that don't
know the book yeah so the the blank
slate the modern denial of human nature
just was released in 2016 with an
afterword was about the idea that that
there is no such thing as human nature
that we are blank slates written on by
our parents by by the culture by
education and that there's no innate
human traits or ways of learning and
thinking it's it's you can program a
human however you want and I argue that
it was popular in the 20th century for
political reasons one of them being that
it seems like the ultimate way to
achieve equality you know
overall zero then zero equals zero
equals zero so we all have to be equal
right I argue this is a mistake in the
book that equality is really a legal and
moral principle to treat everyone
equally it's not really the belief that
we're all clones home like slates and a
lot of the book tried to both lay out
the science of human nature but also to
explore the political and emotional and
moral baggage and coloring and to try to
clarify it and so the difference between
equality of treatment and equality of of
our biological endowment was a major
theme that also course enters into
discussion of sex differences hmm where
one of the reasons that certain
intellectual factions certain parts of
feminism want to deny that there are any
sex differences they think well that
will make it impossible to discriminate
because there's nothing to discriminate
we're all exactly this board exactly the
same right
and I do that's a big big mistake
there's first of all there is a lot of
evidence that men and women aren't
identical in all traits yeah I mean I'm
not a scientist but I think there is a
lot of everything I think anyone who's
had a son and a daughter has been in a
heterosexual relationship yeah anyone
who's listen to gossip about anyone
talking about anyone else yeah many
women aren't really not this is not
exactly the same but I think the myth
that they're the same was introduced for
political purposes namely that would
make discrimination irrational right
because there's no nothing to
discriminate on and I argue that that
you know that's just a error in logic I
strongly believe in gender equity that
no one should be prejudged because
they're a man or a woman
partly because of a scientific fact that
there's a huge overlap between the sexes
in any trait you want to look at so you
can predict an individual's traits just
knowing that they're a man or a woman
but they the policy we should be fair
doesn't require the false belief that
were the same that we are single what's
the best have you heard any argument for
that belief that you thought made any
sense or you just for which belief or
the idea that that this that these
genders are equal like when because you
must hear this from other academics
right I mean we know
that some of this stuff is being taught
at schools yeah well there are you know
there's no doubt that there are there's
a normal enormous overlap there's no
doubt and and some of the differences
between the sexes are are pretty small
and and subtle so in say mathematical
ability which was one of the most
controversial claims about sex
differences it it could it went to a
huge firestorm when Larry Summers the
president of Harvard mentioned that
differences between the sexes might
explain why the number of engineering
professors at Harvard at MIT what wasn't
50/50 down the line male/female yeah
this is very much like the the James
d'amour situation with with Google it is
exactly it's almost it's almost a replay
yeah and and it isn't easy in fact it
would be hard to say that men and women
are better at math in general it's you
have to even drill down to certain sub
components like mentally rotating
three-dimensional objects that men are
clearly better at but women are better
at word problems in arithmetic and math
so it's a so some of the pushback is
that in fact the science is often
complicated you can't make a sweeping
across the board generalization yeah and
then the other kind of pushback for
people who defend the blank slate is
well yeah that's true of you know 2002
when your book came out but society is
changing and you know more women are
consuming porn and more women are having
multiple sexual partners and maybe the
differences say in sexuality aren't due
to human nature but just due to our
culture at a particular moment that may
become obsolete and that seems
incredibly dangerous to me to view it
that way
well maybe although you know you could
in some ways it's actually highly
progressive and even correct because you
could have said you know 70 years ago
women you don't want to go into the
professions they they want to stay home
with the kids and and housework and
that's what makes them complete and
satisfied and happy and there'll be all
you know neurotic and anxious if they
start to become lawyers and doctors and
we know from the course of history that
you know that's not true that when as
soon as the doors open women did pour
through the doors
and so that would be an example where
too strong a claim of biological
differences would have been refuted by
the facts of history so it's not a slam
dunk I mean it is something that has to
be examined on a case-by-case basis are
you shocked at how difficult it is to
talk about all of this without getting
yourself yourself or any of the people
that talk about it into hot water yeah
because you want that you have to go
through here as I can see you're you're
quite well-versed at you're probably the
best at it it's a lot to make sure that
somebody can't pinpoint that one line
but then they're gonna just you know
drag you for exactly right well and the
reason that I wrote the blank slate was
it wasn't so much
I have chapter on gender but the point
wasn't just to review the literature on
gender differences it was also to say
okay so what how does it matter for our
public debates mm-hmm and I also
documented in the book how even when the
book first came out there was a history
of people being deep platformed and
shouted down and called you know all
kinds of nasty names for for the view
that were not blank slates and I said
well look this is based on on emotion
based on bad politics not based on the
facts so I kind of I don't know if I'm
honest leading myself but I laid out all
of these political controversies so I
wasn't blundering into it naive I was
actually that was actually the subject
of the book right sometimes though that
that can't fully defend you there i an't
and in fact both larry summers and jamie
d'amour yeah they almost could have
taken their speeches and indicated in
case of larry summers partly did from
the chapter on gender in the book so I
managed to escape some trouble that
people who then repeated the arguments
got into trouble for yeah so it's
interesting you sort of laid out a case
beforehand to defend yourself you did
like sort of a preemptive strike exactly
where someone both of those guys I know
James I know James personally needs been
in here whereas like he sort of stumbled
into this thing and then the the
reaction the way it sorted out it just
becomes this bigger beast that you end
up fighting when you were just really
trying to talk about science well the
science I I wasn't just talking about
the science because I was talking about
first the science then what are the
political and moral Indonesian
which I thought got confused feeding
back on people trying to shoehorn the
science into a politically correct
position because they were kind of lazy
when it came to the politics you know I
don't believe in I obviously I don't
believe in discrimination against anyone
and but the point being that having that
belief doesn't mean that you have to
insist that were blank slates right and
I made that argument for other
controversies around human nature like
do we have any violent impulses where
there's there there's a kind of
political argument for a different
reason maybe people think well if we're
innately violent then we're kind of
doomed to war and forever and if you try
to reduce war you're just some romantic
peace Nick and it's hopeless and war is
in human nature therefore since war is
bad
and if we're violent then we'll always
have war we can't be violent and I argue
that's that too is illogical
we do have violent impulses I think
that's pretty clear but it's not all we
have we also have have the Faculty of
self-control we also have empathy we
have cognitive processes of
problem-solving so we can figure out how
that we can reduce war we've got moral
norms they're just certain things you
don't do and the fact that part of us is
violent doesn't mean we're doomed to
violence because part of us pushes back
on the violence I cited a statistic
that's that three-quarters of men and
60% of women at least once have had a
homicidal fantasy it imagined killing
something they don't like three-quarters
of men and 60% of ask yeah and and when
I introduced this fact in lecture and I
say well what does this tell us about
human nature tells us that
three-quarters of men are liars but but
I point at this this doesn't mean that
trying to increase peace is futile
because there are other parts of human
nature we can work with and of course
that was what led to my more recent book
the better angels of our nature and they
said not only is it possible it's
happened yeah but again that it's kind
of the the nexus between the political
on the one hand and the scientific on
the other that I was exploring and I
talked about how the people
who thought they were advocates of peace
tried to squash all evidence that people
have violent impulses because it was
just politically too uncomfortable and I
said that's first of all distorting the
science is never a good idea and is if
they clear about the politics then the
science doesn't even mean that we've got
to accept war yeah so for someone that
sort of insulated themselves from some
of this because you were doing the work
beforehand which is actually pretty
brilliant tactic are you afraid that the
hard sciences are going to be hit by all
of this identity politics stuff in a
bigger way than we're seeing right now
when it comes to to gender or race or
any of these issues it's not even so
much the hard sciences but the social
sciences well we know the social
sciences yeah haven't happened yet yeah
but you don't fear that it's gonna come
for the hard sciences too well there
there may be some aspects of genetics
and brain science that are that if
they're feeling the political pressure
[Music]
you guys know that I try my best to stay
out of the day-to-day political
bickering and focus more on Big Ideas
and the philosophies which are behind
all the fighting this doesn't mean I'm
ignoring the issues of the moment be in
North Korea the gun debate or the
general state of trumpism but focusing
on why people believe what they believe
is far more valuable to me than adding
fuel to the fire of whatever the story
of the day might be toss in a healthy
dose of political gridlock and we seem
to have lots of people who are yelling
but very few people who are doing
there's one issue happening in American
politics right now which is a great
example of the stagnation we face but
that is totally flying under the radar
right now dozens of countries some of
them key strategic allies don't have
u.s. ambassadors because the Senate has
refused to vote on their confirmation
according to the rules of the Senate
right now the Senate needs 30 hours of
debate to confirm an ambassadorship you
can imagine with all the nonsensical
waste in d.c how impossible it would be
to spend 30 hours debating each of the
new ambassadorships when a new
administration comes in we'd be talking
about literally thousands of hours of
debate for a branch of government which
can't seem to agree on which flavor of
yogurt should be served at the Capitol
Hill commissary back in 2014 when the
Democrats controlled the Senate then
Majority Leader Harry Reid used what is
known as the nuclear option to get many
Obama appointees through the Senate in
effect Reid changed the rules so that a
simple majority rather than a 60-vote
supermajority would be enough to confirm
ambassadors federal judges and other
positions though I was firmly on the
Left at the time and I had no issue I
can remember with the Obama appointees I
was against Reid using such a drastic
tactic to me if you change the rules
when you're in power it's incredibly
obvious and probably quite deserved when
those same rules will be used against
your team when you're not in power you
can rightly blame Republicans for not
voting on the Obama appointees in 2014
just as right now you can rightly blame
Democrats for not voting on Trump
appointees in 2018
this is exactly
why people rightfully hate the political
machine in Washington it either does
nothing or it changes the rules to suit
itself while usually leaving the people
it's supposed to serve far behind the
Republicans now led by Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell could use what is known
as the nuclear option right now just as
Reid and the Democrats did back in 2014
for whatever reason though McConnell
refuses to do so some are saying he has
such an old-school affinity for the
rules of the Senate that he doesn't want
to stoop to what Reid did in a certain
way this seems like a principled
position but at this point in American
politics
I wonder if clinging on to the old ways
while your ideological opponents chisel
away at those very institutions at every
opportunity
makes much sense at all let me add
another wrinkle to this story the
highest-ranking ambassadorship that we
now have open germany has been offered
to former US spokesman for the UN
Richard Grinnell Richard is the
longest-serving UN spokesman in history
working for four different u.s.
ambassadors he's also served several
other positions in the government as
well as worked for a few other
high-level political campaigns by every
measure he's supremely qualified and
I've seen plenty of people on both sides
of the aisle that praise him as the
exact type of person that we need more
of in politics Richard and I have become
friends over the past few years and I
can personally tell you that he's truly
a decent guy who just wants to serve his
country oh and there's one other piece
to this Richard happens to be gay you
may remember back in 2012
Richard was briefly a spokesman for the
Romney campaign until the media decided
to attack an openly gay man for daring
to work for the Republican candidate
Mitt Romney thus causing Richard to step
down from the campaign because he didn't
want to be a distraction apparently
although Romney felt it was just fine to
hire a gay man and Richard felt it was
totally okay to work for Romney the
media just wouldn't let it be gay
conservatives like Richard much like
black conservatives like Larry elder or
female conservatives like nikki Haley
challenge the orthodoxy that the
Democrats must own all of these groups
of people I mentioned Richard sexuality
not because it's in
horton or even relevant unless you play
the identity politics game as so many do
in effect the Democrats are blocking an
extremely qualified openly gay man from
serving his country aren't the Democrats
and lefties supposed to be for gays
isn't that part of their intersectional
worldview immutable characteristics
often Trump qualifications if you
subscribe to this line of thinking
shouldn't this also mean supporting gay
people whose political positions you
might disagree with because you believe
in their ability to think for themselves
or perhaps the so-called tolerance ID
really isn't Pro gay or Pro any minority
they are actually only Pro those who
believe as they do now obviously you
know that I don't think anyone should be
confirmed because of their sexuality nor
should their sexuality matter in the
least when it comes to being nominated
in the first place I just think that
this particular case is interesting on
so many levels we have the gridlock of
Washington with Democrats refusing to
vote on Trump nominees we have a
majority leader in McConnell that
refuses to use his option to confirm
nominees even though the previous Senate
leader Reid did exactly just that we
have dozens of qualified candidates
waiting to do their civic duty and we
have just as many countries waiting for
our ambassadors to move there and get to
work caught in all of this mess is a
good man Richard Grinnell who I happen
to know personally who doesn't want
extra credit for being gay but just
wants to get to work how can you make a
difference in all this call your local
senator and ask their assistant at the
office why they aren't voting on these
nominees and you can also call Mitch
McConnell at his DC office by calling
two oh two two two four two five four
one actually I'm gonna give him a call
right now
[Music]
joining me today is a guy who's seen an
awful lot of people get hit in the nuts
a man who's lives in a house that
constantly seems to be getting fuller
and a stand-up comic who's new special
zero-to-sixty is now streaming on Amazon
Bob Saget welcome to the Reuben report
thank you
I'm excited to be here you're a very
smart man I cannot keep up with you
mentally but we did have dinner and I
seem to keep up with the entrees is that
why you were applying me with so much
alcohol during dinner - kind of dumb me
down no I just said that we could get on
the level I wanted to see what you were
like unconscious yeah we did good
because that's the world Britain right
now that's an opposite day kind of
statement in other words years ago when
you would say I want to see what you're
like unconscious that would be a joke
but unfortunately we are in a world
right now where that's actually happened
so a lot of things that are irreverent
and could be considered funny or not
yeah and so there's this buffering that
goes on before but either way you did
not get overly inebriated and you were
more than pleasant and we had a lovely
night with both of our significant
others who we both adore and we laughed
and and we had good food yeah now we
will do it again we will do it again and
that's all I want to talk about but I
don't wanna talk about my career what do
we have as entree well I believe I had
the fish you did I think you had
something not as healthy date I think it
was maybe no I didn't know you didn't
say you had some kind of chicken
something maybe all right let's focus
here Saget come here that's a good place
to start what you just did there just
the state of political correctness let's
just do a little bit on that and then I
want to do Saget 101 all right for this
next hour I'm teaching that course at a
community college yeah yeah how many
kids are taking it it doesn't matter
whoever applies that doesn't turn me in
he let him Wally
everybody comes in yeah send a trailer
what do you think of that you're doing
this we're live to tape so right we
don't edit and this did not exist four
years ago this existed but it didn't
exist like this I mean you got millions
of people that watch this yeah this is
crazy
what do you think about that like you're
used to doing I mean obviously I want to
talk stand-up and everything else but
you do scripted series yes you do
movies things like that but you also do
you do panel on talk shows things that
are sort of they're kind of old-school
now like that's very different than
coming in here and right before we
started I said to you we're just gonna
go for it you were like whatever you
want I mean I don't have to look I can
just do that yeah you can yeah where you
get a little bit back again those are
the smallest cards I've ever seen your
interviews of microfiche it's just I
just write little silly things no that
looks all smart yeah I I love the fact
that this exists because years ago if
you wanted to go on a show and have a
one-on-one with someone it was you were
a baby but it was Tom Schneider
maybe all of you do oh yeah getting that
that you might be tiny bit older than a
baby yeah the camera was always very
close to his incredibly close at Dan
Aykroyd on Sarah Night Live and the very
beginning we know an impression of it
yeah and was this tight and he would be
smoking and tom was just talking to
camera yeah do his discourse which is
very much like a podcast is today like
Bill burr friend of mine gets up in the
morning talks for an hour once a week
it's unbelievable to listen to a lot of
our great podcasters that's the
everything has changed and in that
regard this has changed for the better
because you get to have an articulate
conversation that you can't normally
have in commercial television because
commercial television is meant to be
entertaining yeah only I don't know what
we're meant to be over here well
interesting interesting I guess yeah and
my fiancee Kelly turned me on to your
show and I said I really like him and I
like what he's talking about and you had
guests on and you were ever you're able
to be a diplomat which is very difficult
to do when you have people with
different points of view a conservative
and and a liberal which I don't
understand I don't understand any of it
yeah I just mean I understand it but I
mean we were mammals yeah we're supposed
to live yeah we're supposed to be nice
to another mammal not supposed to hunt
it and kill it depends which kind of
mammal you are at if it's delicious
yeah then you have to go for it right
yeah it's just food well we're gonna
we're gonna dive into all that because I
did note
that for you it's interesting I think
because your stand-up is so different
than your your television persona
between America's Funniest Home Video is
in Flast well they're the old ones
though but yeah an entourage that kinda
like a thing but then but then I did a
bunch of acting stuff too and I've done
Broadway work which was some of it was
similar to my stand-up but I've always
done something that's every 7 years
there's some new incarnation that people
go who the hell is he yeah well that's
why I think it's interesting because
especially with celebrities people like
to just get in or anyone that's public
that they like to just get a kind of
image of you and then just run with that
forever and you're instantly challenged
and Kelly I used to be pigeonholed
because it sounds like something you
should not do to a pigeon now see that's
the kind of joke you guys still do you
can still do that because it's not a
human being
yeah it's a pigeon yeah the only people
are gonna be really upset about that
would be the Humane Society yeah and
they are right the ASPCA is all over the
show
they're just haven't I don't see their
name anywhere anymore I think they're
out you think they're done I don't know
I think it's the ASPCA NRA
I think it's they've combined so that
you take care of the bird and the new
fire at it it's that gonna fly well on
this show I think it will you know we've
got those chickens out there and one day
people always happen what are you gonna
do when they stop laying eggs are you
just women but they're so beautiful I
thought they were males because they had
the red millet malay malay was to call
me and we're very excited to say cockle
I said you have three beautiful
but no those are actually those are
female hens that lay eggs and what are
you doing this for the eggs not just
test Woody Allen yeah which was Groucho
Marx I need the eggs I need the eggs but
that's yeah Annie Hall that's the truth
all right go ahead hi this is the
problem with me as a talk show guest as
a comedian yeah and as someone without a
script I free associate and I sometimes
do not stay on track but you are so
smart and linear you were going to keep
me on track and I will do my very best
to accommodate all right will do my best
to accommodate you okay this is fair
let's start at the beginning you are
born in Phil
Delphia I was yeah and Einstein Hospital
Einstein Hospital yes and it is still
there is that an honor of Albert
Einstein it is huh
it is and it's on Broad Street and and I
was born there and my dad worked for a
supermarket company called Food Fair
pantry pride supermarkets and he was a
meat executive that all sounds legit
what about your family what what
background what business were they in I
was born in Brooklyn grew up in Long
Island lived in Manhattan my whole life
went to college upstate New York so I'm
a true New Yorker so we're both you had
the life I wish I had yeah I was in
Philly I lived at home during college
you had it you had that's why you're
smart and I go out and tell a bunch of
wiener jokes I know but I'm going back
into that now as you know you are you're
gonna stand up I told you I'm going back
in this and you were very excited I'm
excited you also told me you're playing
the Irvine improv yeah and when is that
oh that wasn't even public till just now
that's great okay to say back to April
8th my first headlining gig in 10 years
and this is one of the nicest clubs in
Los Angeles and in in anywhere really I
mean it's it's like six hundred people
seven hundred people it looks like a
spaceship it looks like a Disney exhibit
and it's it's an Irvine which is why
they call it the armed by an improv and
I couldn't put that together why do they
call the Irvine improv and there's but I
don't know but there's smart people and
and nice people there you will bring
smart people because you you have so
many people that you will bring your
audience which is that's the advantage
of what we do yeah whatever we do
whatever media we're on
that's who comes to see us that's got to
be the most beautiful shift in comedy
right do you remember that moment when
you went from like being a guy that was
just you know trying to get on 8th out
of ten comics at the end of the night
nobody knows you are do you remember the
beginning of when people were going I'm
going to see Bob Saget something weird
happened with meit which was I started
doing stand-up when I was 17 and I want
to were that that was a human 73 Wow so
because I'm 104 on the freeway look at
that head of hair though for 100
dope very umbra but I had to do the
drops I take the thing I take
propecia that's push on the propecia he
seems fine oh please don't compare me to
that that's the hair we'll get there
we'll get my sonic comb-over yeah I know
it's gonna happen if we get right on
Trump I actually I I believe but I don't
wanna I'm not doing I'm not doing
anything to bash anyone I will not do it
even though it's possible that his
comb-over is from an onion in the
kitchen that just snaggletooth along the
ground and then crawls up his back yeah
did you see that moment I saw that video
on the airplane yes that done CGI was
that done with effects because that
doesn't look possible it looked pretty
it look pretty fake but let's let's
write with Trump aside I want to talk
Stan yes because do you remember that
moment when when things change yeah what
happened was I came out to LA I went I
had won the Student Academy Award for a
documentary I made about my nephew who
had his face reconstructed when he was
seven and I won this student Academy
Award for documentary and then I went on
at The Comedy Store the next night and
mid to the owner of the Comedy Store
said you should work here so I started
getting spots right away Wow and then I
started then she posed a fight for that
people fight and I didn't work the door
Wow
and I was I guess likeable but strange
very strange jokes like my first joke
was I have the first show I have the
brain of a German Shepherd and the body
of a 16 year old boy and they're both on
my car and I want you to see them now
it's just an odd rambling but it
symbolizes I think it answers the
question of how did he become this
because he was that yeah you're gonna be
third person on myself yeah but and then
I started going on a college tour she
put me on a committee sure for the
comedy stuff put me on a college tour
and I was a guitar act just two parodies
and I would sing while my guitar gently
weeps turn a valve and water poured out
of the guitar and you could only see it
in the first ten rows so it doesn't
really do work for the big stage cannot
play the Irvine improv with this bit
yeah and then I was headlining right
away so in my early 20s I'd go out on
the road while I was taking five years
of acting classes with a teacher named
Darrell Hickman
in LA while I was doing improv classes
at The Groundlings while I was doing
spots at The Comedy Store I'd go out on
the road and then headline and then make
money but not enough to get a career and
then I was like eight nine years of
hosting the Comedy Store in Westwood and
and that was hard it was but I got to
befriend people that I worshiped which
were Richard Pryor Robin Williams and
David Letterman was one of my first MCS
and and so I was 22 years old and this
the place was it's packed like it was
then kind of now bad sentence but in the
early 80s
it was you could not get in to any room
and every single person on the lineup
was like and I was hosting a lot of the
shows so but then everybody went off and
got TV shows and I was still at the
comedy store hosting and thinking this
is it I'm never gonna make it and then I
got in a Richard Pryor movie and then I
[Music]
all right Saget we did career that was
it that was my career is just beginning
literally our career ended my career
completely it ended
we never got best fuller house / no we
did Benjamin we're good we did Benjamin
we you know we got weird all this stuff
coming yeah we didn't even talk about
half-baked
but we'll just know that we'll just say
that it never actually did that in real
life my love never did the real life you
know got it okay all right let's talk I
just want to about politician just kind
of what you think is going on in the
world because that's what you do here
that is what I do here but even though I
only know you a little bit from the
conversation we had at dinner I got just
got a sense that like you actually
you're obviously very sensitive like
that's pretty clear I'm overly sensitive
little like you want people to be
treated well and fair ever think of
myself as a liberal must be well what
did I think I look at myself as a
humanist I was on a plane the other day
which no comedians ever said and the
gentleman was on the plane and he had
and he was about 60 years old and he
seemed like a successful businessman of
some kind and I was in the first class
section because there was a cat back in
coach it was a cat for a case you get
sick she had her security animal to keep
her what do you call those animal the
you know special animal yeah the may use
special needs
yeah animo or whatever but I'm a deathly
allergic so I was up front I know cats
do same thing so I was saying to this
gentleman and he had on big bright red
america-first
shirt and so if I was a I guess a what
you brand as a liberal I guess that
shirt would bother me but I just looked
at the guy and he seemed like a nice guy
I didn't I just said do you have an
allergy to cats he went no my wife's got
a cat I said so you have a cat ago no my
wife has a cat and when we laughed a
little bit and
what it said on a shirt on his shirt
isn't a shirt I would wear it's not
where I'm at I mean I do believe I do
believe I love America I believe that
where you live you want to put first you
want to take care of your people you
want to take care of your hometown oh
you're coming out with that far-right
craziness or you want to take care of
your country oh but down the narrow
narrow down down down down down but I
don't but I'm not if you're if you're
kind and you're not out doing some
closet hatred or blatant hatred I don't
know but I just look at my dad's whole
thing was be kind to people so it sounds
like a pacifist might bother people but
that's what we're supposed to do yeah is
the problem with that that you just get
nipped off by both sides I mean I see
that a lot now that I do think there's
this interesting Center developing I
don't even know other's sides I mean I
of course not yeah of course I do
yeah but you know and the and people go
well you're a Democrat right now I'm
like I'll vote for anybody that can get
us out of this mess
you know I bring my dad back from the
grave and vote for him he'd be such a
good candidate a living a Grateful Dead
video yeah I don't know
try agree where are you when you
consider yourself a liberal is that
where you are yeah I still consider
myself a liberal but most of the liberal
things that I believe in I can pretty
much explain from a libertarian
perspective right and that I just don't
want the government involved in my life
that's it and I think you should live
your life however you see fit and I'll
live mine however I see fit like you
have a lot more money than me right fair
to say I don't know but we're gonna do
spreadsheet exams right after this is
over let's be clear I'm on YouTube
you've been on network television you've
got three chickens outside I don't have
three chickens I don't know their value
but you could have chickens the point is
I don't deserve any of your stuff just
because you make more money than me
right I can't have any of your money it
would be nice I suppose but I don't
deserve any but that's what taxes are
about and that's where our incredibly
rich society and our incredibly
poor society are at odds with each other
and that has been since the beginning of
time since you know castles were built
with a dictator and a king living in it
yeah and everybody had to go build all
this stuff and they were slaves so I
mean it's it does it the metaphor
doesn't change the representation
doesn't change that the downtrodden are
downtrodden and are disgruntled and then
other people are angry at things that
that they should just take a freaking
chill pill over yeah
well that cuts an outrage thing well
there's a lot to be outraged over also
because all the the problem with you
know wanting to entertain people was
wanting to be a comedian is it's nearly
impossible when there's so many deaths
when there's so many tragic things
happening which there always have been
but we are at a news ratio where it's
coming at us you just you know you hit
your computer on and it says you know
news alert and you hit news alert and
you're like you're afraid to hit the
button you're afraid to get up at the
Morton and hit whatever news service you
yeah go to so that's just a matter of us
knowing about it more because I have
Steven Pinker on next week who's a
Harvard psychologist who and his whole
argument is actually that things are
better than they've ever been abusing
empirical scientific evidence about the
amount of people that are being exposed
quicker well because we actually have
more people out of poverty now worldwide
than ever before more people with
drinkable water than ever before more
people that live in mobile environment
Enlightenment values and everywhere but
we see more people with drinkable water
yeah more than not around the world no
way around the world more now than ever
before
well that might be true is that our we
hundred percent that's true I'm pretty
sure that's true but what about what
about more people being murdered what
about the safety of our kids what about
you know all these things over but
Gonzo's most of those markers actually
they're better than ever before
it's just that we hear about them all
the time now right and we obsess over
them not and we and we obsess over the
negative yeah because we're now
presented the positive and if we're
presented the positive it's through a
skewed broadcast it's it's it's not
really presented by someone that
comforts you this show comforts you more
than most shows because of the way you
handle it
that's just a fact this is you're trying
to watch use several times you're trying
to put two factions together that might
have similar or opposed views discussing
opposed views and are saying why can't
it be like this because if you try to go
toward an idealistic goal the dream of
it is how you can almost get there
that's that's how the country was
founded besides you know taking a lot of
things away from the people that lived
here that's a whole other show that
you've got three in your yard
pretty good so I just try to get you out
of this now yeah I'm not really
politically astute but did I make any
sense yeah well you are making some
sense but I think you actually are I
mean you're around Mara all the time
well that must be I saw just last night
and he said Aloha cuz we were in Hawaii
together yeah but I do say that I'd
rather get my news from you know from
John Oliver and and Bill Maher and
Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers and
Jimmy Kimmel then the newscasters what
does that tell you about just media we
we need a relief and so the news itself
is already a parody and it's also so
obsessive no matter where it's coming
from and we're also dealing with a
regime which flip-flops in the media and
on Twitter faster than I then its ever
existed because we never had a president
tweet us you know this just did we did I
mean Obama did but right but it wasn't
it was it like I hate this I love this
you know
18:21 you know 21:18 it's like you're in
Vegas yeah you know just double down do
you see him as the problem though or is
a symptom because I
really see well I think that the symptom
he is a symptom it was it was voting for
a guy that was on a show that said
you're fired so what do you expect to
get you know if you're gonna if you're
gonna get the host of America's Got
Talent
you're gonna get the most out of people
it's good to be the the best procession
ever it could be dancers and singers and
yeah if you had been the president
people would be getting big jokes no you
you would from me I guarantee you a dick
joke a day and I would tweet them and
not three in the morning I do not tweet
well three in the morning no one should
know well no one except the president
because but but I just think you know
what did we expect but I think a lot of
people were surprised and I think it
doesn't matter it's happening yeah and
this is it and so we want a better
humanity and there are great people in
the world and there are great people in
other countries leading the world the
best they can and there's a lot of
slackers and there's other people that
are just part of the political bunch of
crap but they're still great people and
there's great people watching this
there's nice people watching your show
yeah you're a nice person nice people
you don't I don't think you get a lot of
haters do you get I having a ridiculous
amount of haters you do yeah because I
talk about the problems that I see with
the modern-day left and the Liberals and
they don't like someone to address those
things that was once one of them but I
got this great fake manner why can't
they they don't fall don't fall for that
well I'm like a perfect shrink come on
could you could calm me down through
tightrope walking that was because we
slipped a little thing in your water
there is something in my water I'm
feeling different yes notice the tone is
change I'm not leaving I'm on the show
tomorrow are the walls vibrating it oh
yeah oh I bet he's moved in yeah there
anyone that is an eye chart behind you
you know that it says Los Angeles but
it's an eye chart
pretty clever huh yeah that's really it
we call that art well done Mr
Bond pretty good is there anyone that
you're paying attention to these days
that you
he's making some sense because I
appreciate all the comments but the
compliments but like that's what I think
I'm doing here is just trying to make a
little sense of something to me to be
honest John Oliver has been I can't
think of anyone political that has made
me go well there is a great hope there
and I'm interested in something some
people had to say that seemed wow that
was noble but they're not gonna do
anything about it or they're not gonna
run or but I'd like to think there's
someone out there you know I'd like to
think you think that's part of it that
we all talk a lot but we don't do I
sense that's sort of what's happening
here yeah so is that everyone's saying
 that's all it is
we're fighting always just a bunch of
 voices it's frequencies
everywhere gone all through our heads
it's just noise so Trump was like
alright I'm gonna do it none of you do
anything and Trump's like alright I'll
do it I'll run for president you morons
and guess what he was right yeah and the
way he does it he can turn anything he
wants into a rally if he feels the
moment and he gets the right South Park
background behind yeah but he's doing it
and I don't know I just don't know
anything it's too you can't predict a
thing and we want that security is
feeling secure that you know at least
what tomorrow brings we don't know what
an hour from now brings we have never
been on our haunches more not knowing
what's gonna come out of him out of the
White House who's going to get fired but
that's not the issue the issue is
where's the world at and where's our
kids at and where are the things that
really matter what really matters is
people this is sort of like you're
giving me the ending of a full house
episode and you know I want to tell you
something else see honey I don't want
you drinking beer at the prom and you
cannot have a horse in the living room
this is where the synthesizer music yeah
yeah and you know what always follow
your gut because your guts not wrong if
you feel it deep inside then take
imodium because any moment there could
be a release
I wish I could have done full house like
that that would have been nice totally
didn't give you a chance for bloopers
like that where you could just Oh their
bloopers yeah grills that were that I
said horrific things yeah
theirs is I wrote a book called dirty
daddy and i stoled I talked about
something I did on the set once and I
got in a lot of trouble I won't say what
it is because it's it's not repeatable
on this YouTube channel but it is in
that book and it was something I should
not have done with with a well I can't I
can't say it but it was something that
happened because big something okay I
did something that we had stand-ins for
the kids that were mannequins and I was
alone on the set with just the crew and
the monitors were on and I didn't know
that not acceptable under these
conditions no we're under this time do
you ever worry about that because you
you still I mean no because everything
someone goes oh someone's gonna come for
wind when's you're being bad thing gonna
come out I don't know look at my last
special yeah you want it it's right
there in a weird way that's like you're
it's like your saving grace sort of like
you know I am a confessional yeah I mean
and there's a story in there in 0 to 60
this special where I say I was given
ludes by a club owner which were serious
drugs it was a yes like a roofie
terrible drug from wolf of wallstreet
Jonah Hill and and Leo DiCaprio and a
club owner told me to give it to a
waitress and I could have my way with
her and I instead to cut to the chase
and ruin a joke I actually took it
myself to knock myself out so because
she was kind of hitting on me because I
did it too that's kind of guy am so all
my stuff's out there because I didn't I
didn't do anything
diabolical that I can recall seeing
yourself right can you yes yeah can you
can you add that I can recall to every
single thing I said on this entire
interview that's what politicians do
okay so I'm gonna come in and I'm gonna
voice-over this new hire interview
so that I can recall yeah I feel we
should end this either with something
hitting you in the nuts or Sun or a song
or else we could do a song but you
already gave me the nice full house
ending what do you think is you you are
the one here with the brain tell me what
you think is the hope of know how this
how we connect it is communication yeah
that this is happening now that people
are doing this that you know what I mean
your divorce your fiance Kelly came
across me we traded a couple messages on
Twitter I was like oh she gets it like
she's trying to find some answers I'm
trying to find some answers and she we
went out for dinner we all became
friends immediately yeah and that people
and that whatever differences that we
may have we're you know you're probably
still a little more left than I am on
something or what just doesn't even
matter
yeah mine I think on some things
probably you're probably a little more
yeah I know it doesn't erode I dress
left
I don't know that counts it just doesn't
even matter but the point is that that
the reason that shows like this are
working is because of this that you were
willing to come here sit down
I wanted to come here yeah yeah you
immediately said to me that you wanted
to come but at that point it's like
people want this now they are so tired
of the other thing and all we're doing
is exactly what Tom Snyder did and he
was just talking to the camera but or
what Carl he had a guess or what William
F Buckley or any of these people who
said let's try to find some answers and
you can get I think as many answers from
Bob Saget as you can from the guys I get
I think you get far more answers from
listening to someone like you who has
some life experience and that cares then
you can virtually listening to CNN all
day long well you can get what we never
got into which we don't I don't want to
get into which is all the death that I
have in my family so much death of
friends I just lost someone today they
just I think man we can go there I'm bad
luck well all I was gonna say was that's
what centers everybody because the
things we all go through our birth and
death and they all happen differently
and when they happen at an unfortunate
age like I lost two sisters at 34 and 47
that's that's what centers you that
bigger than everything is the loss of
life and when people die when young
people die there's nothing more that's
all that matters
yeah the rest of it is your belief this
is that this is that it's yes you want
to solve in a civilization how to keep
people alive but the empathy is what's
missing and just quickly to touch on
what we didn't touch him but we talked
about before the show started you know
okay
I like the talk shows that exist at
night the chat shows as they call them
in England when I would do Johnny Carson
show and before him was Jack Parr who I
got to meet and before him was Steve
Allen who I got to meet and these are
guys that they all had The Tonight Show
those gentlemen
and then Johnny ended up with it that
was viewed how they would tell their
guests you're coming to a cocktail party
mm-hmm how do I dress like a cocktail
party how do I talk you're at a cocktail
party you're in Johnny's living room and
he's sharing that living room with
everybody well why does he have a desk
in his living because he wants a desk he
wants a place for his ashtray he smokes
got a little maybe he's got a drink
there whatever that's why I believe even
that that they used to do that I mean I
there's a lot I can like what they're
smoking they're drinking you know Burt
Reynolds is wasted I mean it's amazing
and that's not what we want we don't
want to see it although sometimes we do
we see some strange things that happened
I mean Letterman certainly had some you
know Joaquin Phoenix moments those kind
of things we're still gonna see more
stuff like that people are gonna do
whatever trippy stuff they're doing but
the truth of it is those late-night
shows are supposed to be entertainment
that's what they're supposed to be
they've become a bit of let's attack
everything today yeah that we've been
through because look what happened today
because it's been getting ratings and
people that necessarily might not do
political comedy like James Corden he's
an entertainment oriented man he's been
[Music]
joining me today is a guy who's seen an
awful lot of people get hit in the nuts
a man who's lived in a house that
constantly seems to be getting fuller
and a stand-up comic whose new special
zero-to-sixty is now streaming on Amazon
Bob Saget welcome to the Reuben report
thank you I'm excited to be here you're
a very smart man I cannot keep up with
you mentally but we did have dinner and
I seem to keep up with the entrees is
that why you were applying me with so
much alcohol during dinner too kind of
dumb me down no I just said that we
could get on the level I wanted to see
what you were like unconscious yeah we
did good because rats the world Britain
right now that's an opposite day kind of
statement in other words years ago when
you would say I want to see what you're
like unconscious that would be a joke
but unfortunately we are in a world
right now where that's actually happened
so a lot of things that are irreverent
and could be considered funny or not
yeah and so there's this buffering that
goes on before but either way you did
not get overly inebriated and you were
more than pleasant and we had a lovely
night with both of our significant
others who we both adore and we laughed
and and we had good food yeah and we
will do it again we will do it again and
that's all I want to talk about but I
don't talk about my career what do we
have as entree well I believe I had the
fish you did I think you had something
not as healthy date I think it was maybe
no I didn't know you didn't say you had
some kind of chicken something maybe all
right let's focus here Saget come here
that's a good place to start what you
just did there just the state of
political correctness let's just do a
little bit on Madeleine I want to do
Saget 101 all right for this next hour
I'm teaching that course at a community
college yeah yeah how many kids are
taking it it doesn't matter whoever
replies that doesn't turn me in you let
him wallet everybody comes in yeah send
a trailer what do you think of that
you're doing this we're live to tape so
right we don't edit and this did not
exist four years ago this existed but it
didn't exist like this I mean you got
millions of people that watch this yeah
this is crazy
what do you think about that like you're
used to doing I mean obviously I want to
talk stand up and everything else but
you do scripted series
yes you do movies things like that but
you also do you do panel on talk shows
things that are sort of they're kind of
old school now like that's very
different than coming in here and right
before we started I said to you we're
just gonna go for it you were like
whatever you want I mean I don't have to
look I can just do that yeah you can
yeah what you get a little bit back
again and those are the smallest cards
I've ever seen your interviews of
microfiche it's just I just write little
silly things no that looks all smart I
love the fact that this exists because
years ago if you wanted to go on a show
and have a one-on-one with someone it
was you or a baby but it was Tom
Schneider maybe all of you do oh yeah
getting that that you might be tiny bit
older than a baby yeah the camera was
always very close to his incredibly
close at Dan Aykroyd on Sarah Night Live
and the very beginning we know an
impression of it yeah and was this tight
and he would be smoking and tom was just
talking to camera yeah do his discourse
which is very much like a podcast is
today like Bill burr friend of mine gets
up in the morning talks for an hour once
a week it's unbelievable to listen to a
lot of our great podcasters that's the
everything has changed and in that
regard this has changed for the better
because you get to have an articulate
conversation that you can't normally
have in commercial television because
commercial televisions meant to be
entertaining yeah only I don't know what
we're meant to be over here well
interesting interesting I guess yeah and
my fiancee Kelly turned me on to your
show and I said I really like him and I
like what he's talking about and you had
guests on and you were ever you're able
to be a diplomat which is very difficult
to do when you have people with
different points of view a conservative
and and a liberal which I don't
understand I don't understand any of it
yeah I just what we're gonna get I
understand it but I mean we were mammals
yeah we're supposed to live yeah we're
supposed to be nice to another mammal
and I'm supposed to hunt it and kill it
depends which kind of mammal you are at
if it's delicious
yeah then you have to go for it right
yeah it's just food well we're gonna
we're gonna dive into all that because I
didn't
is that for you it's interesting I think
because your stand-up is so different
than your your television persona
between America's Funniest Home Video is
in Flast well they're the old ones so
but yeah an entourage that'd be kinda
like a thing but then but then I did a
bunch of acting stuff too and I've done
Broadway work which was some of it was
similar to my stand-up but I've always
done something that's every 7 years
there's some new incarnation that people
go who the hell is he yeah well that's
why I think it's interesting because
especially with celebrities people like
to just get in or anyone that's public
that they like to just get a kind of
image of you and then just run with that
forever and you're instantly challenging
I infused to be pigeonholed because it
sounds like something you should not do
to a pigeon now see that's the kind of
joke you guys still do you can still do
that because it's not a human being yeah
it's a pigeon
yeah but only if you know they're gonna
be really upset about that would be the
Humane Society yeah and they are right
the ASPCA is all over the show there
haven't I don't see their name anywhere
anymore
I think they're out you think they're
done I don't know I think it's the ASPCA
NRA
I think it's they've combined so that
you take care of the bird and then you
fire at it it's that gonna fly well on
this show I think it well you know we've
got those chickens out there and one day
people always happened what are you
gonna do when they stop laying eggs are
you just in women's but they're so
beautiful I thought they were males cuz
they had the red millet malay malay was
too calm and we were very excited to say
cockle I said you have three beautiful
 well no those are actually those
are female hens that lay eggs and what
are you doing this for the eggs not just
to us Woody Allen yeah which was Groucho
Marx I need the eggs I need the eggs but
that's yeah Annie Hall that's the truth
all right go ahead hi this is a problem
with me as a talk show guest as a
comedian yeah
and as someone without a script I free
associate and I sometimes do not stay on
track but you are so smart and linear
you were going to keep me on track and I
will do my very best to accommodate you
will do my best to accommodate you okay
this is fair let's start at the
beginning you are born in
adelphia I was yeah and Einstein
Hospital
Einstein Hospital yes and then it is
still there is that in honor of Albert
Einstein it is huh it is and it's on
Broad Street
and and I was born there and my dad
worked for a supermarket company called
Food Fair pantry pride supermarkets and
he was a meat executive that all sounds
legit what about your family what what
background what business were they in I
was born in Brooklyn grew up in Long
Island lived in Manhattan my whole life
went to college upstate New York so I'm
a true New Yorker so we're both you had
life I wish I had yeah I was in Philly I
lived at home during college you had it
you had that's why you're smart and I go
out and tell a bunch of wiener jokes I
know but I'm going back into that now as
you know you are you're gonna stand up I
told you I'm going back in this and you
were very excited I'm excited you also
told me you're playing the Irvine improv
yeah and when is that oh that wasn't
even public till just now that's great I
don't hey to say back to April 8th April
it's my first headlining gig in ten
years and this is one of the nicest
clubs in Los Angeles and in anywhere
really I mean it's it's like six hundred
people seven hundred people it looks
like a spaceship it looks like a Disney
exhibit and it's it's an Irvine which is
why they call it the arm Bryan improv
and I couldn't put that together why do
they call the Irvine improv and there's
but I don't know but they're smart
people and and nice people they're you
will bring smart people because you you
have so many people that you will bring
your audience which is that's the
advantage of what we do yeah whatever we
do whatever media we're on that's who
comes to see us that's got to be the
most beautiful shift in comedy right do
you remember that moment when you went
from like being a guy that was just you
know trying to get on 8th out of ten
comics at the end of the night and
nobody knows you are do you remember the
beginning of when people were going I'm
going to see Bob Saget something weird
happened with me which was I started
doing stand-up when I was 17 and I want
to were that that was a seven 73 Wow so
his I'm 104 on the freeway look at that
head of hair though for 100 no very
umbra but I had to do the drops I take
the thing
propecia that's post on the propecia he
seems fine oh please don't compare me to
that that's the hair we'll get there
we'll get my sonic comb over yeah I know
what's gonna happen if we get right on
Trump I actually I I believe but I don't
wanna I'm not doing I'm not doing
anything
to bash anyone I will not do it even
though it's possible that his comb-over
is from an onion in the kitchen that
just snaggletooth along the ground and
then crawls up his back yeah did you see
that moment I saw that video on the
airplane yes that done CGI was that done
with effects because that didn't look
possible it looked pretty it look pretty
fake but let's let's write with Trump
aside I want to talk to them yes because
do you remember that moment when when
things change yeah what happened was I
came out to LA when I had won the
Student Academy Award for a documentary
I made about my nephew who had his face
reconstructed when he was seven and I
won this student Academy Award for
documentary and then I went on at The
Comedy Store the next night and midsi
the owner of the comedy store said you
should work here so I started getting
spots right away Wow and then I started
the fight for that people fight and I
didn't work the door Wow and I was I
guess likeable but strange very strange
jokes like my first joke was I have the
first show I have the brain of a German
Shepherd and the body of a 16 year old
boy and they're both in my car and I
want you to see them now it's just an
odd rambling but it symbolizes I think
it answers the question of how did he
become this because he was that you're
gonna be third person on myself yeah but
and then I started going on a college
tour she put me on a committee Shore for
the comedy stuff with me on a college
tour and I was a guitar act just a
parodies and I would sing while my
guitar gently weeps turn a valve and
water poured out of the guitar and you
could only see it in the first 10 rows
so it doesn't really do work for the big
stage cannot play the Irvine improv of
this bit yeah and then I was headlining
right away so in my early 20s
I'd go out on the road while I was
taking five years of acting classes with
a teacher named Daryl Hickman
in LA while I was doing improv classes
at The Groundlings while I was doing
spots at The Comedy Store I'd go out on
the road and then headline and then make
money but not enough to get a career and
then I was like eight nine years of
hosting the Comedy Store in Westwood and
and that was hard it was but I got to
befriend people that I worshiped which
were Richard Pryor Robin Williams and
David Letterman was one of my first MCS
and and so I was 22 years old and this
the place was it's packed like it was
then kind of now bad sentence but in the
early 80s it was well you could not get
in to any room and every single person
on the lineup was like and I was hosting
a lot of the shows so but then everybody
went off and got TV shows and I was
still at the comedy store hosting and
thinking this is it I'm never gonna make
it and then I got in a Richard Pryor
movie and then I got on a CBS show and a
morning show
could it go condition oh I've seen that
I'm the young dr. Joffe who does all the
jobs that are disgusting that he doesn't
want to do because he's not a real
doctor
sounds like the emcee at a comedy club
exactly the same thing you don't want to
touch people and I remember holding
Garrett Morris from Saturday Night Live
by the testicles and Richard kept
telling me kept telling me to squeeze
harder and that was a reshoot they added
me to that scene I can see that when you
talk about it sort of and I've had this
with a couple other comics that that
were around at that time there's like a
real nostalgia for it do you remember
thinking it was as special what was yeah
but you remember it at the time thinking
like I'm really in a hundred percent
because usually people don't like the
good old days you only remember them
it's cool they were good old days yeah
because you know you're in a place that
is you know in the comedy stars a lot of
history and it's eros is the main room
and there's supposed to be ghosts in
there and Sam Kennison says he saw a
quarter floating in the air of a dead
mobster or something and I believe all
of it I spent a lot of time in there and
it was struggling you know you'd have
people come and see you Rodney
Dangerfield was kind to me
put me on a young comedians special but
it was all you know what I was the
warm-up comic for bosom buddies Tom
Hanks epistolary and it was all
struggling you know but but you need it
but you stand I used to wait in line in
New York at the at The Improv and catch
a rising star for ten hours
uh-huh sign the lineup sheet and wait
for ten twelve hours and I think there's
something if you come out of the the
dugout if you really or the trenches
sorry dugouts fine
yeah means you're gonna you're gonna
you're gonna bat maybe but but if you
come out of the trenches and you you go
through it it's almost oh guy had a
heart attack I've had that happen before
you know you know oh this guy's getting
thrown old disco there's a guy's got a
gun oh yeah yeah that happened to me in
Cleveland I remember that yeah you know
just it gets to the point where you're
almost a pilot on a plane you know it's
like I'm ready for anything
but would you want to do is make people
laugh and that was the hardest
transition for me was to take off the
guitar and to learn to be a comedian
yeah and so was that moment like for you
really hard
I had a guitar on for like four years I
took it off and I bombed for a long time
I would do it I used the club for what
it was supposed to be used for but it
didn't service me it didn't help me get
a sitcom if people saw me they went he's
amicable but he's not funny and I was
trying to do jokes and a lot of them
were there was a talent coordinator for
The Tonight Show I could never get on as
a comic I got on to do panel with Johnny
Carson mm-hmm thanks to Garry Shandling
for putting me on the first time and
then Jay Leno I was on once with him but
then I was done with Carson 13 14 times
and then in and always panel but I never
went on as a comedian because this
talent coordinator who passed on named
Jim McCauley who helped a lot of
people's careers except mine but he did
help me in a way he said you're very
funny but your act is like a stone
skipping on the water it never really
digs in ah thank you wow that's
something to really
take me kung-fu yeah Wow thank you
master take the pebble from my hand yeah
so it hurt me because I couldn't get her
on the damn show but I wasn't
I really wasn't meant to I mean I hate
to say those kind of words you know it's
not meant to be or whatever but it was
hell of a lot better to sit there and
talk a couple segments with Johnny
Carson and him like me and be able to
talk to a guy that you looked up to so
much because he was kind of the master
like that like I'm emanating true
jealousy whenever I hear any of you guys
talk about Carson it's like and and I am
not even making this up because I'm not
delusional he liked me and I still can't
figure that out but I would go I would
say something like and I David Letterman
had a lot of his amazing qualities and
it would respond the same way to this
because one of my patters that I would
say is this is true and Johnny would go
I don't care yeah I don't I don't care
if it's true just tell it David would be
the same thing yeah I would go on
Letterman and I would go this is true
because I don't care if it's true or not
it'd just make it funny just say it I'm
blanking on the title of Bill Maher's
first book the novel that he wrote about
stand-up but the first line in it he
says something about this is true which
is exactly what a comic says when they
were about to tell you something false
correct and that's how that's how the
novel the hell's the name of the book
I'll get it in a second you should know
you I sure this guy I should I know him
I saw a picture
we are donated in reading each other's
books yeah he has a read mine either
true story is the name of the book Oh
true story that's that's that's a branch
ah I also think about this but seriously
folks that is the segue into your next
show yeah our Bob Hope I want to tell
you okay so anyway that's always good
but these are all the tricks so anyway
so I'm in the car well you do learn
tricks yeah you know and if you end it's
always if you can kill them with
kindness or if you can fake sincerity
with their guys during that because
everyone when everyone talks about it's
like you could we could literally spend
the next hour you just naming all stars
right you could just do but we're there
guys
drop I'll just name drop for the next
and it'll be very easy to make a promo
I'll do that professor Irwin Corey see
no one will know that I know but yeah
but but were there guys that you thought
were true heck's transcendent yeah so a
guy like Joe Bill Hicks oh that that's
transcendent yeah that's a guy who
worshipped Sam Kinison it was a friend
of mine I got him is Burt I got Sam his
first spot at The Comedy Store was it in
the documentary no but he was he was an
unusual thing it was an anomaly it was
no one had ever seen that before and
Bill Hicks really thought about why are
we here and had a sweet philosopher in
him it was a gentle George Carlin kind
of thing mm-hmm I mean from know you
know probably saw a gentler version I
did because I I knew him and he was kind
of I knew him when he was really young
[Music]
folks it's official we are entering the
age of enlightenment my friend a true
feminist in the best sense of the word
and a fearless defender of free speech
christina hoff sommers was invited to
speak at Lewis and Clark law school this
week here's what happened when she began
her talk
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
putting aside the creepiness of the
clone like repetitive chanting from the
protesters their use of free speech
actually isn't a use of free speech at
all while of course they have the right
to protest your right to exercise your
free speech doesn't come at the expense
of someone else's right to exercise
theirs so what this means is yes you can
peacefully protest outside of event you
can silently protest inside of an event
you can hold all the signs you want and
you can encourage others to join your
cause you cannot however use your
freedoms to trample on the freedoms of
others this chanting which again took
place before christina had even begun to
speak reminded me of when i was at UCLA
with my lowly innopolis about two years
ago protesters screamed spit through
garbage cans pulled fire alarms and even
called in bomb threats before we even
took the stage perhaps most egregiously
though was the group of students who
linked arms to create a human wall to
stop us and other viewers from even
going inside the venue itself apparently
they aren't against walls they just
don't like Trump's wall Cristina's talk
continued through the chanting and the
protesters then broke out in song
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
quite a catchy tune wouldn't you say
of course christina hoff sommers isn't a
fascist at all she's just an old-school
liberal who dare challenge modern-day
leftism ironically these people so keen
on fighting the fake fascism in their
minds don't understand that they
themselves are the ones who are actually
using fascist tactics of silencing and
drowning out their opponents until there
is no opposition remaining at all but if
you're still confused here's a simple
definition of fascism fascism is a form
of radical authoritarian nationalism
characterized by dictatorial power
forcible suppression of opposition and
control of industry and commerce which
came to prominence in early 20th century
Europe do you think that christina hoff
sommers is for dictatorial power is she
for forcible suppression of opposition
to top it off she even works at the
American Enterprise Institute which is
against control of industry and commerce
now just think for a moment if the idea
is that these students were espousing
were the set of ideas in power they
actually would be for dictatorial
control as they believe their cause is
the most just and their opponents are
simply evil how do you think it would be
going for dissent and opposition in
their system perhaps the most insidious
piece of the cultural Marxism that we
see spreading on college campuses these
days is that it is using the freedoms
that our democratic capitalist society
has against itself of course it would
never offer these same protections to
minority voices in the dystopian future
that it would bring while this event
thankfully wasn't nearly as violent as
when Milo went to UC Berkeley and the
school burned down or when it took six
hundred thousand dollars of security to
ensure that Ben Shapiro could speak
there without threat this display at
Lewis and Clark is just another reminder
of how the backwards thinking of
cultural Marxism
is coming for all dissenters cloaked in
the mask of tolerance and diversity
these incidences are happening all over
colleges all over the country and
turning places of higher learning into
places where people are just getting
high on intersectionality sadly this
story really only broke on right-leaning
blogs and was only shared by the usual
suspects who continually defend freedom
of expression as of recording this I
haven't seen any left-leaning websites
that covered it the reason for this of
course is twofold on one hand when you
can win arguments by silencing your
opponents your job is pretty easy but
also and perhaps more importantly the
good actors on the Left which I still
believe there are some who want to call
out events like this rarely do because
they know that the same tactics of
smearing and silencing will eventually
be used against them and then they'll be
purged from their former home just as
former guests of mine like Brett
Weinstein Laura Kipnis Lindsey Shepard
and others who dare speak out against
this tyrannical foe diversity movement
the silver lining though of course is
that the more that people like brat
Laura and others speak out the more room
they give for people like you to do the
exact same in your life speaking of
Berkeley I spoke there yesterday with
Heather McDonald and Steve Simpson and
I'll be speaking at many other colleges
in the coming months come join me
wherever I may be and ask me as many
hard questions in the Q&A as you would
like I ask only one thing which is that
if you sing please make it a little
snappier than what we just heard a cover
of journey Fleetwood Mac or even Frank
Sinatra would be preferable
[Music]
joining me today is the senior editor of
the Atlantic a contributor on MSNBC and
the author of the new book Trump
accuracy the corruption of the american
republic david frum welcome to the rubin
report thank you so much for having me
I'm glad to have you here I've wanted
you on for a couple years I think at
this point you were a tough guy to track
down but we made it happen
I'm findable yeah I'm not in hiding yet
you're not in hiding yet you could be
maybe by the end of this interview
because I let my guests talk and you
never know right
that's the Twitter formula that you're
you're like 140 characters away from
career self-immolation yeah well we've
got about 60 minutes we'll see you about
immolation immediately all right so a
lot of things I want to talk to you
about I thought your your personal
history is interesting and usually when
I see you on television you're talking
about the the day-to-day machinations of
politics you are Canadian I did not know
that I find that I like Canadians yet
everyone does why are you people so
agreeable because they're so
passive-aggressive I grew I grew up in
Toronto I'm just we have place in Prince
Edward County which is what to a nap
East out of Toronto to an hours east of
Toronto where my wife and I and our
children are spent summers now for
almost three decades Canada is a you
know is a kind of mirror image of the
United States with some things omitted
some things intensified and so I think
it offers Americans often a kind of well
what if examination of what the United
States might have been under different
circumstances yes that's an interesting
phrase what do you think so mitad and
what do you think's intensified well so
Canada didn't have the American South
didn't have slavery didn't have a Civil
War Canada had a peaceful separation
from Great Britain so it doesn't have
the mill it doesn't have the kind of
citizen military traditions Canadians a
very different attitude toward guns I
mean they're my neighbors in Prince
Edward County all have are not all but
many have long guns hunting pieces
shotguns but the idea of having a
handgun or a military style weapon is a
very alien idea for Canadians yeah do
you think some of the Canadian attitude
is also that just there's a lot of
geographic space and not that many
people actually yes well there it can be
kind of it can be kind of spooky tonight
I mean they're they're great city so
Canadian Canada's much more urbanized
place in the United States
Canadians are more likely to live in
Toronto Vancouver Calgary Edmonton
Montreal those places but and there
there's a I'm in a line from a poem the
wild is always there and even when you
live in the center of Toronto you can
head off you can start driving and
pretty soon you you're in the wild yeah
interesting so your mom was on the
Canadian Broadcasting YES Network or
company CBC coming in broadcasting
corporation corporation okay Linda from
tell me a little bit that was my Linda
promise my sister who's a member of the
Canadian icing on a few things are they
different no no but she's a very
prominent person to Linda from as a
member of the Canadian Senate a leader
in the Canadian Conservative Party my
late mother Barbara from was the host I
had correct here my biography Keaney
arresting you enter of Agra she was a
radio interview on a show called as it
happens for a decade and then was the
founder of a show called journal which
was one of those face to face TV shows
at a time when satellite instant
satellite communication was quite new
she died in 1992 at the age of 54 was
your family always political I mean it
sounds like probably right well but my
family was interested in politics
my late father was a businessman not a
not involved in the political world and
he had a lot of distance from from
politics but yes I mean my parents
dinner table was a place it was a
high-pressure environment and they they
thought deeply about things but they
were not ideological and one of the one
of the places where I really I mean
learned to think was around that dinner
table because you know my my mother's
very skeptical about everything
including her own children and the way
she when you were saying something she
didn't like but she would never argue
with you which you just set marching
these two lines of interrogatory
questions and you would eventually
realize I'm caught between these two
lines and she would force you to think
more deeply about and not just political
things but about everything why do you
do that why do you say that why do you
think that's funny
and it made you a more conscious person
and I try to live up to that in the way
I raise my own children you never try I
try never to tell them what to do or
what they what to think but instead to
challenge them to think and to think
more deeply and not just about the big
things but about everything do you think
that's what we're fundamentally missing
in society right now I mean I think it's
what I try to bring to this show I try
to let my guests talk even when I
disagree with them and maybe poke and
prod them in ways to to learn a little
bit more but that everyone in the media
these days is just pounding at each
other and hitting each other and trying
to destroy each other instead of sort of
going along that journey with you and
figuring out why you think that way and
yeah and more importantly how you think
I I think it's just human nature I think
I think it's human nature to be tough on
others and soft on ourselves and it it's
a real discipline and to say you know
what maybe I should be soft on others
and tough on myself so there's an
interesting story I want to get this
totally right when you were 14 you
volunteered for the Ontario New
Democratic Party yes so far so good
so far so good and for those who don't
follow Canadian politics as closely so
the Ontario NDP is the Left Party in
Canada it's a multi-party system and can
of course has a parliamentary system and
there was a provincial election and I
was interested in seeing how politics
worked I wasn't I didn't really have
political ideas but I was interested in
campaigns and I volunteered on that back
campaign so on that campaign you're 14
years old and on your commute you're
reading The Gulag Archipelago well it
was a bus subway streetcar to go it was
really something for volunteer right it
was summer holiday and so my mother had
given me as a birthday present the
paperback edition of The Gulag
Archipelago and urged me to read it
and so I had a lot of time on that
commute and had it hit me like a bomb
and I think I mean my family you know
are we're not my parents got I would
have Europe my family my families got
out of Europe before the war but they
left people behind it's Poland but most
of my father
family were annihilated in the Holocaust
and very whereas there was something he
was always very conscious in my mind and
then here was this other story that I
had not heard so much about and it it
saved me how does that shape a 14 year
old well it it what it makes you aware
of is that human history is very tragic
that you can't wrote a lot that power
can be abused and it makes you begin to
think very hard but well how do we build
a society and so there I was on the
Toronto subway system in a society that
really worked and it forces you to think
most societies aren't like this in most
societies people are exposed to random
terror and and to dictatorial power how
do you make societies that that work and
the protect people and respect human
dignity and human freedom
so I began and of course at 14 you have
no answers but you become interested in
the question and what you also know is
that when people say I have a great
scheme for Humanity it just requires a
few prison camps way you learn you know
what it's probably not such a good
scheme right although they usually don't
tell you it requires prison gifts it
usually tells you requires a lot of good
things right I mean isn't that the the
real trick but it's currently but it
tells you that at you there are warnings
early on they're warnings early on in
any utopian project like that we're
going to have to you know break break
some eggs here to make no an omelet and
at first you're right at first the eggs
are not at first the eggs are kind of
small but the first unit you can tell
those steps and that one of the things
that you know I mean this is I think one
of the reasons why people look at what's
happening on campuses with such alarm
because you know obviously those are the
people who are shouting down people on
campus they don't have police forces but
they've made it pretty clear how if they
ever did have a police for exactly how
they'd use yeah so when I first came
across you I think it was probably maybe
ten years ago you were on real time a
lot and I would say I would just see you
on different televisions and it was
probably when for me personally I was a
little more left than maybe I am at the
moment
or at least the whole Overton Window has
just shifted that it's hard to put
anyone on the traditional map anymore
but I always sort of you always struck
me as like a sensible conservative I
never watched you and was like ah that's
the guy I disagree with on the right you
know in some like crazed way what what
does conservatism because you you are a
conservative right I would say I would
use the adjective I am conservative my
I've stopped using the noun a
conservative interesting that's an
interesting distinction and it makes
sense to me relative to so many things
changing right now what does
conservatism generally mean to you well
I think it starts with the way our
brains are built that there are people
who are more conscious of risk and
they're people were less conscious of
risk the people who hanker for change
they're people who are ready to stick
with present evils rather than try new
ones and that's just a matter of brain
chemistry then when people with those
different brain chemistry's approach the
problems with society they start
building systems of ideas so the reason
I stopped using the phrase ain't
conservative and stop talking about the
conservative movement is what I would
have called conservatism when I came out
of college in 1982 was a set of answers
to the problems in the 1970s and 80s
inflation crime the Soviet menace the
disorder in American life a sluggish
productivity growth and the
conservatives of those days had a series
of policy recommendations for those
problems and by and large they weren't
and the result was that the problems
either were overcome or anyway so
reduced in significance they stopped
being the most important problems in
Americans carotenoid new problems came
to the fore and about those new problems
conservatives had the same old answers
they've had back in 1982 and it became a
kinda fetish that if lower taxes were
the right way to respond to low
productivity growth in 1982 then if you
had completely different problems in
2008 and obviously still lower taxes
must be the same must work just as well
as they did with a completely different
set of problems in 1982 so I think what
is what has happened is that the concern
movement conservative politics he's a
fossil it's it's it's interesting in
that reveal it's like unearthing some
piece of rock from a different
geological era it tells you something
about what people had on their minds in
1982 but if you say how am I going to
solve the problems of 2018 not so
helpful yeah so when people say that
they're conservatives now does that have
any particular meaning to you like I
guess there is the set that you're
talking about from the 82 that's going
you know what you know what the answers
are then but that seems very different
from now and then of course we're
obviously going to spend a lot of time
talking about Trump and that really is
flipped as well well this is what is
made from possible this is why the
conservative movement has sort of worked
itself out of a job so the actual
content of conservatism as you know what
does conservatism have to say about the
opioid epidemic what does it have to say
about the Great Recession what does it
have to say but the collapse in life
expectancy among non-college Americans
what does it have to say about America's
place in the world you know in a world
in which we're no longer competing with
an ideological nuclear superpower of the
Soviet Union but with a with these
opportunistic actors that like Russia
and China as conservatism has become
more useless to help those problems what
what it has been left behind is an
attitude what conservatism I think means
to most people say I'm a conservative
it means anti leftism find out what the
what the American Left is talking about
at any given moment and not only think
the opposite of it but actually make
your opposition to that that group of
people the organizing principle of your
politics your sort of defining principle
basically your defining principle now
what that does is first it makes it does
a couple things first it makes
opposition ISM it means you're always
against never for and the second thing
it means is you never have the
initiative because you don't know what
you think about anything until somebody
else tells you first and I think that's
one of the reasons why conservatives
were so vulnerable to Trump is that you
had an intellectual estate that was
largely untended and falling into
disrepair and Donald Trump came and
kicked the
and moved in were there any candidates
that you liked out of that crew before
Trump came in and wrecked the whole
welcome ladies and gentlemen it's a
pleasure to be with you tonight my name
is Bradley Devlin I'm the president of
the Berkeley College Republicans but
more importantly who's excited to see
our star-studded panel tonight featuring
Dave Rubin Heather McDonald and Steve
Simpson come on now thank you so much
for joining us for this event titled are
we killing free speech sponsored by the
I and Rand Institute
I find this inquisitive title and
dialogic nature of this event crucial to
the importance of what's happening on UC
Berkeley's campus and campuses all
across the country when the Berkeley
College Republicans travel oftentimes
conservatives and liberals alike ask how
does it feel to be the tip of the spear
in fighting for collegiate free speech
it truly is an empowering experience
what has gone on at UC Berkeley is
emblematic of what is happening to
conservative students all across the
country in the face of indoctrination
from regressive leftists that advocate
for safe spaces trigger warnings and
microaggressions we don't like those do
we my channel my inner Trump there it
felt really good these lone
conservatives who refuse to waver in
their principles continue to question
the status quo of hyper liberal campus
culture and tonight with three very
special guests we will continue to push
that envelope ladies and gentlemen it is
my distinguished honor to welcome Dave
Rubin of the Rubin report Heather
McDonald of the Manhattan Institute and
Steve Simpson of the Iran Institute
ladies and gentlemen
[Applause]
all right all right is my mic working my
mic working all right make some noise
people you are you are live on the
Internet so you represent all
Republicans right now all conservatives
all right leaning people that's a lot of
pressure for you guys are you up to it
one lady over there is up to it alright
that's what I like to see all right I'm
very excited to be here I I didn't
realize Berkeley until I did a little
research today you guys actually have
had some issues with free speech did not
I did not know that until today yeah you
almost burned the place down with Milo
which is any of you guys were setting
the fires was that probably not this
crew yeah I mean they imagine trying to
burn a place down over a bleached blonde
gay guy like that seem completely
ridiculous and then it cost what six
hundred thousand dollars right to secure
the campus for Ben Shapiro
that crazy Ben Shapiro a little Orthodox
Jew six hundred thousand dollars I feel
like he's like becoming like a sort of
alright fairy tale you know like the
Orthodox Jew behind the tree with facts
we're in trouble all right people this
is I'm excited to talk free speech with
you guys you guys know that it's it's
sort of it's sort of my gig I believe
that the the free speech issue
I truly believe is the issue of our time
for whatever you are studying at school
whatever you are learning about to learn
how to critically think to tolerate
other opinions to to engage people
without silencing them because there's a
lot of people out there these days that
want to silence you guys just in the
past week look what happened christina
hoff sommers I'm sure you guys all saw
that at Lewis & Clark law school your
own Brooke and sargon of akkad over in
the UK and Jordan Peterson at his event
somebody brought literally brought one
of those those things that the Mafia you
know those wires that the Mafia yeah
that the Mafia uses to choke people all
all ended violently I have a better
feeling about you guys here tonight
nobody has a weapon right where do we
know no weapons you would tell me now
right
that's how it works yeah anyway I truly
believe this is the most important issue
of our time and regardless of whether
I'll do a little quick poll and then
we'll start how many of you consider
yourself conservative how many or you
can make some noise instead of clapping
we've got the Internet people
how many how many libertarians hey you
were trying you were trying to get them
going
how many how many liberals okay
classical liberals that all right I'm
reading I'm reading the crowd
progressives how many progressives you
clapping for everything this man has
claps he has literally clap for
everything which you might be operating
like a progressive it's not you're
running for governor oh he's going for
everybody all right very good all right
well look whatever whatever your
political leanings are whatever you
identify as any of that stuff it really
is out the window as long as you will
defend free speech in my opinion it
doesn't matter there's such a beautiful
thing happening right now you know think
about this I'm sure many of you guys
watch my show you could take a guy of
the left like Sam Harris and you could
take a guy on the right like Ben Shapiro
these guys disagree on literally
everything literally everything from the
existence of God and the value of
religion to abortion to taxes to the
death penalty to everything and yet
they're allies now and they're allies
because of the same reasons you guys are
here right now because they want to
defend each other's ability to think and
ability to live in a free society it's
actually a pretty beautiful thing so for
everybody that thinks that all hell is
breaking loose in this country I
actually think there are some good
things happening I think you guys are
evidence of it and I think I've talked
enough so give me a round of applause
for that and then we're going to sit
down
all right so so Heather and Steve are
kind of right in the in the thick of the
free speech battle and Heather I'll
start with you because I spoke at
Claremont McKenna yeah at the beginning
of their they actually let me speak
there which is better than they did for
you actually you're not it's important I
guess well hold on I want to get out of
this one respectfully yes so you you
were supposed to speak and Claremont
McKenna a few a few months before I
spoke there I think in September of this
past year I think you were there in May
or June or so April April and give us
give us about a one-minute breakdown of
what happened what were you intending to
speak about and then and then what
happened well I was intending to speak
about the police in my book and saying
that in fact there is enormous
unrecognized support for the police in
high crime neighborhoods for that I've
been called a white supremacist fascist
homophobe as lama phob trans folk and
the the students at the various
claremont colleges were determined that
nobody should hear me speak so they
blockaded the venue of the Athenaeum
where as is supposed to speak i had to
be escorted in through a secret
passageway but there was nobody in the
auditorium and i spoke to an empty room
it was live-streamed like this event but
people were pounding on the plate-glass
windows during my talk and eventually
the security decided it was not safe and
i had to be escorted through the kitchen
an ignominious retreat yeah and and this
story of course is being played out all
the time on college campuses right now
it's it's why you guys are sitting here
right now to figure out how do you fight
the tide of this where do you think this
thing started Steve well I mean the the
pedigree of this kind of thing goes way
back right but but one of the places
that this this kind of thing of
protesting blocking people from speaking
one place it starts is actually here at
Berkeley now a lot of people look at
Berkeley as the beginning of the Free
Speech Movement on campus I think that's
a mistake
it's not necessarily to single out
Berkeley for criticism that's this is a
criticism you could launch it against a
lot of schools across the country but in
the 1960s there was the student uprising
and and this notion that taking over a
campus is equivalent to free speech or
using force against people is equivalent
to free speech or occupying other
people's property is or threatening
people and this has all happened in the
1960s people look at this as the birth
of free speech
I mean conflate speech with actions
speech with force and if you do that
people are going to respond to it and if
people really think that speech equals
protests that block others that occupy
other people's property that in any way
intimidate or harass or threaten people
they're gonna do the same thing in
Reverse they're gonna do the same thing
back now that's not necessarily to say
that that's what was going on
Claremont I think we've normalized the
idea that it's okay
to physically block people to physically
occupy their property and to attack them
as a form of free speech which is a
crazy idea if we as soon as we conflate
force and speech we lose speech and we
lose the ability to persuade each other
we lose the ability to reason with each
other and the only option at that point
is force and gang warfare but this is
one of the great ironies of thinking
that you know that that Berkeley is the
beginning of the Free Speech Movement I
would say it's the beginning of you know
if it continues it's the beginning of
the end of the Free Speech Movement but
it's certainly the beginning of the idea
that it's appropriate to block other
people from speaking or occupy their
property as a form of speech that is not
free speech that's a real mistake and
it's leading to a lot of what we're
seeing on campus let's let's test the
state of free speech at Berkeley at the
moment do this by applause so that the
the people that are watching online can
hear you how many of you have since
you've been at school here and I assume
most of you guys are students how many
of you have not said something either in
a class or to a friend or to a professor
because of you feared the repercussions
yeah I know it doesn't quite feel right
to applaud that but yeah
that's but that says it right there you
know it's funny I get only invited by
conservatives and libertarians and you
know some classical liberal groups I
always say I'll give the same speech to
the progressives or liberals if you know
them whatever you want to call them
Democrats lefties whatever if they'll
invite me they never do but I find all
the time I come and I talk to you guys
and it's like wow there I look I can
look out here there's a lot of diversity
out here the diversity that the left
loves I see a lot of different skin
colors here I'm sure there's some
different sexualities here and all sorts
of stuff but that doesn't matter what I
know matters and what you know matters
is diversity of thought how did we lose
that that caring for diversity of
thought on campus well I diagnosed this
as the free-speech problem is very
serious
it is as Steve says you either have
discourse or you have force and
discourse is what human beings developed
over millennia as an alternative to
brute force to get their way and it is a
thing of beauty and the pinnacle of
civilizational accomplishment so the the
current attacks on free speech are
extremely dangerous for our civilization
but I think the free speech problem is
just an epiphenomena of even more
serious problem which is the incessant
cultivation of a victim identity on the
part of an ever-growing group of
students and this is now the obsessive
goal of Education starting in grammar
school even where you have fifth graders
being indoctrinated into the whole
complex mythology of white privilege and
it continues in high school and
certainly in college there's now huge
bureaucracies and here at Berkeley you
have a 20 million dollar vice-chancellor
of equity diversity inclusion whose
purpose
is to continue hammering home the
preposterous point that to be a female
or person of color on the Berkeley
campus is to be under literal
existential threat and as long as that
remains the dominant belief that to be
in this ever growing number of victim
groups is to be a literal threat for
your life there used to have a banner on
campus of two students of color saying
allow people other than yourself to
exist that's modeling language but it's
meant literally as long as that remains
the dominant thinking it will follow
that non-conforming non-orthodox speech
is viewed not just as hate speech again
ridiculously but that hate speech is a
literal threat to one's existence and I
think we're not gonna solve the free
speech problem we can have faculty
signing all the petitions they want you
know if only more did so in favor of
free speech it's not going to matter as
long as this victimology ideology
remains the dominant one in higher
education well Steve as a straight white
man would you like to apologize to the
audience I'm middle-aged I mean is there
anything straight white man with all
women in my family so I apologize
alright how do we how do we reverse some
of this I mean we talked about this over
dinner and we all sort of were like wow
are we I like to think that I'm an
optimist at heart
Heather you said you're a pessimist
where do you I'm torn between you guys I
was I was on your side at first and now
now I'm generally an optimist but I have
but I'm an optimist that's realistic
about I'm optimistic because of the
potential of human beings I'm optimistic
because we can think we can't achieve
things look at the society we live in
today I mean this is one of so at one of
the great the big rebuttals to or one of
the things that people just ignore in
the whole victimology I just look at the
society we live in my god it's the most
advanced
freest greatest society in the history
of the world that I mean there's
something to be taken from that not just
that they're wrong to constantly be
playing victims and claim that they're
oppressed in a context in which they're
not oppressed but that human beings can
achieve unbelievable things that's a
great thing so I'm optimistic they're
human beings can also ruin great things
and I'm concerned about the future
because of the direction of this issue
and I think a lot of what Heather said I
I think they're deeper issues going on
which I don't want to we can talk about
them but I agree with the victimology
point I think that's a consequence of
even deeper philosophical convictions
and convictions about ideas that are
leading us to be victims to reject
rationality and speech to reject
individualism to claw on to groups and
and the rise of tribalism all of these
things are playing role but you're
absolutely right that this prosperity
that has been achieved through freedom
through trade through free markets is
stunning I mean every every item in this
room has been created by some guy who's
got a company or some woman in the in
the market chain it's extraordinary
but that doesn't persuade people and if
they can if a student on a campus like
this which is so beautiful I was in the
main library today
with these grand reading rooms and the
noble architecture and the the plants
the trees you've got around if they can
feel sorry for themselves and feel
oppressed at Berkeley I mean that's
preposterous they are leading they are
living a they're leading a delusion they
are they are completely unable to
perceive their privilege to be at a
place of learning where they should be
down on their knees every day saying
thank you for giving me this opportunity
to absorb human history languages
science you name it well that's why I
think is so fascinating because there's
such a disconnect between the reality of
the goodness of this country not to say
we don't have problems and and what this
sort of postmodern cultural Marxist
collectivist set of ideas whatever you
want to call it is
I mean you know I say this on the show
all the time but the essence of
prejudice is to prejudge I could look at
you guys right now and go okay brown guy
here white guy here girl here brown guy
there asian guy there white lady there
and that would assuming that I thought
that that meant I know what you think
that actually is prejudice and yet
somehow we're the ones that are
constantly being told that were bigots
and racists I assume most of you guys
again we'll do it by applause I know
it's weird to applause II think but most
of you I assume had been called all of
these these things and I need to figure
out I need to figure out some other way
to gauge reaction other than applauding
all the bad things we know this is the
way this thing will be clipped on
YouTube Rubin did a live stream they
were applauding bigotry and racism Lord
we stepped in it people somehow the
raising of the hand does you know hand
signal that won't go well either so jazz
hands all right we'll do jazz hands for
now and I see people we have a gay guy
you see you see gay people but I don't
judge him it's okay it's okay people how
do we how do we start turning the tide
here because when I was asking about
sort of whether you're whether you're an
optimist or a pessimist it's sort of
about now well okay a lot of us
recognize this all of these people they
recognize this the people watching at
home they recognize it but how do we
actually start turning this because it
can't just be on the students at
colleges Steve you have to go back to
fundamental ideas I mean you have to
challenge the fundamental mistakes that
people are making
let me just flag to them there's there's
widespread disdain for the idea that
human beings can think and can reason
their way out of problems they're just I
mean it's a weird thing to think that
that is true especially this is
everybody to attack reason you actually
I have to actually use reason it's it's
wacky it seems wacky but there's a whole
philosophical tradition of irrationalism
that it has been attacking reason for
generations it culminates I think in
post-modernism and a lot of the points
that you made before but there is real
disrespect for reason if you don't
respect reason if you don't respect the
fact that or believe that human beings
can make choices in their life
you're gonna look at them as just
they're they're you know they're
determined by other factors what's the
point of thinking what's the point of
speaking if you can't reach other people
because they're you know determined by
factors outside themselves then then
you're lost another point individualism
is on it under attack and in favor of
collectivism and tribalism this idea
that the individual should submit to the
group should sacrifice him or herself to
the group and that the group is somehow
all-powerful that's a an idea that's
been around for centuries but it's
actually on the rise somebody wrote in
the Washington Post the other day that
we should try socialism maybe socialism
is a good idea that you look at
Venezuela for God's sakes it was a well
written arm well they always say it's
never been trying yeah yeah I know but
right that's the thing but this is I
mean these are ideas that have been
[Music]
all right let's do it let's dive into
this Trump guy because I sense that
everything we've talked about for the
first half here a lot of your answers
now are sort of directly related to this
guy but all the weakness but not to the
personality of this guy but to the whole
system look here let me I'll take one
last that have to do it on the wider
lens then well yeah you know I imagine
somebody standing on a time line and the
center the time line is 1990 and they go
forward
25 years 2015 and maybe they go to sleep
and they wake up who are the most
important politicians of the country
when they go to sleep Bush and Clinton
who are the most important politician in
the country in 2015
Bush and Clinton what are they talking
about Iraq and health care you go back
25 years from 1990 you're in 1965 and
it's a different world there's an
afl-cio
there are riots in the cities there are
liberal Republicans and segregationist
Democrats so we have had this frozen
politics for a long time and it was
ready to be changed and Donald Trump the
existing Republican Party couldn't cope
with it and Donald Trump did he smashed
the system open so he's created some
opportunities for a new kind of
political arranged arrangement because
the old one had become so stale but what
he's also done and this is the theme of
the book is he's raising questions not
just about the way we do politics but on
the whole political system because he is
a deeply authoritarian personality his
project is authoritarian and the way he
governs is not compatible with a rule of
law society it was gonna happen one way
or another right do you think that's
fair to say or is he so unique or that
personality trait or that you know the
type of person that would be willing to
do it is so unique that he's not we have
like Trump like figures all over the
Western world you know we have a global
crisis well I mean unique to our
American system because there was no one
even though Bernie was actually talking
about rattling the system the same way
and I think that's why there was some
crossover with their audiences we have
people in I mean there's gear builders
there's marine lepen
there's the alternative for Germany we
just we're recording just a few days
before people see this program there's
an election in Italy in which the
traditional parties were swept aside and
kind of a joke party the five star
movement which was founded by a comedian
and which is you know kind of an
authoritarian populist party of the left
is now in league with a kind of neo
fascist party and we are seeing the
breakdown of the traditional parties of
the center driven by slow growth and
ethnic competition well that's what I'm
saying was it gonna happen no matter
what even if Trump had lost this
election or never rose no nothing is
going to happen no matter what people
make choices you know at the darkest
moments in American history 1932 1860
political parties and political
movements converged on programs that
were constitutional that were liberal in
the broadest sense of the term and they
found leaders who wanted to uphold the
American tradition and change it enough
that it could continue but without
violating its essence this time it's as
if he long had become President 1932 not
Franklin Delano Roosevelt okay so let's
just do like a couple minutes of Russia
so that we can get to that because I we
can't talk about Trump without talking
about Russia you you tweet a lot of
Russia obviously right about rather loud
you talk about a lot do you absolutely
believe that he himself orchestrated or
coordinated some of this stuff with the
Russian government look there remain
many secrets in the Russia story but
there's no mystery the exact modalities
of how the exchange happened that remain
uncertain but here here here is what I
think I do know and I think what you
know we know that Russia wanted Donald
Trump to be President and even more
badly wanted Hillary Clinton not to be
President we know that they intervened
in an in a massive way in an industrial
scale and we're learning more and more
all the time how big was to hurt Hillary
Clinton first the Democratic primaries
to help Donald Trump first in the
Republican primaries and then in the
general election to help Trump Clinton's
expenses can you give me just for people
that are playing total catch-up here so
what are the examples of that well let
me here's the most dramatic
the the WikiLeaks tropes are dumped in
weighs exactly timed to help Donald
Trump the Trump people were expecting
the last WikiLeaks dump of the election
sometime in the first week of October
they knew was coming they'd expected it
done about October 4th or 5th it didn't
come that day instead it was dumped on
October 7th within an hour of the Access
Hollywood tape being broken by David
Farenthold of the Washington Post the
rut the Russians or whoever controls
WikiLeaks which I believe is pretty I
believe and might compel the head of the
CIA believes this week leaked says a
cutout for the Russians have not
directly controlled by them they time
their last WikiLeaks dump to help Donald
Trump should he have a crisis in the
election and and it did and it and I in
the book I said give the
minute-by-minute tick-tock where you see
it's it's you know the Russians would
that help but dogged is the real
question whether the campaign itself was
coordinating that or look we do all
sorts of things with other with foreign
governments and elections and all kind
of stuff so whether whether the campaign
actually was coordinating it with a
foreign government which obviously would
dummy illegal we know that Donald as
opposed to them just doing it and it
having to work out for Trump to hack an
Americans email is a crime it's a big
crime if you know that a crime has been
committed against Americans by you by a
foreign government you would be annoyed
about that especially if you would
aspire to be present the United States
the idea that Donald so we don't know to
what degree yet we don't know to what
degree if any people on his campaign
work in regular back-and-forth
communication with the Russians but he
stood on a stage and in June of 2016 and
welcomed the Russians breaking American
law to steal his opponent's email to his
advantage his son took a meeting with
people who were offering him Russian
hacked information on Hillary Clinton
they didn't at the meeting the Russians
didn't deliver but you know when we say
the Russians we have to clarify between
the government and just other applets
right because everyone says the Russians
as if the lawyer one monolithic thing
the true the lawyer who was at the
meeting was somebody with intense
Kremlin connections and who
advertised that she had Kremlin
connections that she said in them in the
famous email to Don jr. the Russian
government wants to elect your father I
have information from the Russian
government it could help your campaign
and he said great I love it especially
in the summer I am telling you that if
an emissary from the Russian government
had approached george w bush in the
election of 2000 and said I have
information in Al Gore that will help
you there wouldn't have been a meeting
there were no phone call to the FBI and
and there might even have been a phone
call to the gore campaign you guys
should know about this what do you think
all right so all right so you believe
that without question there was Courtney
know so I believe the Russians helped
and I believe that Donald Trump what
it's not a belief it's on video you can
look it up no I'm from welcome to help
was ready to accept the help and profit
it from the help and that and that and I
believe it made a difference in the
election I believe also that there were
Russian attempts as far as we know
they're not successful to interfere with
the actual mechanics of voting in a
number of states what here's what I
don't know I don't know whether
information regular information flowed
back from the United States to Russia
after Don juniors meeting I don't know
that I don't know whether the Russian
operation to influence the American
election benefited from any kind of
information provided by American
counterparts those are things we don't
know what what I do know is that Donald
Trump did not act patriotically and he
did not act with respect to the American
political system and I will never get
past that do you think the Democrats
have any of the same dirt on their hands
no nothing I mean look it's not beanbag
lated many they did many things I mean
when when Hillary Clinton found that
South American beauty queen who was
offended by Donald Trump do i is it
possible the Clinton campaign paid her
money for her story that's what that's
possible but there's a difference
between there by really is a bright line
difference between the usual operations
of American politics which can be pretty
rough and accept
help from the client the clandestine
service of a foreign government give me
another example didn't make a difference
so in 2004 it was no secret that Gerhard
schröder of Germany and Jacques Chirac
the president France would dearly love
to see John Kerry beat george w bush
they made that very clear
they gave interviews they made very
clear they heard just counting the
minutes right until Bush was gone and it
was also clear in 2012 that Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel preferred net Romney
to Obama your allies have opinions it is
ready none of those elections did we
have hostile foreign States China Russia
Iran actors like that working not
through talking to journalists but
through clandestine intelligence
services to help one candidate and hurt
another and have it all be visible and
have the candidate who has helped accept
the help and imagine if Iran had tried
to intervene in 2012 against or for
Obama or Romney and one of those
candidates had said you know Iran if
you're listening thank you for the help
right inconceivable but that's what
Trump did he did it on video it's not a
mystery so right so I want to really
talk about the presidency and sort of
the decisions in that but to sort of get
us to some sort of ending with this if
this all unfurls way I think you suspect
it will unfurl I mean I definitely would
be for impeachment right this is where
it's going so what I'm part of the part
that I'm struggling with this is if we
take all of the people that talk about
all this it seems to me what we're
talking about is okay well you you
impeach Trump and then really then we
have to do something which is
unprecedented which is most likely Pence
knew something and now you have to take
the whole administration out now we
suddenly have Paul Ryan as the president
or we have a review of the election and
then we're really at war this is not
sure just how Trump has already changed
us so no prep Heat the Russia part of
this just one of the things that have
that happened in no precedence is Lyndon
Johnson has operated a business while
president no no president in my memory
has directed his party's fun
into his own personal 80% of the money
that the Republican Party has spent on
events in last year wet was paid at a
Donald Trump branded resort so this is
like when they're holding meetings at
more loud or hidden a friend of mine
sent me this clip George Shultz to a
Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan
had been an important executive maybe
CEO at Bechtel the giant engineering
firm and at his confirmation hearing he
was asked mr. Schultz after you become
Secretary of State well your
relationship be with Bechtel and he said
well there's only one possible answer
nothing that's right that was the
standard so what you have is an attack
on every ethical norm of the US
government both financial and national
security and the and half of the country
is being borne along then the
discussions we are having our
discussions that I prompt if in 9 2013
as recently as that I said someday we'll
be having these discussions people think
well we will be so far gone even to
contemplate so that is unprocess about
are we heading toward an impatient of
crisis here's what we're heading toward
and here's what I really wanted my
deepest worries I think where there's a
good chance we're gonna arrive at this
place that Muller is going to report if
he's assuming he's not fired and he's
gonna discover a lot of things that are
violations of the law done by mid-level
and even upper level people and he may
discover some you know financial mal
practices are a lot of laws about things
like declaring you're a foreign agent
that there are technical rules about
can't campaign finance and he will
discover or may infractions of those but
the core thing in the Russian matter the
people like me are concerned about is
probably not illegal it's probably not
illegal for an American politician to
work with a hostile warrant no there
isn't such a law and it's hard to
imagine what such a law would look like
and so where we may be a year and a half
from now is confronting this that Donald
Trump worked in some way we may be I'm
not predicting this I'm just
hypothesizing worked in some way with a
hostile foreign intelligence service but
he himself broke no law in doing that
and now the country is going to have to
process
how to deal with that and it's going to
be part of what is going on in this new
era which is ripping apart the but the
the cords that bind us because one of
the things that makes a country is the
assumption how your connections to your
fellow Americans however much you may
disagree with them and however you may
he may have a different color skin or
have a different accent from you that
bond is more powerful than the bonds
outside the border and as American
politics becomes emphasized I think a
lot of people are saying my connections
with this global movement of reactionary
populist forces are more powerful than
my bonds to fellow Americans of
different skin and different accent and
because of that unless you could show me
that Donald Trump literally broke a
federal criminal statute I don't mind
what he did so how do we get out of this
how do we get out of either that
inevitability or do we just end up
literally fighting on the streets the
way we get out of it is we have to the
new American nation up and so we have to
do if we get out of this we're gonna do
something some are going to sound pretty
liberal and some are going to sound
pretty conservative I believe we need a
lot less immigration because that's you
have to we have to make a nation again
we've taken on a lot of new people and
I'm a naturalized citizen myself I grew
up in Canada and my family's from
Eastern Europe making nations is hard
and time-consuming so that's the
conservative part of the part you need
Allah said that that sounds pretty
trumpian actually you have a you'll have
the whole left and ever virtually every
Democrat against the other okay you need
a thicker social insurance network you
need you need a real health care system
because what we have to deal with we
have to deal with the crisis and life
expect we have to care for each other
more the idea that we went through in
the whole second Obama term people who
didn't graduate from college living less
long than their parents which literally
did not happen in the great depression
and not only did nobody do anything but
no one even noticed maybe this was found
out my pair of economists
I happened to look at some data there's
no one was paying a lot of attention to
this the opioid epidemic erupted with no
one in Washington paying much attention
to it
we need we're going to need to build a
stronger a stronger sense of national
identity and but it's going to be a
different kind of national again he's
not going to be Sarah Palin's America
but we have to we're gonna have to find
some way of agreeing what it means to be
an America and what it means not to be
an American but it is the inherent
problem there that were caught now
between Trump and sort of the Democrats
that love identity politics and neither
one of those is giving us the answer to
that I mean where is the voice that's
where is the political voice that's
learning exactly what you just said look
we've been here before you know that
melting pot story that you were told it
wasn't true at the time it was a myth we
created later when the United States
entered World War one the biggest
minority in the country was one of the
biggest with german-speaking Americans
and there was real doubt about what the
United States would be able to fight
Germany in the first world war because
the German Americans might be disloyal
and the country went on a ramp having to
ban German language in newspapers it
suppressed German language schools it
wasn't a melting pot it was a harsh and
rancorous process and the United States
had in the 1988 aftermath of World War
one um pogroms in American cities that
were very you know by white Americans
against blacks that were deadlier than
the anti-semitic could programs that
took place under the Tsar those were
facts of our history and out of that we
built but in the years after World War
two and for half a century after it's
been a strong sense of national identity
we have to do that state building and
nation building process again and some
and it's going to not look is going to
look out partly liberal partly
conservative but it's going to be a new
politics for a new century and and the
idea that people are going to that and
if anyone is standing around saying I
don't know I think what I prefer the
problems of 1982 so I can have the
solutions of 1982 I mean say you just
not helping what would you say to the
people that would say and this is a
little bit more where I fall on all this
that the government
is just not the answer to any of these
things that I hear you on all of these
problems without question no doubt but
that to me at this point that everything
you're talking about is showing me the
government no longer functions at the
federal government specifically no
longer functions in a way that it can
cope or deal with any of these things we
get then bad actors that want to wreck
the whole thing or we get these
mid-level management people that never
really do anything and that you could
look at virtually every member of
Congress that all the answers that
you're asking for I would argue have
almost nothing to do with the government
and that there's other ways now
especially because of the internet and
everything else there's other ways that
we can connect and build things right
now Elan musk is the guy that's getting
us into space Warren Buffett's working
on an alternate health care plan you
know like that
there's just other ways to do this and
that those machines they can't work
anymore
look something a lot of great social
transformations have in the American
history is different from that of other
[Music]
joining me today is the senior editor of
the Atlantic a contributor on MSNBC and
the author of the new book Trump
accuracy the corruption of the american
republic david frum welcome to the rubin
report thank you so much for having me
I'm glad to have you here I've wanted
you on for a couple years I think at
this point you were a tough guy to track
down but we made it happen
I'm findable I'm not in hiding yet
you're not in hiding yet you could be
maybe by the end of this interview
because I let my guests talk and you
never know right now that's the Twitter
formula that you're like 140 characters
away from career self-immolations yeah
well we've got about 60 minutes we'll
see about emulation immediately all
right so a lot of things I want to talk
to you about I thought your your
personal history is interesting and
usually when I see you on television
you're talking about the the day-to-day
machinations of politics you are
Canadian I did not know that I find that
I like Canadians everyone does why are
you people so agreeable because they're
so passive-aggressive I grew up in
Toronto I'm just we have place in Prince
Edward County which is about 2 and 1/2
East out of Toronto two hours east of
Toronto where my wife and I and our
children are spent summers now for
almost three decades Canada is a you
know is a kind of mirror image of the
United States with some things omitted
some things intensified and so I think
it offers Americans often a kind of well
what if examination of what the United
States might have been under different
circumstances yes that's an interesting
phrase what do you think so mitad and
what do you think's intensified in well
so Canada didn't have the American South
didn't have slavery didn't have a Civil
War Canada had a peaceful separation
from Great Britain so it doesn't have
the mill it doesn't have the kind of
citizen military traditions Canadians a
very different attitude toward guns I
mean they're my neighbors in Prince
Edward County all have are not all but
many have long guns hunting pieces
shotguns but the idea of having a
a military style weapon is a very alien
idea for Canadians yeah do you think
some of the Canadian attitude is also
that just there's a lot of geographic
space and not that many people actually
yes well there it can be kind of it can
be kind of spooky tonight I mean they're
they're great city so Canadian Canada's
much more urbanized place in the United
States
Canadians are more likely to live in
Toronto Vancouver Calgary Edmonton
Montreal those places but and there
there's a I mean a line from a poem the
wild is always there and even when you
live in the center of Toronto you can
head off you can start driving and
pretty soon you you're in the wild yeah
interesting so your mom was on the
Canadian Broadcasting YES Network or
company CBC Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation Corporation okay
Linda from tell me a little bit that's
my Linda promise my sister who's a
member of the Canadian I think things
are different no no but she's a very
prominent person to Linda from as a
member of the Canadian Senate leader in
the Canadian Conservative Party my late
mother Barbara from was the host I heard
correct here keep my biography Keaney
arresting you on your back she was a
radio interview on a show called as it
happens for a decade and then was the
founder of a show called the journal
which was one of those face-to-face TV
shows at a time when satellite instant
satellite communication was quite new
she died in 1992 at the age of 54 was
your family always political I mean it
sounds like probably right well but my
family was interested in politics my my
late father was a businessman not not
involved in the political world and he
had a lot of distance from from politics
but yes I mean my parents dinner table
was a place it was a high-pressure
environment and they they thought deeply
about things but they were not
ideological and one of the one of the
places where I really I mean learned to
think was around that dinner table
because you know my my mother's very
skeptical about everything including her
own children
and the way she when you were saying
something she didn't like but she would
never argue with you which you just set
marching these two lines of
interrogatory questions and you would
eventually realize I'm caught between
these two
lines and she would force you to think
more deeply about and not just political
things but about everything why do you
do that why do you say that
why do you think that's funny and it
made you a more conscious person and I
try to live up to that in the way I
raise my own children you never try I
try never to tell them what to do or
what they what to think but instead to
challenge them to think and to think
more deeply and not just about the big
things but about everything do you think
that's what we're fundamentally missing
in society right now I mean I think it's
what I try to bring to this show I try
to let my guests talk even when I
disagree with them and maybe poke and
prod them in ways to to learn a little
bit more but that everyone in the media
these days is just pounding at each
other and hitting each other and trying
to destroy each other instead of sort of
going along that journey with you and
figuring out why you think that way and
yeah and more importantly how you think
I think it's just human nature I think I
think it's human nature to be tough on
others and soft on ourselves and it it's
a real discipline and to say you know
what maybe I should be soft on others
and tough on myself so there's an
interesting story I want to get this
totally right when you were 14 you
volunteered for the Ontario New
Democratic Party yes so far so good so
far so good and for those who don't
follow Canadian politics as closely so
the Ontario NDP is the Left Party in
Canada it's a multi-party system and the
canid of course has a parliamentary
system and there was a provincial
election and I was interested in seeing
how politics worked I wasn't I didn't
really have political ideas but I was
interested in campaigns and I
volunteered on that back campaign so on
that campaign you're 14 years old and on
your commute you're reading The Gulag
Archipelago well it was a bus subway
streetcar you know it was really
something for a volunteer right it was
summer holiday and so my mother had
given me as a birthday present the
paperback edition of The Gulag
Archipelago and urged me to read it and
so I had a lot of time on that commute
and it had it hit me like a bomb and I
think I mean my family you know
we're not my parents got I would have
Europe my family my families got out of
Europe before the war but they left
people behind it's Poland Poland but so
most of my father's family were
annihilated in the Holocaust and very
fair was something was always very
conscious in my mind and then here was
this other story that I had not heard so
much about and it it saved me how does
that shape a 14 year old well it if what
it makes you aware of is that human
history is very tragic that you can't
wrote a lot that power can be abused and
it makes you begin to think very hard
but well how do we build a society and
so there I was on the Toronto subway
system in a society that really worked
and it forces yet I think most societies
aren't like this in most societies
people are exposed to random terror and
to dictatorial power how do you make
societies that that work and that
protect people and respect human dignity
and human freedom
so I began and of course at 14 you have
no answers but you can you become
interested in the question and what you
also know is that when people say I have
a great scheme for Humanity it just
requires a few prison camps way you
learn you know what it's probably not
such a good scheme right although they
usually don't tell you it requires
prison gifts it usually tells you
requires a lot of good things right I
mean isn't that the real trick but it's
currently but it tells you at at there
are warnings early on they're warnings
early on in any utopian project like
that we're going to have to you know
break break some eggs here to make no an
omelet and at first you're right at
first the eggs are not at first the eggs
are kind of small but the the first you
but you can tell those steps and that
one of the things that you know I mean
this is I think one of the reasons why
people look at what's happening on
campuses with such alarm because you
know obviously those are the people who
are shouting down people on campus they
don't have police forces but they've
made it pretty clear how if they ever
did have a police for exactly how they'd
use yeah so when I first came across you
I think it was
maybe 10 years ago you were on real time
a lot and I would say I would just see
you on different televisions and it was
probably when for me personally I was a
little more left than maybe I am at the
moment or at least the whole Overton
Window has just shifted that it's hard
to put anyone on the traditional map
anymore but I always sort of you always
struck me as like a sensible
conservative I never watched you and was
like ah that's the guy I disagree with
on the right you know in some like
crazed way what what does conservatism
because you you are conservative right I
would say I would use the adjective I am
conservative my I've stopped using the
noun a conservative interesting that's
an interesting distinction and it makes
sense to me relative to so many things
changing right now
what does conservatism generally mean to
you well I think it starts with the way
our brains are built that there are
people who are more conscious of risk
and they're people less conscious of
risk the people who hanker for change
they're people who are ready to stick
with present evils rather than try new
ones and that's just a matter of brain
chemistry then when people with those
different brain chemistry's approach the
problems with society they start
building systems of ideas so the reason
I stopped using the phrase a
conservative and stop talking about the
conservative movement is what I would
have called conservatism when I came out
of college in 1982 was a set of answers
to the problems in the 1970s and 80s
inflation crime the Soviet menace the
disorder in American life a sluggish
productivity growth and the
Conservatives of those days had a series
of policy recommendations for those
problems and by and large they weren't
and the result was that the problems
either were overcome or anyway so
reduced in significance they stopped
being the most important problems in
Americans karaduman
new problems came to the fore and about
those new problems conservatives had the
same old answers they've had back in
1982 and it became a kind of fetish that
if lower taxes were the right way to
respond to low productivity growth in
1982 then if you had completely
different problems in 2008 and obviously
still lower taxes must be the same must
work just as well as they did before
completely different set of problems in
1982 so I think what is what has
happened is that the conservative
movement on conservative politics is a
fossil it's it's it's interesting in
that reveal it's like unearthing some
piece of rock from a different
geological era it tells you something
about what people had on their minds in
1982 but if you say how am I going to
solve the problems of 2018 not so
helpful yeah so when people say that
they're conservatives now does that have
any particular meaning to you like I
guess there is the set that you're
talking about from 82 that's going you
know we know what the answers are then
but that seems very different from now
and then of course we're obviously gonna
spend a lot of time talking about Trump
and that really is flip this on well
well this is what is made from possible
this is why the conservative movement
has sort of worked itself out of a job
so the actual content of conservatism as
you know what does conservatism have to
say about the opioid epidemic what does
it have to say about the Great Recession
what does it have to say but the
collapse in life expectancy among
non-college Americans what does it have
to say about America's place in the
world
in a world in which we're no longer
competing with an ideological nuclear
superpower of the Soviet Union but with
a with these opportunistic actors that
like Russia and China as conservatism
has become more useless to help those
problems what what it has been left
behind is an attitude what conservatism
I think means to most people say I'm a
conservative
it means anti leftism find out what the
what the American Left is talking about
at any given moment and not only think
the opposite of it but actually make
your opposition to that that group of
people the organizing principle of your
politics your sort of defining principle
basically your defining principle now
what that does is first it makes it does
a couple things first it makes
opposition ISM it means you're always
against never for and the second thing
it means is you never have the
initiative because you don't know what
you think about anything until somebody
else tells you first and I think that's
one of the reasons why conservatives
were so vulnerable to trump is the
you had an intellectual estate that was
largely untended and falling into
disrepair
and Donald Trump came and kicked the
door down and moved in
were there any candidates that you liked
that of that crew before Trump came in
and wrecked the whole thing look there
been a lot of I mean I've almost always
supported well until 2016 I always
supported the Republican nominee for
president and I thought there have been
a lot of people who have had real
promise to make a good precedent MIT
Romney would have made a very very good
president conservatism problem a
republicanism problem has been that you
take people who are have real promise as
leaders and you then connect them to a
program that can't win a democratic
election you know since the end of the
Cold War conservatives won the
Republican nominee for president has won
a majority of the popular vote exactly
once that was in 2004 in the aftermath
of 9/11 it's no longer there's no longer
a national majority for what Republicans
are offering and what has happened and
it's no surprise because one year said
well our big idea is to take the
Medicare guarantee away from everybody
under 55 to put Medicaid on the path
toward extinction and to use all of that
to finance more tax cuts like those that
worked in the 1980s in a completely
different set of circumstances that
you're not talking to or about me so
good people have been committed to an
unworkable program and what has happened
then has been that as Republicans have
lost the parties become more desperate
and we're vulnerable but when it's also
happened is that you have had a an
increasingly self-conscious move in the
conservative world and this is part of
the trump acqua see when I talk about in
the book to say well if we can't win a
majority of the people what we are going
to we're going to cope with that by
redefining who the proper people are
we're going to define the country we're
going to shrink our definition of who
are the people and divide the country
between the people and
those people and the people and if we
have a majority of the people that's all
we care about and we're going to try to
find ways to prevent those people from
participating in even voting so it's a
couple things there so it's interesting
you mentioned taxes a couple of times
generally speaking when I have
conservative sit across from you there
for tax cuts no matter what and that's
what you're saying that there was the 82
Cru basically that was sport and then
this fossil remained and people are
always for it now but it's it's rare to
sit across from a conservative and
you're basically saying that there are
instances at least where the tax cuts
are not a problem yeah but what one of
the really damaging things I mean
societies have states states need
revenue so there are their thing their
ways you know the United Sates might not
need so much tax money if for example it
didn't spend twice it twice as much per
person on health care as everybody else
in the world I mean you look at the
actual dollars the United States spends
on on health provision for terrible
results it's very expensive
conservatives by and large are not
interested in getting their fingers into
that problem they're not so the
government needs revenue and it has to
be funded and part of the fossilization
happens it's conservative say you say
we've got a problem whatever it is and
consider well if I can solve it with a
tax cut then I'm for doing something if
I can only solve it by having a spending
increase that I won't do anything
well then happens it's cynical operators
say well what if we take our spending
increase instead of doing it through an
appropriation we do it through a tax
credit how do you feel that oh then I'm
fine right and the result is that
whether the problem is housing or higher
education or caring for disabled
children that conservatives can be sold
a solution in the form of a tax credit
which is usually the least efficient way
of solving up a problem and the result
is we that you get this kind of
malformed state where the United States
has a really big and expensive
government but it's financed in
especially inefficient ways and it
addresses problems in especially
inefficient ways so
is the first part there though that
nobody actually cut spending you know
I've had been Shapiro in here a bunch of
times and that's what he talks about
that we can keep raising taxes forever
and ever and ever but that really we
have this just giant monstrosity of a
government that's incredibly inefficient
I mean even health care aside just
everything all the mid-level bureaus and
regulators and just this massive federal
government that was never supposed to
get so big that we never actually really
look at how much of that we could chop
away at where then if we did a little of
that we could have the the sort of
relevant conversations about tax cuts
that you're talking about well that's
partly true and partly not the United
States what does the Unites States
government's spend its money on defense
Medicare Medicaid Social Security
I think that's those things together I
think that's about 80 percent so the
rest of the government you know is I
mean I think it's true that dollar for
dollar the US government is less
efficient than that of other countries
mostly because of the inheritance of not
having a proper civil service that the
idea the president starts off by
[Music]
all right we are live on the YouTube and
joining me today is an author a public
speaker a digital detox er and the
daughter of the greatest stand-up comic
of all time Kelly Carlin welcome back to
the Reuben report in the real home of
the Reuben report to this I don't know
where we were last time we did this we
were another studio we're far away in a
long car ride from my house is all I
remember yes this is a little closer to
your house it's freeway adjacent as I am
to in my house so I should also note
that we are good friends I think people
are gonna see that
yeah the course of the next hour first
off how annoyed are you at me that I
even referenced your father the great
George Carlin in the intro because I
know this is sort of it's like the most
wonderful thing that you know someone
could have or at least from the outside
and one that does comedy and also
something that you've tried to escape in
a certain way and create your own thing
and we talked about it last time and
this is what your your book is about
yeah and all that yeah what I want to
smack me right before we start no I
don't want to smack you know because I
you know I've been doing a lot of work
on this lately and what it's come down
to is this is who I am this is a part of
who I am this is how the world will
always on some level see me and see the
filter of me and yet my job is to unhook
from that and really understand that
that's just a thing that happens and if
I'm chasing after it or fighting against
it then I'm in some sort of exhausting
relationship with it yeah and really
what I've been doing lately is like what
is it like what am I about what's what's
the big conversation I want to have with
the world now and it's been funny
because I've been circling around back
to where I was 10 years ago before my
dad died actually and picking up those
pieces of myself that was ready to have
a big conversation with the world but I
didn't have all the things that I have
now which were actually
I could only have received by fully
embracing my father's legacy and walking
through the shadow of all of that by
doing the solo show and doing the memoir
and kind of trust falling into the arms
of fans and his peers you know but I had
to I had to do all of that to really
then say all right am I ready as an
adult and as a daughter to put that down
and really be in perspective with it in
a healthy way yeah so I am now it's
funny because I don't want to spend too
much time talking about that but I think
there's something particularly unique
with your situation because it's not
like you could take any big celebrity
and take their child and okay they're an
actor they're a musician whatever but
your dad was it was so directly related
to truth yeah like telling the truth
yeah and that's why he holds a special
place pretty much for every stand-up
comic but really culturally and all that
and especially in a time now and I think
this will relate to a lot of things
we're gonna talk about yeah we're we're
sort of post truth everyone up there
true where stand-up is kind of weird
right now and so much it's like I think
that probably makes your situation yeah
and why you why you wrote the book which
I know it was you know such a deeply
personal experience you know that it
just makes you particularly unique and
then I'm only gonna ask you one other
thing about yeah and and I think the
thing that I have claimed for myself
around this is that being a Carlin when
I walk into a room I have permission to
speak big truth and that's a nice card
to have these days it's an amazing card
to have and it's one I'm learning to
physically embody and mentally embody
and sometimes the big truth is nothing
about the truth that my father would
have been talking about but it's the
truth as I you know the one that I want
to hand people and one of the things
that I handed people by doing my solo
show and writing my story as a book is
the big truth that even though my father
was the truth teller on stage as a
family we had a really
a dysfunctional relationship with truth
because we were a family of addictive
addicts you know and so when you're a
family of addicts and dysfunction truth
is a whole other thing you know and that
was like the scariest but most
empowering thing for me to do with my
story was to say to his fans yes okay
he's the truth teller you've got him on
the pedestal and now here's the father
and the husband and the artist who like
it like the rest of us you know had
uncomfortable moments didn't how to
speak the truth to each other all the
time
you mean these people that we don't
really know that our performers aren't
always perfect human beings is that why
you're trying to tell I have some bad
news for you yes and that's been sort of
my fat I mean it's it's really
interesting because I went to grad
school in the early aughts as we like to
call them and when I came out of grad
school I you know I got my masters in
uni in psychology
we're gonna go into that a little bit
but studying the power of archetypes and
the gods and the goddesses and mythology
and all of that and seeing that
celebrity in our culture has kind of
taken over the part of our brain that we
used to use to worship gods you know
those of us in the secular world who
don't believe in the big guy with the
beard in the sky thing and so I've I've
always been fascinated by how we de humo
NIH's these people we put them up on
this pedestal and then what we love to
do in our culture is to bring them down
to remind them that they're human and to
say like hey I'm human - you were
equal you know so this is a whole little
game we play with this but yeah and it's
and it was kind of scary for me the
first few years after my dad died when I
knew that I wanted to speak some
possibly unpopular truths about my dad I
mean luckily I'm not like Mackenzie
Phillips
nothing weird like that happened in my
life but it was scary for me to come up
against people who I thought well I'm
gonna be disappointing these people
enjoy yeah that's why I think this case
even though I know you the best I have a
couple friends in similar situations
like you but but that this one where his
relationship was so close to truth
that it's like people would want to
protect him like a religious figure
which the irony related to everything he
thought about religion everything when I
started encountering the Atheist
community I mean that's what I saw was
he was on t-shirts and and there was
this this worshipping of him and I kept
reminding them you to find it a little
strange that you're worshiping the
person like you do you see the mental
gymnastics you're doing here in order to
do that you know so yeah
which you know we've done some atheist
events together I want to talk a little
bit about that from there too so one
other quick thing on him so I've told
you this story but I think it'll relate
to everything else we're going to talk
about I want of all the things that I
saw your dad on and all the specials and
all that stuff I saw him on the view
once and I think it was probably his
maybe he's one and only appearance on
the view but he was talking about the
pain that a comic has to have but I
think he was really describing it as the
pain that anyone would have yeah that
you have to have that pain for a while
and then if you don't learn to own that
pain it will destroy you and this is why
we see so many comics that either become
drug addicts or alcoholics or self
destructing the zillion other ways yeah
and for me it really helped change me I
was like oh this is the guy I idolized
and here and I was you know I was
closeted I was doing drugs I was yeah it
was just a mess a night and it did sort
of register something for me so I think
I've told you that publicly but yeah I
just wanted to put it out there right
yeah and that thing about owning our
pain I think is a something we're not
trained for here in America hide it
blame someone else
yeah and chase after the next hit yeah
of something whether it's progress or
the next million dollars or whatever
version your American Dream comes in you
know or it's the next swipe on the app
or the next tweet or did I get it now it
seemed do I get a like do I get a heart
do a thing that all that crap
but we are not trained as little people
and not as adults and there's knowing
there's no incoming communication about
then it's okay to a fail to feel pain to
death we don't talk about death in this
culture we don't talk about sickness I
mean we do more now I mean people you
know who like go through cancer you can
talk about cancer now we're even like 20
years ago whispers it was still like the
c-word you know and now it's a different
c-word yeah conservatives yeah you know
it's one of those seven ones I believe
but and you know when my mom died 20
years ago and that was the first time as
like my in my adult life that I faced
some big like loss in my life and it
changed me because I'd always because
because we push away loss so much in our
culture we don't know how to metabolize
it and move through it and when my mom
died instead of me like falling apart
and like ending up in a padded cell at
UCLA psych ward which I'd always
imagined for sure was gonna happen
pretty great place there yeah
why you gotta go do good UCLA is very
nice but instead it showed me a strength
I have and that in my brokenness and in
my grief I did not fall down an endless
pit I mean it was painful I mean as
grief is physically painful and I was
kind of dysfunctional for a few years
but I I felt like I had been like
tempered in some way like I'd gone
through a fire and come out the other
side of it stronger and I I don't think
you know I think about kids these days
kids these days but you think about like
how everyone gets a blue ribbon and all
that kind of stuff and nobody's learning
to metabolize failure or disappointment
or anything like that and we're just and
you need
what they're part of the human
experience you know we can't you know
it's this whole idea like the AKOP the
American economy and how it's like every
year it has to like grow grow grow grow
grow well the only thing that grows all
the time is like a cancer and and so we
have this false notion that only up is
good and and I'm here to lie I mean one
of the things I do when I I've been
teaching lately will you talk about that
is that I I have a section where I talk
about sitting with difficult emotions
you know or I have a death and dying
week we talked about that you know and
it's funny like a few less people show
up live that week maybe I'll listen to
that on my own time you know or maybe
I'll skip that week but the the ability
to sit with uncomfortableness I think
would do not all of us even all of us
personally a lot of good but just as a
country a hell of a lot of good too
right and probably people of all time
probably never dealt with those
uncountable things that well but now we
can distract ourselves so easily no on
the phone that it makes that much easier
okay so here's the one question about
your dad and then we're not going to
talk them yeah what do you think he
would make of the madness right now just
the general state the politics
that's the worst quote I know it's the
worst way I know it's the worst question
anyway but do you learn so Alfred
rephrase it's like do you think he would
be throught like creatively do you think
he'd be thriving yeah I think that I
think I mean it was always of two minds
anyway he was I mean he was of one
essential being and one mind in general
like when he would say you know oh you
think I'm kidding I'm a comedian you
think I'm kidding no I really believe
this he really did I mean he really
did believe the species was gonna hit a
cul-de-sac
yeah and we were in a cul-de-sac and
we're circling the drain he didn't know
how long that would take but he believed
that because of greed basically and not
having empathy for your fellow man so I
think he in some ways probably saw this
coming I mean I I tell people all the
time when they ask me this I say look I
don't know I mean I think he would hate
Trump I mean Trump represents everything
my father stood again
you know just the golf part white male
rich businessman narcissistic just the
hole and the part of New York that my
dad just you know my dad came from the
Upper West Side streets of New York nine
hundred and twenty first so which is now
George Carlin way which is George Carlin
way so he he everything about Trump he
would have hated and his and especially
his racism my father was a man who from
day one on earth for me was all about
you know everything this country has
ever done is oppressed people of a
different skin color
you know we massacred the Indians and
then we shipped in black people you know
all of that so a huge soft soft heart
for minorities and and the underdog but
the chaos of it he would have I'm sure
yeah you know and he didn't like to do
politics in the sense of like everyone
else making you know I don't know if he
you know every once in a while he'd
bring up right he didn't kind of
high-level he did sort of philosophic
Polly yeah picture you know and if he
did if he brought up Bush and Dick
Cheney you know it's because he talked
about the bush and the dick and all that
kind of some you know it was a great you
know the the pink rockets and penises in
the Gulf War or whatever it was yeah but
you know his thing was he said when
you're born you're born with a ticket to
the Freak Show and when you're born in
America you're you get a front-row seat
yeah and that thing that has sustained
me these last two years because because
you were literally born into it yeah I
mean in the name yeah and and just being
able to see it as a freak show yeah to
have my own personal politics and my own
desires for the country and the
direction and and the panic of that not
happening and then but also seeing that
this is if we can see if we survive it
and I know we will is a really good
thing for the country and that we're
having a
it's all out on the table no like if you
want to know about what this country's
been doing for 200 years well word we're
in it now and everyone's talking about
it because it's racism and misogyny and
greed and corruption in politics and
money you know I mean I hope that's the
next big conversation you know that we
can all have the big messy one is you
know money and corruption let's go there
you know yeah so we'll see because
money's everything in this country but
we'll shave we'll save the money in
corruption for our necks sit down but if
anyone wants anything else on your dad
it is all in this book yeah please which
mine will post to the link yeah yeah
hello and now let's talk about so much
yeah okay so I thought the reason I
wanted to I wanted first up we did this
two and a half years
that's impossible insane we're both
getting very old yeah but putting aside
those two and a half years yeah the
things that we've talked about privately
for the last two minutes are the things
that I've slowly been trying to
incorporate into the show things that
I've been trying to incorporate into my
life things that respect the
conversation that I'm having here so
first off your your big on the
unplugging movement yeah I think at this
point is a movement just getting off
line sometimes yeah doing the digital
detox you're teaching some webinars on
this my chronic Lee I'm teaching
webinars about unplugging I mean it here
we are doing it oh yeah this is the
technology we have and this is how you
reach people yeah what does this make us
right Hippocrates of the highest order I
don't know what it makes us complicated
human exactly but you know my audience
knows I I did Auguste completely off the
gallery with no electronics and no
nothing and I came back to the chameleon
box I've been trying to do it on the
weekends but I'm failing I'd say at
least 50% of the time yeah basically
trying to what was it that spur that
spurred this in you that was like men
there's something really wrong here
yeah a weary activist I think it's it
was two things one of which was you know
ten years ago smartphones came into
existence and all of these social media
apps came into existence and we at the
beginning all of us were like oh my god
this thing takes a picture and you could
look up the works of Shakespeare on it I
mean it's just like this is a
baby Jesus miracle right here you know
amazing in like Oh social media oh my
god I'm talking to strangers and look at
this and I'm like I found my voice on
social media I mean that was the first
place I went and had a platform in a
stage to say hey this is my opinion
about something outside of my house and
my friends you know so it was it same
here and I slipped on us together
Twitter brought us together
exactly Twitter exactly and I think that
was all amazing and then about five
years into it about five years ago I
felt the sudden like and part of that
was the 24/7 of the technology but also
how I was engaging with it which is I
was completely George Carlin's daughter
online mm-hmm and I had a podcast and I
had my own voice there but 99% of the
time I was getting every day I was
getting pictures of my dead father or
videos of my dead father or his name
being put in front of me and I didn't
know what to do about that because I was
like well I can't say no to this because
I signed up for this I'm writing a book
about this I have a solo show I mean
this is my own fault how dare I
and yet in the summer of 2016 I was in
yoga I was having a very la moment I was
in yoga in corpse pose huh literally
laying there and it was like May and I
thought what do I really need in my life
right now and I thought I need to get
away for the summer I'd done my book I'd
done publicizing it I didn't have to be
promoting myself online which is just
and I thought I'm going to do this for
three months I'm going to unplug from
the social media tether and and thus
this device because that was you know
the main reason I mean talk on the phone
with this thing what are you talking
about are you kidding you're basically
the only person I called you the other
day yeah yeah we talked on the phone and
so that summer maybe 1974 I made phone
calls that summer I would randomly call
people and say hey hi what are you doing
people like excuse me wait we didn't
text first that we were gonna plan to
talk yeah you called
like what's wrong you were just talking
crazy and I have to say the first two
weeks of that unplugging I would find
myself with my phone in my hand randomly
and I'd be like why is my phone in my
hand because I had I mean the
habituation of this thing is and that's
when I really started realizing oh we're
in deep I've already rewired my
brain to need this thing however often
you know and it was about two weeks
until I finally then would like lose my
phone all day in my house yeah I mean I
literally I know you know this but I
[Music]
joining me today is an author the
co-founder and president of
environmental progress org and a
candidate to be the next governor of the
great state of California
Mike Shellenberger welcome to the Rubin
report having me David
I am very jealous of your beard even the
amount of gray I just added up before I
came yeah do the reverse what do they do
it's just for men yeah takes the gray
out exactly you do yeah I'm trying to
the baby boomer votes so you know
Addison gray in yeah yeah I'm very
excited to talk to you because I think
this is going to be a good political
discussion but also we'll get to some
environmental stuff that I wanted to
touch on and a little bit about this
state of California this highly
regulated highly taxed state that we're
in and all kinds of stuff but first you
live in Berkeley I do what the hell is
going really what's going on there it
seems like it's become one you know it
was once the the home for free speech
mm-hm and and real liberalism and it
seems like it's become this sort of
hysterical crazy silencing mob up there
what's happening I mean in some ways
it's funny because it's it's supposed to
be an outlier but in some ways it's
similar of what's happening in the rest
of the country Lauren don't listen to
each other you know it's so striking I
think that the social media gives people
a lot of confidence in their views they
have a lot of information available to
them and so people are just not
listening and I find that everywhere you
know Berkeley is certainly the case
we've been smug for a long time though
we pioneered it but have you seen a
change let's say in the last five or ten
years has something actually changed or
was this all just sort of what's
happening nationally I mean when I when
I sort of changed my views in particular
of nuclear and dealt with some of the
backlash against that that gave me a
different point of view on the broader
kind of culture and the ways in which
people are intolerant I don't want to
hear it but you know just because of my
age I think and I hadn't been associated
with the University I had a think tank
in Oakland lived in Berkeley but I
hadn't really had a lot of interaction
with the students until recently so I
didn't even know about trigger warnings
like until like a couple years ago then
I was like what are those yeah so live
in
we had a think tank in Oakland I'm just
trying to paint for the people that
don't know yeah you know you come from a
lefty area and all that stuff yeah so
before we get into the nuclear stuff
which is really I think your your key
thing yeah tell me that just a little
bit about your history what do I need to
know about you before we get on the meat
here let's see so I'm a gen Xer born
1971 raised you know in that fear of the
Cold War as you probably had you know
saw the day after on television when I
was in whatever 12 you know terrified of
nuclear war my parents were Christian
pacifists but they also divorced I was
kid of divorce
suburban Colorado very left-wing kid you
know at very my parents were pretty
liberal and then I moved to the Bay Area
after college to work with a left-wing
activist group called global exchange so
it was always I've always been sort of a
man of the left and when my views of
nuclear in particular change in the
environment then I sort of was able to
kind of start to get myself permission
to rethink other things and not not
believe everything I thought so to speak
and to start to question some of those
things yeah and that's why I thought
you'd be a perfect guess because what
we're about to talk about now you're
sort of evolution and yeah you're
pushing against and where you get
support it sort of fits a lot of sort of
we're on that and what a lot of what
some of my other guests have dealt with
right so tell me as you woke up to
nuclear like all right so what was the
sort of base environmental thinking when
you just got out of college and we're
working and yeah yeah I mean I had sort
of that sort of basic simplistic you
know kind of lefty view that all of the
problems in the world world do to big
corporations and capitalism and that
that's what was wrong with the
environment and I had this picture I
think that a lot people have still which
is that a more beautiful world would be
solar panels on your roof and electric
car in the driveway and and we wrote
about how to achieve that but the more
we were writing about it the more we
realized the limitations of solar and
wind in particular its energy sources
and we had a bunch of friends who were
just like you know if you're concerned
about climate change and air pollution
why not nuclear and we had to go through
a process really took several years to
sort of finally answer that question and
go yeah we got to have nuclear if we're
gonna deal with climate
so before we fully get there what are
some of the limitations because I think
most people even now even yeah you're
saying this was a couple years ago for
you sure but now most people I think
have that idea if we just all had solar
panels on our roof and if you know if we
had more wind turbines and all that that
everything actually would be okay but
that's actually not what you argue
that's right and it's in and my views
sort of have evolved but I mean the
biggest problem people are aware of is
that you only get electricity out of
wind and solar when the sun is shining
and the wind is blowing and people kind
of go well maybe there the sun is
shining when the winds not blowing in
other way and it's like no that's not
really true either so you always have to
have power plants ready to run at any
minute
usually natural gas because you can fire
them up so quickly in people go what
about batteries batteries are really
expensive just getting enough of them to
store the amount electricity you need I
mean think we had we calculated that if
you took all of the batteries in
California and you stored all of
electricity we'd have like a couple
hours max you know so and that would be
taking all the batteries out of cars and
trucks so it's a lot of it's a lot of
batteries yeah oh these batteries are
terrible for the environment and there's
another problem with renewables which is
that they take a lot of space because
the sunlight and water and wind our
energy diffuse there's just you have to
get a lot of wind to get enough
electricity out of them or you have to
cover a lot of area to get enough
concentrated sunlight to make sufficient
clients electricity you actually have
big land-use impacts and if the whole
point is to save the natural environment
you end up doing things like killing a
lot of desert tortoises in the Mojave
and then you have a big waste problem
that we haven't solved both solar panels
and batteries contain high levels of
toxic waste in fact about two to three
hundred more toxic wastes from the same
amount of energy in solar panels than is
created from nuclear Wow
so when you kind of it's really the big
problems with renewables are actually
environmental problems yeah and it also
tends to make them more expensive them
do you do you think then that there's no
place for them or is there some place
like if you were to derive from from LA
here if we were to drive towards like
Palm Springs there are in the hills you
see plenty of wind turbines yeah
obviously here in LA because of the
amount of sunshine we see plenty of
people with solar panels
Rufe every time I go to Home Depot
there's a little five people that try to
accost me and get me unsure panels and
all that do you think there's any place
for those things oh sure and there's
there's one place for them ISM in my
backyard I have you know I mean I think
that solar was traditionally used for
remote applications so places where you
don't have electrical wire doesn't make
sense to have electrical wire there
solar panels are really cool
technologies I mean just there's nothing
wrong with them I think there's
something wrong when we are subsidizing
the most affluent members of our society
to have and that's what's happened so
California has seen our electricity
prices went up 40 percent at a period
where I'm sure they went up four times
more than they did in the rest of the
country over the last seven years and a
big part of that was we were subsidizing
people to get solar and wind I think if
you're doing some experimental work some
R&D perfectly important role for the
government that's how we got jet
turbines and a lot of the technologies
and our iPhones but when you're kind of
constantly subsidizing them the people
that get punished is working people you
know middle-class people poor people
because their electricity prices go up
and so that that starts to have a
concern that a universal concern whether
you're liberal or conservative or yeah
so I want to get a little more to that
bedroom it's rolling whether that's the
answer will show that for now but I'm
very much aware of that because even
right now as I've looked into it a
little bit you know I see that a lot of
subsidies have actually run out in
California there's a lot that are
expiring at the end of the year and all
sorts of other stuff and also just by a
function of having this studio I mean
you see all these lights like these
lights they burn hot and they suck a ton
of of electricity so my electricity
bills there are are crazy surprises
something I'm very aware of so Johnny
tell me when you started realizing that
nuclear wasn't the the evil thing that
perhaps it had been portrayed as you
know I I think I I mean I helped to stop
a proposed radioactive waste repository
actually in my late 20s but as you got
concerned about climate you started
hearing people talk a little bit more
about it I think my views were probably
softening even before I became directly
focused on it but then it was really a
couple of friends one of them was
Stewart Brand who was sort of the
original hippie you know Whole Earth
Catalog advisor to Governor Brown in the
70s he
wrote a famous essay in 2005 and in a
book in 2009 and by the time I read the
book in 2009 I was pretty persuaded
because he just went through all the
evidence you know the accidents really
were not what people think they are the
waste is actually the best kind of waste
because there's hardly any of it it's
easy to manage never hurts anybody what
do they do with the waste because I
think that yeah that's what we usually
think of our I of the nuclear power
plant in the Simpsons and the three is
more damage for your argument though
yeah yeah yeah the first thing you learn
is you go await the waste isn't green
and liquid because it was in the
Simpsons which is how I got my
information um yeah mr. burns was
running for governor which oh yeah a
little bit more money than I got you
know being right now what we do with it
is fine I think we take it you take the
spent fuel you take the fuel rods out of
the nuclear reactor you cool them in
water for a few years and then we put
them in dry cask storage right there on
the site where the plant is from an
environmental point of view that's like
exactly what you'd want I mean if you
when you grow up kind of learning about
the environment the first thing you
learn is that waste always has to go
somewhere right it doesn't disappear and
you have to be responsible for taking
care of the waste products from our
consumption
so that's nuclear is like the only way
that we make electricity that does that
right now we don't have any protections
that solar panels won't just go into
landfills and leach toxic chemicals or
be sent to Bangladesh to be torn apart
by kids and slums only nuclear really
cares for its waste and it's all in a
really clinical way we put them in these
big casts and and they're right there on
basically a couple of basketball courts
at a given plant and we kind of look at
them and store them and watch on a pill
go what if they leak or something there
in these hugely thick cast but even if
they were you would be able to see it
and observe it and there's not really
anything to leak because there's no way
is there any evidence that something
could really go awry with that as you're
laying it out is something that's pretty
safe no there's no evidence that waste
from nuclear energy production has had
any of those problems who will say pool
point to problems with the waste that
came out of weapons production but that
that is a very different process you're
just creating huge amounts of plutonium
having a cheery neum for bombs and when
we were really when you had really big
problems even there it was like in the
middle of World War two
where you're just throwing bodies and
machines to fight this war so it's got
an incredibly good track record I mean
people will talk about wanting to bury
it under the desert in Nevada and I'm
always like I don't know why like why do
you need to do that like just it's fine
where it is you just store it and
maintain it it takes up no space it
doesn't pose any harm for me I'm like
that's like the one of the Chiefs
selling points of nuclear is the way it
manages this waste yeah so when they
talk about that you know burying it in
the desert somewhere on Iran or whatever
are they talking more about the
weapons-grade way no they're talking
about the nuclear energy waste and I try
to figure it out because I'm like a bit
of a newcomer to it I didn't you know
I'm just I'm I ask people in the
industry why do you need to do that and
they kind of go well because it's better
because it's better look who made a lot
of money building that big hole in
Nevada you know being from a libertarian
point of view you kind of go there's
just there was a lot of money to be made
on these fears that were manufactured
and that were used to manipulate people
like us a group in the 70s so you would
think that there's some relationship
between like a bomb going off and the
waste and there's just nothing the waste
can't be used in that way so I have to
say it's one of the things I find most
frustrating and baffling you know is it
also one of those things that you really
and this is why I want to tag on the
show to really unpack this stuff you
really have to have some basic
understanding of how this all works so
when you even mentioned before that the
the different ways between weapons-grade
yeah and just you know civilian use for
power I don't think people have any
sense that these are different things
right they don't and the funny thing is
so I'm working on a I've got a book that
I'm gonna I'm doing on the history of
nuclear and one of the surprising things
is that ordinary folks knew that there
was a big difference between nuclear
weapons and nuclear power plants from
like the mid 50's to like the mid 70s
like people kind of in fact the whole
people were actually excited about
nuclear power like they were like this
is great you mean like this thing that's
really terrible and frightening actually
has this really positive side and I was
like yeah well let's get some of that
positive side going
cuz all we hear about is a negative
stuff this makes sense I was born in 76
so right when they did probably yeah and
then Three Mile Island accident occurred
and blown way out of proportion but
really importantly China Syndrome this
this anti-nuclear movie in 1979 came out
and that really shaped perceptions and
and that they deliberately and that you
can see what they're dealing constantly
they were trying to mix up the two
things same word yeah you know but you
know it's funny because we have a lot of
dangerous things in our society that we
actually use for positive things we're
even injecting poliovirus into people's
brains to kill cancer particular kind of
cancers you know we obviously immunize
that we inject our children with
dangerous diseases because to protect
them so I think we're capable of having
a more complex understanding of that
technology but there is vested interests
and ideological interests in maintaining
people's fears right so there's sort of
two separate things here there's one is
what the reality is and then there's the
other where when you hear about Three
Mile Island or Chernobyl or any of this
stuff what's the argument that your your
best argument when there's something
that actually is a disaster in the case
of Chernobyl I guess you're saying
three-mile
not as bad as they hyped it up to be
yeah so I mean there's three serious
accidents that involved melted reactors
Three Mile Island Chernobyl and
Fukushima the worst was Chernobyl and
even the worst one killed shockingly few
people basically killed the firefighters
who put out the fire about 50 to date
and you know firefighters died putting
out fires you know so it's not like
unique to nuclear accidents there were
there's about a 1% mortality for the
several thousand people that got thyroid
cancer and then that's it like no
increase in any other cancers so nothing
else nothing else if you would have
asked me just yeah knowing anything
about this I think I probably would have
said oh there's probably like some sort
of even generational thing going no
definitely I think that's I think that's
really the yeah the meme that's out
there that's the one that they even
promoted a lot was that somehow they
were yet exposed to radiation then your
kids would have some problems and we
don't see that and that's great I mean
it's one of those things where everyone
should have been like yay like like yay
we discovered that nobody was
let's celebrate but people were like no
there's got to be something wrong I mean
I think there's also just it is such a
different way of making heat that's what
nuclear plants do they make heat and
then the heats used to make electricity
but there's no smoke and there's no fire
there's no smoke and that's just weird I
mean humans have been around for over
10,000 years and we really evolved and
are in our pre-human ancestors helped to
make us with fire so fire is just a
central part of human stories around the
world and it's a part of our identity I
mean look at the Greek myths and then we
have this completely different way of
making energy and power and fire and I
just think and not fire energy and power
and and we kind of go it's strange and I
think we kind of go there's got to be
something wrong with it and of course
you know you get really close to nuclear
reactors it's really dangerous harmful
and you can die so it's not like it's
harmless but I think people don't
understand you know when you consider
that you know somewhere between 5 and 7
million people will die every year from
just breathing smoke and suffering
respiratory illnesses I think we just
are less scared of smoke then then we
should be here
there's something about nuclear power
and when when you relate it to weapons
in our minds it's become like this thing
where we love disaster movies you know
like all of this stuff so it's sort of
taken a life unto its own in a way yeah
[Music]
joining me today is an author the
co-founder and president of
environmental progress org and a
candidate to be the next governor of the
great state of California
Mike Shellenberger welcome to the Rubin
report having me David
I am very jealous of your beard even the
amount of gray I just added up before I
came yeah do the reverse what do they do
it's just for men yeah takes the gray
out exactly you do yeah I'm trying to
the baby boomer votes so you know
Addison gray in yeah yeah I'm very
excited to talk to you because I think
this is going to be a good political
discussion but also we'll get to some
environmental stuff that I wanted to
touch on and a little bit about this
state of California this highly
regulated highly taxed state that we're
in and all kinds of stuff but first you
live in Berkeley I do what the hell is
going really what's going on there it
seems like it's become one you know it
was once the the home for free speech
mm-hm and and real liberalism and it
seems like it's become this sort of
hysterical crazy silencing mob up there
what's happening I mean in some ways
it's funny because it's it's supposed to
be an outlier but in some ways it's
similar of what's happening in the rest
of the country Lauren don't listen to
each other you know it's so striking I
think that the social media gives people
a lot of confidence in their views they
have a lot of information available to
them and so people are just not
listening and I find that everywhere you
know Berkeley is certainly the case
we've been smug for a long time though
we pioneered it but have you seen a
change let's say in the last five or ten
years has something actually changed or
was this all just sort of what's
happening nationally I mean when I when
I sort of changed my views in particular
of nuclear and dealt with some of the
backlash against that that gave me a
different point of view on the broader
kind of culture and the ways in which
people are intolerant I don't want to
hear it but you know just because of my
age I think and I hadn't been associated
with the University I had a think tank
in Oakland lived in Berkeley but I
hadn't really had a lot of interaction
with the students until recently so I
didn't even know about trigger warnings
like until like a couple years ago then
I was like what are those yeah so live
in
we had a think tank in Oakland I'm just
trying to paint for the people that
don't know yeah you know you come from a
lefty area and all that stuff yeah so
before we get into the nuclear stuff
which is really I think your your key
thing yeah tell me that just a little
bit about your history what do I need to
know about you before we get on the meat
here let's see so I'm a gen Xer born
1971 raised you know in that fear of the
Cold War as you probably had you know
saw the day after on television when I
was in whatever 12 you know terrified of
nuclear war my parents were Christian
pacifists but they also divorced I was
kid of divorce
suburban Colorado very left-wing kid you
know at very my parents were pretty
liberal and then I moved to the Bay Area
after college to work with a left-wing
activist group called global exchange so
it was always I've always been sort of a
man of the left and when my views of
nuclear in particular change in the
environment then I sort of was able to
kind of start to get myself permission
to rethink other things and not not
believe everything I thought so to speak
and to start to question some of those
things yeah and that's why I thought
you'd be a perfect guess because what
we're about to talk about now you're
sort of evolution and yeah you're
pushing against and where you get
support it sort of fits a lot of sort of
we're on that and what a lot of what
some of my other guests have dealt with
right so tell me as you woke up to
nuclear like all right so what was the
sort of base environmental thinking when
you just got out of college and we're
working and yeah yeah I mean I had sort
of that sort of basic simplistic you
know kind of lefty view that all of the
problems in the world world do to big
corporations and capitalism and that
that's what was wrong with the
environment and I had this picture I
think that a lot people have still which
is that a more beautiful world would be
solar panels on your roof and electric
car in the driveway and and we wrote
about how to achieve that but the more
we were writing about it the more we
realized the limitations of solar and
wind in particular its energy sources
and we had a bunch of friends who were
just like you know if you're concerned
about climate change and air pollution
why not nuclear and we had to go through
a process really took several years to
sort of finally answer that question and
go yeah we got to have nuclear if we're
gonna deal with climate
so before we fully get there what are
some of the limitations because I think
most people even now even yeah you're
saying this was a couple years ago for
you sure but now most people I think
have that idea if we just all had solar
panels on our roof and if you know if we
had more wind turbines and all that that
everything actually would be okay but
that's actually not what you argue
that's right and it's in and my views
sort of have evolved but I mean the
biggest problem people are aware of is
that you only get electricity out of
wind and solar when the sun is shining
and the wind is blowing and people kind
of go well maybe there the sun is
shining when the winds not blowing in
other way and it's like no that's not
really true either so you always have to
have power plants ready to run at any
minute
usually natural gas because you can fire
them up so quickly in people go what
about batteries batteries are really
expensive just getting enough of them to
store the amount electricity you need I
mean think we had we calculated that if
you took all of the batteries in
California and you stored all of
electricity we'd have like a couple
hours max you know so and that would be
taking all the batteries out of cars and
trucks so it's a lot of it's a lot of
batteries yeah oh these batteries are
terrible for the environment and there's
another problem with renewables which is
that they take a lot of space because
the sunlight and water and wind our
energy diffuse there's just you have to
get a lot of wind to get enough
electricity out of them or you have to
cover a lot of area to get enough
concentrated sunlight to make sufficient
clients electricity you actually have
big land-use impacts and if the whole
point is to save the natural environment
you end up doing things like killing a
lot of desert tortoises in the Mojave
and then you have a big waste problem
that we haven't solved both solar panels
and batteries contain high levels of
toxic waste in fact about two to three
hundred more toxic wastes from the same
amount of energy in solar panels than is
created from nuclear Wow
so when you kind of it's really the big
problems with renewables are actually
environmental problems yeah and it also
tends to make them more expensive them
do you do you think then that there's no
place for them or is there some place
like if you were to derive from from LA
here if we were to drive towards like
Palm Springs there are in the hills you
see plenty of wind turbines yeah
obviously here in LA because of the
amount of sunshine we see plenty of
people with solar panels
Rufe every time I go to Home Depot
there's a little five people that try to
accost me and get me unsure panels and
all that do you think there's any place
for those things oh sure and there's
there's one place for them ISM in my
backyard I have you know I mean I think
that solar was traditionally used for
remote applications so places where you
don't have electrical wire doesn't make
sense to have electrical wire there
solar panels are really cool
technologies I mean just there's nothing
wrong with them I think there's
something wrong when we are subsidizing
the most affluent members of our society
to have and that's what's happened so
California has seen our electricity
prices went up 40 percent at a period
where I'm sure they went up four times
more than they did in the rest of the
country over the last seven years and a
big part of that was we were subsidizing
people to get solar and wind I think if
you're doing some experimental work some
R&D perfectly important role for the
government that's how we got jet
turbines and a lot of the technologies
and our iPhones but when you're kind of
constantly subsidizing them the people
that get punished is working people you
know middle-class people poor people
because their electricity prices go up
and so that that starts to have a
concern that a universal concern whether
you're liberal or conservative or yeah
so I want to get a little more to that
bedroom it's rolling whether that's the
answer will show that for now but I'm
very much aware of that because even
right now as I've looked into it a
little bit you know I see that a lot of
subsidies have actually run out in
California there's a lot that are
expiring at the end of the year and all
sorts of other stuff and also just by a
function of having this studio I mean
you see all these lights like these
lights they burn hot and they suck a ton
of of electricity so my electricity
bills there are are crazy surprises
something I'm very aware of so Johnny
tell me when you started realizing that
nuclear wasn't the the evil thing that
perhaps it had been portrayed as you

because he just went through all the
evidence you know the accidents really
were not what people think they are the
waste is actually the best kind of waste
because there's hardly any of it it's
easy to manage never hurts anybody what
do they do with the waste because I
think that yeah that's what we usually
think of our I of the nuclear power
plant in the Simpsons and the three is
more damage for your argument though
yeah yeah yeah the first thing you learn
is you go await the waste isn't green
and liquid because it was in the
Simpsons which is how I got my
information um yeah mr. burns was
running for governor which oh yeah a
little bit more money than I got you
know being right now what we do with it
is fine I think we take it you take the
spent fuel you take the fuel rods out of
the nuclear reactor you cool them in
water for a few years and then we put
them in dry cask storage right there on
the site where the plant is from an
environmental point of view that's like
exactly what you'd want I mean if you
when you grow up kind of learning about

learn is that waste always has to go
somewhere right it doesn't disappear and
you have to be responsible for taking

so that's nuclear is like the only way
that we make electricity that does that
right now we don't have any protections
that solar panels won't just go into
landfills and leach toxic chemicals or
be sent to Bangladesh to be torn apart
by kids and slums only nuclear really
cares for its waste and it's all in a
really clinical way we put them in these
big casts and and they're right there on
basically a couple of basketball courts

we were really when you had really big
problems even there it was like in the
middle of World War two
where you're just throwing bodies and
machines to fight this war so it's got
an incredibly good track record I mean
people will talk about wanting to bury
it under the desert in Nevada and I'm
always like I don't know why like why do
you need to do that like just it's fine
where it is you just store it and
maintain it it takes up no space it
doesn't pose any harm for me I'm like
that's like the one of the Chiefs
selling points of nuclear is the way it
manages this waste yeah so when they
talk about that you know burying it in
the desert somewhere on Iran or whatever
are they talking more about the
weapons-grade way no they're talking
about the nuclear energy waste and I try
to figure it out because I'm like a bit
of a newcomer to it I didn't you know
I'm just I'm I ask people in the
industry why do you need to do that and
they kind of go well because it's better
because it's better look who made a lot
of money building that big hole in
Nevada you know being from a libertarian
point of view you kind of go there's
just there was a lot of money to be made
on these fears that were manufactured
and that were used to manipulate people
like us a group in the 70s so you would
think that there's some relationship
between like a bomb going off and the
waste and there's just nothing the waste
can't be used in that way so I have to
say it's one of the things I find most
frustrating and baffling you know is it
also one of those things that you really
and this is why I want to tag on the
show to really unpack this stuff you
really have to have some basic
understanding of how this all works so
when you even mentioned before that the
the different ways between weapons-grade
yeah and just you know civilian use for
power I don't think people have any
sense that these are different things
right they don't and the funny thing is
so I'm working on a I've got a book that
I'm gonna I'm doing on the history of
nuclear and one of the surprising things
is that ordinary folks knew that there
was a big difference between nuclear
weapons and nuclear power plants from
like the mid 50's to like the mid 70s
like people kind of in fact the whole
people were actually excited about
nuclear power like they were like this
is great you mean like this thing that's
really terrible and frightening actually
has this really positive side and I was
like yeah well let's get some of that
positive side going
cuz all we hear about is a negative
stuff this makes sense I was born in 76
so right when they did probably yeah and
then Three Mile Island accident occurred
and blown way out of proportion but
really importantly China Syndrome this
this anti-nuclear movie in 1979 came out
and that really shaped perceptions and
and that they deliberately and that you
can see what they're dealing constantly
they were trying to mix up the two
things same word yeah you know but you
know it's funny because we have a lot of
dangerous things in our society that we
actually use for positive things we're
even injecting poliovirus into people's
brains to kill cancer particular kind of
cancers you know we obviously immunize
that we inject our children with
dangerous diseases because to protect
them so I think we're capable of having
a more complex understanding of that
technology but there is vested interests

unique to nuclear accidents there were
there's about a 1% mortality for the
several thousand people that got thyroid
cancer and then that's it like no
increase in any other cancers so nothing
else nothing else if you would have

you know you get really close to nuclear
reactors it's really dangerous harmful
and you can die so it's not like it's
harmless but I think people don't
understand you know when you consider
that you know somewhere between 5 and 7
million people will die every year from
just breathing smoke and suffering
respiratory illnesses I think we just
are less scared of smoke then then we
should be here
there's something about nuclear power
and when when you relate it to weapons

freemen a history of the American Civil
War Jeffery Rogers Hummel
welcome to the Rubin report it's a
pleasure to be on the ribbon report we
have already just in a few minutes we've
been sitting here we talked about almost
every other present right now I guess
we're gonna have to get the Lincoln guy
yes definitely let's do it so first off
the obvious question was he actually a
vampire hunter I doubt it it's not a
show that I watched was it a movie I
forget it was a movie I thought it was a
documentary but not all right there's a
lot I want to talk to you now it was
obvious when we were selecting our five
presidents to do this week we wanted to
do some of it some of the big ones and
some smaller ones and hopefully we'll do
this for many years to come and get to
everybody but Lincoln was the one I was
like alright we got to do it because I
think if you polled most Americans they
always say that Lincoln is their
favorite right I think probably George
Washington comes in second but I think
Lincoln is the big one so I want to do a
little bit on his bio than I want to do
obviously on the political stuff and
Civil War in freeing the slaves and I
want to talk about some of the
interesting criticisms that you have of
him in this book but first let's just
start a little bit about childhood where
should we start well Lincoln was born in
Kentucky 1809 and grew up in a in a very
poor frontier household his mother died
when he was very young I was partly
raised by a by a stepmother they moved
to Indiana and basically he educated
himself and and it was a humble
background yeah as he would have as he
as he described it himself how was that
possible to educate himself back then I
mean was he just grabbed
he was just grabbing books and reading
them at every opportunity he could get
and yeah that's basic thats basically
the story yeah do we know anything about
his further education as he got a little
bit older uh I don't know anything about
his further education I don't think he
was university educated he obviously
went on to get a law degree but in those
days getting a law degree was you
clerked under a lawyer and then you hung
out your shingle right so as far as
formal education is concerned he didn't
have very much of that yeah was his
really ambition at first to be a lawyer
I don't know whether he had a real
ambition at first I mean you know he he
he he had a lot of other kinds of more
frontier oriented jobs right that's how
he got the nickname the Railsplitter
working on the rivers and and those
sorts of things and so I think he just
sort of fell into law yeah so he's a lot
but eventually I mean eventually
politics became his passion yeah so he's
a lawyer and then politics became his
passion yes I would say those two are
interrelated because remember at that
time many of your politicians if not
most of your politicians where either
came through the military or through the
profession of law yeah
was there a seminal moment for him that
he realized this is when and why I have
to get into politics uh no I don't think
so I don't think so
you know it's like life happens yeah and
opportunities open and you take
advantage of them yeah and you know he
a legal profession in Illinois and then
he was elected to the Illinois
legislature eventually elected to the
House of Representatives for a short
time and and became very prominent in
the Illinois Whig party
yeah what were his politics like in time
and what was the Whig party like okay
well this is one of the if you look at
the two parties ideologically at that
time it was the Whigs versus the
Democrats the Whigs were the end of
interventionist party the Whigs were in
favor of high protective tariffs they
were in favor of spending a lot of money
government money on internal
improvements what we call infrastructure
today and they were in favor of a
nationally chartered bank and a lot of
these policies were the outgrowth of one
of the most prominent Whig leaders Henry
Clay and what he termed his American
system whereas by this time the
Democratic Party had become the party of
laissez faire low tariffs getting rid of
the National Bank and in fact actually
trying to divorce government from any
relationship with banks and at least
trying to keep the federal government
out of funding internal improvements
yeah that that's very interesting to me
because in a modern sense that seems to
be a bit of a reversal right where we're
at right now
right was was Lincoln really in line
with oh yeah he's I mean he really
admired Henry Clay Henry Clay what was
his hero and he he supported all those
policies down the line when he was in
the state legislature in Illinois he was
crucial in passing a very expensive
internal improvements program in
Illinois that subsequently almost drove
the state into bankruptcy
financing of canals and and railroads
yeah so fiscally at the time he was he
was spending a lot and did the the
infrastructure deal actually makes sense
well I know in other words in other
words if if what happened is that the
states went through sort of two phases
in terms of infrastructure the first
phase was Canal building and the second
phase was railroads these are often
referred to as phases of the
transportation revolution during that
period the canal building orgy was
actually set off by New York building
the Erie Canal which is one of the few
examples of a socialist enterprise that
actually made a profit and so this
inspired a lot of other states to build
canals almost all of which lost money
and created financial problems for the
states that built them which suggests
that they were not economically
justified yeah and then as a result of
the states losing so much money on the
canals initially they were heavily
involved in railroads and they continued
to subsidize the railroads but at least
by the 1840s and 1850s they weren't
owning outright the railroads the way
they had owned outright the canals and
therefore either there was a little bit
too much railroad expansion subsidized
by the government but it wasn't as
significant as the problems created by
the canal building interesting because
this is a part of Lincoln that I don't
you know we mostly think about the Civil
War right and freeing the slaves but the
economic part is sort of interesting
what do you think his sort of overriding
economic policy was because it sounds
like it was a it was a lot of he carried
this policy into the presidency the
first subsidized transcontinental
railroads were during Lincoln's
administration during the Civil War and
that resulted in many other
Transcontinental's and being subsidized
by the national government
and a whole bunch of pork-barrel
legislation in the in the post-civil war
period and a lot of scandals corruption
involved as well yeah so so so his
economic views continued throughout his
entire career and these were this was
the main dividing line between the two
policies between the two political
parties because up until the Civil War
both political parties tied to straddle
the issue of slavery so they would both
be national parties so they tried to
keep it out as best they could out of
the political arena yeah when did he
start talking about slavery really I
mean when he was in the Illinois
legislature no he doesn't really start
talking about slavery he he he had a
visceral dislike of slavery from his
youth but he didn't really start talking
about slavery until after the
kansas-nebraska act and slavery becomes
a prominent issue and it causes the
death of the Whig party mm-hmm
and the collapse of the of the Whig
party yeah can you explain that a little
bit more why why that actually yeah yeah
well see both parties initially try to
straddle the slavery issue but as as it
evolves over time the Whig party being
more interventionist tends to be
stronger in New England whereas the
Democratic Party tending to be
non-interventionist tends to be stronger
in the south and the west and so the
both parties feel the strain between
northern and southern democrats northern
and southern Whigs but the Whig party is
actually blown apart by that strain
after the kansas-nebraska Act and one
issue that causes the demise of the Whig
party
is slavery so you have the split between
northern Whigs and southern Whigs and
then also another issue that comes to
the fore during that period is
immigration
there is a nativist movement that some
Whigs end up embracing and that also is
a plays a role in the demise of the Whig
party yeah
what was his policy well actually
Lincoln was fairly good on that I mean
he in other words there was a debate
within the council's of the Republican
Party about you know between those who
were more nativist and those who were
less nativist and Lincoln was definitely
on the side of the one he didn't want he
didn't want the Republican Party to be
him to take a platform stand on nativism
opposing immigration or actually they
they they weren't proposing restrictions
on immigration so much as restrictions
on acquiring citizenship so when the
Whig Party fell apart and then basically
the remnants became the Republican Party
what well what was that like what like
where the day literally just well
actually the people or a man well well
inissia initially the Republican Party
is a coalition of anti-slavery Whigs
and anti-slavery Democrats so it it's
exclusively a sectional party it's
almost exclusively so just to be really
clear on that though so the Republican
Party actually was the original
anti-slavery party it was taking from
both sides and was right taking now we
need to be clear about this term
anti-slavery because being anti-slavery
was a was a broad tent at one extreme
were the abolitionists and at least in
America the term abolitionist refers to
anti-slavery advocates who favor
immediate emancipation of all slaves and
full political rights for all African
Americans
so there's a whole range of anti-slavery
positions and so the Republican Party
the abolitionists are always a minority
and the Republican Party succeeds where
the abolitionists don't succeed by
reducing anti-slavery to its lowest
common denominator essentially one issue
which is opposing the spread of slavery
into the territories and so you have and
again the kansas-nebraska act in which
in which Kansas and Nebraska were opened
to slavery
in violation of the Missouri Compromise
is what sort of inspires this concern
among anti-slavery northerners so just
just to be clear at the beginning of the
Civil War there are a lot of Democrats
involved in former Democrats involved in
the Republican Party Lincoln's Secretary
of State Salman Chase is a former
Democrat several Republican governors
and Senate are me yet Republican
senators and governors are former
Republicans so in Lincoln's election the
Republican Party has to sort of straddle
these economic issues to keep both sides
of the coalition together where did he
fall when he was running for president
where did he fall on that scale of
abolitionists to what what would you
call he was a would you call that other
group they were sort of well they're
just they're just anti-slavery yeah and
but what that approach that they had
what would you repeal was that pragmatic
or what did they base it
well gradualist pragmatic basically
again this is where Lincoln follows
Henry Clay Henry Clay was a favor it was
in favor of colonization in other words
not just having a plan of perhaps
compensated emancipation in which freed
slaves
are moved to back to Africa and Lincoln
was a big advocate of colonization and
in fact he continues to pursue
colonization even after the outbreak of
the Civil War by the end of the Civil
War he's probably given up on that but
during the Civil War he sponsored one
disastrous attempt at colonization in
Haiti that it just didn't yeah what
happened well what happened is that
there they got the I'm a little bit hazy
on the details but but some land was
acquired in Haiti and they got some
african-americans who agreed to move
there and then it was not just
economically unviable but does have
problems with disease and so the whole
colony collapsed in other words he
wanted to do he wanted to push in in
Latin America something similar to
Liberia in in Africa which also was also
a colonization scheme set up by the
American Colonization Society of which
Henry Clay was a participant right so
there's a couple interesting things
there so you referenced that the Whig
party itself had a sort of internal
conflict between their northern
representatives that would be someone
like Abraham Lincoln and their southern
if you were a local representative in
the legislature in Illinois did it ever
come up to talk about I mean why would
slavery even really it was only within
the national discussion right like was
it something that people were actually
voting on in anyway not at the state
level now yeah there it's hard to think
of party politics in a 20-18 lens
without everything being right national
and everybody affected by every little
thing yeah yeah no the only sense in
which it was the only sense in which the
state you got involved at the state
level was with respect to the Fugitive
Slave Law so if you look at the history
of slavery there's always this ten
in between free states and slave states
even at the Constitutional Convention
but it is usually kept below the surface
except during these instances where it
where it erupts and then it's resolved
so you first have Missouri coming in as
a slave state which leads to the
Missouri Compromise and then things calm
down and then you have the tariff issue
which is partially driven by South
Carolina's slave and then you have
things calming down with the annexation
of Texas and California coming in as a
state slavery becomes a big issue again
and it's partially calmed down by the
compromise of 1850 and then after that
you have the kansas-nebraska Act and
then then there's no coming it down
anymore and the compromise of 1850 is
responsible part of the part of what
southerners got out of the compromise of
1850 or more precisely slaveholders was
the slave was the Fugitive Slave Act of
1850 now one of the one of the
constitutional deals I mean right in the
Constitution there's a fugitive slave
provision in which it's the obligation
of free states to return runaway slaves
and the Washington administration
actually passed the first Fugitive Slave
Act but the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850
was one of the most draconian laws that
Congress ever enacted yeah
and in other words it set up a
bureaucracy of commissioners who would
hear cases of fugitive slaves they got
$5.00 if they decided that that the
person wasn't a slave and $10 if they
decided it was a slave right so you're
right they
the slave had no right to represent
gestation a jury trial no right to
testify the legisla and the the
commissioners could require the
cooperation of individuals to apprehend
Runaways and if you violated that you
could face a jail sentence $1,000 fine
$1,000 civil penalties for each escaped
slave so it was pretty so many of your
northern states began have before this
but began after this passing what were
called personal liberty laws trying to
make sure that state officials did not
participate in the apprehension and
return of Runaways and so that's that's
that's the that's the big slavery issue
in northern states yeah it sounds like
such a crazy thing because they were
incentivizing the north right yeah that
may not have wanted to send the slaves
back they were literally financially
incentivizing and then as you're saying
there were other people there were just
citizens that were going out there right
and it also also also made it easier to
engage in kidnapping free blacks yeah
bringing them south who was fighting
this the most I mean I would imagine
there must have been some states rights
people in the North that maybe you
didn't even care about slavery per se
but must have said you can't tell yeah
well this this is this is one of the
things after the compromise of 1850 that
brings slavery starts pushing it to the
forefront and of course this is when
Kelly Elliot Uncle Tom's Cabin
Henry beat what's her first name I'm
drawing a blank Harriet Beecher Stowe
writes Uncle Tom's Cabin which becomes a
best-seller and it's about the Fugitive
Slave issues so it sensitizes a lot of
northerners to the Fugitive Slave
question and so Illinois does
pass a personal liberty law because
Southern Illinois is actually settled by
from the southern the eastern southern
states but some of your other states
like Pennsylvania and states further
north
do pass personal liberty laws yeah as a
result of either before the Fugitive
Slave Act or after the Fugitive Slave
Act so before we get directly into the
presidency and the warriors there
anything else we need to know about
Lincoln's politics at the time or what
else was influencing him besides
obviously there were states rights
issues there was obviously the slavery
issue it was there anything else that we
think of as really the moments that kind
of shaped him before the president I
think I think we I think we've covered
the important issues the big ones okay
so he runs for president what what do we
need to know about that platform well as
I say it tries to paper over the
difference between former Democrats and
former Whigs it has a it has a plank
about about the tariff that can be
interpreted differently but the primary
plank is is opposition to the spread of
slavery into anymore territories and
what's interesting about that plank is
that it's essentially that plank has
essentially been declared
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in
the Dred Scott decision
in the Dred Scott decision the Supreme
Court says that the the territories are
the common property of both northerners
and southerners and therefore the
national government cannot restrict the
property rights of southerners when they
move into the territories by preventing
them from bringing their slaves so that
so you have a you have a platform plank
that was that was literally on
Constitution
declared unconstitutional I mean most
Supreme Court most legal scholars today
think it was a very bad decision but yes
it was had been declared
unconstitutional what do we need to know
about the the tenor of the political
[Music]
it's presidents week here on the Rubin
report and we're partnering with learn
Liberty to bring you five shows in five
days each highlighting a different
President of the United States joining
me today is an associate professor of
history at Sam Houston State and the
co-author of JFK and the Reagan
Revolution a secret history of American
prosperity Brian to be trovich welcome
to the Rubin report it's great to bear
Dmitrievich Dimitra vick usually i said
with a heart state Dimitra vick Demetra
vick okay I was a big fan of drazen
petrovic yeah who is a basketball player
from Croatia and the in the early 90s
but some people said Petro Vic and I
could never tell Rudy Tomjanovich the
old coach yeah it's properly a hot check
at the C so I'm heretical rudakov
knowledge that 95 Houston rocket team is
my favorite basketball team of all time
Clyde Drexler right there there you go
Houston guy do you alright I could talk
basketball the entire time but let's
talk presidents by the title of your
book we could probably talk about Regan
just as easily as we could talk about
JFK who we're gonna talk about do you
have a do the preference out of those
two well our book JFK in the Reagan
Revolution really is two-thirds
three-quarters about John F Kennedy
because we've forgotten that John F
Kennedy paved the way for the Reagan
Revolution in this big tax cut alright
so JFK since you spent two thirds of it
on JFK that's the guy we're gonna talk
about I find with JFK that what it seems
that most at least younger people no say
under 45 is 50 or something like that
they know a lot about the assassination
you know History Channel runs the
documentaries all the time you can watch
the movie JFK zillion other things that
are out there but there's obviously a
lot more to JFK than than just the
unfortunate ending so let's start at the
beginning what do we need to know about
early childhood the the Kennedy family
etcetera Terry let's start with
childhood sure ill John F Kennedy was
born in May of 1917 in a very important
family a family that was becoming one of
the richest in the United States his
father Joseph P Kennedy at that point in
the teens had graduated from Harvard
about ten years before was building his
fortune I would within Kennedy's
childhood before he turned 15 his father
had become one of the richest men in the
country and actually just a peak Kennedy
made most of his money in what we call
the great contraction the worst period
of American economic history from 1929
to 1933 when he short sold the market
and that's really when the Kennedys
became the one of the top richest
families in the United States so how
political was the Kennedy family at that
time yeah I mean it was pretty political
Joseph P Kennedy john f kennedy's father
had married the daughter of an important
boston politician and then Joseph P was
not involved in politics until FDR
Franklin Roosevelt appointed him the
first head of the Securities Exchange
Commission in 1934 and then he became a
big Roosevelt Democrat so that was the
sort of beginning of the dynasty yeah in
the candidate name yes yeah so JFK then
tell me a little bit about sort of his
evolution from a young person to
starting to become a politician yeah so
John
JFK was the second son so there was the
Chesapeake Kennedy jr. who would be
killed in World War two and he wasn't a
good student in prep school and he went
to Princeton actually for a semester
didn't do well there then went to
Harvard did not do particularly well
until his senior year probably
plagiarized his thesis which then
somehow sold 80,000 copies as a book
when it was published but with his
father's help really tell me a little
more about that I haven't heard that one
oh yeah yeah yeah
so John F Kennedy his father in 1938-39
I guess this would have been at that
point was the ambassador to the court of
st. James it was the US ambassador to
Great Britain and was very interested in
the United States fighting the Soviet
Union and not necessarily fighting Nazi
Germany and so that kind of caused
diplomatic problems with FDR's foreign
policy but JFK had extraordinary access
to the files and so he wrote a thesis
that was probably substantially ghost
written about how England was dealing
with the Germany crisis Wow and then and
then it was published as a book and it
sold about 80,000 copies of course
Kennedy would publish another growth
profile is encouraged and Joseph he
would pull strings so it won the
Pulitzer yeah it's good to come from
shamily it is pretty good so tell me a
little bit more about how he then
decided to get into about developing
yeah well I the decisive event really
was the death of his brother in 1944
Joseph Peake Kennedy jr. killed in World
War two because really all the hopes
were on on this son and he apparently
was a very impressive guy if you look at
old pictures of the son Joe he was even
way better-looking than JFK he was kind
of bigger JFK was always kind of skinny
and it really devastated the father when
he was killed in the war and they
realize oh boy Jack he's gonna be the
one where we're gonna have all these
political hopes on and the father did
not have high hopes for Ted at that
point - Robert Robert maybe but right
after Kennedy got out of the war of
course he had his distinguished war
career - he ran for Congress in 1946 his
father pulled a lot of strings and he
won a seat in Brookline Massachusetts he
was in the US House
what does pull a lot of strings mean
because I just find the dynasty part of
this fascinating the idea that they're
sort of grooming children that the power
elite can sort of help people get into
play here well pull a lot of strings in
the 1946 election for example so on the
ballot Kennedy was running against a
particular opponents his father found
somebody else with the exact same name
and put that guy's name on the ballot
and then had a whole publicity campaign
for that guy's name I forget the exact
name to be voted for so that that would
split the vote that takes a lot of money
and a lot of kind of naked ambition so
that's an example the kind of hardball
but he played so that's a slight sidebar
when you hear about all the you know
craziness involved in politics these
days and everyone know it's never been
worse and listen to the way people talk
and all that it's like a lot of shady
stuff has been going on for a long time
well I have no idea how we could look
and say the McCarthy era both how
McCarthy was treated and how McCarthy
treated others and say that politics was
warm and fuzzy back in the 40s and the
50s I have no idea how we could say that
yeah so did JFK do you think he had
presidential aspirations then when he
started this this was sort of thrust on
him and he and he became a congressman
but was here already thinking about that
do you think I think so in that it was
well under
that Joe jr. was going to be something
like President of the United States and
so when that could not happen after his
death I think it became pretty clear to
the sons so there was still Jack Robert
and Teddy left and then I think six
girls that they had to take take that
place and so when he ran for Congress
yeah I mean it was to go onward and
upward yeah so he was a congressman do
you know how many years was he a
congressman right up until he ran from
president he was a US Representative
from Brooklyn Massachusetts from from 46
to 52 and then he won a US Senate seat
in Massachusetts bucking the Eisenhower
trend because he ran on the Democratic
side so he was one of the few Democratic
victories in the 1952 election so then
he was a senator for eight years before
he became president yeah did he have any
major accomplishments as a senator well
that's the interesting thing because
when we ask what were his major
accomplishments as presidents let's say
legislatively yeah
really comes down to maybe one or two
tax cut in the Civil Rights Act so
there's not a lot of like major
accomplishments in the whole Kennedy
biography the funny thing about his
career as a legislator in the Senate in
particular mrs. big enthusiasms were two
things number one he was going after the
mob okay which then his son Rob his
brother Robert would be big on and
number two he was an anti-communist in
foreign policy and that that's how he
distinguished himself as a senator yeah
so it's interesting that the
anti-communist part is interesting
because the parties have shifted so much
these days that I'm not saying the left
ever the Democrats are communists now
but that voice that sort of anti
socialism communism voice would rarely
be heard of from the moderate left which
does tell you how these things have
shifted Joseph P Kennedy his father
became persona non grata in the US
government when in 1938 39 he told
Franklin D Roosevelt from his high
position as ambassador in Great Britain
we don't have to worry about the Nazis
so much we have to worry about communism
because communism can overthrow the
American Way of life I think there's a
pretty direct link there to what his son
was doing in the 50s and 60s that's
interesting so he was he viewed it as
Nazism was in a
little threat not within our borders but
communism actually was something that
could come that was Jose feeling yeah
yeah it was kind of kind of prophetic
even is he was a new dealer and all that
he said well New Deal the New Deal could
help save capitalism that was an
erroneous argument but but Joseph P
Kennedy was worried about the onslaught
against capitalism by communism yeah
interesting so it sounds like the Senate
career was sort of less than spectacular
right it doesn't sound like anything
major happened
I think Kennedy was pretty careful he he
began his Senate career ailing he had
back surgery in 1953 as soon as he
became a senator and could not attend
the Senate he was in fact had to be
reclined for a very long time because of
his back injury and that's when he
decided to write profiles encourage his
1956 book 1955 when the appeal in 1956
about the Great's of the Senate over
time so because he was incapacitated he
wanted a show he was still doing Senate
work by writing about Senate history
right yeah god what a beautiful thing to
be in government you don't really have
to do anything and you can write about
the other guys they've done some stuff
it's it's an incredible thing alright
1960 it becomes president he defeats
Richard Nixon who was vice president at
the time I think the one thing that
people really remember is that debate oh
yeah because he was sort of this young
good-looking guy and there was Nixon
sweating is there anything else we have
to remember from from that elections
yeah that so I there was debate in
September 1960 and people always say
that Nixon won on the radio and lost on
televisions that if people just heard
his words or even read the transcript
that he defeated Kennedy but if he
looked on the television that's
black-and-white television and lots of
viewers Kennedy was the youthful bronze
which is probably from his Addison
syndrome not the suntan hero and Nixon
looked like a schlub yeah I don't know
ironic because it was in black and white
but helps and again that was from one of
his ailments yeah that wasn't from the
South Pacific so I don't know I've read
those transcripts and I think Kennedy
clearly won I mean Nixon was saying
things like oh there's been great
economic growth in this country we're
tipping into a recession right then
400,000 people were about to lose their
jobs in the month of October it makes
saying oh we've had the greatest
economic growth with have we've ever had
under Eisenhower I've been three
recessions under Eisenhower now I think
Nixon lost that debate on the transcript
as well
interesting so just to get a sense of
how parties have changed what was that
what were the basic tenants that JFK was
running on you know so John F Kennedy
didn't know what he wanted to run on
this is a classic Kennedy thing we know
we must be presidents the question is
what are we to run it yeah so it was
really the Democratic National Committee
or the putt that the convention that
summer they kind of defined for Kennedy
he had a lot to do with it of course
what the what he would run on and he
decided he would run that on that the
country was not growing enough and he
made his tag line we have to get this
country moving again we have all these
old slow people and governments and he
kept making the point that we have a lot
of recessions he was right there was a
recession in 1954 big one in 1957 and
then it was coming right then in 1960
and he said we got to get out of this
rut and he kept saying we have to get
this country moving again get this
country moving again so that was his
main thing and then he also talked about
after we out we have to get a little
tougher on communism because we're not
moving enough the Soviets are starting
to pass a spy and those were his big
things so when you say that within a
20-18 context it's hard to believe as I
referenced earlier it's hard to believe
that a Democrat would be running against
sort of slow inefficient government but
that is what he did it's kind of
incredible yeah now the Republicans back
then were the big deficit hawks they're
like okay maybe we've had some
recessions but we have a budget deficit
and we have to keep taxes high tax rates
high so we take care of the budget
deficit wouldn't be prudent in that old
George Bush line I mean that's a very
applicable George Bush came of age in
the 1950s to have economic growth if we
don't take care of our deficit first and
that was the defensive position of
Eisenhower and Nixon Kennedy saw that
and saw an opening and ran with it yeah
so what was the beginning of the
presidency like you know when I watch
all of these documentaries now yeah you
know they talked about it was it's so
much about the family and that there was
this feeling of this young person in the
office and all that I suspect there was
more to it than just that okay so when
Kennedy was elected in November
1960 the United States had just tipped
into a recession there were mass layoffs
of hundreds of thousands in October
probably delivered him the election when
that de Sorenson his advisor Thornton
certainly thought so
and then unemployment went all the way
up increased up to five million by night
by January 1961 so when do you know what
that percentage was just for reference
to stri percent now doesn't sound like
that well five million
yeah sorry five million the workforce
the unemployment rate was probably going
up to about eight percent at that point
I'd have to check but probably around
there okay
so Kennedy took office and it's a snow
storm right that just ended before his
inaugural dress famous inaugural dress
and the big problem was there's now a
new recession and then when he gave a
State of the Union address ten days
later in January 1961 he kind of had a
lot of kind of equivalents a equivocal
statements he said we have to get our
house in order yet our country moving
again and we have the government has to
spend a lot of money so we're kind of
laid out two options we have to kind of
get the government more efficient but
also get the government spending a lot
of money so it was unclear what he was
gonna do yeah what does that even mean I
mean do you think he knew at the time
because those sound like statements that
can't work together Richard Reeves who's
his greatest biographer he wrote the
great book on Kennedy 1992 President
Kennedy he said no no what Kennedy liked
to do and I think this is true we have
all the Kennedy tapes we can hear him on
audio the John F Kennedy Library has
some amazing things online we can hear
so much from Kennedy's voice privately
it's pretty clear that he thought
himself kind of the uber intellectual
not a philosophical intellectual but
somebody who could process thoughts and
he would get a lot of good advice and
then pick the best option so that's the
way he would operate he wasn't gonna
figure it out himself he was gonna wait
and see and then make a strategic
decision so you think when he brought up
those seemingly conflicting ideas that
he actually did mean it and that
eventually he he would widdle it away
with the right people behind it and now
this sort of gets to to what your book
was about which one did he end up going
for okay and and
this good you went for both okay so
Larry Keller and I wrote this book JFK
in the Reagan Revolution about the John
F Kennedy tax cut and the big reason is
what Larry my co-author has had to deal
with for 15-20 years he gets this at
parties from the likes of people like
Caroline Kennedy he gets it on
television CNBC how dare you say that
the John F Kennedy tax cut had anything
to do with the Reagan tax cut because
that tax cut was designed by Keynes
Ian's in order to stimulate demand in
the economy and Larry said I don't think
so
and he's right all right wait little is
cause for just a sec though can you tell
me a little bit about the tax cut
specifically yeah so we have the
framework okay yeah so there was a tax
cut in 1964 so after Kennedy's president
after Kennedy died that was his
brainchild and that actually was his
main legislative accomplishment but he
was president for a thousand days ahead
and he didn't get anything done really
on the economy until he introduced that
tax cut in 1963
so in 61 and 62 he was doing his famous
vacillating that's when he was thinking
about hey the Keynes ears are saying we
need loose money from the Federal
Reserve and we need a lot of social
programs and he was experimenting with
that forecast came in there's gonna be
another recession he pulled back and
said wait we need some more deep
thinking Keynesian said keep doing it
but then pulled in other people what do
you say no we need a big marginal tax
cut I get it when the stock market
crashed in April 1960 to June 1962 he
said ok we need a big marginal tax cut
how powerful was the presidency at this
time you know one of the things that we
talked about on this show alive is just
that the executive branch just keeps
getting more power more power does all
this stuff via executive action a lot of
this when you hear about it I think the
average person thinks wait a minute is
it the president's job really grows to
be doing all this isn't he supposed to
sign the law is not really making the
law right it's interesting on that score
is that John F Kennedy was actually not
terribly interested in making unique
executive actions actually with each of
his executive sign at signing signings
he had these signing statements that
went on and on and on about how
justified his signature was sometimes
now we did they just saw yeah now it's
just ya know he
that signature man so good I think
that's the residents yeah yeah so he
[Music]
we've got more presidents week in
partnership with learn liberty foria
today that's five shows in five days
with five experts on five different
presidents of the United States joining
me today is a professor of political
philosophy at Clemson University the
executive director of the Clemson
Institute for the Study of capitalism
and the author of two books on John
Adams see bradlee Thompson welcome to
the Rubin report hi Dave it's great to
be here with you I've seen the studio
many many times and it's great to
finally be here well it's great to have
you here you know out of all of the
professors that I'm talking to you this
week you're the only one that I've met
before and we've worked together before
yeah we did an event at Clemson of
course with Jordan Peterson and on car
gate from Iran Institute and just very
briefly before we dive into John Adams I
just when I left that weekend and Jordan
I talked about it after I just thought
what you guys were doing there was
spectacular the amount of young people
talking about freedom I'm talking about
capitalism you took us to a little event
in the afternoon with some of your top
tier students and we sat around and just
talked about ideas and they had great
questions so just very briefly can you
just kind of tell me about what you're
doing there and then and then we'll talk
about yeah yeah absolutely so I think in
your interview with Jordan Peterson and
Ben Shapiro a couple of days ago you
mentioned an idea revolution and and I
think that's precisely what we're trying
to do at Clemson so in addition to being
a professor political philosophy I run
the Clemson Institute for the Study of
capitalism and the Institute is
America's first and only university
based teaching and research center
dedicated to exploring the moral
foundations of a free society and more
recently in the last three or four years
we've started a brand new program called
the Lyceum Scholars Program and what it
does is it offers a scholarship to
incoming freshmen and we use a great
books approach to studying the history
of Liberty capitalism the American
Founding and the principles of moral
character
and there's simply no program in the
United States like this it's it's the
students are required to take eight
classes together as a cohort one each
semester over their four years and we're
trying to create a new kind of
intellectual community one that is based
around big ideas great books and in a
genuine interest in the history and
development of the idea of freedom yeah
well it was just very obvious to me and
to Jordan that you guys were just doing
great work I mean just the questions we
were asked even I had a few hours in the
afternoon I was just wandering around
campus and kids were coming up to me and
asking me you know it's one thing they
wanted to say I take it something but
they really wanted to talk about
politics I was like this is this is
absolutely amazing so so good work well
thank you and we have to have you back
yeah we'd love to have you back with
Jordan and and and others and and and
you also work with Brandon Turner by the
way yes the former guest of the Reuben
board and also a great professor yeah
Brandon is a member of the Clemson
Institute and a good friend
great all right so let's talk John Adams
yeah so we're doing a lot of founders
this week not not all founders but the
three really James Madison Thomas
Jefferson and John Adams yeah I think I
actually know the least about John Adams
out of the three so this is going to be
a little bit of a learning experience
for me too you've written two books on
John Adams so first off the way I've
started all these is just a little bit
on the brief history just as a young
person what do we need to know well but
before I start with Adams as he as a boy
in a young man let me just begin with a
kind of controversial claim in my view
of the Adams is the most important the
most accomplished of all of America's
founding fathers I think this can be
demonstrated it's provable and hopefully
over the course of the next hour so
we'll find out so and I think Adams was
the revolutions greatest man of ideas
and I think he was the greatest man of
and we'll talk about that I talked about
that over the course of our time who was
John Adams born in 1735 in Braintree
Massachusetts he was the son of a farmer
and a shoemaker so he came from very
very modest means he was raised in a
Calvinist
Puritan culture he was home-schooled
essentially until he was 16 first just
in as his parents home and then as I
think starting maybe as an eight year
old boy he would go to a local literally
a home school right where someone would
take in four or five students and teach
them in their home
he went to Harvard when he was 16 and it
was at Harvard though that you really
see the flowering of a new person as a
result of a kind of intellectual
confrontation with the Enlightenment so
raised in as I said in this Calvinist
Puritan family and culture gets to
Harvard and he's introduced to the ideas
of the Enlightenment more particularly I
would say he's introduced to two books
that that change his life the first is
Newton's Principia Mathematica and the
second is John Locke's essay concerning
human understanding and from Newton he
learns that the universe is governed by
by universal absolute physical laws of
nature from Locke he learns that he
learns the possibility of what we might
call a the creation of a demonstrative
or secular science of ethics so he
combines these two ideas when when he
when he's at Harvard and he starts to
think seriously about developing a kind
of naturalistic moral philosophy right
after he graduates from Harvard he takes
a job as a as a schoolmaster in a
one-room schoolhouse
in Worcester Massachusetts and if you
think about it where is Worcester
Massachusetts in in 1757 it is literally
on the western frontier of civilization
certainly yeah British civilization and
so here here he is in a village of maybe
five hundred people in a one-room
schoolhouse for a couple of years
teaching eight-year-old boys and there
are great stories that he tells in his
diary about his experience during that
time and I have to say I mean it mirrors
my own my own life I taught for two
years at an all-boys boarding school
teaching teaching young boys and I can
tell you you have to learn to grow up
real fast trying to teach young boys
well much of anything yeah and so it was
during this time during this two or
three-year period that he's in Worcester
Massachusetts that that John Adams young
John Adams who's now say 21 years old is
really starting to think about who and
what he is and wants to be so he begins
a diary and in this diary he you know
first he confronts his Puritan
background and there are there are
tortured passages where he's really try
he's wrestling with the foundations of
Calvinist theology and and ultimately he
comes during these years he finally
comes to reject Calvinist theology so he
rejects the idea of total depravity
original sin unconditional elections and
and he really sort of embraces the idea
that that you can through primarily
through reason through introspection and
one's observation of the world that you
can develop a moral philosophy
I mean Adams was Adams was always
religious beginning to end but he really
did think it was possible to develop
what we might call the secular science
of ethics yeah that's really interesting
let's just pause there for a second
because I think that's one of the themes
that we talked about on this show a lot
right people of faith and not of faith
who are constantly trying to figure out
well where do morals come from and he
remained a religious person and also I
was I'm gonna read a specific quote to
you in a little bit
yeah about his feelings on that but then
also did acknowledge the separation of
church and state to which is sort of but
although maybe not as specifically as
perhaps Thomas Jefferson right James man
which is a really interesting little
piece yeah and and I mean through
studying John Adams and and particularly
studying him at this age so when he's in
his early 20s I mean you you you really
see it's a kind of pivotal point in
American history when we went when
Americans colonial Americans transition
out of particularly those in New England
when they transition out of their
adherence to this Calvinist theology to
becoming you know essentially a kind of
enlightenment nation and and and so he's
he's struggling with his religion he's
struggling with how to how to establish
this kind of demonstrative science of
ethics and what he does is he in this in
part he gets from Locke and Newton is
it's the study of human nature and how
do you study human nature well the first
thing you do is you introspect you turn
inward you look look inward on yourself
right and you you try to figure out who
and what you are and and what your
motives are when you act and and how it
is and why it is that you get angry in
certain situations and and and the
results the effects that certain kinds
of behaviors have on other people then
the second thing is you just look out
into the world right and you observe
other people and so for instance in his
diary he has passages where he just a
young man where he describes a fight a
conjugal fight between his parents and
it's it's clearly upsetting to him he
goes upstairs to his bedroom and he sits
down and then he writes out a long
passage describing
the passions that affected both of his
parents and how one can overcome those
passions and then the third vehicle by
which you can study human nature he says
is by studying history history is a kind
of laboratory for studying human nature
history is in a sense for Adams
philosophy by example and so he slowly
in the late seventeen fifty s develops
this sort of moral philosophy that is
that is that is focused on his own
individual development his the primary
virtue of the what we might call the
architectonic virtue is self-governance
right how do you govern yourself and and
he developed a series of virtues
connected with self-governance which is
it's very interesting that that he does
this at that age he was 21 when he
starts this and instead of saying part
because Benjamin Franklin when he was
the same age as Adams decides that he
wants to achieve moral perfection and
you can read about this in in Franklin's
autobiography which and if you think
about it I mean this is extraordinary
and Adams was concerned but the same
thing moral perfection how do I become
if not morally perfect the the most
virtuous kind of person that that I can
be or one can be Franklin develops a
sort of like a pre Jordan Peterson
thirteen step program for moral
perfection he establishes thirteen
virtues and he creates a chart right by
which one can can practice each week one
one virtue and you go it's a it's
literally a thirteen step program to
moral perfection and John Adams does
something very similar to that
and it's I mean people always ask ask me
the question how is it why is it that we
got this extraordinary generation of
revolutionary leaders right Adams
Washington Franklin Jefferson Madison
Hamilton that were often very separate I
mean Geographic absolutely they were all
separate right but it all in the end I
think I mean the explanation for how and
why we got this generation at one moment
in time is is the moral education that
they all undertook when they were very
young men and that was a big part of of
18th century American culture the focus
the really intense focus on one's more
own moral development yeah it's
interesting because we could use
probably a little more in that these
days but as you just referenced Jordan
Peterson I think that has a lot to do
with all the reasons that he's catching
fire yeah no he is so I wanted to read
this quote to you because I think it
gets right to what you're talking about
and and the play that John Adams had
with religion which is so interesting to
me this quote he said our Constitution
was made only for a moral and religious
people it is wholly inadequate to the
government of any other
that almost sounds a little reverse of
the way the rest of the founders might
have viewed religion and government do
you think that's a fair estimation um no
I think that probably would have been
shared by most of of the revolutionary
generation because it says a moral and
religious people now they were
separating church and state but I guess
morality was tied so into religion at
the time either way although he was
working on this way sort of to solve
that problem yeah I mean I I think the
view of the entire revolutionary
generation is that you can't have a you
can't have a free society made up of
moral reprobates right and so for the
founding generation there was there
there must be a connection between moral
virtue in a free society so in many ways
I mean they're of course best-known to
us
by what they created politically right
by by the Constitution and the
revolutionary state constitutions but in
in many ways I think their greatest
contribution which we have entirely
neglected in the in the late 20th and
now in the early 21st century is their
understanding of morality right now
we're all of them five-point Calvinists
no somewhere were all of them atheists
well even fewer were atheists even
Thomas Jefferson who probably came the
closest to to you know not being
religious believed him even Jefferson
himself believed that that most people
needed religion of some kind right in
and they had I mean we'll take Adams and
Jefferson they had I think a kind of
utilitarian view of religion so whether
each one I'm eeen how how devout each
was in their own personal life can be
disputed but what can't be disputed I
think is that they is that they did
think that that that religion could
serve a useful purpose and function in
society not everybody can be at John
Adams or at Thomas Jefferson
not everybody can be a philosopher and
so I think ultimately in the end what
they did was they attempted to reconcile
philosophy and religion yeah so this
seems to be a little bit of the macro
micro argument on religion and morality
so we've done this a couple times in
this very studio where I've had Dennis
Prager and Michael Shermer on where
Michael comes from the point of that you
can have be completely moral without
religion right Dennis says that at the
micro level you right there can be but
in at a societal level on the macro
level that it doesn't quite work it
sounds like there's a little bit of that
idea in there no I mean I think III
think that's right in terms of the
founding fathers though I think there's
there's really no question
that that that they thought that that
religion and philosophy would have to be
reconciled in in some kind of way that
were to put it differently that Athens
and Jerusalem right would have to be
reconciled reason and revelation now
whether the philosopher can actually
whether whether the philosopher actually
thinks that in fact is true is a
completely different question so can
there can there be both moral virtue and
freedom without religion well I think
absolutely there can be and but the
question is how do you convince three
hundred and fifty million rather of your
fellow citizens of that and and how how
do you get them to be to actually be
moral in their lives here now today
without without without that crutch now
I think there are ways and do you think
so is that right there is that sort of
the the linchpin of everything else that
John Adams believed do you think that's
sort of his most important post that he
staked in hindsight given the context of
the world in which we live today yeah I
think we have a lot to learn from Adams
and in fact it's really just only been
in the last couple of weeks that I've
decided that I'm a not certain yet but I
may be writing in what I would call a
moral biography of John Adams and the
purpose of which is to introduce to 21st
century Americans particularly the kind
of audience that Jordan Pederson is
appealing to introducing to them at the
very least introducing to them the moral
seriousness of this extraordinary
generation of Americans
there's a sense in which there's a sense
in which and I think particularly in the
context of the world in which we live
today
politics is becoming increasingly
irrelevant if not or secondary and if
there's going to be I mean you've talked
about an idea revolution and I think a
big part of that idea revolution has to
be a kind of moral revolution and you
know as Breitbart Andrew Breitbart
famously said you know cult politics is
down I'll go even further economics is
downstream from politics politics is
downstream from culture and culture is
downstream from ideas and ideas are
housed in the universities and if we if
there's going to be an idea revolution I
think it has to begin with morality and
we need a kind of in an age of nihilism
I do think we need a kind of moral
revolution and one way to get at it
would be to go back to our founding
fathers yeah well that's why I wanted to
do so many of the founders in this first
presidents week that we're doing and
obviously this particular topic fits
within the sort of larger thing that
we're doing here what else do we need to
know about his sense of morality I mean
what did he really believe those tenants
to be well I mean he formulated it in
different ways at different times but I
think one could probably sum up his
moral view with three pillars believe in
God be kind to other people and govern
yourself but Adams really only focused
on the third one right which is
interesting if you if you read his diary
his autobiography all of his political
writings and more and maybe even more
importantly if you read the advice that
that he gives to his own children like
for instance in letters to his son John
Quincy Adams
when John Quincy was a young boy 13 when
when he's sending John Quincy Adams
advice you know on how to become a young
man the focus the emphasis is almost
entirely on how to govern oneself and
how do you govern oneself or what it for
instance what are the books that one can
read well it's it's never the Bible it
is Aristotle Nicomachean ethics Cicero
cicero's de o'fee key Seneca and
epictetus so ancient Greek and Roman
yeah moral philosophers in other words
pre-christian pagan moralist and yet he
has this important religious piece
that's hatched to him in seemingly a
more intimate way I guess that's what
I'm finding it seems like he had it in a
more personal way than some of the other
founders did yeah well certainly more
than Jefferson that that that is I think
that is that is true and but probably
more so he had probably he certainly had
a little slightly more religion I mean
he almost Adams was almost a deist he
wasn't quite as as much of a deist this
Thomas Jefferson was but look there that
were there revolutionaries and founding
[Music]
we're kicking off presidents week here
on the Rubin report and partnership with
learn liberty and we're talking about
five different presidents in five
different days with five different
academics and joining me today is a
professor of history at the United
States Military Academy at West Point
Rob McDonald Rob welcome to the Reuben
report thanks Dave it's great to be here
I'm very excited to talk to you I'm glad
we're kicking off presidents week with
you because we're gonna talk about the
man that you have written this book
about and edited several other books
about Thomas Jefferson everyone knows my
feelings about Thomas Jefferson this is
this is my favorite founder I think this
is the person whose politics have sort
of affected me personally the most so
let's let's just dive right in so let's
just you know so I really want to do
some one-on-one stuff and then I want to
extrapolate on sure on his greater
political philosophies and things in
later life and all that tell me a little
bit just about childhood first let's
just go into some history well you know
Jefferson was born and what was
essentially the edge of civilization in
1743 in the Piedmont of Virginia
his father was kind of an interesting
guy's name is Peter Jefferson he was
sort of a planner you know sort of an
aristocrat but also kind of a pioneer
and with a William and Mary math
professor named Joshua fry Peter
Jefferson plotted this map that would
serve is the kind of signature map of
Virginia for a good 100 years so you
know he was out there in the wilderness
and Native Americans would come through
Jefferson's house and you know travel
with his dad to Williamsburg where his
father was a member of the House of
Burgesses so were they actually
surveyors so they were doing sort of
what Washington did as well and really
looking at the land and parceling out
where houses were gonna be where roads
were gonna be mainly what they're do is
they were plotting the boundary line
between Virginia and North Carolina you
know so there was sort of an agreed-upon
location of it but they were putting
that within the context of the actual
you know natural topography gotcha so
what else do we need to know about his
childhood specifically its siblings
anything we know about his education
anything like well I mean you know
Jeffers
has a first memory and I guess we all
have first memories in his first memory
I think is especially poignant and maybe
relevant to what I predict will come up
in the rest of our discussion when he
was three years old his family was
moving temporarily from near
Charlottesville to a house of a relative
and the James River between the
Williamsburg in Richmond and Jefferson
was being carried on a pillow looking up
into the face of an enslaved man so I
mean this is a the world edged into his
mind and this result this is the world
into which he is born Wow that that is
incredible
what about education-wise do we do we
know anything about high school you know
just the later before before the
politics yeah so you know he had a
number of different teachers when he was
at this this house this family house
that they moved to called Tuckahoe
he had essentially a grammar school
teacher later on he had a teacher who
focused on Greek and Latin and then you
know in his late teens he moved to
Williamsburg and became a student at the
College of William and Mary and it was
kind of a an interesting time to be in
Williamsburg
you know when Jefferson was reading for
the law he was I believe 21 years old
and you know he heard Patrick Henry in
the House of Burgesses I'm talking about
the Stamp Act you know and he and he
said essentially you know Caesar had as
Brutus referring to King George the 3rd
and you know people shouted treason
treason and this is when Henry said if
this is treason make the most of it yeah
and you know here's young Jefferson kind
of hanging in the doorway listening in
and you know clear of those years were
formative for yeah are there any other
formative moments like that that kind of
set up his political beliefs um it's
interesting I mean that's a good
question I don't know I mean his his
beliefs are being formed in part by all
the different books that he reads and I
mean there a lot it was a vociferous
reader I mean when I went to Monticello
which we'll talk about yet I mean they
talked about all his library and he was
inventing things I mean this guy loved
knowledge he sure did so much that he
had
the largest library in the Western
Hemisphere Wow I mean that's pretty
incredible
is that you know at the house in
Monticello is that it well he had
several different libraries over the
course of his life you know it's a shame
one of the things that we don't know
about his childhood is exactly you know
what he was reading as a youngster we
have a list of books that his father
owned his father unfortunately died when
Jefferson was about 13 years old so we
have an inventory of his estate but you
know Jefferson's family house burned in
the 1770s
and you know he lost essentially his
first library so there are a few
questions about you know his early
intellectual development but you know
over the course of his life he owned a
number of different libraries including
the one that he would sell to the
Library of Congress after the British
you know burned down the Capitol they
needed new books and you know the books
that he supplied you know increased
their their collection tremendously I'm
always fascinated by that particularly
because it's like did these people learn
their political philosophies by reading
or that they were alive during the
founding of the country they knew why we
came here right you know and and that
it's always just sort of built into them
what freedom is and I suspect it's
probably a little bit of both I think
you're right I mean you know Jefferson's
law professor was this incredibly
significant guy named George width and
you know he trained a generation of
Juris through his perch at the College
of William and Mary and George Wythe
introduced Jefferson to a ruthie kind of
elite circle Jefferson you know played
the violin and the the governor at the
time when Jefferson was were a student
the royal governor in Williamsburg would
have these dinners slash jam sessions
guns you know young Thomas Jefferson
would be included and you could just
sort of imagine the kind of
conversations that he was you know party
to yeah and you know it was it was a
kind of formative moment not only for
him but also for the country that would
become the United States do we know
about any of his other big influences at
the time as far as individuals yeah just
people that he was around
anyone else that maybe flew under the
radar yeah I mean you know he had a
really good friend named Dabney Carr I
think their friendship was was you know
pretty pretty typical for the time they
when they were boys would would run up
this mountain that was near Jefferson's
childhood home and they would hang out
there under this this oak tree and they
made a pledge to each other that the
first one to die would be buried by the
survivor under that tree and that
mountain that they were you know hiking
up became Monticello Wow where jefferson
built his home and when car
unfortunately passed away jefferson made
good on his promise and that's the basis
for the the Monticello cemetery wow
that's interesting I didn't know that
yeah I must have seen it and or maybe
it's part of the tour yeah well I'd it's
at the end of the tour so uh it's a
quick walk yeah
but definitely worth seeing and you know
I mean that cemetery includes people who
have passed away
you know since Jefferson's life but it
includes you know many of the most
important people in his life including
his his wife you know his wife and he
married and I believe 1769
and they you know had many children
together including a few who didn't
survive infancy we know also that she
had some some miscarriages and
eventually she would die of
complications of from childbirth you
know before he hit age 40 so she's
buried there as well and that out she
has a big influence on him so what do we
know about his political philosophy
around the founding time yeah I mean he
Jefferson wrote that in some ways the
most elemental books of public right
were John Locke's two treatises on
government he thought very highly of
Montesquieu he felt very highly of
Shaftesbury so essentially you know he
he was imbibing these works of people
who we could probably call classical
liberals um you know John Locke had a
that's where I was trying to get you to
go yeah well I was hoping you were gonna
say you know I think it's it's a point
that people would agree on I mean you
know John Locke has this unenviable task
to explain to the British people why the
Glorious Revolution of 1688 was was okay
why is it legitimate to overturn one
monarch and bring in new ones like
William and Mary and essentially you
said you know in the state of nature all
people have have rights they pre exist
government you know you have the right
to life and liberty and property problem
in the state of nature is you don't
necessarily have security and so people
band together with others to
reciprocally protect their rights and
that's the origin of government that's
what government is for to protect
individual rights and if government you
know should cease protecting individual
rights or worse right if government
should trample upon those rights people
have the obligation to first petition
right and in complain but if the
government continues a long train of
abuses and usurpations right then they
have you know the obligation to rise up
and have a revolution and establish a
government that does the job that
government is supposed to do yeah and so
it's interesting because he was writing
about that at the same time he was also
building the institutions that have
given us so much freedom I mentioned
right before we started I mean the the
Jefferson Memorial which is a little off
the beaten path so people don't go to it
as much as they go to the Washington
mind him in or the Lincoln Trail or
whatever else but I was just there a few
months ago and you know it's it's a
circular building and they have these
giant plaques with some of his writing
and it's like man this guy his
understanding of what freedom is what
tolerances tolerance in the dry sense
his understand you know he's writing
about God but also at the same time
talking about why we desperately need a
separation of church and state yeah he's
he's writing about as later in life he
was writing laws to help free the slaves
while he owned slaves I think all of
those reasons are why he affected me so
much because it's like he was a complex
man of his time really grappling with
with really hard issues and wasn't a
perfect human while doing it yeah he
wasn't um and and I'm sure that will
come up but you know I think in some
ways one of his most interesting
monuments is the one he designed for
himself his gravestone and you know in
the spring of the final year
his life he designed it you know he
wanted it to be an obelisk and he
brought his epitaph and he wanted it to
read you know here was Barry Thomas
Jefferson author of the American
Declaration of Independence father of
the Virginia statute for religious
freedom and and father of the University
of Virginia and it's amazing when you
think about all right let me think about
what he didn't put on it Yeah right
he didn't he didn't mention I was a
member of the House of Burgesses he
didn't mention that he was remember the
Continental Congress there's a member of
Congress under the Articles of
Confederation didn't mention that he was
our ambassador to France
our first Secretary of State our second
vice president our third president yeah
he mentions instead that he's cutting of
the of the resume well it is been but
think about what it means right I mean
if he focuses on the Declaration right
which gives us political freedom and he
focuses on the Virginia statute for
religious freedom and in the University
of Virginia I mean you know the body and
the mind and the spirit and I think what
he was trying to tell us is that as far
as he was concerned his greatness came
not from the power that people gave to
him right but by them happen but from
the power that he restored to people
yeah I love that I mean that that sums
it up right there this may sound like
this sort of a mature question but do we
know how much work everyone was doing
together on the Declaration of
Independence actually um you know he
does it's probably fair to say that
Jefferson writes 95 percent of the words
that appear in the final text there were
there were some changes that we know
were made by by John Adams for example
in Jefferson's one of his early drafts
instead of writing we hold these truths
to be self-evident
he had it as sacred and undeniable you
know the exact same what's the nature of
the change there because those don't
sound - at odds with each other I don't
think they're at odds with each other at
all I think I think that in some ways
the Declaration is I mean this this
won't be a very satisfying answer for
people but I think that some changes in
the Declaration were made because they
sounded better and you know not to get
too much you got to sell this they've
already do what you do and you know so
there's this late scholar it's Dan
her name Jeff legally wrote a book
called declaring independence and he
made this pretty cool discovery so there
is an early engraving a printing of the
Declaration of Independence that has all
these strange punctuation marks littered
through it and you know five seen this
thing and for the longest time I thought
what's up with this and it turns out
that Jefferson in his library had a book
on rhetoric and it essentially said that
there is this natural like human ear
like people hear things in a way that
they find compelling and there are
certain rhythms certain patterns certain
ways to emphasize words that helps make
ideas more compelling and he suggested
that when people wrote speeches or you
know arguments they should use a system
of abbreviations and symbols to
demonstrate ok here is where you pause
here is where you add F emphasis to take
note of the rhythm and these symbols
correspond to these strange punctuation
marks that appear on this engraving in
other words it's as if Jefferson had and
early drafted the Declaration that we've
never seen yeah because it was passed
along to this printer and and so why did
Jefferson go with life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness instead of you know
the classic Lockean formulation of life
liberty and property yeah I think in
part because it just says better flow so
I wanted to ask you specifically about
that like life liberty and the pursuit
of happiness
okay so life were here okay liberty our
freedom the pursuit of happiness yeah is
one of the most to me it's like the most
incredible phrase you could possibly put
in a founding document I think maybe
only one other country is there one
other country that is pursuit of
happiness do you know I'm not sure if
yeah I think one other country and I'm
blanking on who it is has something to
that effect but it's such an empowering
statement to put in there because it's
really saying it's on you people like
well you know we'll protect your life
you know will protect your Liberty but
pursuit of happiness get going sure it's
fascinating
absolutely yeah I mean I think the
Declaration of Independence just
deserves its reputation as this world
historical document and it kind of sums
up a philosophy of freedom I mean just
think about you know the sentence from
what
that that quote is taken you know we
hold these truths to be self-evident
that all men are created equal that
they're endowed by their creator not the
government with certain inalienable
rights that among these are life liberty
and the pursuit of happiness and then
here's the part the quote often ends
there but the sentence continues that to
secure these rights governments are
instituted among men deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed
so there's kind of a twin test of
legitimacy as far as governments are
concerned first they have to protect
individual rights that's their goal
right but the means by which they
achieve that goal you know need to be
democratic there's so much there so
let's let's unpack all of it so endowed
by their creator was there any debate
with them on whether that needed to be
in there or because they it would seem
like they all basically there was a
belief in God I think sure by most of
them at least I don't know that were any
of them known to be atheists I don't
think anyone was known to be a theist
but there was definitely a spectrum of
belief well you know so but that's that
phrase is interesting because they
purposely put that in there to say that
something you own something yourself
before government which is really
interesting and yet at the same time he
Jefferson especially was so clear about
the separation between church and state
right which is really kind of
fascinating well I mean the church is
too important to be contaminated by the
state right I mean you know in the
church when you think about it what was
that really the view or was it that he
didn't want the church infecting that I
think it was both it was both
it was absolutely both I mean you know
what absolute power corrupts absolutely
when you think about the Dark Ages right
I mean you have tremendous collusion
between the church and the government
the King receives his legitimacy from
from the Pope right and in turn the king
would require everyone to support the
church and you know if you went against
the state you were going against God and
when you went to the when you went to
your execution as punishment there was
not only a government you know
executioner but there was a priest
standing next to him to tell you that
you were gonna go to hell I mean this is
an incredibly powerful combination and I
think
- powerful yeah and I think a lot of
people don't really know that because
even for myself in a pretty well-versed
in this stuff I'm watching the crown on
Netflix and our - yeah and I didn't
realize how intertwined the monarchy was
Ronnie Church I guess I I guess I should
have known but it really was and that
was part of what they were trying to
protect against sure and and so I mean
when Jefferson is thinking about all
right so that's a wonderful moment for
reform we have declared our independence
we have a blank slate and you know how
can we make it so that we actually have
a fighting chance of surviving as a
[Music]
again I want to thank you all for and
brownie you're doing a heck of a job
FEMA directors working 24/7 CBS FEMA as
well as the hosts of the Michael Brown
radio show Michael Brown
welcome to the Reuben report hey Dave
good to see you good to be with the eggs
you know this is the first time we've
ever done this where we played a ten
second clip let me get do you have any
idea well I can't I can't even imagine
what you might be talking about yes
I've struggled with it for a little
while because I thought do I want to go
right in and throw this right at him
sort of the infamous moment or do we
want to ease into it but then I thought
let's just let's just get it out there
because it it is what it is it's a
seminal moment in my life yet there's
there's before that moment then after
that moment yeah all right there are
many many reasons that I'm glad to be
sitting here with you because I think
we're gonna get into so many of the
things that we talked about on the show
all the time about the role of
government and the difference between
local government and federal government
all of these agencies and red tape and
all that but also that for that moment
and what happened for the months and
probably years after and actually even I
wouldn't I was googling you this morning
all the 10 year anniversary at we're
still pissed on you and all that stuff
it has a lot to do with just sort of the
general outrage culture and blame
culture and all of that so right we're
gonna do a lot here so first let's just
start with that moment though and then
and then I want to do everything else
back sure okay just tell me a little bit
about the days leading up to Hurricane
Katrina I it became clear to me probably
within well it came clear to me the day
after the storm made landfall because I
was on a Black Hawk helicopter with
former senator Mary Landrieu and we were
supposed to be going straight to the
Superdome to meet with mayor Nagin who I
always like to joke is remind people
he's still in federal prison
and in I'm sitting there and I'm not I'm
just kind of reading my notes from my
staff and I look out the helicopter and
I realize that we're going the wrong
direction across Lake Pontchartrain and
I asked the pilot were you going and he
said well the senator has asked that we
go check her cabin before we go to the
Superdome I was livid so now I have a
sitting united state senator next to me
who's just overridden what I said we
need to be doing and what the priorities
are I have the governor sitting next to
her who doesn't have the wherewithal to
say to the senator you know what your
cabin is not our priority the priority
is the people of New Orleans it was a at
that moment that I realized that I had
walked into a state that was so much
more corrupt I've been involved in
politics since I was literally six years
old that it was just so corrupt and it
was so dysfunctional
that I knew that everything that I had
in my hand about how things should
operate we're gonna start going out the
window okay I think that's actually a
perfect story to now start with your
childhood let's just let's just get a
little bio to you because I think that's
really interesting and what led you to
eventually be the director and then
we'll go through everything else right
so just tell me a little bit about
growing up was your family political
what sort of got you into this world Oh
Mike you know my family was kind of
political when I think about it I mean
my mom is 86 87 years old
and she still works for the Election
Board she still does the little local
elections in the little town that I grew
up I think you have to be over 80 to
work at the exactly I think there's a
requirement she's been doing it since
she was in high school but when the
first Republican governor of Oklahoma
was running he was at state party
chairman a guy by the name of Henry
Bellmon was coming out to the Oklahoma
Panhandle and they recruited me at six
years old to be the little kid to hand
to push cards out as he walked these
rural streets of Oklahoma so I just grew
up in this political family that was
always involved and of course you know
involved in student council and you know
in college and young Republicans and all
of that and so politics has just always
been a part of my life yeah and now he
thought I understood politics until I
got to Washington DC
and until hurricane katrina and they
just gave me an entirely different
perspective yeah but anyway long story
short you know I took the typical route
graduate from high school to my my my
wife is my childhood sweetheart her dad
actually delivered me wow that's the
kind of small town we grew up in
Wow we've been married for gosh forty
some years I don't want to say how many
and you know went to law school raised
two children very successful very very
successful children and just had a
pretty normal life except that I knew I
wanted to be a lawyer but I always had
this thought process that you never turn
down and you always look at an
opportunity and if an opportunity looks
good you take that opportunity even if
it's off the path you thought you were
going to take and so that's led me to
these incredible incredible experiences
in my life that most people don't do
because they become lawyers and all they
do is practice law their entire life
yeah That's not me so what was the first
one of those moments when you thought
well there's a good opportunity a little
little to the right off that exit the
home Republican Party came to me and
asked me to run for Congress back in
1988 promised me all of this money that
they were gonna in fact that governor
who was the first Republican governor
went on to be a u.s. senator and then
came back he was a big supporter of me
but I was running Henry Bellmon yeah
former US senator he was involved in the
Panama Canal treaties and everything but
the Oklahoma Republican Party recruited
me and said you know come on we really
want you to run and so I let Eagle get
in the way and I ran against a 12 term
Democrat incumbent in a gerrymandered
district where I got my butt beat but it
was it was an experience that again
most Americans never do most Americans
never throw their hat in the ring and
actually go out and say I'm gonna do it
and I would encourage people whether
it's a city council County Commissioner
state representative whatever it is if
you don't like the way things are going
if you're gonna about I don't
really hear about it unless you're
actually involved doing something
doesn't mean you have to run for office
but you got to be involved yeah it's so
funny after that
that you've been through I guess it's
maybe it's not funny it's either ironic
or perfectly poetic but that still is
your message as someone that you know we
sort of put up as the poster boy for
everything that's wrong with women Dave
let me tell you it may be poetic but it
sorry I quit pointing it's the lawyer it
is I could tell you so many stories
about how dysfunctional state I'm at
I've been involved as a city councilman
I've worked at state legislature as a
finance director didn't you go on I'm
the Undersecretary of Homeland Security
I have seen I have been inside the
bowels of the government and I can tell
you how it works and it is not what most
Americans think yes and we're gonna get
to all of that so the Under Secretary of
Homeland Security that is the director
of FEMA correct that's the gross just
sort of the the more technical term for
that were you involved in the
administration before 9/11 or was it
after the bats when bush no peg you for
no we I was there yeah and in fact I was
in Montana
getting ready to deliver a speech to the
national emergency managers Association
about the role of FEMA in terrorism on
9/11 2001 so you were the director of
him at that time I was I was a general
counsel at that okay and we ended up on
c-135 going back to Andrews Air Force
Base Joe all ba who was the director at
the time immediately went went to ground
zero on that Wednesday morning and I
went to the White House and just spent
the next gosh seems like year just day
in and day out just planning getting
ready for we didn't know what yeah
what's the one thing that really sticks
out in your mind about that day itself
for the first time you you are you're
flying alone there are no planes in the
sky you're flying alone some Airmen
asked me if I want to go down in the
tanker Bay and and just watch as we fly
across you know middle America and I'm
listening on the on the headset and the
only chatter you hear are among the
fighter jets that are flying around the
country and when I landed it was not
knowing it was like there was this blank
wall in front of us
none of us knew what was going to happen
next and so we meet in the Roosevelt
Room in the Situation Room that next
morning to get briefing by the CIA and
everybody else
and I remember just this this quietness
in the room that everybody knew that
none of us knew what we were facing yeah
was there a feeling that George W Bush
was the right guy to handle this because
for all the frustrations that people
right may have with him and that perhaps
you have related to some rug with
Katrina we can get into that right
I do remember at the time and I lived in
New York City at the time so I was there
for 9/11 Roy family was there my grandma
was there my know my dad I do remember
that between George W Bush at the time
but particularly Giuliani I think there
was at least a feeling that these guys
are sort of the right people to be
handling this at the time certainly
Giuliani at least from a New Yorker yes
perspective did you did you feel that
did people feel that within the
government that like that Bush was kind
of able to handle this or have the real
skill set to handle yes it was for me it
was more the most I mean I can still
remember vividly that day in the in the
Roosevelt Room
you've got Tolan Powell you've got
Donald Rumsfeld you've got condi rice
you've got Andy card so you have all
these heavy hitters and here's little
old me sitting at the table too and I
remember watching because I just I'm I'm
an observer of people and I remember
watching all of them and there was none
of the usual because I've been in these
meetings before and there was none of
the usual hey how you do and everybody
was at the table everybody was reading
their briefing everybody was trying to
understand we know that we always
referred to the President as the boss we
know the boss is going to ask some tough
questions and we know we're not gonna
have answers and that's indeed what
happened
you know we had theories we had ideas we
had plans but nobody really knew for
certain Mo's next yeah and especially in
those first few days where we didn't
know if another attack was coming or
what was actually the job of FEMA for
those first few days we are were the
nation's federal first responder we
coordinate all of for example the
Pentagon Ground Zero our job was to make
sure that we had
all of the urban search-and-rescue teams
deployed that we take care of the
firefighters we provide all the
equipment we provide the training we do
all of that stuff so our job was to
clean up Ground Zero our job was at the
Pentagon to help clean that up and what
was fascinating about it was normally
you go to a disaster it's not also a
crime scene but in this case both the
Pentagon and and and in in in
Pennsylvania and obviously in ground
zero
they were also crime scenes so we now
had to coordinate talking about
federalism so now we had to coordinate
you know the federal government state
government local governments and on top
of that we had to coordinate with the
CIA the FBI the NSA and everybody else
who's doing all of the forensic work how
does that go I mean one of the things we
talk about here a lot is sort of the
unwieldy giant government we have right
now sort of all the middlemen and
bureaucrats that get in the way
everything I mean how did it really go
if that's your job here's what's
fascinating when the government's under
pressure like that everybody does what
you have to my mother-in-law had to say
that drill Mike drives my wife like
crazy dude she's now deceased but it was
you know sometimes you just have to do
what you have to do and when when a
crisis hits of that magnitude it's all
hands on the deck and if you need to
break the rules people are willing to
break the rules to make things happen so
I would say that in in those intense
moments that's probably when the
government tends to do the best job
because everybody's trying their hardest
to do what's best for the country yeah
so how soon after that did W tap you to
be the head of FEMA let's see so shortly
after I became the deputy DRI I'd say
like just a couple of months later I
went from general counsel to deputy
director then they announced the
creation of the department well it's a
story about the creation of DHS yeah so
they're gonna create the DHS so W points
me to the transition team or one of five
people putting together the department
and I apologize to the nation for that
because I've got lots of regrets about
DHS I'm happy to die yeah we will
and then soon thereafter Albaugh left
and that's when I became the
undersecretary and the director of FEMA
so probably within gosh a year yeah boy
and then and just just it's the
mailman's story you know you start in
the mailroom and you work your way up
yeah and only two years after that then
the other crisis in years over here
certainly so tell me a little bit about
your regrets creating the Department of
Homeland Security
here's a backstory first that most
people don't know the administration was
opposed to the creation of the
department we thought it was a mistake
we're gonna create this massive
bureaucracy why things are working the
way they're supposed to work but
Congress felt this political desire that
you have to be seen doing something so
once Congress said hey we're gonna move
forward with legislation then the White
House says oh my god now we've got to
get in front of this because we want to
control it and and mold it in our only
view not Congress's view because in
effect they don't want to get
legislation put on his desk
that he they exactly dough and then it's
like these against all right there
exactly so Kay so our job was a great
example of how screwed it is so so I'm
thrown me and four other guys with clay
Johnson the president's best friend
college roommate deputy director of OMB
we're thrown together to create this
massive new bureaucracy by taking 22
different cultures 22 different cultures
22 different organizations and throwing
them in together and trying to make it
work what are a couple of those
organizations that were I mean it's
everybody right well it was secret
Secret Service what the hell Secret
Service doing in Homeland Security the
the Coast Guard the Coast Guard has this
kind of schizophrenic role they've
worked for homeland security yet they're
subjected to the military code of
conduct and they kind of technically
work for the Pentagon so we've got all
of the you've got that you have ice
Customs and Border Patrol immigration
you different grants for the Department
of Justice FEMA everybody had a
different culture and my objection was
you can't throw different cultures
together and really expect them to work
either in the short term in the long
term every organization corporate
private governmental has a culture and
trying to meld those is the one of the
most difficult things to do
look I love carly fiorina consider her a
friend but they brought Carly in to talk
to us about how to do mergers and
acquisitions and I'm thinking wait a
minute
the HP merger and acquisition that
didn't seem to go too well and you're
gonna tell us how to do this twenty-two
government agency thing I mean that's
one objection then the second objection
was you know we got of airports with a
major concern and for whatever reason we
wanted to blame the private contractors
who have a vested interest in making
sure that the airlines are secure right
but that's not good enough
instead let's fire all of them and let's
create this massive new bureaucracy
called the TSA and I'm unlike the kid in
the back of the classroom that keeps
raising his hand and saying but
professor why how's that gonna work but
there was just hadn't what would happen
when you said something like that cuz
now I think in 2018 if you say something
that the TSA most people agree with you
11 unwieldly ridiculous
moderation the reaction was always well
we're gonna meet your objection by doing
why and I had been around the block long
enough to know that that answer was BS
but when you're the one person out of
five you're outvoted so you you tend to
there's a great Washington Post story
that talks about brown as the
bureaucratic in fighter and I was and
the post writes it is if that's a bad
thing and I considered a badge of honor
because I was fighting for just the
reality that when you tell me that
putting these two put these different
agencies together is gonna be budget
neutral that's BS when you tell me
you're going to create TSA but you're
gonna prevent them from ever being a
union that's BS because I just know how
government metastasizes and so the TSA
has turned out to be what I thought it
was the dysfunction within DHS while it
may be minimally better it's still a
dysfunctional organization so let's back
up for a second cuz you mentioned that
before this the security was it all done
by private companies before the TSA
that's almost hard to believe was it was
it all done by private yeah
the airlines who have who has the most
now you think about just trying to
figure out what's the best way to put a
program together well who has the most
interest in making certain that their
planes are never hijacked or flown into
buildings oh the airlines why don't we
let them decide security because what do
they they have competing interests they
want to make sure their planes are
secure their passengers are safe but
that the security operates in the most
efficient and effective way now you tell
me
government's gonna care about those
three things bs yeah well it's also so
interesting because it's like what a
great way to use competition in the
right sense it's like this airline
that's doing it the right way yes where
they could go you know what look at our
marks on security so we're charging you
five dollars more and a lot of people
wouldn't have a problem with it right it
would it would be a beautiful thing I
didn't realize that it was fully private
before that yes Wow any other I mean
that's a well it's a pretty big issue
but any other big regrets related to
yeah well well for example we had within
[Music]
all right so let's get back to that 10
seconds of videos you know the exact
line even though everyone says a heck of
a job brownie they don't even get that
right you actually say brownie you're
doing a heck of it yeah yeah I just want
to clean that up for you because even
that line day they don't get right ok
how many days into the hurricane was
that oh gosh I want to say is maybe four
maybe five days I've kind of I can flake
time but four five okay so four or five
days yeah what now I watched plenty of
other video today of what you were doing
at the time and there's you're standing
there people can see this on YouTube
you're standing there with giant maps of
the whole area it was very clear to me
at least watching it now that you had
total command of where things were who
was supposed to be where where water was
going to hit harder and this you know
and drugged bush you know it's his
credit he it seemed that he was
listening along with you and you know
doing the best job I think that he could
after was it it was it three minutes
after he says that that you realized
there that the media went crazy with it
that was the minute it was the minute he
said it because here's what you don't
know but you what most people don't know
is that I had told the I called Air
Force One and said when he lands and
gets here I need five minutes before we
do any sort of public photo-op and when
you even if my level of the
undersecretary even when you say I got
to have five minutes with the president
they still want to know why and I said
because he's got to understand before he
walks in front of cameras how bad things
are New Orleans because we're gonna
leave that Air National Guard base get
on marine one and we're gonna fly to New
Orleans and he's gonna start seeing how
screwed up it is in New Orleans and I
want to make sure he understands that
before he gets there so sure we got
plenty time so we walk into the green
room I'm just starting to talk to the
president and they come in and say we
got to get moving presses out here we're
already running late and they pulling
that and I don't have time to breathe
man it is Wow so the moment and here's
what really happened Bob Riley who was
the Governor of Alabama former
congressman good friend of mine we were
doing great now Alabama things were
perfect in Alabama perfect things were
very good in Mississippi it was just
Louisiana so Bob Riley being the
supporting guy that he is said oh by the
way mr. president I just want you to
know the theme was doing a great job in
Alabama and that's when the president
said boo
slapped me in the gut and it was that
moment Dave that I knew oh my god now
three things have happened the press
knows that I've got a relationship with
the president I have a nickname so I'm
one of the few people in the inner
circle that has a nickname to the press
knows how bad things are in New Orleans
and now both me and the boss look like
we're totally out of touch about what's
happening down the Gulf I mean there's
so much there you really realize how
this was happening yeah I I was if you
watch that closely you'll see me grimace
because I was just like holy yeah so
okay so once that happened how much of
what your job became was just dealing
with media craziness total total not
just the media but now with a Secretary
of Homeland Security by the name of
Michael Chertoff who had never done any
sort of operations in his life he was an
appellate court judge yeah an appellate
court judge has clerks that bring your
briefs and say here's what we think your
decisions should be you sit behind the
desk you take your time you don't
realize that if you put off a decision
for 30 minutes in the middle of a
disaster that translates to three hours
and that costs lives so now I'm dealing
with a Boston DC that doesn't have a
clue what he's doing
who's mad at me because I'm on a
Gulfstream trying to get from mobile to
Gulfport to Baton Rouge to New Orleans
and trying to keep my fingers on
everything going on who tells me I'm
tired of you flying around because I
can't find you and I'm thinking you
can't find me I'm on a government
Gulfstream that's got saddling you can
find me anywhere in the world if you
want to
so tells me to plant life
in Baton Rouge and I turn to my staff
and say this is the beginning of the end
they're after me
the media is after me Chertoff after me
they're looking for a scapegoat I'm not
that stupid I know what's going on yeah
are there any points of criticism during
that time that you think are yes yeah
yes I have a friend who is a
psychiatrist at the Kennedy School of
Government and the School of Public
Health and I asked him one time I said
there was a point during Katrina where
you haven't known me but a few minutes
now but I think you can tell I'm a
pretty type-a person person pretty
energetic I'm pretty engaged in whatever
I do I'm passionate about what I do and
I asked my buddy I said so I know that
there was a point where I was just
frozen I literally could not make a
decision what happened what happens he
drew me a cartoon and it's a cart you
know the great Wizard of Oz well it's a
picture of me in the first panel pushing
all these buttons and levers and turning
wheels and stuff and in the second panel
I'm staring at that same group of
buttons like what's going on and in the
third panel I've gone around look behind
and all the wires have been cut and he
says that physiologically whether it's
it's a it's PTSD it's a natural
phenomena in the brain that when we are
trained like if I if I have trained
myself that when I tell my staff do X I
expect X to happen when you and I turn
on these lights or flip a switch we
expect the lights to come on now you add
all of the physical stress the emotional
stress and nothing is working the brain
starts to shut down and I will freely
admit and this is why I I to this day I
saw a firefighter the other day on the
street was having lunch and I walked up
to him and I said what are you doing
we've been doing training and I'm taking
the guys out for lunch and I said well
you don't know who I am
let me just tell you that
yeah you know making sure those guys
have time off and that they get rest
that's the most important thing you can
do because if they don't get rest when
they're fighting the fires they
themselves can become victims of that
disaster so we've got to learn to train
ourselves that when we're under that
kind of stress you have to be able to
step back and this is when I speak about
resilience I've learned to try to teach
audiences that we all have a network and
what we have to do is learn that when we
find ourselves in those moments that
we're either not making the right
decisions
or we're not making decisions we need
some external force to come in and kind
of slap some sense into us and say
change your perspective what I see is
this if somebody had helped me do that
during Katrina
- still had the presidential bus running
over but at least I would have known why
and what was happening but is that
almost counter to the way a sort of big
government has to operate yes it is
right like you can't go running around
smacking people are trying to get him to
wake up because the machine is so stiff
right but but what I needed and you
could my very best friend of my lawyer
Andy Lester who went through all the
congressional hearings with me to this
day he'll tell you he regrets not
getting in his car and driving to Baton
Rouge because he's watching this from a
distance and he's seeing what's
happening and he knows me well enough
that he could tell that I'm just frozen
like nothing's working what do I do next
and I just needed that external force to
come in and say you're right nothing's
working here's why let's take inventory
have you slept no I haven't slept for
three days maybe you ought to go try to
take an ambien at least get four hours
of sleep it's that kind of stuff that
makes a huge but at that point also with
what was happening because of the media
you were sort of just in a feeding
frenzy oh it was like a self-fulfilling
absolutely self-fulfilling it's right
you know to this day I am always amazed
I mean I could I could go through the
litany of falsehoods that I'm no longer
defensive about because they're
falsehoods and it is what it is and I
love talking about
them in front of you know corporate CEOs
and titans of industry who think they
know that they can run everything well
let me tell you someday the prefer the
proverbial feces is gonna hit the fan
and you're happening and you're gonna
want to learn these lessons and learn
them well that's why I run a small
business here we have a very very very
good what what do you make of just sort
of the I guess this is just part of the
human condition the idea that we always
need someone to blame now you are
acknowledging that not everything went
right you didn't make every right
decision we're acknowledging government
over you know nonsense and all that but
just this need to blame because I think
you are one of the first examples
because maybe it was sort of it that
just at the beginnings of social media
or lines and I'm just like let's just
take this guy didn't know who he was yes
long enough and let's just destroy that
let's we'll destroy his career and then
we'll try to destroy his life yeah what
do you what do you make of just that
general psychological well then there is
a there's two ways to look at it in
Judaism there is the the philosophy of
finding the scapegoat and putting all
the sins of the community putting all
the sins of the village and escape on
the goat and throwing the goat over the
cliff well I think that really is
applicable to life in general and we
have through social media I can't I
can't even imagine what I would have
been like with social media back in 2005
it was brutal enough without it but I
think we have when you think about the
hierarchy of needs that people have the
long love power social media has
amplified all of those and the the
feeling of being superior to somebody
else so permeates our society that any
chance we have to squish somebody it
makes I don't know whether it's an
endorphin rush adrenaline but something
that we now have this horrible horrible
desire to just destroy people they have
lives they have families now some people
maybe they deserve it maybe them but I
like to think that everybody unless
you're just totally the doofus people
are actually trying to do the best they
can
yeah I mean I'm a firm believer in that
yeah but yes of course there
are people that want to just destroy
them unfortunately I think social media
amplify the best antidote to that is me
because I refused to stay down there
were people that actually advised me you
need to slither away and I was like are
you kidding I cannot wait for these
congressional hearings because I can't
wait for some dumbass congressman or
dumbass senator who thinks that he's
God's gift to creation to ask me a
question because I'm gonna telling the
truth whether he likes it or not so
let's talk about those hearings a little
bit because when you see it just any
here right any hearing related to any
yeah it strikes me as patently obvious
that pretty much the senator is M
congressman have almost no idea what
they're talking about really right but
they've been handed a brief career and
they've been told by probably you know
handler or whoever these are the three
questions you got to ask because we got
to get you on CNN tonight so then you
can push this and blah blah just did the
hearings when they're trying to
unpackage all of this do the hearings
ever make things better at the end like
is there a hearing that ends and then
they go we really solved the problems of
why Katrina happened why the levees fail
what the problems were with Nemo or
other responders etcetera etcetera
rarely in fact let me tell you it's
actually worse than what you think it
right it's just more government growing
it's no it's more government growing but
to tell you how bad it really is and
there if as the undersecretary if I'm
gonna testify now I was a private
citizen when I testified in the in the
Katrina hearing yeah wait just to be
clear so how long after the the yeah
brownie you know until you until you
resigned well I actually interestingly I
resigned on September 11th of 2005 but
then they came to me and said oh we need
you to stay on because we've got to
figure out just what's going on because
they're gonna come after the
administration so we went to plow we
want to keep you in the fold for a while
so they kept me on as a consultant force
I want to say four or five months
afterwards and then I pulled it you must
be seriously pissed at that but now you
knew you were just yes so I pulled the
trigger and said no more consulting I'm
a private citizen
and so when I'm called to testify the
White House has to do one of two things
they have to be there except that I'm
gonna tell the truth or they have to
invoke executive privilege and prevent
me from testifying and we deliberately
set it up with Susan Collins and Joe
Lieberman for Senator Lieberman to ask
me a question
so about conversations with the
President or the White House so that
when that question was asked my lawyer
could say my client wants to answer the
question but he cannot if the White
House is going to invoke executive
privilege which then allowed senator
Lieberman see how the charade works yeah
then allows senator Lieberman to ask is
there anyone in this hearing room from
the White House who wants to invoke
executive privilege and of course the
room silent thank you sure that works
right and since early Bruin laughed and
said well I'm sure there are plenty of
people from the White House here but
apparently nobody wants to invoke
executive privilege mr. Brown answer the
question and then we were off to the
races but to go back about just a
regular hearing yeah if an
undersecretary or any other government
official is going to go testify his
testimony is cleared through the Office
of Management and Budget that testimony
is given to the senators and congressmen
in advance the questions are given to
the witness in advance it is a show it
is a production how much of it also is
that they're asking you things as if
everything sort of works perfectly in
any of the hearings you know in Hillary
the Benghazi knows where they're asking
minute by minute what did you say then
to this person that person I mean I know
in my own daily life you ask me what
happened three three days ago at noon
right you know I don't know I don't know
I'd have to think about it for a while
but me and maybe I can maybe maybe no
you come up with it right yeah but just
that they they're trying to get you on
every little thing plus the pressures of
your you're under oath right the media
watching and everybody else I mean it
just seems like it's a recipe for
nothing - nothing good nothing
substantial to comment nothing
substantial does come out of them now I
think there's an exception if if in the
House or Senate if they are truly
conducting an investigation and here's
how to tell if they're truly
conducting an investigation they'll
deposed witnesses outside the hearing
room they will ask a witness either
voluntarily or with subpoena to come in
and subject to a deposition by staff
lawyers that's a real investigation
that's really sitting you down and
saying swear to tell the truth the whole
truth nothing but the truth
now let us ask you a series of questions
and that can actually result in
something productive now for the witness
you have to be very careful because like
anything else to your point what you
doing Wednesday at noon I you know I
went to went to this bagel shop down the
street and had lunch what was the name
of it well I think it was X they find
that actually you went to a burger stand
and had a burger now they got you in
perjury yeah
it's crazy really is quickly so what was
the resolution and when the hearings
ended like what do they do so then they
issue a report the report they're a part
brand and the report what the report I
get a kick out of this because the
report virtually acknowledged everything
that I had said was wrong about the
integration of FEMA and these other
agencies in the DHS there was a virtual
admission to that then the things that
they wanted to do to correct were I
don't want to over exaggerate so let's
just say 50% they in essence adopted
about 50% of the things I've been
arguing about now is it working it's not
working because the way things go in DC
whoever has the money has the power and
you can't won them I'm using the FEMA
current FEMA director who's a former
employee of mine is an example you can't
expect him on a day-to-day well what's
his name Brock Brock long okay used to
be the at the National Hurricane Center
emergency manager in Alabama he's a
great guy I love this guy
probably should have said that because
that he'll probably regret having said
that we don't know but you probably made
his can
yeah exactly so it was like my family
well that the the reports the reports so
if you're fighting on a day-to-day basis
for your budget with the Secretary of
Homeland Security and all the other
under secretaries and then when a
disaster hits now you're the boss and
the secretary is subordinate to you can
you imagine doing that in the private
sector
one day you're the CEO but under certain
circumstances you as the CEO are
actually subordinate to somebody else on
your staff I mean that's an untenable
situation but that's kind of the
situation they created with the post
Katrina act that's crazy
so we touched obviously on the media
portion of this and I mentioned how when
I was googling you this morning as I'm
doing research half the articles come up
or about the 10-year Android sorry and
they're still attacking yes
now again you have sat here and
acknowledge that you did not do
everything perfectly but but what is it
what do you make of that in a more broad
sense about the media because I talk
about the media out here and I'm
extremely frustrated with mainstream
media and it's almost gotten to the
point where every time they write
something bad about somebody I start
thinking that they're actually the good
guy no because I see the way I do it to
me right that the media really has
completely gotten out of control
they've lost they've lost all integrity
they've lost all this is what I do in my
own radio program is I don't tell I
don't ever try to tell people what to
think I try to give them a different
perspective so that they can with their
own minds maybe think about something a
different way the media if you look for
[Music]
again I want to thank you all for and
brownie you're doing a heck of a job
FEMA directors working 24/7 CBS FEMA as
well as the hosts of the Michael Brown
radio show Michael Brown
welcome to the Reuben report hey Dave
good to see you good to be with the eggs
you know this is the first time we've
ever done this where we played a ten
second clip let me get do you have any
idea well I can't I can't even imagine
what you might be talking about yes
I've struggled with it for a little
while because I thought do I want to go
right in and throw this right at him
sort of the infamous moment or do we
want to ease into it but then I thought
let's just let's just get it out there
because it it is what it is it's a
seminal moment in my life yet there's
there's before that moment then after
that moment yeah all right there are
many many reasons that I'm glad to be
sitting here with you because I think
we're gonna get into so many of the
things that we talked about on the show
all the time about the role of
government and the difference between
local government and federal government
all of these agencies and red tape and
all that but also that for that moment
and what happened for the months and
probably years after and actually even I
wouldn't I was googling you this morning
all the 10 year anniversary at we're
still pissed on you and all that stuff
it has a lot to do with just sort of the
general outrage culture and blame
culture and all of that so right we're
gonna do a lot here so first let's just
start with that moment though and then
and then I want to do everything else
back sure okay just tell me a little bit
about the days leading up to Hurricane
Katrina I it became clear to me probably
within well it came clear to me the day
after the storm made landfall because I
was on a Black Hawk helicopter with
former senator Mary Landrieu and we were
supposed to be going straight to the
Superdome to meet with mayor Nagin who I
always like to joke is remind people
he's still in federal prison
and in I'm sitting there and I'm not I'm
just kind of reading my notes from my
staff and I look out the helicopter and
I realize that we're going the wrong
direction across Lake Pontchartrain and
I asked the pilot were you going and he
said well the senator has asked that we
go check her cabin before we go to the
Superdome I was livid so now I have a
sitting united state senator next to me
who's just overridden what I said we
need to be doing and what the priorities
are I have the governor sitting next to
her who doesn't have the wherewithal to
say to the senator you know what your
cabin is not our priority the priority
is the people of New Orleans it was a at
that moment that I realized that I had
walked into a state that was so much
more corrupt I've been involved in
politics since I was literally six years
old that it was just so corrupt and it
was so dysfunctional
that I knew that everything that I had
in my hand about how things should
operate we're gonna start going out the
window okay I think that's actually a
perfect story to now start with your
childhood let's just let's just get a
little bio to you because I think that's
really interesting and what led you to
eventually be the director and then
we'll go through everything else right
so just tell me a little bit about
growing up was your family political
what sort of got you into this world Oh
Mike you know my family was kind of
political when I think about it I mean
my mom is 86 87 years old
and she still works for the Election
Board she still does the little local
elections in the little town that I grew
up I think you have to be over 80 to
work at the exactly I think there's a
requirement she's been doing it since
she was in high school but when the
first Republican governor of Oklahoma
was running he was at state party
chairman a guy by the name of Henry
Bellmon was coming out to the Oklahoma
Panhandle and they recruited me at six
years old to be the little kid to hand
to push cards out as he walked these
rural streets of Oklahoma so I just grew
up in this political family that was
always involved and of course you know
involved in student council and you know
in college and young Republicans and all
of that and so politics has just always
been a part of my life yeah and now he
thought I understood politics until I
got to Washington DC
and until hurricane katrina and they
just gave me an entirely different
perspective yeah but anyway long story
short you know I took the typical route
graduate from high school to my my my
wife is my childhood sweetheart her dad
actually delivered me wow that's the
kind of small town we grew up in
Wow we've been married for gosh forty
some years I don't want to say how many
and you know went to law school raised
two children very successful very very
successful children and just had a
pretty normal life except that I knew I
wanted to be a lawyer but I always had
this thought process that you never turn
down and you always look at an
opportunity and if an opportunity looks
good you take that opportunity even if
it's off the path you thought you were
going to take and so that's led me to
these incredible incredible experiences
in my life that most people don't do
because they become lawyers and all they
do is practice law their entire life
yeah That's not me so what was the first
one of those moments when you thought
well there's a good opportunity a little
little to the right off that exit the
home Republican Party came to me and
asked me to run for Congress back in
1988 promised me all of this money that
they were gonna in fact that governor
who was the first Republican governor
went on to be a u.s. senator and then
came back he was a big supporter of me
but I was running Henry Bellmon yeah
former US senator he was involved in the
Panama Canal treaties and everything but
the Oklahoma Republican Party recruited
me and said you know come on we really
want you to run and so I let Eagle get
in the way and I ran against a 12 term
Democrat incumbent in a gerrymandered
district where I got my butt beat but it
was it was an experience that again
most Americans never do most Americans
never throw their hat in the ring and
actually go out and say I'm gonna do it
and I would encourage people whether
it's a city council County Commissioner
state representative whatever it is if
you don't like the way things are going
if you're gonna about I don't
really hear about it unless you're
actually involved doing something
doesn't mean you have to run for office
but you got to be involved yeah it's so
funny after that
that you've been through I guess it's
maybe it's not funny it's either ironic
or perfectly poetic but that still is
your message as someone that you know we
sort of put up as the poster boy for
everything that's wrong with women Dave
let me tell you it may be poetic but it
sorry I quit pointing it's the lawyer it
is I could tell you so many stories
about how dysfunctional state I'm at
I've been involved as a city councilman
I've worked at state legislature as a
finance director didn't you go on I'm
the Undersecretary of Homeland Security
I have seen I have been inside the
bowels of the government and I can tell
you how it works and it is not what most
Americans think yes and we're gonna get
to all of that so the Under Secretary of
Homeland Security that is the director
of FEMA correct that's the gross just
sort of the the more technical term for
that were you involved in the
administration before 9/11 or was it
after the bats when bush no peg you for
no we I was there yeah and in fact I was
in Montana
getting ready to deliver a speech to the
national emergency managers Association
about the role of FEMA in terrorism on
9/11 2001 so you were the director of
him at that time I was I was a general
counsel at that okay and we ended up on
c-135 going back to Andrews Air Force
Base Joe all ba who was the director at
the time immediately went went to ground
zero on that Wednesday morning and I
went to the White House and just spent
the next gosh seems like year just day
in and day out just planning getting
ready for we didn't know what yeah
what's the one thing that really sticks
out in your mind about that day itself
for the first time you you are you're
flying alone there are no planes in the
sky you're flying alone some Airmen
asked me if I want to go down in the
tanker Bay and and just watch as we fly
across you know middle America and I'm
listening on the on the headset and the
only chatter you hear are among the
fighter jets that are flying around the
country and when I landed it was not
knowing it was like there was this blank
wall in front of us
none of us knew what was going to happen
next and so we meet in the Roosevelt
Room in the Situation Room that next
morning to get briefing by the CIA and
everybody else
and I remember just this this quietness
in the room that everybody knew that
none of us knew what we were facing yeah
was there a feeling that George W Bush
was the right guy to handle this because
for all the frustrations that people
right may have with him and that perhaps
you have related to some rug with
Katrina we can get into that right
I do remember at the time and I lived in
New York City at the time so I was there
for 9/11 Roy family was there my grandma
was there my know my dad I do remember
that between George W Bush at the time
but particularly Giuliani I think there
was at least a feeling that these guys
are sort of the right people to be
handling this at the time certainly
Giuliani at least from a New Yorker yes
perspective did you did you feel that
did people feel that within the
government that like that Bush was kind
of able to handle this or have the real
skill set to handle yes it was for me it
was more the most I mean I can still
remember vividly that day in the in the
Roosevelt Room
you've got Tolan Powell you've got
Donald Rumsfeld you've got condi rice
you've got Andy card so you have all
these heavy hitters and here's little
old me sitting at the table too and I
remember watching because I just I'm I'm
an observer of people and I remember
watching all of them and there was none
of the usual because I've been in these
meetings before and there was none of
the usual hey how you do and everybody
was at the table everybody was reading
their briefing everybody was trying to
understand we know that we always
referred to the President as the boss we
know the boss is going to ask some tough
questions and we know we're not gonna
have answers and that's indeed what
happened
you know we had theories we had ideas we
had plans but nobody really knew for
certain Mo's next yeah and especially in
those first few days where we didn't
know if another attack was coming or
what was actually the job of FEMA for
those first few days we are were the
nation's federal first responder we
coordinate all of for example the
Pentagon Ground Zero our job was to make
sure that we had
all of the urban search-and-rescue teams
deployed that we take care of the
firefighters we provide all the
equipment we provide the training we do
all of that stuff so our job was to
clean up Ground Zero our job was at the
Pentagon to help clean that up and what
was fascinating about it was normally
you go to a disaster it's not also a
crime scene but in this case both the
Pentagon and and and in in in
Pennsylvania and obviously in ground
zero
they were also crime scenes so we now
had to coordinate talking about
federalism so now we had to coordinate
you know the federal government state
government local governments and on top
of that we had to coordinate with the
CIA the FBI the NSA and everybody else
who's doing all of the forensic work how
does that go I mean one of the things we
talk about here a lot is sort of the
unwieldy giant government we have right
now sort of all the middlemen and
bureaucrats that get in the way
everything I mean how did it really go
if that's your job here's what's
fascinating when the government's under
pressure like that everybody does what
you have to my mother-in-law had to say
that drill Mike drives my wife like
crazy dude she's now deceased but it was
you know sometimes you just have to do
what you have to do and when when a
crisis hits of that magnitude it's all
hands on the deck and if you need to
break the rules people are willing to
break the rules to make things happen so
I would say that in in those intense
moments that's probably when the
government tends to do the best job
because everybody's trying their hardest
to do what's best for the country yeah
so how soon after that did W tap you to
be the head of FEMA let's see so shortly
after I became the deputy DRI I'd say
like just a couple of months later I
went from general counsel to deputy
director then they announced the
creation of the department well it's a
story about the creation of DHS yeah so
they're gonna create the DHS so W points
me to the transition team or one of five
people putting together the department
and I apologize to the nation for that
because I've got lots of regrets about
DHS I'm happy to die yeah we will
and then soon thereafter Albaugh left
and that's when I became the
undersecretary and the director of FEMA
so probably within gosh a year yeah boy
and then and just just it's the
mailman's story you know you start in
the mailroom and you work your way up
yeah and only two years after that then
the other crisis in years over here
certainly so tell me a little bit about
your regrets creating the Department of
Homeland Security
here's a backstory first that most
people don't know the administration was
opposed to the creation of the
department we thought it was a mistake
we're gonna create this massive
bureaucracy why things are working the
way they're supposed to work but
Congress felt this political desire that
you have to be seen doing something so
once Congress said hey we're gonna move
forward with legislation then the White
House says oh my god now we've got to
get in front of this because we want to
control it and and mold it in our only
view not Congress's view because in
effect they don't want to get
legislation put on his desk
that he they exactly dough and then it's
like these against all right there
exactly so Kay so our job was a great
example of how screwed it is so so I'm
thrown me and four other guys with clay
Johnson the president's best friend
college roommate deputy director of OMB
we're thrown together to create this
massive new bureaucracy by taking 22
different cultures 22 different cultures
22 different organizations and throwing
them in together and trying to make it
work what are a couple of those
organizations that were I mean it's
everybody right well it was secret
Secret Service what the hell Secret
Service doing in Homeland Security the
the Coast Guard the Coast Guard has this
kind of schizophrenic role they've
worked for homeland security yet they're
subjected to the military code of
conduct and they kind of technically
work for the Pentagon so we've got all
of the you've got that you have ice
Customs and Border Patrol immigration
you different grants for the Department
of Justice FEMA everybody had a
different culture and my objection was
you can't throw different cultures
together and really expect them to work
either in the short term in the long
term every organization corporate
private governmental has a culture and
trying to meld those is the one of the
most difficult things to do
look I love carly fiorina consider her a
friend but they brought Carly in to talk
to us about how to do mergers and
acquisitions and I'm thinking wait a
minute
the HP merger and acquisition that
didn't seem to go too well and you're
gonna tell us how to do this twenty-two
government agency thing I mean that's
one objection then the second objection
was you know we got of airports with a
major concern and for whatever reason we
wanted to blame the private contractors
who have a vested interest in making
sure that the airlines are secure right
but that's not good enough
instead let's fire all of them and let's
create this massive new bureaucracy
called the TSA and I'm unlike the kid in
the back of the classroom that keeps
raising his hand and saying but
professor why how's that gonna work but
there was just hadn't what would happen
when you said something like that cuz
now I think in 2018 if you say something
that the TSA most people agree with you
11 unwieldly ridiculous
moderation the reaction was always well
we're gonna meet your objection by doing
why and I had been around the block long
enough to know that that answer was BS
but when you're the one person out of
five you're outvoted so you you tend to
there's a great Washington Post story
that talks about brown as the
bureaucratic in fighter and I was and
the post writes it is if that's a bad
thing and I considered a badge of honor
because I was fighting for just the
reality that when you tell me that
putting these two put these different
agencies together is gonna be budget
neutral that's BS when you tell me
you're going to create TSA but you're
gonna prevent them from ever being a
union that's BS because I just know how
government metastasizes and so the TSA
has turned out to be what I thought it
was the dysfunction within DHS while it
may be minimally better it's still a
dysfunctional organization so let's back
up for a second cuz you mentioned that
before this the security was it all done
by private companies before the TSA
that's almost hard to believe was it was
it all done by private yeah
the airlines who have who has the most
now you think about just trying to
figure out what's the best way to put a
program together well who has the most
interest in making certain that their
planes are never hijacked or flown into
buildings oh the airlines why don't we
let them decide security because what do
they they have competing interests they
want to make sure their planes are
secure their passengers are safe but
that the security operates in the most
efficient and effective way now you tell
me
government's gonna care about those
three things bs yeah well it's also so
interesting because it's like what a
great way to use competition in the
right sense it's like this airline
that's doing it the right way yes where
they could go you know what look at our
marks on security so we're charging you
five dollars more and a lot of people
wouldn't have a problem with it right it
would it would be a beautiful thing I
didn't realize that it was fully private
before that yes Wow any other I mean
that's a well it's a pretty big issue
but any other big regrets related to
yeah well well for example we had within
[Music]
as of this recording almost a million of
you watched my chat with jordan peterson
and ben shapiro last week on youtube and
a couple hundred thousand more of you
have listened to the audio podcast while
the mainstream media continues to
spoon-feed the masses soundbite
clickbait we're here doing some real
proof of concept work to prove that you
guys are a lot smarter than they think
while mainstream media focuses on trumps
diet coke habit we're here talking about
the Marxist roots of post-modernism and
the secular and religious arguments over
where rights come from i received a
bunch of emails from you guys after the
livestream saying that jordan often says
things that go over your head but you
actually go ahead and pause the video
and do some research for yourself I'll
be totally honest with you sometimes he
says things that fly by me as well and
while I usually try to pause him to
clarify obviously I can't always do that
in the midst of a conversation while
you're learning through these
conversations know that I'm learning
right next to you
after the Petersons Shapiro live stream
Jordan got in a well-deserved nap and
then spoke to a sold-out crowd of 2,000
people at the Orpheum Theatre here in LA
Jordan was nice enough to let me
introduce him as a special surprise
guest to the audience and I got to tell
you it was truly the best reception I've
ever received on stage I did a couple
minutes to stand up cracking jokes about
lobsters and the importance of cleaning
your room but there was something beyond
just the laughs that I could feel on the
stage the room felt lit with intellect
and curiosity 2,000 strangers coming
together to hear a middle-aged
psychology professor talk about how
fixing yourself is the only way to fix
the world
this simply wouldn't have happened even
two years ago because so many of you who
dare think differently were silenced by
false cries of racism and bigotry people
like Jordan and Ben are using their
intellect to say what they believe and
that in turn is showing millions of
people out there that they can do the
exact same thing whether you like or
hate Trump this idea revolution is
directly related to his election
everything is up in the air right now
from our political institutions to our
educational institutions to our media
instead
toons as Eric Weinstein and I discussed
a few months back perhaps some of us
would have preferred less upheaval to
get us to address the problems with
these institutions but perhaps that more
selective tactful upheaval actually
never happens as I said to Eric he
wanted a panther in a china shop but all
that was available was the bull as the
Rolling Stones taught us you can't
always get what you want but you get
what you need as most of you probably
have already seen we followed up our
chat with Peterson and Shapiro with the
brothers weinstein Eric and Brett it was
their first public appearance together
ever and I have to say that my brain is
still in recovery mode from taking in so
many high-level important ideas if the
dial of ideas was turned too low for the
last few years it's quickly moving into
the hot position the dial is moving
because the conversations were having
here are finally starting to leak out
into the rest of the world
that's why thousands of you are showing
up at Jordan Peterson events and at live
Sam Harris podcasts and by the way Sam
and Jordan disagree on pretty much
everything especially the most
fundamental existential questions that
exist yet we're all on the same side
because the only real enemy is the
authoritarians who want to control us so
that they can have a silenced once you
realize that you'll suddenly find
yourself with many more allies and many
less enemies so it probably goes without
saying that I'm feeling incredibly
positive about the direction things are
heading and I hope that you are too this
month we're gonna continue having real
conversations with people who are truly
affecting the world with their thoughts
and their actions we've got a five-time
bank robber who became a Georgetown Law
professor we've got a former head of
FEMA and we've got a nuclear power
expert running for governor of
California also I'm thrilled to share
with you that we're doing five shows in
five days with five experts on five
different presidents of the United
States to celebrate presidents week from
some founders like Jefferson Adams and
Madison to JFK and Lincoln the stories
of our past are as relevant as ever as
we fight for the liberty of today oh and
yes we'll be doing plenty more of the
three-person sit downs as well who do
you want sitting down across from each
other let us know in the comments right
down below after all there's an idea
revolution happening right now and it
may not be televised
but it's definitely
to be streamed we're continuing our
partnership with learn liberty this week
and joining me today is an associate
professor of law at Georgetown Law
School as well as the founder of prison
professors dot-com
Sean Hopwood welcome to the Rubin report
all right thanks for having me so I got
to tell you man I have been in
partnership with learn Liberty for about
a year and a half or so and it's a great
partnership they send me a list of great
professors and academics from all over
the country they say if you want to talk
to any of these people
we'll make them available easy enough
you have by far the craziest bio of
anyone that they have passed along to me
I suspect you know that in advance you
don't have many public intellectuals who
have gone to federal prison for robbing
banks you are the first one out of the
law I mean they've given us lists of
hundreds of people that we select out of
I I've gotten used to be on the Freak
Show
yeah at one point it used to bother me
but I I tend to embrace it now yeah so
yes you spent 12 years in a federal
prison for bank robbery we're obviously
gonna have to hear that story should I
be concerned at all that this is in my
house you've now seen my security system
and everything else I think you'll be
okay yeah when I took a meeting while
you were sitting in the green room I
thought maybe he could be you know doing
some stuff but yeah yeah probably
emailing with students yeah all right
that's my new life these days
that's your new life you have cleaned up
you're wearing a suit you've got legit
as they say I've cleaned up I brought my
First Amendment socks with me yeah yeah
Oh
given the finger to the man that's right
all right I'm a big believer on the
First Amendment I'm pretty much a First
Amendment absolutist me too all right
well then we're in good company here all
right so here we go so let's just start
with it with the big story you've robbed
a bank what are you doing
yeah robbed five of them what was I
doing I was a young 20 year old man who
had no purpose in life and did not way
out the consequences of my actions on
myself so it's not hard to realize that
I wasn't really thinking about the
consequences of my actions on anyone
else and everyone always wants to what
was the big reason why and the reason is
I was young
20 and stupid and part of my Redemption
out of that was just growing up all
right so just tell me how this even
happens when does the idea of I'll rob a
bank like you can be young and yes and
misguided and everything else and Daffy
you might you know steal some stuff from
the candy store
it's a robbing a bank differently yeah
no that's right a friend of mine invited
me to the bar in my hometown sprawling
metropolis of 2,500 people and rural
Nebraska and said hey what do you think
about robbing a bank and most people
would have said no you're crazy laughs
done anything and my response was that
sounds like a great idea
and so we discussed it over beers and I
don't think either one of us thought we
were gonna actually do it yeah that
night but we started taking steps and
then once we got into it it was kind of
took me on a downward spiral yeah so
from that conversation to to the first
robbery how long was that probably six
months okay so now just had that we had
to hype ourselves up to actually do it
yeah
so what were those conversations like I
mean what were their multiple plans of
how to go about doing this was this all
like the way you see it in old western
just showing up at the know yeah give me
some yeah we planned it out we had
stolen a car went to the bank ran in the
bank with guns yelled at everyone
grabbed as much money as we could we
never intended to hurt anyone
the guns were there pretty much for show
and then we left and dumped the stolen
car and got into a grain truck because
this was August in Nebraska and no one's
gonna think about bank robbers being in
a grain truck and we drove lives and you
did this five times yeah you know once
we started doing it I had to use drugs
and alcohol to kind of get over the fact
that I had a lot of guilt it's not like
I didn't know this was wrong yeah and so
once we got into it we started spending
money when you make using money it's
easy to spend it yeah just was a year
of trying to party that's fascinating so
you get all this money and now the guilt
of the action is now the financial part
that's fueling yeah sure your need to do
it again yeah and I was going through
depression and some other issues and I
just I needed I needed somebody to say
what are you doing and I never really
got that and the guys I were with we're
all in the same place early 20s didn't
have a job didn't know what they wanted
to do with their life and we kind of
filled each other for this year-long
spree yeah
putting aside the the drugs for a second
I mean what about the rush of just doing
it I would imagine you know even though
it it's a criminal act obviously but
just like getting away with something
that sounds so crazy ya know it's not
really a rush every time you go in the
bank everything in your body is the only
you do not do this you kind of have to
shut that off yeah you kind of have to
shut rational thought down because if it
was rational you would not be doing it
if you were thinking rationally you
would not walk into a bank because you
know at the end of the day I got less
than $200,000 for all those banks well
served 11 years in prison and ended up
having to pay all the money back anyway
and so rationally didn't make much sense
from a cost-benefit analysis maybe isn't
the best idea well this is this is why
this is one of the big reasons why we
impose long sentences on people in this
country is this belief in general
deterrence if I give you a 20-year
sentence it's going to deter everyone
else all the literature says that that
doesn't actually happen
yeah people that commit crimes are a lot
of it is young men 18 to 25 these are
not people that weigh out the
consequences mm-hmm drug addiction
alcoholism mental health issues again
not people that weigh out the
consequences of their actions but even
if they did let's just pretend they did
mm-hmm what would they have to do to
find out how long they would be
sentenced for a particular they would
have to find one of five thousand
federal statutes right that sets the
mandatory minimum and maximum penalties
then they'd have to read a 500-page
guideline manual that judges and lawyers
miss apply every day to thank
anyone's actually doing that is
ludicrous yeah I never met one person 11
years in prison who knew how much time
they were facing but this is the primary
argument that people like the Attorney
General and other the tough-on-crime
crowd believes we should pose long
sentences because it will deter everyone
else yeah so this is what you've really
devoted your life to since and I want to
get to all that obviously and we just
briefly spoke about the Attorney General
I want to talk about him because I'm
frustrated about some stuff as well okay
so how much time cook place for those
five bank robberies like what kind of
time frame are we looking at less than a
year less than a year so within a year
okay now you get caught you end up in a
federal prison for I thought it was 12
you said 11 but maybe there's three
months we'll have a sentence but I got
good time for behaving in prison okay so
I served less than 11 years okay so less
than the 11 years just tell me what that
process even just tell me first what
that first day of showing up at a
federal prison is like it's not what you
would think it's not orange is the new
black it's not orange is the new black
the first day in prison and the first
week in prison felt like freedom and the
reason I say that is I was moved around
like many people that are pretrial from
County Jail to County Jail where you're
locked down maybe 20 hours out of the
day and when I got to prison I could
actually go outside I hadn't been
outside in oh oh nine months well when I
got to prison I could go outside I could
go to the library I could pick out books
I could do something to occupy my mind
and so the first couple weeks in prison
outside of the part of being scared to
death felt like more freedom yeah what
was the scary part beyond just being in
car being like just all the physical
threats here like physical threats
threats of sexual assault you know I
watched a lot of people with medical
issues die in federal prison because
they weren't adequately treated and you
know then the real punishment is you
don't you're cut off from all your
family and community ties which is a
problem because we know that people that
are able to maintain community and
family ties is key for people coming out
of prison especially if you come out of
prison you get a
and you lose the job or get fired if you
don't have family or some sort of
community to fall back on that's usually
when people go back to committing crime
right and that's part of the reason of
high rates of recidivism yeah in all of
this stuff
yeah the rates of recidivism in this
country are not good they range from 45
percent to 75 percent we have some state
prison systems that within five years
everyone leaving the prison seventy five
percent of them will come back I mean
that's just mind-blowing
like putting everything else aside that
we're going to talk about for the next
hour if just the idea that you put
people here to punish them for this
crime and then more than half in many
cases and you're saying sometimes
significantly more end up back there
man I mean what it what a failure what a
true failure what what I mean government
programs that fail three out of four
times and no one really it is disturbing
yeah you know anyone who has an out date
and is going to come out of prison we
should be trying to rehabilitate those
people for a number of reasons one
public safety do not want people coming
out of prison and committing new crimes
new victims it costs a lot of money to
reprosecution der and then their
incarceration so you got that issue but
you also have an issue with we want
people to come back and lead law buying
successful lives and if you've just
warehouse somebody for 10 years and then
you kick them out to the streets with no
or little support and no family or
community ties and then you expect a
miracle to happen and then when it
doesn't we say oh you were evil because
we you were gonna fail and go back to
prison commit a new crime anyway yeah
now you were truly the aberration in the
system because you have a little bit of
a Shawshank kind of story here because
Andy Dufresne took things into his own
hands one in a couple different ways
legally and by digging the the tunnel
but you started getting into law this is
fascinating to me yeah I got a job at
the president law library and for the
first couple months all I did was hand
out the books they were big they were
thick they were intimidating when I did
whole one down off the shelves and read
it felt like it was written in another
language right who was reading the books
I mean was everyone there trying to
solve their case with now there were
people there was there were a lot but
there were people trying to fight their
case especially in federal prison when
when a lot of people were getting twenty
thirty year mandatory minimums for a
handful of crack cocaine mm-hmm so
people are trying to fight their cases
and I didn't want anything to do with
that until June 26 of 2000 the Supreme
Court handed down a decision called
aprende V New Jersey I like everyone
else in federal prison thought that this
might apply to the federal sentencing
guidelines so I started learning the law
on my own and was never able to get any
relief for myself but what I found was I
enjoyed solving this legal puzzle and
kind of writing out the solution so I
started helping other people in prison
keep going then what happened this is
where it gets good that there's always
up to here to your career now and your
whole life yeah I started writing memos
for people friends of mine their lawyers
saying hey check out these issues and
here's some case law the lawyers often
time would be like yeah whatever I mean
do people think you were now yeah I did
what about their prisoners think like
well I mean they don't know good legal
work from bad right so many of them had
bad lawyers to begin with and they were
desperate so they would help me and I
finally started to write a briefer to
and we would file post-conviction
motions and the third legal brief I ever
prepared was for a friend of mine named
John fellers who was filing what's
called a petition for writ of certiorari
to the United States Supreme Court I
didn't know a great deal about the
Supreme Court but I knew it was
different than filing in other courts
that court gets 8,000 petitions 7,000
petitions a year they grant 70 to 80
cases got a 1% chance that the 1% is for
lawyers filing breaks to a court when
you are filing pro se as an indigent
prisoner with no lawyer and you're the
prisoners name is on the front cover
yeah a chance of getting one of those
heard is about 1% of one
Wow and so do you know how many times
that was done before you
I think it's been done 20 times Wow
25 times since the 1950s not a lot yeah
so you know I didn't think a great deal
about John's case I thought we were
right on the issues and I thought the
issues were important
John transferred to another prison and I
I forgot about his case until one
morning at 6:30 in the morning a friend
of mine came running and screaming out
of the housing unit Sean Sean you know
let's be in federal prison I thought
what did I say to him yesterday it wants
to come fight me at 6:30 in the morning
yeah usually when people are running and
screaming at each other not present it's
not aggressive but you don't normally go
to a fight carrying a newspaper in your
hand and what he had was a copy of the
USA USA Today saying that the court had
granted John fellers case how unlikely
[Music]
okay so the whole prison and law
conversation often is framed around
drugs so we talked about this briefly
right before we started but we both have
some frustrations with our current
Attorney General so basically a few
years ago Obama's Assistant Attorney
General passed this memo or instigated
this memo that said that the feds
weren't going to go after states for
legalizing marijuana is that yes broadly
correct okay now it appears that
sessions is getting rid of that memo so
it's a little unclear does that mean
they're gonna start doing it or did he
just not like the memo or what as a
small government guy want the states to
be able to do whatever they want do you
have any insight into what's actually
going on here yeah and and and I'm not
certain that I disagree with the
Attorney General on the memo federal law
says this is illegal it's really strange
for DOJ to then come in with a memo that
says we're not going to enforce federal
law but what the memo does is just
leaves it to the discretion of local US
Attorney's and I would be surprised if
any of them decided that they wanted to
go after people for marijuana in states
where it's legalized but what really
needs to happen like the real solution
to this is not a memo from DOJ it's the
Congress saying we're not gonna be in
this business anymore let's let States
decide this you would think in a
Republican Congress that claims to be
for states rights that they would do
that I mean the West Coast has spoken
Alaska Washington Oregon California
Nevada Colorado I mean there there is a
movement here of states that have said
we as a policy matter think locking up
people for marijuana is not helping the
problem so what does this tell you about
the way the federal government works cuz
you're right a Republican administration
or Republican Congress everything else
by by logic if logic has anything to do
with politics which I know it often
doesn't they should not be going after
states I mean it's completely the
reverse of what they say they are for
now we don't know he's going to do it
that's what you're saying there may have
just been something in the memo that he
didn't like
but it just it just this is one of the
reasons that people just hate politics I
think yeah it's because it's so hard to
get movement on these issues and and
part of it is the politics of crime no
one runs on I'm gonna be smart about
criminal justice issues that's always we
got to be tough we got to be tough we
got to be tough but you know you look
and we have spent trillions of dollars
on the war on drugs we've locked up
hundreds of thousands of our citizens
and drug usage rates are pretty steady
over an entire 30-year period and it
turns out you just can't get around
addiction issues by locking people up
and the oppo opioid crisis is a good
example of that hosing mandatory minimum
sentences on people who are in the
throes of addiction is not going to work
because you could tell someone who's
addicted to heroin if you keep doing it
I'm gonna put you in prison for twenty
years and I'm not certain it would
matter yeah what they need is treatment
not present so what happens to that
conversation where our because you don't
hear I mean I guess you hear it a little
bit maybe but where are the politicians
or the public figures saying guys
instead of funding all of this money to
the prisons you know keeping these
people here forever all right
many of them going back right the day
after they get out all of this stuff
where are the people saying we have to
help them break addiction yeah I mean
the problem one of the problems I see is
we focused on back-end solutions and so
the Federal Bureau of Prisons is a third
of do J's budget if we stopped locking
up so many people and spent some of that
money on treatment or spent the money on
more federal law enforcement who
actually solved more crimes that might
actually deter people mm-hmm but just
punishing people through bit long
sentences is never gonna have that
deterrent effect that the government
wants and and you know you you also
can't say that we are the land of
liberty on the one hand and then on the
other recognize that we incarcerate our
citizens at a greater rate than almost
any other country on the planet yeah 2.2
million people in prisons are jail in
America today that's Houston yeah as you
say that that's more than some small
countries yeah
Houston locked up all around the country
and and for a country that claims to be
the land of the free those two things
are just incompatible and inconsistent
with each other yeah so I understand the
federal level and why there's so much
sort of gridlock with that are there any
states that are doing this really much
better than other states yeah Texas
recently closed a bunch of prisons and
decided that they were gonna try and
rehabilitate more people and as they
closed prisons and release more
prisoners you know what happened to
their crime rate it went down well turns
out there's not a great correlation
between crime rate and incarceration
rate people commit crimes for all sorts
of reasons the economy how the economy
is doing is probably the biggest factor
mm-hmm
but just locking people up is not going
to solve the problem of crime and you
know we have fairly historic low rates
of crime at the moment but you would
never know that by our Corrections
practices and by the number of people we
prosecute and put into prisons and jails
every day yeah what are some of your
other pet peeve issues I know the
mandatory minimum one I know is the big
president reform is another one it's
just my belief that if we are gonna let
someone out of prison someday why would
we not want to spend a little bit of
money for rehabilitation and job
training you spend a little bit of money
so that you save a whole lot of money by
not them getting out of prison and not
committing new crimes not being
reprosecution car serrated say spend a
little money to save a lot of money to
me that's good government is there
virtually no job training in federal
prison so you were sort of self-training
and I'm sure there are other people that
learn shop or learn some other traits
but is there really nothing well I mean
that they they have not allocated a
great deal of money towards that and
then the wardens of federal prisons have
a lot of discretion I'll give you one
example president I was at we had a
really great welding program men we're
learning this trade they were getting
out they were getting jobs paying twenty
five dollars an hour which that's the
gold standards great people getting out
people don't care if you
a felony if you can weld and do the job
25 bucks an hour if you get out of
college that EDC and and what a warden
Caymans thought well I can get more
money if I change the program so he
changed the welding program and put in
an associate's degree program in
business management because we know that
every person wants to hire a former
person from the prison to help manage
and run their business these are the
decisions I saw all the time in the
system and and most of them just don't
make any sense what we need to do is
open those prisons up get more
volunteers get businesses into the
prisons provide job training and basic
life skills somebody the men I served
time with had never had a bank account
and it's the little things when I got
out of prison I got to the halfway house
I was told you need to get a job before
we'll give you a pass to leave and you
can't get a job until you get a bank
account and I went to the bank and they
said you haven't banked for 11 years
what's the deal I had to tell them why
and then I find out that the credit
agencies had listed me as deceased
Jesus and so I go back to the halfway
house and I'm like I can't even get the
process started of getting a job because
I can't get a bank account and I said
well you need to hire a lawyer to get
this for ya I just did a lower GI Joe
yeah I need a lawyer that I can't afford
to get the bank account to get the job
to get the money yeah that doesn't
compute and for a lot of people when
they hit those roadblocks they don't
know how to cope with them and what they
do is they revert back to the things
they do now yeah I mean I mentioned
Shawshank before but it's like it
reminds me of both you know there was
red and the old guy with the bird I'm
blanking who is that blanking on his
name yeah but you know Reds Pat sees a
gun in the in the window and he's
thinking maybe I should get back in
there and the old guy like ends up
killing himself because they can't
function they just can't finalized
institutional when you are taken from a
system where everything is controlled
and you're in a system that says you are
a piece of garbage everyone in there
that is the message you get every day in
prison
that you are a piece of garbage where
you're here to suffer punishment and
you're not gonna get out and lead a
successful life that has an impact on
people you know I got out and wasn't
aware of what I could do I had but I had
a woman who was intelligent and
beautiful and who loved me who said you
can go to law school and I had a former
Solicitor General of the United States
telling me I could go to law school that
had a profound impact on me and my own
self-worth and whether I thought I could
do some of these things had I not had
that I don't think I would have even
tried to go to law school yeah so on
that note let's let's talk about some of
the good stuff so you're teaching law
now what are kids excited by it right
now like what do you see them caring
about criminal justice reform is a big
topic it's big everywhere I go I see
more people writing about it people
talking about it
Pew just put out a study yesterday
saying an overwhelming number of
Americans support criminal justice
reform and I think people get it like we
are sending people to prison too many
people to prison for too long we use
incarceration as a first response rather
than a last resort and it doesn't work
the irony is the longer you send someone
to prison the less likely they are to
come out and be law-abiding successful
citizens and so why are we doing it yeah
tell me a bit a little bit about about
teaching in general I mean it must be
pretty freakin rewarding for you to be
doing it is and it's fun when I'm
teaching fourth amendment to students or
fifth amendment Miranda issues yeah and
now I'm teaching a Prison Law and Policy
class where we are diving into both
legal doctrine about what are the
constitutional rights that prisoners
retain why they're incarcerated and
getting into the policy aspects of why
do we impose solitary confinement on
people we know that it makes people who
have mental illness it exacerbates their
mental illness and we know that people
without mental illness it causes it
mm-hmm so why would you want to impose
long terms of solitary confinement on
people that are eventually going to be
released from prison why are we putting
sex offenders in
present and not trying to rehabilitate
them before we kick them to the outside
world and before the neighbors for me
and my young kids anyone that has an out
date we should be trying to reform and
rehabilitate and I think with a little
bit of resources and opening presents up
to more volunteers we can make a big
impact on the recidivism rate so you
would basically want it sounds like you
basically want sort of less laws in
general perhaps even less funding or at
least you'd want to shift the funding to
some other things and then you think you
think volunteers and things like that
could actually help like I do I think
people would come in and teach courses
I've seen it in prisons I went to a
private prison in Texas in December and
this prison had allowed a company to
come in and build an assembly line and
this woman I spoke to at this woman's
prison said I'm making $9 an hour in
prison now she said the state takes $3
of that an hour but I make enough money
where I can send six or seven hundred
dollars to my daughter who is a Baylor
University for her rent she said I can't
tell you how great it feels to
contribute to my daughter's life and be
able to do it from here and she said I'm
gonna be able to take these skills that
I'm learning and go get a job with this
company or a similar company when I get
out of prison why would we not want to
do more of that yeah I think it's kind
of amazing that twice now you've used
Texas as an example of a state that's
doing this right I think if you would
have asked me before we sat down what
state probably has the most backwards
legal laws and Prison laws I probably
would have said Texas which is probably
just a terrible stereotype but that's
really interesting
well Texas has its issues too I mean
there's no state that's doing it well
but there are states that are ramping
down punishments and realizing that if
we do put people in prison we need to
incentivize them people that are in
prison respond to incentives just like
anyone else
California recently passed a bill that
incentivizes prisoners by cutting their
sentence short if they take
rehabilitation programing and that's
something that we my company president
professors are talking with correctional
associations all over the country about
this is what you should be doing
incentive eyes excellence when I was in
prison all of the things I did the legal
briefs I won two Supreme Court cases
court cases all over the country it was
clear to people in the prison that I was
on a different trajectory than a lot of
people and that I was not going to be a
safety risk when I got out and yet no
matter what I did it didn't sortin my
sentence by one day and I tell you that
you know the first five years in prison
I deserve to be there but I grew up and
I found the law and got responsibility
and the last five years I wasn't a
danger to anyone else I had grown up and
I was just warehoused yeah so I know you
focus obviously mostly on criminal law
it's the most personal thing to you and
it's what you're teaching and everything
else what are the other parts of the law
laws that we're not paying a tendon of
attention to for example you just
mentioned the Fourth Amendment right to
privacy I feel like people don't even
understand that we have a right to
privacy yeah yeah I mean the Fourth
Amendment is a really tough area of law
because there aren't any hard and fast
rules and because of the exclusionary
rule courts are very reticent to say
there's a Fourth Amendment violation
because the consequence is all of the
evidence is thrown out and the person
may go yeah maybe the cases gets
dismissed right there's an interesting
catch-22 yeah and so you know what you
see is is courts I mean the Supreme
Court slowly starting to get more
concerned about technology and privacy
there's a big case pending up there
about whether your cellphone metadata
requires a warrant for the government to
go get a warrant before they can look at
that data and you know with GPS
technology these days they can get your
data from your cell phone and tell
exactly what you've been doing where
you've gone if you visit a doctor
they'll know you may have an illness if
they see you've done it several times so
in effect has the ship sailed on that
then I mean how do we have a right to
privacy we don't in the digital age yeah
it's really difficult this is one of the
reasons why it's so hard for people
coming out of prison because there are
so many collateral consequences be
discriminated against in housing and
employment you can lose your voting
rights
and you can't really hide it anymore so
we have all these initiatives to ban the
Box banned the question on the
application mmm-hmm
but if employers can just run a google
search and find out that you committed a
felony I'm not certain that just pushing
that information to the interview is
going to lead to more people getting
jobs right and so I would like to see
more groups just go to employers go to
big companies and say affirmatively hire
people coming out of prison try it maybe
give them a tax break or some sort of
incentive to get them to employ these
people because there are a whole lot of
people coming out we want the primary
reason why they go back to committing
crimes is they can't find employment and
a place to live yeah you mentioned to me
briefly in the green room that you're
trying to work on some stuff with the
White House right now yeah so I sat at
the table a couple weeks ago as the
president said that we need prison
reform and they're trying to push a bill
in the house I start in the house that
would provide incentives to prisoners to
take rehabilitation programs so that we
can reduce the recidivism rate and I'm a
big believer that that we can if we
structure things in the appropriate
manner yeah so on this case this sounds
like something good that Trump's trying
to push through which usually isn't
prison reform usually thought of as a
lefty or a progressive idea it is but
there are more and more conservative
groups who understand that the criminal
justice system has gotten too big and
compasses too much law too many things
are criminalized and we are over relying
on incarceration and it's funny I go
around to every single group in DC the
Heritage Foundation Cato the Koch
Institute ACLU and double-a-c-p these
people can agree on nothing but they all
agree that the criminal justice system
as a massaman to be fixed yeah what do
you see is there giant differences
though in the solution so I would
imagine some of the ones on the right
you just mentioned they just want the
government to do less or get rid of some
regulation as ones on the left want the
government probably to do more yeah I
mean I think everyone realizes we need
to reevaluate sentences and the lengths
of sentences I think there's
disagreement with various how various
crimes are prosecuted like environmental
crimes Congress likes to pass statutes
without what they call mens rea uh
requirements that you knowingly violated
the law and people on the Left would say
it's really hard to get CEOs and
companies that do this to be prosecuted
if you have the mens rea oh whereas on
the right they're a big believer that
mens rea a' is a necessary part if we're
gonna send you to prison you shouldn't
it's because you knowingly violated the
law mm-hmm yeah that's or knowingly
committed an act of violated the law
right but as you were saying before
there are so many laws at this point
that really nobody knows nobody knows
yeah you have 5,000 statutes over 5,000
no one has an accurate count the Cary
criminal penalties now administrative
agencies can sometimes create
regulations with criminal penalties and
you have a California you probably have
another two or three thousand statutes
so there are eight nine ten thousand
things that you can do wrong that may
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty this week and joining me
today is an associate professor of law
at Georgetown Law School as well as the
founder of prison professors dot-com
Sean Hopwood welcome to the Rubin report
all right thanks for having me so I
gotta tell you man I have been in
partnership with learn Liberty for about
a year and a half or so and it's a great
partnership they send me a list of great
professors and academics from all over
the country they say if you want to talk
to any of these people
we'll make them available easy enough
you have by far the craziest bio of
anyone that they have passed along to me
I suspect you know that in advance you
don't have many public intellectuals who
have gone to federal prison for robbing
banks you are the first one out of the
law I mean they've given us lists of
hundreds of people that we select out of
I I've gotten used to be in the Freak
Show yeah one point it used to bother me
but I I tend to embrace it now yeah so
yes you spent 12 years in a federal
prison for bank robbery we're obviously
gonna have to hear that story should I
be concerned at all that this is in my
house you've now seen my security system
and everything else I think you'll be
okay yeah when I took a meeting while
you were sitting in the green room I
thought maybe he could be you know doing
some stuff but yeah yeah probably
emailing with students yeah all right
that's my new life these days
that's your new life you have cleaned up
you're wearing a suit you've got legit
as they say I've cleaned up I brought my
First Amendment socks with me yeah yeah
Oh
given the finger to the man that's right
all right a big believer on the First
Amendment I'm pretty much a First
Amendment absolutist me too all right
well then we're in good company here all
right so here we go so let's just start
with it with the big story you've robbed
a bank what are you doing yeah robbed
five of them what was I doing I was a
young 20 year old man who had no purpose
in life and did not weigh out the
consequences of my actions on myself so
it's not hard to realize that I wasn't
really thinking about the consequences
of my actions on anyone else and
everyone always wants to what was the
big reason why and the reason is I was
young and 20 and stupid
and part of my Redemption out of that
was just growing up alright so just tell
me how this even happens when does the
idea of I'll rob a bank like you can be
young and yes and missguided and
everything else and do you you might you
know steal some stuff from the candy
store
robbing a bank differently ya know that
that's right a friend of mine invited me
to the bar in my hometown sprawling
metropolis of 2,500 people and rural
Nebraska and said hey what do you think
about robbing a bank and most people
would have said no you're crazy laughs
done anything and my response was that
sounds like a great idea and so we
discussed it over beers and I don't
think either one of us thought we were
gonna actually do it yeah that night but
we started taking steps and then once we
got into it it was kind of took me on a
downward spiral yeah so from that
conversation to to the first robbery how
long was that probably six months okay
so now just had that we had to hide
ourselves up to actually do it yeah so
what were those conversations like I
mean what were their multiple plans of
how to go about doing this was this all
like the way you see it in old Western
just showing up at the No yeah give me
some yeah we planned it out we had
stolen a car went to the bank ran in the
bank with guns yelled at everyone
grabbed as much money as we could we
never intended to hurt anyone
the guns were there pretty much for show
and then we left and dumped the stolen
car and got into a grain truck because
this was August in Nebraska and no one's
gonna think about bank robbers being in
a grain truck and we drove life and you
did this five times yeah you know once
we started doing it I had to use drugs
and alcohol to kind of get over the fact
that I had a lot of guilt it's not like
I didn't know this was wrong yeah and so
once we got into it we started spending
money when you make using money it's
easy to spend it yeah just was a year of
trying to party that
fascinating so you get all this money
and now the guilt of the action is now
the financial part that's fueling yeah
sure you're need to do it again yeah I
was going through depression and some
other issues and I just I needed I
needed somebody to say what are you
doing
and I never really got that and the guys
I were with we're all in the same place
early 20s didn't have a job didn't know
what they wanted to do with their life
and we kind of filled each other for
this year-long spree yeah putting aside
the the drugs for a second I mean what
about the rush of just doing it I would
imagine you know even though it it's a
criminal act obviously but just like
getting away with something that sounds
so crazy yeah no it's not really a rush
every time you go in the bank everything
in your body is you do not do this you
kind of have to shut that off yeah you
kind of have to shut rational thought
down because if it was rational you
would not be doing it if you were
thinking rationally you would not walk
into a bank because you know at the end
of the day I got less than $200,000 for
all those banks well served 11 years in
prison and ended up having to pay all
the money back anyway and so rationally
didn't make much sense from a
cost-benefit analysis maybe isn't the
best idea well this is this is why this
is one of the big reasons why we impose
long sentences on people in this country
is this belief in general deterrence if
I give you a 20-year sentence it's gonna
deter everyone else all the literature
says that that doesn't actually happen
yeah people that commit crimes are a lot
of it is young men 18 to 25 these are
not people that weigh out the
consequences mm-hmm
drug addiction alcoholism mental health
issues again not people that weigh out
the consequences of their actions but
even if they did let's just pretend they
did mm-hmm
what would they have to do to find out
how long they would be sentenced for a
particular they would have to find one
of 5,000 federal statutes right that
sets the mandatory minimum and maximum
penalties then they'd have to read a 500
page guideline manual that judges and
lawyers miss apply every day to think
anyone's actually doing that is
ludicrous yeah I never met one person 11
years in prison who knew how much time
they were facing but this is the primary
argument that people like the Attorney
General and other the tough-on-crime
crowd believes we should pose long
sentences because it will deter everyone
else yeah so this is what you've really
devoted your life to since and I want to
get to all that obviously and we just
briefly spoke about the Attorney General
I want to talk about him because I'm
frustrated about some stuff as well okay
so how much time cook place for those
five bank robberies like what kind of
time frame are we looking at less than a
year less than a year so within a year
okay now you get caught you end up in a
federal prison for I thought it was 12
you said 11 but maybe there's three
months without a sentence but I got good
time for behaving in prison okay so I
served less than 11 years okay so less
than the 11 years just tell me what that
process even just tell me first what
that first day of showing up at a
federal prison
is like it's not what you would think
it's not orange is the new black it's
not orange is the new black the first
day in prison and the first week in
prison felt like freedom and the reason
I say that is I was moved around like
many people that are pretrial from
County Jail to County Jail where you're
locked down maybe 20 hours out of the
day and when I got to prison I could
actually go outside I hadn't been
outside in them Oh nine months well when
I got to prison I could go outside I
could go to the library I could pick out
books I could do something to occupy my
mind
and so the first couple weeks in prison
outside of the part of being scared to
death felt like more freedom huh what
was the scary part beyond just being a
guard I mean like just all the physical
threats here like physical threats
threats of sexual assault you know I
watched a lot of people with medical
issues die in federal prison because
they weren't adequately treated and you
know then the real punishment is you
don't you're cut off from all your
family and community ties which is a
problem because we know that people that
are able to maintain community and
family ties is key for people coming out
of prison especially if you come out of
prison you get a job and you lose the
job or get fired
if you don't have family or some sort of
community to fall back on that's usually
when people go back to committing crime
right and that's part of the reason of
high rates of recidivism yeah in all of
this stuff
yeah the rates of recidivism in this
country are not good they range from 45%
to 75% we have some state prison systems
that within five years everyone leaving
the prison 75% of them will come back I
mean that's just mind-blowing like
putting everything else aside that we're
going to talk about for the next hour if
just the idea that you put people here
to punish them for this crime and then
more than half in many cases and you're
saying sometimes significantly more and
up back there man
I mean what it what a failure what a
true failure what what I mean government
programs that fail three out of four
times and no one really it is disturbing
yeah you know anyone who has an out date
and is gonna come out of prison we
should be trying to rehabilitate those
people for a number of reasons one
public safety do not want people coming
out of prison and committing new crimes
new victims it costs a lot of money to
reprosecution ajudge the public defender
and then their incarceration so you got
that issue but you also have an issue
with we want people to come back and
lead law by in successful lives and if
you've just warehouse somebody for 10
years and then you kick them out to the
streets with no or little support and no
family or community ties and then you
expect a miracle to happen and then when
it doesn't we say oh you were evil
because we you were gonna fail and go
back to prison commit a new crime anyway
yeah now you were truly the aberration
in the system because you have a little
bit of a Shawshank
kind of story here because Andy Dufresne
took things into his own hands one in a
couple different ways legally and by
digging the tunnel but you started
getting into law this is fascinating to
me yeah I got a job at the president law
library and for the first couple months
all I did was hand out the books they
were big they were thick they were
intimidating when I did pull one down
off the shelves and read it felt like it
was written in another language right
who
was reading the books I mean was
everyone there trying to solve their
case without there were people there was
there were a lot but there were people
trying to fight their case especially in
federal prison when when a lot of people
were getting 20 30 year mandatory
minimums for a handful of crack cocaine
mm-hmm so people are trying to fight
their cases and I didn't want anything
to do with that until June 26th of 2000
the Supreme Court handed down a decision
called aprende V New Jersey I like
everyone else in federal prison thought
that this might apply to the federal
sentencing guidelines so I started
learning the law on my own and was never
able to get any relief for myself but
what I found was I enjoyed solving this
legal puzzle and kind of writing out the
solution so I started helping other
people in prison keep going then what
happened this is where it gets good that
that is up to your to your career now
and your whole life yeah I started
writing memos for people friends of mine
their lawyers saying hey check out these
issues and here's some case law the
lawyers often time would be like yeah
whatever I mean do people think you were
now yeah what about their prisoners
think like well I mean they don't know
good legal work from bad right so many
of them had bad lawyers to begin with
and they were desperate so they would
help me and I finally started to write a
briefer to and we would file
post-conviction motions and the third
legal brief I ever prepared was for a
friend of mine named John fellers who
was filing what's called a petition for
writ of certiorari to the United States
Supreme Court I didn't know a great deal
about the Supreme Court but I knew it
was different than filing in other
courts that court gets 8,000 petitions
7,000 petitions a year they grant 70 to
80 cases you've got a 1% chance that the
1% is for lawyers filing rates to the
court when you are filing pro se as an
indigent prisoner with no lawyer and
you're the prisoners name is on the
front cover yeah a chance of getting one
of those heard is about 1% of 1% Wow and
so do you know how many times that was
done before you
I think it's been done 20 times Wow 25
times
since the 1950s not a lot yeah so you
know I didn't think a great deal about
John's case I thought we were right on
the issues and I thought the issues were
important
John transferred to another prison and I
forgot about his case until one morning
at 6:30 in the morning a friend of mine
came running and screaming out of the
housing unit Sean Sean you know let's be
in federal prison I thought what did I
say to him yesterday it wants to come
fight me at 6:30 in the morning yeah
usually when people are running and
screaming at each other not good doesn't
it's not good but you don't normally go
to a fight carrying a newspaper in your
hand and what he had was a copy of the
USA USA Today saying that the court had
granted John fellers case how unlikely
that was given John had filed without a
lawyer and it actually quoted from the
brief that I had pecked out on a prison
typewriter I knew that was a big deal
did I know that it would lead to doing
this work long term no that I know it
was I was going to go to law school or
become a lawyer no and I certainly never
thought I would end up as a law
professor at Georgetown yeah so what
happened right after that I mean did the
prison administrators go man this guy's
yeah well the big break for John fellers
and and myself was that an attorney took
the case over and not just any attorney
has named Seth Waxman he's the former
Solicitor General of the United States
and one of the top appellate lawyers in
the country he took the case and I think
most people and with his background
Harvard undergrad Yale Law School
clerked for federal judges worked at the
Department of Justice was the Solicitor
General would have said hey good job
mass mr. Dale House lawyer without a
bachelor's degree great work we'll take
it from here and yet he did the exact
opposite they would send in he and his
firm Wilmer Hale would send in drafts of
the brief I would markup it with notes
and I would send it back out one point I
know one point I had a conference call
in my counselor's office was sattim
three other lawyers the week before oral
arguments and Seth asked me Sean can you
think of any questions that the justices
might ask the
we haven't thought about and I'm sitting
there thinking I'm like I have been
self-learning the law for 18 months I've
never even taken freshman English ya
know I have no idea what the courts
gonna ask you and they started laughing
but it was quite the experience what do
you make of I mean it's a fascinating
that Waxman was willing to do this do
you think it was truly he was trying to
get your insight as a prisoner I mean
obviously he saw a good legal mind even
if it was a novice at the time do you
think it was also like just like a PR
element to that as well like I'm gonna
stick with this guy and there's some
value there too I think he was curious I
think he was curious that he had looked
at this petition that was typed on a
prison typewriter and had been granted
and he thought it was a really good work
product and he was surprised when he
discovered that it had been prepared by
a federal prisoner with no background in
the law whatsoever who had just kind of
been picking this up on his own yeah and
and I think he thought that there was
value there and and you know he became a
mentor to me we won the case 9 to 0 and
he has been a good friend he introduced
me a couple months ago at the DC bar
galas I want young lawyer of the Year
award and Seth walked up there and
introduced me to the crowd and we were
just sitting there at the table thinking
things have come full circle for us yeah
it's so funny because you're a young guy
the idea of like typing this thing up on
a typewriter you just that alone do they
white out and cut no they don't yeah you
think you could trade that because I
feel like there's some value to this
probably things you can do it right out
oh yeah yeah yeah I typed up a lot of
things on a present typewriter almost
all the briefs I prepare I never was
allowed to touch a computer while I was
incarcerated so when I get out in 2008
I had never been on the Internet
incredible never seen an iPhone and iPad
and iPod one of the things that I
struggled was finding the jobs 2008 it
was the height of the recession no one
was finding work let alone the bank
robber that just did 11 years in federal
prison yeah tell me about that day when
you when they officially say to you okay
you get
and then what is it like when you're
actually putting are you literally
putting on the clothes that you walked
in with it they said no that's sort of
the image that yeah right
somebody had sent me clothes my brother
picked me up to take me to the halfway
house I still had six months of custody
with the be ope but I was going to serve
it at the halfway house across the river
from Nebraska in Council Bluffs Iowa and
my brother picks me up and we drive and
we go to a Walmart and I needed to pick
up toothpaste
and I remember just being stuck in the
Walmart in an aisle because there was a
wall of toothpaste and I had not had
choice mm-hmm for over a decade and it
was overwhelming and I'm not one that
stresses or gets a great deal of anxiety
but I tell you my first 30 days at the
halfway house I was consuming four to
five thousand calories a day and losing
weight well just because of the anxiety
of trying to figure out this new world
yeah you know one of the places that my
big break was getting a job with kaká
legal briefs this company in Omaha that
helps lawyers all over the country file
briefs to the US Supreme Court they had
asked me I told them I had this
reference letter from Seth Waxman that
really impressed them I didn't tell them
all right people we are live on the
YouTube or we're at least live until the
stream crashes we shall see what happens
and I am sitting between the famous
Weinstein brothers
I've got Eric to my left I've got Bret
to my right in no order by the way did I
intro you or seat you the order in which
we were born
that's perfect sentence the order in
which you were born as you guys know I
believe that there is an idea revolution
happening in this country I think these
two a right at the center of it they
happen to be born from the same two
parents we're going to talk about that
and a lot more first off you guys
arrived together you took a car here
together you actually like each other as
brothers that's pretty good quite a bit
yeah quite a bit quite a bit we don't
see each other all that often but this
is the first time we've ever appeared
the same place like ever ever with all
the professional stuff that you guys
have done you in the math world you in
the biology well this is somehow the
first time you've done this this is the
first oh no I have no idea what happened
I guess I first should ask you the
family hair what's going on here we have
the other didn't you as the more temped
burger yes thank you haven't glad I'll
ask you what is going on in the in this
family with the hair holy-holy curly
well the hair is a is a is a bit of a
curse and the problem is that there are
a lot of people who who enjoy pointing
that out and I'm actually I'm not going
to bring this live until March but I'm
gonna institute a rule where it's fine
to make nasty comments about the hair as
long as they come with a helpful
suggestion mine is always on your
YouTube comments
yeah he's the managing director of teal
Capital why can you afford a decent
weave yeah well I love the fact that we
could talk for like two hours you
mentioned 87 theories or go way over my
head and 90% of the comments are about
your hair alright let's just do a little
history with stuff with you guys first
because obviously we're gonna talk about
so much more stuff here but obviously it
seems to me at least from the outside
your parents must have done
thing right that they got two brothers
who so care about ideas but are true
experts in their field of math and
biology and that care about doing what
what I see as what's right and and being
brave enough to constantly do that what
did they do that was right or where did
this this passion for education and all
of that come from older brother you
first oh boy well I mean I think that
the family history has a few ingredients
and not all of them are about the
nuclear family I think that we there
were four families that came out to
California we grew up not too far from
here and the they came out to make
mayonnaise it was the gelfand who
figured out how to make mayonnaise not
separate properly the Kern extermo
glands and the Reubens and the Reubens
were the weakest branch
families that buy no no we are Rubin
chicks yeah and so we were raised by
Harry and and Sophie Rubin as well as
our parents and Harry Rubin was a
chemist who couldn't finish college I
think there's a family history of
learning issues and there was a lot of
question about how to how to ground
one's idealism and rationality so that
you are fundamentally thinking with your
head feeling with your heart and that
the two of them remain connected and I
think that there was a lot of emphasis
on not taking shortcuts to a better
tomorrow and taking massive risks yeah
I'm glad you mentioned the head heart
thing because I think you're
particularly in that space these days
well you know it's tough because I think
that you know as we've been talking
about this group of people who's sort of
growing up outside of the standard
channels of communication you know and
made a joke about the intellectual dark
web and then it got repeated we sort of
ran with it but the only part of it that
was dark was that the media and the
institutions weren't you know we're sort
of making sure to avoid any reference to
this group of people as much as possible
and you know I think that you know this
intellectualism outside of the
mainstream was definitely a part of our
family growing up and I think that the
learning issues in some sense
disconnected us from standard
institutional structures and you know
one of the things I think we'll get to
hopefully today is that well people are
tuning in to this conversation that that
Bret and I have been having for a long
time there were a lot of previous rounds
where there just wasn't anyone to talk
to and there were a lot of different
issues that got brought up and I it
would be great to use this current
passion where you you may see it over
free speech perhaps I see a little bit
less so over that but it would be great
to talk about some of the previous
battles that we've fought that involve
things like drug testing or wealth
transfer by using the CPI as a closet
way of raising taxes and slashing
benefits so we've been at this a long
time and the great new thing I think is
is that there's so many new voices and
there's this channel to go around and to
disintermediate this very strong thing
that I call the gated institutional
narrative which we've never been able to
crack through so easily and now we have
channels where we can we can actually
get to the yeah well as I said to you
guys right before we started I mean I've
scribbled down a few things here but I
fully want you guys to take as much
control here as you see fit I mean he
teed you up on a couple things there but
just first just on the family stuff
growing up I mean we're in the house
like was just education and education
and education just constantly drilled
into you guys well I mean the funny
thing is the concept of education was
was quite prominent but as Eric points
out neither he nor I had a comfortable
experience in school they were different
uncomfortable experiences but both of
them were troubling for you for example
what does that mean oh I was actually I
think Eric figured out some mechanisms
for getting through school that were
more effective than what I did and in my
case I actually remember being in the
second grade and
my handwriting and spelling in
particular were so bad that I remember
somehow I remember school giving up on
me and declaring me off in some way and
I you know this is the adult me looking
back but I felt a choice
I can either submit to what it's
judgment of me is and I can try to
confront it or I can stop playing ball
and that's what I did
which caused my academic life to come
apart and really it didn't go back
together arguably ever although I did
find a home in graduate school but but
the process of walking away from the
formal education and then having our
grandmother died relatively early but
Harry our grandfather was a he was a
really interesting intellectual person
who had the unique characteristic of
taking children very seriously and it
doesn't mean he wasn't fun he wasn't in
it he was extremely fun but it meant
really if I think back on it you could
ask him any question any question if it
was a good question he would do his best
to answer it and he would let you know
at the point that you'd topped out what
he could address and that it was like
having a personal intellectual tutor and
you know that was that was one faster
that was particularly important maybe
especially for me but it sort of picked
up where school left off and because he
was an unusual mind in his own right I
think some of the stuff that Eric and I
picked up from him ended up being sort
of jumping off points to places that are
hard to get to through the standard a
standard model yeah I'm curious did
either one of you even now where you're
both obviously public people and and you
were sort of thrust into it just eight
months you know that what was it if it's
about yesterday right
did you ever anticipate that you'd be
someone that is talking about these
things publicly you know to me like you
had this is a very long piece of work
but now you end up sort of talking about
this stuff from a zillion different
angles well I I don't think either one
of us wanted to become a public figure
per se I think we wanted to do work and
we wanted the work to go into the world
and then it turned out that the the
opposition to the work like it's
important that this work never be heard
is a very different thing then it's
important that this work be heard and
that it be evaluated properly and if
it's found to be wanting discarded so I
think that we ended up spending a lot of
our energy just mystified as to hey I've
come up with this great new thing I've
got a new discovery I've got a new way
of seeing things why are people so angry
and hostile and that created a choice in
some in some sense where we had to give
up a certain amount of privacy and I you
know I still value our privacy like you
know I don't think either one of us
tweets pictures of our children or
something like that or even names them
and I think it's in some ways a little
bit uncomfortable oh yeah oh yeah
tremendously uncomfortable and the ideal
would be to have the ability to speak
into the public dialog in an important
way but not be recognizable so that you
could have your your anonymity and your
influence simultaneously but nonetheless
you're saying the Twitter avatar people
might be doing something a little wiser
than the three of us is that it these
they're maintaining their anonymity and
at least at some level getting in on the
conversation yes on the other hand I
think part of what is driving the sort
of surprised interest you know I feel
surprised interest in me and an eric is
the void of authenticity and so the very
fact of anything authentic it doesn't
matter if it lines up with the way you
think things are or not just a simple
fact that it's unpolluted by is
so powerful that it
it causes people who wouldn't otherwise
be interested in what you had to say to
listen so at some level I feel like
that's the trade is that we have given
up the anonymity part in exchange to
illustrate that this really is authentic
and that that that is driving a lot of
the interest yes I feel like our hands
are somewhat forced that it is
astounding all of the interesting and
important things that aren't simply not
being said mm-hmm in a world where you
know you go through these news cycles
and just repeats the same mind-numbing
perspective that doesn't really I mean
it can't be made some sense of upon
reflection I think you know just getting
back to your original question I think
our grandfather Harry Rubin in
particular refused to teach and in at
least in my case you know I remember he
gave me this guitar and he said all you
need to do is tune it you don't need to
play it and it was a very strange
instruction like why would you have a
guitar if you could only tune it and his
point really was
it'll be so frustrating to have a nice
guitar that is tuned that you don't know
how to play then he will figure out that
it's a mystery and that you do not need
a teacher and I remember going to UCLA
music library and xeroxing all of these
beautiful guitar pieces I could barely
read the notes on the page but it turned
out that you know this was a very
strange and interesting form of teaching
for two people who couldn't actually and
and I just I it really needs to be
emphasized you can think all you want
about privilege about maleness or
whiteness or this or that but if you
have a learning disability that is
conceived of by the educational system
it is almost impossible to lead a normal
life and so you either find some crazy
way of overcompensating and then you you
have an original perspective because the
system can't serve you or you sort of
accept that you are the problem
and I think neither of us accepted that
we were the problem and it's sort of a
radical overreaction to to the mismatch
in education so oh good well there's one
other thing I just want to add before we
move on from it which is
there's an important question about
birth order and where we end up birth
order is an interesting mystery because
if you imagine that where you fall on
the birth order causes you to lead a
very different life than you would have
if you had been born somewhere else in
it that almost sounds like a failure of
evolution to function because whatever
you should be doing optimally you should
do on the other hand you're born into a
world that is altered by the siblings
that were born ahead of you and so for
me
I think part of why I end up where I do
is that I was born into a world with
Eric in it and Eric was a very unusual
intellectual presence to be in your
natal home you know yeah I do say so you
know if you think about it
eric has a extreme talent for
fundamental thinking and when I say
fundamental I mean the most fundamental
levels of thinking that meant that the
niche in the home I was born into that
niche was full fundamental thinking
wasn't wearing was going to be at and so
it is I think totally fair to say that I
ended up as far away from the
fundamental as you could get right
biology is about complexity and
emergence and so in order to you know
maximize the chances of contributing
something that was not already taken
care of I went to the other end and I
got very fascinated with living systems
and it turns out that actually that pair
of toolkits is pretty useful together
Eric is much better at understanding my
toolkit he's quite good at evolutionary
thinking in a way that I will never be
good at mathematical thinking and so
anyway there is a a way in which I think
the the Williams sisters the tennis
players provide something of a model of
one of the aspects that was very unusual
in our house which was there was a kind
of and you've said it before on maybe on
your program about a kind of
intellectual arms race you know a
friendly sibling intellectual arms race
that resulted in us you know both upping
our
just to keep up with try but it was also
like a off-script in other words it was
like two twins speaking a language that
nobody else was speaking and you're
competing inside of this ring it's like
a system that nobody even knows that
this competition is going on and I think
you know bread is actually slightly
inaccurate in that what he did in
biology was to take this emergent system
and treat it as an as if fundamental
system and I think that's where so much
of his power comes from is is that he
treats evolute like most people think of
evolution as kind of bedrock and I think
Brett goes below that and says look
they're the critiques of evolution have
more to it than you imagined but the
solution isn't a religious solution it's
actually better more fundamental
theorizing about a layer that can
actually support that even though
there's no reason you should be able to
do fundamental thinking in such a high
level emergent layer so I feel like he
sort of copied the same behavior pattern
and I also think in terms of birth order
just to be entirely honest about it I
don't think Brett really became Brett
until I left the house like he was
almost mute he was very very shy I
wouldn't say anything and when I left
the house suddenly you know I'd been
pretty good in Speech and Debate
and Brett would just clean up from
public speaking in a level that I
couldn't and you know there's also this
aspect where you feel that as an older
sibling you are in part suppressing you
the younger sibling unintentionally so
that it's not mean-spirited it's just
something those things are already
occupied and so as soon as you leave the
house suddenly you have an as if Brett
became an as if older sibling or an only
child and I think that really catalyzed
the transformation all right so there's
a lot here so it seems to me that for me
personally my whole life has sort of led
up to this right I sort of mean this
actual moment because this is what I do
but I mean what is this thing that's
happening right now that we can all feel
the reason that you know all these new
people loved you that didn't know who
you were a year ago
or that you know two or three years ago
when you message me and you said can we
just jump on skype for a second I had no
idea who you were and I did a quick
google and I was like this guy's seems
bright let's talk and and everything
that is sort of flowered out of that but
it seems like there's something
happening right this moment that is way
bigger than certainly than three of us
sitting here
when did you start tracking it early
eighties the Reagan transition was very
violent very interesting and the
university system was the first place
that I was able to notice that the
institution's contained fundamental
structural laws that they'd been built
in a different time and they required
growth that could no longer be supplied
and so can you give me an example of
what that means sure so I think I
mentioned this before but I think
pre-war we educated about 8% of the
population at a post-secondary levels of
some kind of after high school training
and then we went to about 50% of the
population so that's a huge expansion in
a very brief period of time from 1945 to
about 1970 and the university system
couldn't keep growing you can't have a
professor leaving you know fifteen PhDs
who all become professors who leave
fifteen PhD so that structure works as
long as the system is growing and as
soon as it hits steady-state then you go
from saying one professor should leave
fifteen students to one professor should
leave one student over a career well
that doesn't work because you need the
students to do work under the professor
same thing for lawyers you know and then
partners and associate same thing for
doctors you know maybe an intern you
need growth to have these structures so
then almost all of these institutions
stopped growing in this particular way
and then they had to have a story to try
to attract people in to pay in and it
became akin to Ponzi schemes and that's
why during this period of time you know
I wrote this this essay called anthropic
capitalism in the new
economy and the whole idea of the essay
was that we had kept these institutions
alive
by trying to figure every gimmick known
to man so offshoring downsizing
securitization playing with you know GDP
and CPI dials all of these sorts of
games were used to try to squeeze a
little bit more as if growth out of the
system so that nobody would have to
confront the fact that the whole thing
had become in some sense pathological
and my belief is is that with the end of
the baby boomer bubble if you will which
is a very long-lived bubble it's not
like a short you know bitcoin style
bubble what you have is a situation in
which the narrative is unsustainable by
2008 this narrative about deregulation
and the Great Moderation couldn't be
sustained and Lehman Brothers went down
[Music]
[Music]
all right people we are back I jokingly
said that we were gonna crash the
internet and I'm pretty sure we crashed
YouTube literally out of every live
stream we have ever done we have never
had an issue I don't know what happened
there I have conferred with these two
fine men and we're not willing to
completely go down the conspiracy theory
yet we're gonna have to just recap what
happened in ten minutes I believe well
first off Ben Shapiro to my left
ironically Jordan Peterson to my right I
believe that we are fully right now in
an idea revolution we talked about this
for about 10 minutes we'll try to recap
a little bit of what we started with and
then get to some more all new stuff as
I've said to the guys they're welcome to
talk directly to each other if they have
questions for me we can there are no
rules here there are never rules in here
but truly today there are no rules and I
think that these guys are in the thick
of something just tremendously important
right now and relevant and that's why
they're blowing up the way that they are
ok let's try to do some of that again
although you guys were both quite
eloquent the 10 minutes ago idea
revolution do you believe that we are in
an idea revolution right now well this
is what I think's happening I think and
I think this accounts for the
attractiveness of the content that I put
on YouTube so when Nietzsche diagnosed
the death of God about a hundred and
fifty years ago and his he made three
predictions he said people will as a
consequence our culture will shape - the
roots will become nihilistic or
totalitarian in response or will invent
our own values ok those were those were
his three possibilities and then and
then of course we became nihilistic and
totalitarianism totalitarian through the
20th century and many tens of millions
of people died as a consequence which
Nietzsche also foretold specifically he
said that a hundred million people would
die because of the rise of communist
ideas he said that in will to power so
then he predicted that while we would
have to invent our own values then the
psychoanalyst came along they said well
wait a second you can't you can't create
your own values because you're not
master in your own house there are
forces operating inside of you that are
autonomous and for Freud those were
proud
primarily biological forces but young
took that a step further and he said
wait a minute biology is a lot more
sophisticated and complex than you think
and there are symbolic forces at work he
thought of the archetypes as images of
the instincts for example but the
instincts were a lot more sophisticated
than people thought so it's not just an
instinct to aggression let's say there's
an instinct to operating properly so
that you walk up hierarchies human
hierarchies of competence it'd be
something like that and that's a that's
an archetype of the ideal in some sense
Jung thought the gods didn't disappear
they went inside they went into the
psyche and so he dove down as far as he
could dive to find out what those
eternal images were and to bring them
back up to the surface and that's what
I've been continuing I would say in my
lectures I'm saying look there's there
are elements to the ancient story that
are not only they're deeply correct and
you cannot live and you live in hell
unless you know them it's something like
that and that's the case so and I think
that's I'm hoping that's what is
happening is that people are starting to
understand that people people's lives do
have a transcendent purpose that's the
most appropriate way of looking at life
that our brains are in fact evolved to
reveal that purpose to us which I also
believe I think the neural neurological
evidence in that regard is quite clear I
believe that and so I hope I'm hoping
that what we're we're at the end of
postmodern despair that's what I'm
hoping yeah so to me what you're giving
there is sort of a realist version of
religion you're you're saying these
stories are needed for a very real way I
suspect you basically agree with that
yeah I mean I do and what's what's
fascinating about this is I mean Jordan
may be closer to Aristotle than I am to
Plato but I think that we almost have a
platonic versus a wrist is healing an
argument going on here because it seems
like what you're talking about is the
idea that if we dig down deep enough
into our biology's and into our neural
networks what we find is a common set of
shared values that if you refuse to
acknowledge them leads to grave
unhappiness and well I'm almost every
level right and what I'm coming from is
almost a platonic idea which is that the
mind of man reflects the mind of God the
extent that you can
not only is I would argue in Orthodox
your revelation is necessary but even if
you don't use revelation that using your
capacity to reason you can find a
purpose in something above but we end up
at the same place which is the set of
values that if you actually if you if
you stray away from this common set of
values and I'm talking like the most
root level values personal
responsibility freewill it's your job to
be responsible for members of your
family it's our job to make good
decisions and responsible decisions and
not to blame the society around you for
failures that you are yourself
responsible for you can't surpass your
own innate capacity and in in terms that
you can expect society to make up for
your lack of innate capacity in certain
areas you just have to make the most of
what you have in front of you you and I
agree on values but I think that the
source of the values there's gonna be a
slight disagreement I think I think it's
a it's a it's a profound place for
disagreement because and I don't
understand how to mediate it exactly
because I'm not willing to dispense with
the metaphysical no when I did my
biblical lectures last year I called him
up it's like a psychological approach
for a typical stories right because I
wanted to push a secular interpretation
a scientific interpretation which by the
way is not interrupted I think that
that's supremely useful to people
specifically because I mean despite the
fact that I come from a religious
background I'm trying to make arguments
that are not religious and orientation
and never cite to the Bible and I talk
about values for example I never cite
regulation it's valuable to me because I
think that that's a good source of the
values and I think that it's a relevant
source of the values but it is not the
only way to achieve those guys I've
never suggested for example that
atheists can't be moral or that you can
be an agnostic and not believe in
judeo-christian systems of Revelation
and come to the same exact set of values
that we're talking about now well and
it's also a simpler argument to make
because you constrain the number of
necessary very exactly so but that I'm
but having said that I'm not willing to
dispense with the metaphysical and I
think like I think it's and I'm like
stretching the edges of my cognitive
ability when I'm talking about this sort
of thing because I'm in realms that I
don't understand that it's it's that I'm
just getting vague pics ISM but I think
it's as if there's a there's a
revelation from evolution that matches
the revelation from above the new things
come together and I
I don't understand how that can be
possible I think it has something to do
with the fundamental nature of
consciousness which is something we
seriously do not understand and so I can
see you can make a straight biological
case for the evolution of archetypes but
I don't think that the biological
explanation exhausts the archetype
there's more to it and because and what
I've learned too in delving into these
religious stories but also into
religious experience is that it's
bottomless like there is a point where
as you dig into the archetypal
everything turns into one thing
biological spiritual transcendent it's
all one thing from the top to the bottom
and I think people get intimations of
that when they have profound experiences
experiences that are generated by music
for example it might love for my sex or
there's a variety of ways that they can
be anytime you have an experience of
meaning in your life and I can also see
that and I believe this to be the case
is that you are you're neurologically
adapted to a universe where meaning is
the highest instinct and I mean that
technically is that when you're sitting
in a situation where what's happening
around you is meaningful what your
nervous system is signaling to you is
that you occupy the optimal position in
the dynamic territory that you currently
inhabit and that's and that sense of
meaning is it's not just cortical it's
it's way deeper than merely cortical and
so that's a very exciting that's a very
exciting discovery I would say I think
that because the again a place where we
agree is that meaning is uncovered it's
not some it's discovered it's not
something that you're making up yourself
and that's why I think it's revealed
exactly and because we're going
happiness exactly and I think that one
of the reasons that that the message
that we're putting out there is is
making people happier actually mmm even
though we're both pessimists by nature I
would think is that what we're basically
saying is that in this land of chaos
where you could have wandering around
with no meaning there is a meaning and
if you search for it you'll find it but
you haven't be open to the concept that
there is a meaning yes we discover yes
and if you shut yourself out from that
by just saying there's no meaning to be
discovered meaning is to be made up by
you and you can do what you want a
phenomenal right exactly
it's just something that you experience
but it's not really real
you know that that kind of stuff is is I
think disquieting to people and so
there's something that quiets the soul
yeah that says you have purpose and and
if you don't have purpose then maybe
it's because you're searching in the
wrong place yeah whatever
yes possibility that's right there's a
few interesting things that you said
there because it's like I know you guys
pretty well at this point and and this
crew of people that were sort of in when
when we're off camera we're actually
talking about the exact same thing it's
like we are lit whether this camera was
on right now or off like we're living
this thing all the time I think it's I
can speak from my own experience in this
regard it's made me a better person and
I will and I'm still striving to be
about I'm more authentic I'm more honest
I'm constantly I mean I sit in this
chair when it's over there and look at
the person over here every week and I
actually hear and I listen right and I
sit across great minds and I go wow I
have to reevaluate some of the things
that I think and I sometimes it's
because I disagree with someone you know
and I'm like they really don't know what
they're talking about but often it's
hopefully that I'm hearing somebody say
some great right this is what's really
interesting and I think what's what's
great about conversations like this one
is when yeah if I have Jordan on my
facebook live and I ask him questions or
he'll have me on his YouTube and he's
asking questions what we're all really
in the business of all of us who are
occupying the spaces asking questions
and we're treated as weird because we're
asking the questions if they're actually
listening to the answers yeah exactly
I always think well you know you might
have something to tell me that's my rule
number eleven by the way yeah right
assume that the person you're listening
to might know something you don't
right I mean because then you can they
can tell you that to you and if you
learn it then you don't have to run face
first into a brick wall
exactly it's really helped and and from
Jewish tradition that's deeply embedded
in Jewish tradition that the wise man is
the man who learns from every man around
him hmm and so this idea is is it's what
unifies this really disparate stream of
people yeah the three of us people like
sam harris people echo rogen right I
mean like you look at me and Joe Rogan
what we have we like asking questions
right we actually look like you and
there's different species well that's
how I found the same thing when I was on
Chaco willings podcast it's like you
know we're we're very different people
but that's what's in common is that
we're able to have a conversation we're
actually able to have a conversation and
and that we're aiming I think we're all
aiming at making things better rather
than worse which is also a very
important thank Tomas
one of the things that makes that happen
is the fact that we are as you say
talking about first principles all the
time when people will talk at the top of
the iceberg then it's impossible to for
them to even see sometimes that they're
actually standing on two different
icebergs right they're not seeing the
commonalities of and they're not seeing
what's different like if I argue first
principles with somebody then you can
see how those first principles manifest
in political differences in the business
that I'm in but if you're just arguing
about a certain political policy without
examining anything that goes underneath
there then you just end up clubbing each
other and not even understanding what
the other person saying cuz you don't
understand the set of values they're
deriving those political polls part of
the problem that we have right now in
our culture is trying to diagnose the
level at which the discussion should be
taking place and I think the reason that
this is a tumultuous time is because it
actually is a time for discussion of
first principles and it's it's that
first principles are virtually at the
level of theology because first
principles are the things that you
assume and then move forwards like well
what should we assume well the dignity
of the human soul let's start with that
you can't treat yourself properly
without assuming that you can't have a
relationship with another person you
can't stabilize your family you can't
have a functional Society so what does
it mean for this human soul to have
dignity well the part of the idea is
that you're participating in creation
itself and you do that with your actions
in your language and you get to decide
whether you're tilting the world a bit
more towards heaven or a bit more
towards hell and that's actually what
you're doing so that's a place where the
literal and the metaphorical truth comes
together and people are very they're
terrified of that idea as they should be
because it's a massive responsibility
it's a massive realization of
responsibility to understand that all
the decisions that you make during the
day are decisions between hell and
heaven essentially and but I think there
is no truer way of saying that so as you
guys have both sort of hit the level
that you're at and I was at the turning
point thing with you couple weeks ago
and you literally came out it was like
the Rolling Stones came out I mean
people people were going bananas I
talked about all my political
differences with them that we've
discussed about being pro-choice and for
gay marriage although they're basically
okay with that and and being pro pot and
all that and I got a standing ovation we
did our thing in
sin and the line for you after was
longer than the line for me and I told
you this but I was like man that makes
me want to be better I have to I wasn't
jealous of you I was like man he's doing
something great and I have to be better
so my question for you is this was all
meant to be right I mean without going
to religious or metaphysical but the
internet sort has now allowed all of the
people that were watching television and
seeing pop culture and gone something is
really wrong here something is missing
the Internet has sort of forced us
together I mean that's this this growing
group is because we're it's not because
we're all looking for it it's because
we're being forced together and what's
really funny is the way that everybody
is introduced to our work is is the same
way but it's the way that you wouldn't
expect so most people I think Jordan
originally saw you in a confrontation
with somebody over transgender pronouns
right and that's how most people began
to engage and then suddenly you are
getting 500,000 views on discussions of
biblical stories from Genesis which I
mean let's be frank if if the first
thing never happens 5,000 because right
and the same thing is true for me right
the way that I originally kind of drew
public attention was because I was on
Piers Morgan's show and I shall act him
on a show and so all of a sudden people
were now listening to our long lectures
about about you know my ideas on
philosophy and root principles of the
founding fathers if it came for the
scandal and stayed for the content and
that's and that's I think the advantage
that it takes a particular skill set for
everyone in this space to be able to do
that but that's that's the beauty of the
of the YouTube moment and of the
Internet moment is that people are
engaging it in the news level if you
just watch any new cable news channel
the news cycle is about 30 seconds long
then there's the headlines again and so
that's the level at which we consume but
if you see every sees the flashpoint for
you or the flashpoint for me or the
flashpoint for Sam with Ben Affleck or
the flashpoint for you with number many
of them for you and then they and then
they want more and it's the introduction
of it it's basically the gateway drug
like there's a 30-second video that's
the gateway drug to these two hour-long
lectures about deeper principles and
people and the reason that the question
is why those flash points flash and I
think that because what makes those
different what makes it that people want
to see that and then they go okay now I
want to see the rest of their content
and start streaming tons of videos from
these folks happy newman video so is a
good
yeah so let's get to that one second I
just want to leave that is is just that
I think it's incongruity they see
something different and if you notice
difference in the society on any level
then you are automatically a pariah and
an outlier and we all know deep down
that there are distinctions and
differences to be made logically between
I'm not talking about groups of people
ethnically you know for some odd reason
I'm talking about just logical
distinctions between modes of thought
and logical distinctions between between
certain policies and if you are willing
to draw distinctions instead of just
saying that we have to exist in this
morass of identity politics that's it's
a flash in the darkness and people
gravitate toward the light like mom well
it's partly because the problem with the
problem with relativism let's say let's
say that that did produce a radical
state of equality well the problem with
that is that there's no up and the
[Music]
alright people were taking a break from
politics this week and we're gonna focus
on the f-word that's right
food they say you are what you eat and
if that's true a lot of us are half hot
dog half pizza and half ice cream I know
that that's three-halves but we're a
pretty fat group of people these days
every week there's a new diet to follow
a new oil to avoid or a new superfood
that'll change your life then the week
after that we usually find out that the
new revolutionary diet will actually
make you gain weight you actually need
that oil to live and the superfood does
absolutely nothing and an endless slew
of magazines to the countless websites
and blogs devoted to keeping you
clicking on the newest fad and it
becomes almost impossible to figure out
what you should eat as those of you who
follow me on social media know I'm in
the midst of a little diet myself right
now
I'm doing a slow carb paleo diet which
is a slightly modified version of what
former Rubin Report guests Tim Ferriss
helped popularize basically I'm eating
only meat fish and veggies with no sugar
and very limited carbs I'm even putting
grass-fed butter in my coffee to get an
extra boost of fat and energy in the
morning as of taping this direct message
I've lost about 5 pounds in 10 days
although I've also punched four random
strangers on the street for looking at
me the wrong way but as they say
everything in moderation of course what
you should or shouldn't put in your body
isn't just about weight it's also about
your mind and this is a place where the
science is actually pretty solid the
foods that we eat or don't eat can have
a tremendous effect on our brain itself
right down to our ability to think as
we've seen a spike in degenerative brain
diseases such as Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's disease which are just two
of the many forms of dementia it's
becoming clearer and clearer that
fueling our brains with the right foods
and avoiding the wrong ones are a key to
brain health so much of what we talk
about on this show is related to clear
and critical thinking well we may not
think about how the food that we eat is
affecting our brains on a daily basis
feeding our brains the right foods is as
important actually possibly more
important than feeding our brains the
right information so this week we're
going to learn
some information on what we should feed
our brains so that we're optimized to
engage in intellectual battles in the
best way possible joining me to discuss
this is an old friend of the show and
author of the new book genius foods max
Luger veer now excuse me while I put
grass-fed butter on an avocado sprinkled
with goji berries joining me today is a
truth seeker a self experimenter of
brain food expert and author of the
upcoming book genius foods max Luger
beer welcome back thanks so much for
having to the Rubin report this is a
back although most of my audience now
will not know you from the Rubin report
but you used to do the old Rubin report
seems like a real lifetime ago doesn't
it yeah yeah back back in the day when
it was a panel show it was a panel show
years ago on tea uit I don't even know
what we were doing I have almost no
recollection of my life at that time
it's you know the every time that I was
on it though I would always have such a
good time and I always would think to
myself like how good you are at what you
do and so I'm just so honored to like be
here in this new set and to see your
success like you know the fact that
you've just blown up it's awesome cool
well thank you and I feel the same and
I'm glad that our pads have sort of you
know been on parallel tracks kind of
growing together you have a new book
coming out which we're gonna talk about
shortly the last time I saw you though
it was about two or two-and-a-half years
ago you had me eat some really nasty
stuff on camera that you felt I don't
even know why you had me eat it but you
wanted me to what what did we eat yeah
because you're doing a lot about food
yeah so you're you're testing this stuff
out all time we ate natto
which is a fermented soy bean dish that
is very commonly consumed in Japan and
that was my first time ever trying it
because I think yeah back where your old
set was we were like a few blocks away
from like a Japanese market yeah yeah
and I was like wow what a great place to
go and try to find this food that I've
heard so much about because of its
purported health benefits but I'd never
tasted it and it's known for being
particularly gnarly like it smells like
dirty socks yeah
and I knew that you were back at the
studio and I was like what you know
there's no better time to try this
gnarly food than with my friend dave
rubin so i brought it back and we tried
it and yeah i don't think you were that
into it it was pretty nasty yeah I mean
I'm a pretty open eater and we're gonna
get a lot into the different types of
things that you should be eating and
fermented food obviously good but it was
kind of like beans in this gooey sticky
sauce and it stunk to high hell it's got
the cool you're saying it was good for
my brain it's very good it's very good
yeah there's I mean you know it's the
top known source of vitamin k2 which is
a really important vitamin for vitamin
for maintaining calcium homeostasis in
the body basically keeping calcium in
the parts of your body where calcium
should be yeah like your bones in your
teeth and out of your soft tissues like
your kidneys and your arteries and stuff
like that there's really good research
on vitamin k2 and yeah just you know
natto is one of these foods they eat it
and you know one of the world's Blue
Zones so I just figured why not give it
a try yeah I would say it has the
consistency of like baked beans with a
little bit of like personal lubricant
that's world together yeah which is
obviously not appealing it's that sounds
quite horrific that you had something
here for you to taste on camera don't
even awesome like kicking the ball back
yeah something like that alright maybe
maybe next time alright so first I
thought well we start off with before we
get to the book is I think sort of what
you're doing is interesting because it
kind of parallels what I'm doing here
where we're watching mainstream media
crumble and people are coming to people
like me perhaps and and Shapiro and Joe
Rogan and all these alternate voices to
hear about news and I also think that's
happening in the food world and the diet
world as well where you used to maybe
watch the nightly news to find out what
you're supposed to eat what the latest
fad is what all's you're not supposed to
have it cetera et cetera and now people
are going to people like Joe Rogan who I
just mentioned Tim Ferriss people like
you did you sort of see that thing
coming and that's why you started
getting into this world and we'll talk a
little bit about your the personal
reasons why you got into just a sec yeah
no yeah I mean it's it's an amazing
point I feel that you know look we live
in a time you know and in a world where
we have all of the world's information
at our fingertips at any given time with
our smartphones you know
and research is out there information
wants to be free so you know whereas
prior generations I feel like you know
could have could have only received
health information from the doctor or
nutrition information from the
nutritionist today you know I think
things are different where people that
are passionate and that do their
homework in a way I'm not just talking
about going to you know media for their
health information but you know PubMed
is something that anybody can search
it's that you know the research is out
there not everybody's gonna be qualified
to the degree that they can you know
understand for example medical
literature or even cut through the
jargon but there's a lot that people can
glean from what is readily available I
mean one of the ways that I try to tell
people to become educated about health
and science and research is to look at
websites that put out university press
releases that often accompany studies
like science daily for example or
medical express you know oftentimes when
a study is released the University will
write a press release that basically has
the gist of what the study basically
found in layman's terms and that's often
what journalists will use to write
pieces for like the Huffington Post or
Fast Company so what I tell people is to
do is cut out the middleman go to the
press releases read them then go to the
research article compare what you read
in layman's terms in the press release
to the research article and that can
actually help you interpret research so
the average person though obviously
you're not gonna do all that legwork and
I think that's where someone like you
comes in going I will sit down read all
this stuff yeah and now distill it to
you in a way that makes some sense yeah
well my background I mean you know
before before really diving into health
and nutrition and fitness I was a
journalist you know at Current TV which
was my first job out of college and so
getting to work with the journalists
there you know Peabody award-winning
journalists award-winning storytellers
it gave me a sense of how to ask
questions how to pick my sources and
then when I became interested in
nutrition and health you know I kind of
knew not only where to look but how to
look and and yeah and you know my unique
job gave me the time and the ability and
you know my personal circumstances yeah
and so yeah I don't expect everybody to
do
their own research but I do think that
people should do their own research I do
think that the the you know healthcare
healthcare is something that we like to
pretend that we're able to sort of
offload to our healthcare providers
right but you don't go to a doctor to be
healthy you go to a doctor to become
free of disease or to have a disease
treated I think health care really is
something that you know starts in the
kitchen and in the gym and it's
something that we you know that we have
to in you know and view our lives with
day to day yeah and I wanted to start
with that because I think it sets the
table properly because I know on YouTube
there's a million people talking about
health and diets and all that stuff and
I want people to understand that you're
somebody that I know has been in this
for a long time actually doing the
research so let's go to that that
personal circumstance part that you
mentioned you sort of got into this it's
probably only about five years ago you
with the circumstances with your mom and
all yeah yeah so when I left Current TV
to sort of figure out where I was gonna
go with my career it was sort of in that
downtime in between jobs that my mom
started displaying very strange symptoms
that I couldn't explain I mean memory
you know problems with her memory she
complained of brain fog and she also had
changes to her gait that were very
apparent I mean my mom is a spirited New
Yorker and New Yorkers walk very fast
they walk everywhere and my mom ran a
business so cognitively she was always
very sharp and essentially what we what
we saw is that my mom's cognition took
like a it just seemed to have like you
know like a web browser with too many
open tabs is how I described it you know
just you know like a stuttering frame
rate on a YouTube video with a poor
internet connection and my mom's gate
changed where you know before she was a
very fast Walker
she almost developed sort of like a
shuffle and both of these strange
symptoms seemed to come on at once and I
had no prior family history of any
neurodegenerative disease you know
dementia to me was not a term that I was
familiar with I didn't know what else hi
MERS disease was actually when I thought
about the word dementia you know I
thought about that character from The
Addams Family movie you know like it was
like cousin it's or Fester's like a rush
or something her name was dementia which
was actually pretty fun
but yeah so coinciding with like my
ignorance I had the time to go with my
mom to some of the top neurology
departments in the country we were very
fortunate to be able to do that we went
to you know NYU Columbia and New York
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore the Cleveland
Clinic all in hopes of trying to find
some kind of diagnosis for my mom to see
what was going on and it was in 2011 at
the Cleveland Clinic where my mom was
diagnosed with a neurodegenerative
disease for the first time and she was
prescribed drugs for both Parkinson's
disease and Alzheimer's disease and at
that moment I mean my world pretty much
stopped like I it was I'm a pretty chill
guy that that weekend or that week in
Cleveland it was the first time in my
life that I'd ever had a panic attack I
was just so freaked out by the
possibility that my mom had this fatal
disease for which there is no cure or
particularly meaningful treatment and I
basically became unable to think about
anything else let alone my career I
ended up you know my mom started taking
the drugs I ended up coming back to LA
to try to you know look for jobs and do
what it is that you do when you live in
LA and you're a journalist on TV and I
basically became unable to think about
anything other than nutrition you know
every waking minute that I wasn't you
know doing something career related I
was in PubMed digging through the
research and what I think really
motivated this journey from you was the
fact that what I uncovered in the
research was a stark contrast to the you
know what neuroscientist Norman Doidge
calls neurological nihilism to the to
the despair and bleakness that I
experienced in those doctors offices
with my mom yeah can you describe what
that is yeah what are they actually
telling you well the despair yeah so I
call it diagnosed and audio's you know
basically there's a there's a there's a
quote that I learned that is circulated
amongst medical school medical school
students that neurologists don't treat
disease they admire it that's because
the brain is a mystery for the most part
I mean we know quite a bit about the
brain which is surprising
there's a lot more unknowns than notes
at this point and treatments for
neurological diseases are very limited
you know no there's no approved drug for
Alzheimer's disease that has a disease
modifying treatment they only act as
band-aids like chemical band-aids
essentially that work to sort of
artificially boost neurotransmitters in
the brain but they do nothing to solve
the underlying pathology and you know
drug trials are notoriously bad flies
are just announced for example that
they're gonna stop pursuing
pharmaceutical treatments for
Alzheimer's disease because treating the
quest to find a drug to treat the
disease has like a ninety nine point six
two percent fail rate that's worse than
any other you know disease so meaning
that they're getting out of the game
altogether they view this as something
that can't be solved yeah via drugs I
mean that sounds incredible I don't know
how often that happens with other
diseases right that sounds that sounds
pretty staggering yeah I mean another
huge pharmaceutical company basically
recently announced this ain't the same
thing axe event yeah it's a massive fell
rate so think about it from like the
perspective perspective of an investor
you know are you gonna invest in an
Alzheimer's or in any drug trial that
has you know a ninety nine point six
percent fail rate it's you know it's
just not a smart investment and that's
why Alzheimer's disease research is
criminally underfunded or I shouldn't
say criminally it makes sense although
it's tragic because you know if there
was a pill tomorrow that I could give my
mom that would help in a meaningful way
of course I wouldn't want it I wanted
for all the five million people in
America that are suffering from
Alzheimer's disease well I'm just saying
you know because I can bring almost
anything back to politics it's like this
is a good argument for a publicly funded
scientific research because it doesn't
have to deal with the bottom line where
you're saying yeah these companies they
have to deal with the bottom line and
shareholders and they have to then stop
at some point if they can't get far
enough where something publicly funded
they can keep going to the science
hopefully although you found that there
are some other ways to deal with this
and that's that's really what changed
your life yeah so I you know I so on the
one hand I became really interested in
learning about diet you know potential
diet and lifestyle interventions
that I could throw my mom's away to sort
of help her but then at the same time I
became really conscious of my own brain
health because I learned that changes
begin in the brain decades before the
first symptom of Alzheimer's disease
which is just one form of dementia but
even Parkinson's disease by the time you
show your first symptom of Parkinson's
disease half of the neurons involved in
movement in that part in the part of the
brain associated with Parkinson's
disease are already dead so these are
not you know like any chronic disease
these are not diseases that develop
overnight they take years if not decades
to develop and I became really
interested in doing what I could do in
my own life to maximize my brain health
so that I might not have to deal with
what it is that my mom is dealing with
well go from there and will slightly
shift to your book and obviously this is
all intertwined this is the advance copy
the book comes out in a couple weeks and
I was reading a little bit and I just
thought that the opening alone was was
really perfect so I'm just gonna read
the opening paragraph
unless do you want to read it in your
own voice maybe maybe you should you
know what okay I'm gonna let you read
the reading paragraph of your book oh
man I thought it was pretty beautiful
thank you so much
nestled within your skull mere inches
from your eyes are eighty six billion of
the most efficient transistors in the
known universe this neural network is
you running the operating system we know
is life and no computer yet conceived
comes close to its awesome capabilities
forged over millions and millions of
years of life on earth your brain is
capable of storing nearly eight thousand
iPhones worth of information everything
you are do love feel care for longed for
and aspire to is enabled by an
incredibly complex invisible symphony of
neurological processes elegant seamless
and blisteringly fast when scientists
tried to simulate just one second of a
human brains abilities it took
supercomputers 40 minutes to do so so
yeah I mean the brain isn't we each are
heir to this amazing birthright yeah I
know forged over millions of million you
know millions and millions of years of
life on earth and yet the modern world
is fighting it at every turn you know
from the toxic industrial products that
have saturated the food supply to the
dietary advice that we've been given
[Music]
all right I want to get down to all the
things we should be eating we talked
about green leafy things yeah but
there's a lot more to it than that
that's what a lot of this is about so
let's get to it if you want to someone's
watching this right now yeah maybe
they're eating poorly maybe they're
eating okay maybe they think they're
doing a pretty good job but they want to
just kind of reset yeah take them from
beet one yeah so I mean I think the
first thing that people should do is
really cut out the processed foods which
is harder than it seems you know and and
I definitely my heart goes out to people
that feel like they can't give up the
junk food because again you know these
foods are not designed to be consumed in
moderation the advice to eat everything
in moderation is horrible in the modern
world in the modern supermarket
literally our our supermarket aisles are
lined with foods that are designed by
scientists that are paid a lot more than
you and I to create insatiable
overconsumption and addiction yeah wait
let's let's focus on that because it
sounds like it's not true but it's
actually true like they actually have
people working on isn't this what they
did with Doritos originally I think I
think that they mean that Cool Ranch
flavor
I usually just - I literally used to
just lick those chips you don't want to
eat your fingers yeah yeah yeah so there
are literally scientists working for
these companies making you want more and
more and more of this absolutely these
foods you know net which now make up
again 60% of the calories consumed in
the u.s. are designed to screw up your
brain and usually what happens is the
scientists will combine some parts sugar
wheat usually with fat and salt and it
creates this this unique mixture of
delectable you know mouthfeel as well as
just you know the the the exact
sensation that we've evolved basically
to seek out more of it just sets off
dopamine fireworks in our brains is that
actually the same thing that happens to
your brain when you do drugs and then
you need more drugs I mean is it really
the same chemical reactions that are
happening yeah absolutely if not worse I
mean they've done Studies on on
rats for example which are all it'd
basically in rats provide a really great
look into the behavior that certain
foods drive because you know they've got
no super-ego to steer them from what it
is that they really want to do they're
all it so they've shown that rats
actually prefer sugar to cocaine which
is funny because rats really like
cocaine yeah hi
rats really like cocaine they really
like cocaine yeah but um no I mean we
tend to think you know of ourselves as
having had like a moral failure right
like when we go through a whole bag of
chips or like eat the whole pint of ice
cream but again like these foods are not
designed to be consumed in moderation
they're designed literally to have you
finish that whole pint or that whole bag
and then go back as a repeat customer
yeah I always think the branding of it
is so funny to like you see all these
things like guilt-free chips or don't
feel bad about how fat you are it's for
any of this stuff and it's like it's all
this weird psychological play to get you
to keep eating ah yes no once you pop
you can't stop it's like a truism with
scientific backing yeah at this point
all right so the the reset person that's
watching this right now that's gonna
start doing some yeah okay get the
processed stuff out and that includes
like that's pretty much all the stuff
that you see in the frozen section yeah
like like all of that frozen breakfast
stuff and all those sandwiches and all
definitely and actually you know a
really good recommendation for people
that are really trying to make this
change is to first actually which is
kind of counterintuitive but to work on
your sleep sleep I like to say allows a
person getting good quality adequate
sleep gives a person the hormonal
fortitude to make those dietary changes
so when you you know when you're under
slept actually a study was just put out
showing the people tend to over consume
and eat excess calories predominantly
from these exact kinds of foods so yeah
optimising sleep and then what do they
say on sleep like is it eight hours
really is that what they want for like
the average yeah eight hours is a good
amount and then it's that's also roughly
the amount of sleep that you need to
maximize growth hormone which is an
important hormone in the body for
preserving lean mass but yeah I mean in
quality sleep as well so I mean not just
getting those eight hours but making
sure that those eight hours are really
you know super high quality
and we can get into ways of optimizing
sleep I guess one of them one of the
best ways that I like to optimize my
sleep and I find it to be very effective
is to limit my exposure to screens at
night because what time do you shut down
yeah I mean I shut down I try to shut
down two to three hours before bed or if
I if I'm not shutting down and I have to
work up until the point of which you
know I go to bed I mean let's face it
living in the real world you know
sometimes we have to respond to an
urgent email I use blue light blocking
glasses mm-hmm
which I'm a big fan of actually and
there's good research on amber colored
glasses and their ability to sort of
mitigate some of the loss of melatonin
do you know is that the same effect that
the iPhone has now with their night
thing is that that same thing I'm not
sure that I'm filtering yeah
yeah I'm not sure if it's comparable
actually I mean I'd feel it certainly
feels way better to my eyes when night
shift is on but yeah I mean I noticed
that when I so in my house in New York
I've got it's my brother's I live with
my brother he has a massive TV it's like
85 inches or just one of the biggest
monsters at television I've ever seen in
my life and you know he likes to watch
movies up until the point at which he
goes to bed and that's not my preference
but I do that with him sometimes and
I'll watch like a movie up until like
midnight or something and I notice that
when I have that amount of light pouring
into my face when I go to bed right
after that I'll oftentimes actually wake
up feeling hungover even though I've
never I've had the eight hours of sleep
and I hadn't had any alcohol
I just feel under slept and not
rejuvenated whereas when I wear the blue
light blogging glasses and I have no you
know I'm not uh you know formally
affiliated with any of these companies I
don't manufacture them in any sense but
uh but I do find that they work I wait I
wake up feeling a lot more refreshed
when I hear them I well I think that the
digital piece of this is so interesting
as I talk about it with almost every
guest like just the frustration with
social media and not putting this stuff
down in digital addiction and and all of
this and it's like one of the things
that I've tried to do is I never bring
my phone into my room anymore
badge tomorrow I just stopped doing it
because I realized wow right before I go
to bed I'm looking at my phone and then
literally the first thing I do when I
wake up yeah before I brush my teeth
before I go to the bathroom is I'm
suddenly looking at my phone again like
even if it's all wonderful news it's
probably not and it's usually not yeah
but even if it was it's probably not a
great way to start saying so that and
I've really really been trying to do no
technology on the weekends and I think
and I think that that's really helped so
is there some sort of connection between
all of that and and like just the
digital monster that's affecting iodine
- yeah I mean there's no you're just
like well yeah I mean I think from a
mood standpoint for sure I mean like you
know our stress response evolved at a
time when things that were stressful to
us required our immediate attention
right so cycle there yeah like a bear in
your face yeah like this like protracted
long-term psychological stress though
that so many of us have you know so
commonly today is a fairly new invention
in on the evolutionary timescale and the
media for example knows this and like an
app developer app developers know this
that's why I like you turn on any you
know news station local news especially
they abide by the if it bleeds it leads
mentality put the most anxiety inducing
segment up front or tease at it at least
so that it causes an expression of or an
upregulation of norepinephrine in the
brain which is basically the brain's
focus and attention neurotransmitter
associated with stress and that's
something that you know it makes you
more alert makes you feel more awake and
so when you read you know doom and gloom
news on your on your smartphone you're
basically having the same exact stress
response yeah it's funny how when you
step away from it a little bit to how
silly it almost seems so like when I get
away on the weekend and then I'm back on
Monday if I look back at anything that
might have happened and I see all these
people find I'm like wow you all spent
your weekend just fighting about this
stuff it's one thing that we're doing it
on the weekdays and maybe we can all
manage that myself included maybe we can
all manage that a little differently
nope that endless sort of you know way
out thing it's it's a lot it also yeah I
mean I'm not as familiar with the there
was this there was a study that came out
showing that just
having your smartphone around you is
exhausting from a cognitive standpoint
you know just sort of having it around
and sort of feeling that pull we get
addicted to it I mean it sort of you
know hijacks our dopamine systems as
well you know being addicted to social
media that's a real thing yeah it's
interesting to me though because people
watch this show and we know what our
watch times are and they're off the
charts for for YouTube which usually has
like a seven second watch time or
something and that shows to me that
people want long-form they actually want
something that isn't so insulting to
their senses to their brain now
ironically many people are watching this
right now or listening on their phones
but a lot of people listen on their
phones while they're doing exercise or
while their computer you're saying but I
do sense that people want something else
so it's like the news is giving us the
local news as you're saying they're
giving us something we don't want
because they know it'll keep us there
but food companies are giving us
something that's not good for us because
they know it'll keep us there we now
know Tristan Harris who I've had on
talked about how the tech companies and
you just alluded to this are giving us
things that they know are bad first so
it really is your job yeah it's like a
full-time job now as a human to be like
I'm gonna do the things that actually
argued for me not the things you keep
feeding well exactly and you know that's
why I think it's such a shame because we
each are heir to this amazing gift right
the human brain yet the modern world is
like The Hunger Games right like
attacking it from every which way and we
are not equipped with the tools to
understand you know what to do to sort
of fix that situation yeah and so yeah I
mean I definitely recommend people
taking a break you know from social
media from news the 24-hour news cycle I
think is just not healthy and then also
certainly food you know I think food is
a major part of it lifestyle you know
one of the things that I talked about in
the book we go into depth is the fact
that you know not only are we more
sedentary than we've ever been not
getting enough exercise but you know
there's a there was another form of
exercise that we all had for the
majority of our evolution and that is
thermal exercise you know today we live
in a time where you know there's chronic
climate control you know and that's
something that seems to be to the
detriment of our metabolisms
so I talked about how you can use you
know cold showers to enhance vigilance
which is one of the few things that you
can do that you actually feel a shift in
your consciousness are you big on that
people there are these people that like
jump from like the hot tub to a freezing
cold I do that yeah you know wait maybe
it was you that I thought you were you
took a picture like in a pool or
something yeah yeah it must've been you
I think the first time I saw it so what
is that so you jump in from hot water to
cold water in your system is just like
constantly rebooting yeah well it's
called contrast therapy so basically you
know and your and a lot of the
mechanisms are sort of conserved between
the two activities so you know when you
go into a cold when you go into like a
sauna for example you're activating
something called heat shock proteins
which are there to sort of guard the
proteins in your body against
disfigurement which is really important
because a lot of the diseases that we're
talking about Alzheimer's disease
Parkinson's disease are associated with
misfolded proteins so anytime we can
sort of activate these heat shock
proteins seems to be helpful
they're also activated when you expose
yourself to cold air yeah there's really
good there's really good research a lot
of people now are practicing cryotherapy
as a means of enhancing you know
vigilance reducing inflammation boosting
metabolism increasing the proliferation
of brown fat we all have a kind of fad
in us that it wasn't thought that adults
carried it with them past you know
childhood or infancy but now we know
that we actually have this sort of fad
it's actually a good fat a fad that we
want more of because it's metabolically
active and it burns calories so by going
into cold I mean keeping ourselves
exposed too you know it intermittent
cooler temperatures we actually
encourage the proliferation of this hat
which is really cool so I thought by
moving to LA and being an 80-degree so
every day was good that was a good thing
I guess it's good for my vitamin D but
that's not good for some of this other
stuff yeah yes I so I think getting back
to that you know having a little bit
more thermal stress in our lives is
important they've done really good
research on people with type 2 diabetes
and have found that you know even mild
cold below you know or higher I should
say than then what would be like a
freezing temperature does improve
insulin sensitivity which is sort of the
hallmark of metabolic
health which is really interesting it's
a way to improve your health without
even doing anything I mean you basically
just turn the dial on your air
conditioner down a little bit more yeah
all right so now let's circle back okay
okay this person starts that word this
imaginary person that we're talking
about that's watching right now I'm
going all right I'm going to incorporate
some of that stuff yes they're gonna get
the the Eggos leg oh my they're gonna
get that out of the way processed food
in the morning right what are they
replacing that with for breakfast yeah
so I mean start this day okay let's
start the day well first of all there is
no biological need for breakfast so
let's just get you know get that out of
the picture but I thought breakfast was
the most important meal of the day the
meal that you break your fast with is
important but there's no biological need
to eat as soon as you wake up so whether
you push that first meal an hour after
you wake up or two hours after you wake
up you should be able to do that I mean
breakfast is a fairly new construct you
know in the evolutionary sense and also
when you wake up first thing in the
morning your body has a really unique
hormonal milieu where it wants to burn
fat you know cortisol is at its highest
it Peaks immediately after you wake up
and cortisol is sort of like the body's
fat burning hormone it's the body's
chief catabolic hormone liberate stored
fatty acids sugars proteins and sort of
throw breakfast into that equation
especially in the most commonly the most
commonly consumed form of it which is
you know as you said like a Lego an eggo
waffle yeah no offense there go and
Doritos before yeah where does naming
some things here yeah yeah what for the
person though that wants to have you
know something in the morning fat and
fiber and protein so you know eggs are a
perfect food to eat first thing in the
morning a scramble for example with some
spinach kale and some extra virgin olive
oil or you can use a little bit of
coconut oil that's a you know great eat
an avocado oh those are two good oils
cuz every I feel like every year someone
says grapeseed oils good now I know you
I saw on your website get rid of the
great yellow carrot or something to do a
grapeseed oil okay no problem yes but
when you're cooking you so basically
you're saying coconut oil or coconut oil
is good yeah you can actually cook with
a extra-virgin olive oil it maintains
you know it doesn't oxidize the way
some of these awful grain and seed oils
will corn oil soybean oil canola oil
grape seed oil these are the worst yeah
that's basically like the smoke point
part right where it becomes actually
interestingly and this is a question I
get asked a lot smoke point and the
temperature at which an oil oxidizes
there there's no relationship so smoke
point is something that's like a
culinary concern more than anything else
and in fact these oils like canola oil
corn oil soybean oil are so heavily
processed in order for them to have a
high smoke point but actually they
become rancid at much lower temperatures
whereas you take a you know like a fat
like butter butter will start to smoke
pretty early on but it's not because the
fat oxidizing is because of the proteins
and the KCM you know the trace lactose
encasing and found in butter but that
actually has no bearing on whether or
not it's good or bad for you
so basically though if you were making
you know an egg yeah you some use some
kale and spinach you're talking about
olive oil you're talking about coconut
oil use some water or butter yeah yeah
exactly yeah because you know the more
saturated an oil is the more chemically
stable it's gonna be at higher
temperatures so higher heat cooking you
want to use coconut oil butter ghee lard
tallow things like that
my coffee right now it's got ghee and
MCT oil and and collagen in it it
doesn't really taste like coffee anymore
but it's not bad collagen is awesome I
did a great you know article deep dive
into the health benefits of collagen on
my website and MCT oil is great I don't
you know I don't really see people that
have no idea MCT oil it's it's like an
extract of coconut oil yes yeah so MCT
oil is digested differently than other
fats it basically goes straight to the
liver and it becomes converted to
ketones which are a sort of alternate
fuel that the brain will readily use
when they're available and there's some
really interesting research on MCT as a
potential intervention for patients with
Alzheimer's disease it might
theoretically help people sort of wean
themselves off of carbs by sort of
[Music]
joining me today is a truth seeker a
self experimenter of brain food expert
and author of the upcoming book genius
foods max Luger beer welcome back thanks
so much for having to the Rubin report
this is a back although most of my
audience now will not know you from the
Rubin report but you used to do the old
Rubin report seems like a real lifetime
ago doesn't it yeah yeah back back in
the day when it was a panel show it was
a panel show years ago on T uit I don't
even know what we were doing I have
almost no recollection of my life at
that time it's you know the every time
that I was on it though I would always
have such a good time and I always would
think to myself like how good you are at
what you do and so I'm just so honored
to like be here in this new set and to
see your success like you know the fact
that you've just blown up it's awesome
cool well thank you and I feel the same
and I'm glad that our our pads have sort
of you know I've been on parallel tracks
kind of growing together you have a new
book coming out which we're gonna talk
about shortly the last time I saw you
though it was about two or
two-and-a-half years ago you had me eat
some really nasty stuff on camera that
you felt I don't even know why you had
me eat it but you wanted me to what did
we eat you know because you're doing a
lot about food yeah so you're you're
testing this stuff out we ate natto
which is a fermented soy bean dish that
is very commonly consumed in Japan and
that was my first time ever trying it
because I think yeah back where your old
set was we were like a few blocks away
from like a Japanese market yeah yeah
and I was like wow what a great place to
go and try to find this food that I've
heard so much about because of its
purported health benefits but I'd never
tasted it and it's known for being
particularly gnarly like it smells like
dirty socks yeah and I knew that you
were back at the studio and I was like
what you know there's no better time to
try this gnarly food than with my friend
dave rubin so i brought it back and we
tried it and yeah i don't think you were
that into it it was pretty nasty yeah I
mean I'm a pretty open eater and we're
gonna get a lot into the different types
of things that you should be eating and
fermented food obviously good but it was
kind of like
beans in this gooey sticky sauce and it
stunk to high hell it's got the clothes
you're saying it was good for my brain
it's very good it's very good yeah
there's I mean you know it's the top
known source of vitamin k2 which is a
really important vitamin for vitamin for
maintaining calcium homeostasis in the
body basically keeping calcium in the
parts of your body where calcium should
be yeah like your bones in your teeth
and out of your soft tissues like your
kidneys and your arteries and stuff like
that there's really good research on
vitamin k2 and yeah I just you know
natto is one of these foods they eat it
in you know one of the world's Blue
Zones
so I just figured why not give it a try
I would say it has the consistency of
like baked beans with a little bit of
like personal lubricant that's world
together yeah it is obviously not
appealing it's that sounds quite
horrific that should've had something
here for you to taste on camera don't
even awesome by kicking the ball back
yeah it's something like that all right
maybe maybe next time all right so first
I thought well we start off with before
we get to the book is I think sort of
what you're doing is interesting because
it kind of parallels what I'm doing here
where we're watching mainstream media
crumble and people are coming to people
like me perhaps and and Shapiro and Joe
Rogan and all these alternate voices to
hear about news and I also think that's
happening in the food world and the diet
world as well where you used to maybe
watch the nightly news to find out what
you're supposed to eat what the latest
fad is what all's you're not supposed to
have it cetera et cetera and now people
are going to people like Joe Rogan who I
just mentioned Tim Ferriss people like
you did you sort of see that thing
coming and that's why you started
getting into this world and we'll talk a
little bit about your the personal
reasons why you got into just a sec yeah
no yeah I mean it's it's an amazing
point I feel that you know look we live
in a time you know and in a world where
we have all of the world's information
at our fingertips at any given time with
our smartphones you know and research is
out there information wants to be free
so you know whereas prior generations I
feel like you know could have could have
only received health information from
the doctor or nutrition information from
the nutritionist today you know I think
things are different where people that
are passionate and that do their
homework in a way I'm not just talking
about going to you know media for
their health information but you know
PubMed is something that anybody can
search it's how you know the research is
out there not everybody's gonna be
qualified to the degree that they can
you know understand for example medical
literature or even cut through the
jargon but there's a lot that people can
glean from what is readily available I
mean one of the ways that I try to tell
people to become educated about health
and science and research is to look at
websites that put out university press
releases that often accompany studies
like Science Daily for example or
medical Xpress you know oftentimes when
a study is released the University will
write a press release that basically has
the gist of what the study basically
found in layman's terms and that's often
what journalists will use to write
pieces for like the Huffington Post or
Fast Company so what I tell people is to
do is cut out the middleman go to the
press releases read them then go to the
research article compare what you read
in layman's terms in the press release
to the research article and that can
actually help you interpret research so
the average person though obviously
you're not going to do all that legwork
and I think that's where someone like
you comes in going I will sit down read
all this stuff yeah and now distill it
to you in a way that makes some sense
yeah well my background I mean you know
before before really diving into health
and nutrition and fitness I was a
journalist you know at Current TV which
was my first job out of college and so
getting to work with the journalists
there you know Peabody award-winning
journalists award-winning storytellers
it gave me a sense of how to ask
questions how to pick my sources and
then when I became interested in
nutrition and health you know I kind of
knew not only where to look but how to
look and and yeah and you know my unique
job gave me the time and the ability and
you know my personal circumstances yeah
and so yeah I don't expect everybody to
do their own research but I do think
that people should do their own research
I do think that the the you know health
care health care is something that we
like to pretend that we're able to sort
of offload to our health care providers
right but you don't go to a doctor to be
healthy you go to a doctor to become
free of disease or to have a disease
treated I think health care really is
something that
you know starts in the kitchen and in
the gym and it's something that we you
know that we have to in you know and
view our lives with day to day yeah and
I wanted to start with that because I
think it sets the table properly because
I know on YouTube there's a million
people talking about health and diets
and all that stuff and I want people to
understand that you're somebody that I
know has been in this for a long time
actually doing the research so let's go
to that that personal circumstance part
that you mentioned you sort of got into
this it's probably only about five years
ago you with the circumstances with your
mom and all yeah I'm taking yeah so when
I left Current TV to sort of figure out
where I was gonna go with my career it
was sort of in that downtime in between
jobs that my mom started displaying very
strange symptoms that I couldn't explain
I mean memory you know problems with her
memory she complained of brain fog and
she also had changes to her gait that
were very apparent I mean my mom is a
spirited New Yorker and New Yorkers walk
very fast they walk everywhere and my
mom ran a business so cognitively she
was always very sharp and essentially
what we what we saw is that my mom's
cognition took like a it just seemed to
have like you know like a web browser
with too many open tabs is how I
described it you know just you know like
a stuttering framerate on a youtube
video with a poor internet connection
and my mom's gait changed where you know
before she was a very fast Walker
she almost developed sort of like a
shuffle and both of these strange
symptoms seemed to come on at once and I
had no prior family history of any
neurodegenerative disease you know
dementia to me was not a term that I was
familiar with I didn't know what
Alzheimer's disease was actually when I
thought about the word dementia you know
I thought about the character from The
Addams Family movie you know like it was
like cousin it's sore Fester's like a
crush or something her name was dementia
which was actually pretty funny but yeah
so coinciding with like my ignorance I
had the time to go with my mom to some
of the top neurology departments in the
country we're very fortunate to be able
to do that we went to you know NYU
Columbia and New York
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore the Cleveland
Clinic all in hopes of trying to find
some kind of diagnosis for my mom
what was going on and it was in 2011 at
the Cleveland Clinic where my mom was
diagnosed with a neurodegenerative
disease for the first time and she was
prescribed drugs for both Parkinson's
disease and Alzheimer's disease and at
that moment I mean my world pretty much
stopped like I it was I'm a pretty chill
guy that that weekend or that week in
Cleveland it was the first time in my
life that I'd ever had a panic attack I
was just so freaked out by the
possibility that my mom had this fatal
disease for which there is no cure or
particularly meaningful treatment and I
basically became unable to think about
anything else
let alone my career I ended up you know
my mom started taking the drugs I ended
up coming back to LA to try to you know
look for jobs and do what it is that you
do when you live in LA and you're a
journalist on TV and I basically became
unable to think about anything other
than nutrition you know every waking
minute that I wasn't you know doing
something career related I was in PubMed
digging through the research and what I
think really motivated this journey for
me was the fact that what I uncovered in
the research was a stark contrast to the
you know what neuroscientist Norman
Doidge calls neurological nihilism to
the to the despair and bleakness that I
experienced in those doctors offices
with my mom yeah can you describe what
that is yeah what are they actually
telling you well the despair yeah so I
call it diagnosed and audio's you know
basically there's a there's a there's a
quote that I learned that is circulated
amongst medical school medical school
students that neurologists don't treat
disease they admire it that's because
the brain is a mystery for the most part
I mean we know quite a bit about the
brain which is surprising but there's a
lot more unknowns than notes at this
point and treatments for neurological
diseases are very limited you know no
there's no approved drug for Alzheimer's
disease that has a disease modifying
treatment they only act as band-aids
like chemical band-aids essentially that
work to sort of artificially boost
neurotransmitters in the brain but they
do nothing to solve the underlying
Pathology and you know drug trials are
notoriously bad Faiz are just announced
for example that they're gonna stop
pursuing pharmaceutical treatments for
Alzheimer's disease because treating the
quest to find a drug to treat the
disease has like a ninety nine point six
two percent fail rate that's worse than
any other you know disease so meaning
that they're getting out of the game
altogether they view this as something
that can't be solved yeah via drugs I
mean that sounds incredible I don't know
how often that happens with other
diseases right that sounds that sounds
pretty staggering yeah I mean another
huge pharmaceutical company basically
recently announced this ain't the same
thing axe event yeah it's a massive fail
right so think about it from like the
perspective perspective of an investor
you know are you gonna invest in an
Alzheimer's or in any drug trial that
has you know a ninety nine point six
percent fail rate it's you know it's
just not a smart investment and that's
why Alzheimer's disease research is
criminally underfunded or I shouldn't
say criminally it makes sense although
it's tragic because you know if there
was a pill tomorrow that I could give my
mom that would help in a meaningful way
of course I wouldn't want it and I
wanted for all the five million people
in America that are suffering from an
Alzheimer's disease well I just think
you know because I can bring almost
anything back to politics it's like this
is a good argument for a publicly funded
scientific research because it doesn't
have to deal with the bottom line where
you're saying yeah these companies they
have to deal with the bottom line and
shareholders and they have to then stop
at some point if they can't get far
enough where something publicly funded
they can keep going to the science
hopefully although you found that there
are some other ways to deal with through
this and that's that's really what
changed your life yeah so I you know I
so on the one hand I became really
interested in learning about diet you
know potential diet and lifestyle
interventions that I could throw my
mom's way to sort of help her but then
at the same time I became really
conscious of my own brain health because
I learned that changes begin in the
brain decades before the first symptom
of Alzheimer's disease which is just one
form of dementia but even Parkinson's
disease by the time you show your first
symptom of Parkinson's disease half of
the neurons involved in movement
in that part in the part of the brain
associated with Parkinson's disease are
already dead so these are not you know
like any chronic disease these are not
diseases that develop overnight they
take years if not decades to develop and
I became really interested in doing what
I could do in my own life to maximize my
brain health so that I might not have to
deal with what it is that my mom is
dealing with yeah so we'll go from there
and we'll slightly shift to your book
and obviously this is all intertwined
this is the advanced copy the book comes
out in a couple weeks and I was reading
a little bit and I just thought that the
opening alone was was really perfect so
I'm just gonna read the the opening
paragraph unless do you want to read it
in your own voice maybe maybe you should
you know what okay I'm gonna let you
read the writing paragraph of your book
oh man I thought it was pretty beautiful
thank you so much nestled within your
skull mere inches from your eyes are 86
billion of the most efficient
transistors in the known universe this
neural network is you running the
operating system we know is life and no
computer yet conceived comes close to
it's awesome capabilities forged over
millions and millions of years of life
on earth your brain is capable of
storing nearly eight thousand iPhones
worth of information everything you are
do love feel care for longed for and
aspire to is enabled by an incredibly
complex invisible symphony of
neurological processes elegant seamless
and blisteringly fast when scientists
tried to simulate just one second of a
human brain's abilities
it took supercomputers 40 minutes to do
so so yeah I mean the brain isn't we
each are heir to this amazing birthright
yeah I know forged over millions of
million you know millions millions of
years of life on earth and yet the
modern world is fighting it at every
turn you know from the toxic industrial
products that have saturated the food
supply to the dietary advice that we've
been given for decades to now the fact
of the pendulum sort of swing in the
other direction and people are it's sort
of like a dietary free-for-all you know
yeah so alright let's shift okay my
dietary yes so I want to talk about your
or a second so you know that at the
moment I'm in the middle of this sort of
slow carb
died at this high fat no sugar no car
yes diet i've actually in about as of
this taping in about nine days i've lost
about three pounds it i actually feel
pretty good I have these like brief
moments where I want to punch random
people I think I'm being a little meaner
on Twitter that I don't know whether it
would be for real I mean like there is
just like a little bit of mood stuff but
my energy feels pretty good I'm not
getting that sort of crash from coffee
that you might get it like two o'clock
but then has people drinking all kinds
of chemicals that after their 2:30
feeling or whatever that is right so I
basically feel pretty good it's pretty
much just meat and fishing and veggies
and a lot of butter and you said you
said to me right before we started maybe
but maybe the butter isn't the great
grass-fed butter
yeah well grass-fed butter is definitely
good you know I mean there's definitely
trace nutrients in it vitamin k2 which
we talked about earlier CLA which is
being studied as a potential cancer
fighter and fat burner but it's a you
know one of the hallmarks of a healthy
food is nutrient density when you take
any concentrated fat you know butter oil
they're not very nutrient dense they've
got a lot of calories 9 calories per
gram a tablespoon of oil has 140
calories and and yeah and it's just it's
a lot of calories with very little
nutrients and there's you know on butter
alone there is not a lot of evidence to
say that butter improves fat burning or
brain health or anything like that so
you know I like to tell people that you
know consuming fat the the high fat low
carb diet if you already have fat all
you need is a low carb you know your
body has the fat to burn right so this
body's gonna go to your fat probably in
your stomach area yeah as opposed to
what a lot of people are doing with
these diets is you're loading up on fat
to sort of get the burn going on fat and
then the hope is that then it yeah you
see your family your buddies gonna want
to burn the fat that you're consuming
before it burns the fat that you have
around your waist and the point of a
diet like this I would assume is to lose
some of the fat around your around your
waist yeah I mean that's why I think
this conversation is so interesting
because I you know Ferriss Tim Ferriss
is the one that sort of did the slow
carb thing for the 4-hour body whatever
it is and it's like well alright he's
focusing on that part the weight-loss
[Music]
all right people we are live on the
YouTube I haven't done one of these in a
while just me and you human-to-human
through the tubes of the Internet I'm
very excited today we cracked 600,000
subscribers overnight I suspect
according to our internal metrics that
happen at about 2:00 a.m. Pacific time
and and it's pretty awesome this last
hundred thousand came faster than any
hundred thousand before that the five
hundred thousand mark came faster than
any hundred thousand before that and so
on we've really just grown tremendously
thanks to you guys and and it's pretty
awesome and there's so much good stuff
happening right now with the show with
the conversations we're having with all
these new interesting alliances you know
I said at the beginning of the year the
2018 is going to be the year of unusual
alliances I think there's a ton of
evidence for that already so I'm just
feeling very good about everything
that's going on we shot two shows
already today so I've already done two
both of them we're about an hour and a
half actually interviews today I'm one
of them I'm gonna leave as a as a
surprise although I am gonna tip you
guys off to some upcoming things and
then one of them I'll tell you about in
just a moment because we are expanding
some things we're doing some new new
little bonus things and all sorts of
cool stuff but anyway so in honor of
600,000 subscribers I thought we'd do in
a QA and I'll share some thoughts with
you and all that good stuff you want to
just say anything to me now is your
chance so of course if you are a member
on patreon you get the special benefits
that only a patron gets which is you'll
be bumped up to the top of the line so
if you have any questions you can just
ask in the patreon feed that goes
directly to David and Amira otherwise
you can jump in on super chat and if you
throw a couple bucks or whatever it is
the more you give I guess basically the
easier it is for us to see it and track
it and I have an iPad a fancy iPad from
this little startup company called Apple
and the questions get directly sent to
me so it comes from you and somehow
magically ends up right here in front of
me and we'll do we'll do it for about an
hour
emma is in studio if you're following on
Twitter you saw we
I believe the only interview show in the
world that has a pet bed on set and a
pet in it at this very moment so Emma's
right over there
and yeah there's a lot of cool stuff
going on I'm really feeling good about
things I know if you just listen to most
of the people especially in mainstream
news cable news everyone's hysterical
everything's crumbling everything is
horrible Trump ah it's like I actually
think there's a lot of cool stuff
happening right now and I'm very psyched
so let me just give you a couple couple
little things that are upcoming and then
we'll jump into some of this I see stuff
rolling in already so that's great so
first off one of the interviews I did
today will be aired in February so
during president's week which is
February 17th I believe that to the
Monday we are doing five shows in five
days with five different professors
about five different presidents former
presidents and I don't want to tell you
all the presidents but I interviewed a
professor today all about this Abraham
Lincoln fella and we got into the good
the bad the the nitty-gritty of all of
it we've shot two of those already but
that'll be just a great week and I want
to do more of that kind of thing where
we give you a little historical context
what I'm trying to do with all of these
interviews is not only learn the history
about some of these presidents but also
how we can view them through a 20-18
lens what would they be electable or
popular or interested in politics in
2018 you know and some of that's
obviously you know a little bit of
conjecture and you have to kind of well
it's up to the person sitting across
from me to tell me what they think but
getting great scholars in here and just
doing five shows like that that's sort
of like we've done YouTube week in the
past and and we're going to try to do
more of that kind of thing one other
thing I want to tip you off to before we
jump into the QA is that I forget what
day it is but January 31st I guess
that's probably next Tuesday if I'm not
mistaken but someone who correct me
January 31st we will crash the internet
because on this very channel right here
we will have Jordan Peterson and Ben
Shapiro in studio so I'm incredibly
psyched about that I'm gonna try to do
this in a completely different way where
we're not going to just talk about sort
of the standard political stuff that
we're talking about I've got a couple
ideas that I think are really going to
be different than a lot of the things
that you're
these two guys obviously Jordan and Ben
are out there all the time they're both
on fire I love the fact that they've
caught fire I think there's some places
of agreement and disagreement that's
completely irrelevant I just love that
they've so caught in the zeitgeist of
what's happening right now obviously
Jordan in particular after that channel
for news thing which was just so beyond
ridiculous
which you know it's sort of interesting
I'm sure many of you saw this where the
the interviewer who was very unprepared
and I know what it's like to be an
interviewer she basically was trying to
imply that his right to free speech is
less than someone in this case a trans
person's right to be not offended and he
just dealt with it so beautifully and I
think it actually will be looked back
years from now as one of the seminal
moments in sort of what's happening with
the Free Speech Movement and with
liberalism and all of the stuff that
we're talking about all the time sort of
like the sam harris ben affleck gross
and racist thing was i think another one
of those that bubbled up into mainstream
was ben shapiro with piers morgan about
guns but occasionally this group of
people that Eric Weinstein has coined
the term intellectual dark web and I see
that kind of catching along that this
crew that you guys are watching online
and listening to and all that that this
crew is out there and we occasionally
we're bubbling into mainstream I don't
even think we need them anymore I get
all kinds of offers at this point I
don't really even want them but I think
it's cool that there's some sort of
interesting crossover stuff happening
right now and all right let's jump into
some questions holy schmoly they're
flying in super chat you are the most
truthful interviewer on YouTube not a
question but I appreciate it I do the
best I can
I tried well I don't lie to you and I
try not to you know fudge facts or I
tell you what I think and if I screw up
occasionally okay and as some of you
guys know there have been times where I
have screwed something up and we you
know we pre-tape we don't always go live
as we're going right now and my guys
will say to me after you know do you
want to get rid of that and I never do
because alright I'm human I screwed up
something there there's one thing I
don't even need to mention it to get the
trolls to start the feeding frenzy but
there's one thing that I really screwed
up on a factual thing which I did
address in the comments right down below
but we left it there and it's like
alright I'm human I'm human okay
will you have Glenn back on again
absolutely I really enjoyed that
conversation with Glenn when we had him
in here was it about a year ago already
Wow time flies
I think Glenn is a good guy he's had an
interesting kind of navigation of what
he is and where he is politically over
these last couple years as so much as
has kind of changed but certainly on the
libertarian stuff and the small
government stuff and your individual
liberty and to live your life as you see
fit Glenn and I certainly agree on a lot
of that stuff most of it and yeah I
think the blaze is actually doing a
profile piece on me they interviewed me
you know very leery of interviews at
this point or at this point when
BuzzFeed or any of these places reach
out to me I pretty much just ignore it
but a buzz feeI sorry a blaze writer
reached out to me seemed like a great
guy we did our due diligence I sat in
here with it for with him for a couple
hours and I think we're doing a photo
shoot and I sounds like they're gonna do
a fair spread on me but we shall see
would you or have you considered
inviting Penn Jillette I'd love to have
Penn Jillette we've had a couple back
and forth with him David maybe can let
me know where we're at with that big
time libertarian I briefly met him for a
split second when I spoke at the reason
rally in DC about a year and a half ago
I'd love to have him on Penn if you're
watching this let's do it man come on
now what are you doing over there
super chat hey Dave will you be having
Thomas Sola on your show at some point
yes I have his advance copy of his new
book which I think drops in about two
and a half weeks I have so many books
that people are upcoming guests you're
sending me I've got Steven Pinker's book
over here and a couple of others
we're just waiting to work out the all
the logistics with with dr. Sol
obviously he doesn't do a ton of
interviews at this point I believe he's
86 years old but probably the most
influential classical liberal thinker
sort of in the modern day or at least in
that certainly in that top tier that
goes without saying he's up at Stanford
so what we're gonna do for that is what
we did with I can't even say it but
we're gonna can't say that there's a
reason I can't say it just let it be but
we're gonna do an on-location shoot at
Stanford University with dr. Tsao and
I'll try to get some other people that
are in the San Francisco area because we
have to rent a studio I gotta fly my
guys up there and and hotels and all
that and that by the way is fully funded
by you guys that support us on patreon
because per video we certainly don't
make any of that real money back and so
you guys absolutely enable us to do that
by the way speaking of monetization
which I'm happy to talk about if you
guys want to get into it all my
interview for tomorrow is with a guy
named max Eluga beer max an old friend
of mine who has a great book coming out
soon called genius foods and he's doing
all this stuff on brain health and food
and diet and exercise and I'm in the
middle of this paleo thing right now so
it was a great time to be interviewed I
also wanted to get away from politics a
little bit this week anyway we just
looked on our back end and it's already
demonetized it's a video about food and
your brain Wow Wow so we're already
fighting the demonization before it even
goes public but it's just like this the
slew of this thing is just it's just
endless super chat congratulations Dave
I really appreciate the work you do
thank you very much
super chat are you gonna go on louder
with Crowder again or would you have
Stephen on your show for a longer format
interview absolutely I'm happy to do it
any time that they ask I do Crowder
probably every maybe other month or so
and we were trying to get him here while
he's on this a little break I know their
work and I think they're redoing his
studio but it didn't quite work out but
he's welcome in this chair any time I
really like Stephen I think he reminds
he gets me to sort it back to my old
comedy self which I wanted to talk to
you guys about in a little bit and I did
have him on once when we were on or a TV
this is god this is over two years ago
now and we did it be a Skype and we
didn't really know each other but you
might you might find that interesting
let's see patreon what guests have you
got lined up or hope to in the new year
so as I said Thomas solo we were just
working out the logistics steven pinker
I think we have in March he'll be in
town for a live event with with Sam
Harris middle of March so I think we
have him for that we've got this YouTube
or this president's week situation lined
up we've got Mike Shellenberger who is
running for president in California and
he originally was running as an
independent although was a lifetime
Democrat now he's running as a Democrat
I just found that out and a really
interesting guy who sort of bounces
between sort of the standard democratic
stuff which is kind of you know and the
progressive stuff that I don't love but
also has this really interesting
libertarian streak that I do like I
think sort of fits within the old
classical liberal line of thinking and a
couple other cool things I don't want to
tip everything off right now you know
this isn't by the way one of the ways
that becoming a patron has its rewards I
do tip off people especially in the
small group chats to some of the things
upcoming oh by the way I see a few
people asking we do sell this classical
liberal t-shirt on our on our merch
store it's teespring
it's teespring calm slash rubin report
or they'll get me the exact link i think
i have the link here do i have the link
here oh how about this people just go to
rubin report comm slash store and it'll
send you over there and we've got all
kinds of stuff we got them we got Rubin
report mugs and sweatshirts and and
stickers and whatever else you got there
okay let's see will you have a youtube
week of all liberal or progressive
leaning guests that's an interesting
idea to really try you know just in the
last couple days I've invited Rob Reiner
on the show I invited this guy Greg
Proops who's a lefty comic who compared
me into to Goebbels the Nazi so I
invited him on the show he blocked me on
Twitter that that's an interesting idea
if I could find five progressives in a
row to do something with that you know
it's interesting the way you wrote it
it's I think it's a liberal or
progressive I would still argue but and
I saw someone break this down on
Facebook once that most of my guests
actually are liberal of course it comes
with that first part and that be in
classical classical liberal these days
as I often say defending my liberal
positions is becoming a conservative
value or defending my liberal values is
becoming a conservative position
depending on which way you want to word
it that liberals right now old-school
liberals certainly are having an easier
time working with or talking to
libertarians conservatives and caps
whatever else it is but it's sort of the
far left these that are that are kind of
lining up against all of us but I'm
always open to having those
conversations truly let's see Dave when
will you cover the gun control debate
and are you willing to sit down with big
names in the Second Amendment
communities such as Tim from Mac so I
don't know Tim specifically we haven't
done the ton on guns but i but i touch
on it with a whole bunch of different
guests i think the most we ever did was
with antonio Okafor who I love Antonia I
think she's really great she's a rising
star by the way in in conservatism or
Republican politics whatever you want to
call it and she really is talking about
why young black women have to arm
themselves to be safe it's an
interesting employee not employees and
it's an interesting play on how this
conversation is framed and she's really
taking the power back to herself and and
I just really I really like her
can you flex those beautiful biceps for
us what's going on there this is this a
flex let how am I doing here that's not
bad that's not bad look at that all
right
that's a you know among all this
grass-fed butter with this paleo thing I
think it's going right to the muscles
okay let's see hey Dave really love your
work been watching for a while now keep
it up question do you like cartoons 90
cartoons like duck tails or bonkers well
I don't know what bonkers is but duck
tails was part of the Disney Afternoon
of course now I was born in 76 so by the
time the Disney Afternoon was really in
its heyday I probably should have been
out there doing some other things but
yeah I watch duck tails and tail spin
and gummi bears what else was on that
that Disney Afternoon I watched all that
stuff but my real my real cartoons of my
childhood
definitely Hema and GI Joe and
transformers were were the big three if
I remember correctly transformers and GI
Joe were on back-to-back on weekdays
maybe around 3:00 and 3:30 when was he
man on was he man on it on at 4:00 I
think it was channel 5 before it was Fox
in New York maybe somebody can correct
me on that oh I just watched a great
documentary actually on on Netflix
they've got this new thing it's called
where the toys are or something like
that where they track like just your
favorite toys from the old days so they
do one on he-man that's the one I saw so
far but I think there's one on GI Joe
probably Star Wars and all that it's
it's pretty cool ok oh and by the way
now I have it in front of me for sure
Peterson and Shapiro Jordan Peterson Ben
Shapiro will be in studio together live
for about a two hour live stream we'll
see how long we can go Peterson's got a
live event in LA that night that I will
be attending by the way Wednesday
January 21st at 12 p.m. that's our live
stream Peterson's event is is that night
oh I'm sorry
January 31st sorry this thing's moving
fast because you guys are asking me a
lot of questions okay patreon have you
ever considered having guests discuss
simple subjects to focus on how
constructive you can make a conversation
over the little things I believe one can
have the right to the right thing to say
but the wrong way to go about it that's
interesting you know I think I think in
general we've done a pretty good job of
that like getting people to just sit
down and explain what they believe but I
think what your question really is is
getting to the heart of what is so wrong
with almost everything right now that
people can agree on basic things we're
always at each other's throats that's a
good idea to kind of pick some really
basic topics maybe that are outside of
the the political realm and and dive
into them that's a good idea let me
think about that I will make note of it
oh by the way so this past weekend you
know I've been telling you guys that
I've wanted to get back into stand-up
for a long time so if you don't know I
did stand-up for about twelve years in
New York City and we took down all my
old videos because I just didn't you
know it was like my formative years a
lot of it was sort of topical stuff I
just didn't want it all on on YouTube
and it's it's not that relevant to the
me of today but anyway because I think
stand-up unfortunately if you look on
Twitter just most of these mainstream
comics it become so hyper partisan and
lefty progressive and it's just
dribbling they're screaming all the time
and telling everyone that they're racist
they're not winning with comedy right
like what would George Carlin be doing
these days you think he'd be bitching
and moaning and demanding books like
[Music]
Monday was dr. Martin Luther King jr.
day and as is the case with almost
everything lately virtually everyone on
social media seemed to parse out MLK's
words for whatever narrative they're
currently pushing in our modern times I
saw articles on how MLK was the first
environmentalist how he was an ardent
feminist a communist a socialist and
much more the one quote I tweeted of his
is perhaps his most famous I have a
dream that my four little children will
one day live in a nation where they will
not be judged by the color of their skin
but by the content of their character
I believe this quote to be as relevant
now as it was in the early 1960s but for
a whole other set of reasons in the
1960s MLK was fighting for equality
under the law and equality of
opportunity two things that we should
all absolutely believe in today those
who judge people by the color of their
skin and not the content of their
character are fighting not for equality
but for special treatment of some at the
exclusion of others this misguided
principled thinking you should treat
someone differently because of their
skin color or thinking someone should
believe what you think they should
believe because of their skin color or
any other immutable characteristic is
the essence of prejudice which means to
prejudge this is the complete reverse of
what MLK stood for and sadly this way of
thinking has infected the modern left
almost completely this is why I like
myself so many of you find yourselves on
the outside of a political bubble that
you were once safely part of for this
direct message though I don't want to
focus on the flaws of identity politics
instead I want to focus on one of the
other topics I just mentioned socialism
and for the purposes of this message I
want to put aside whether MLK was a
capitalist or a communist or a socialist
or a hybrid of any of them what I want
to discuss is some of the reaction
around the word socialism itself the
amount of people I see talking about
socialism positively is actually
staggering a tweet I set out saying
socialism is
cool even got me into a little exchange
on Twitter with the official verified
Socialist Party who explained to me that
socialism has actually never been tried
which is why we don't know if it'll work
yet perhaps they should tell that to the
people of Venezuela right now who were
fighting for food and basic services as
they watch their socialist system
collapse on top of them the ideas of
socialism that the means of production
distribution and labor should be owned
controlled and regulated by the
community as a whole are the worst sort
of collectivist ideas which exist the
very implication that the group knows
what is good for the individual that we
exist to do things for the greater good
is totally antithetical to the purpose
of being human it's your job to find
value in your work to strive for more
than you have to bring good to yourself
and the people around you and to live as
a free person as you see fit the very
idea that you should set aside your
individuality for the community as a
whole which virtually always turns into
an intolerant hostile mob is exactly why
so many have died in socialist regimes
despite the obvious failures of
socialism socialists have no problem
using the freedoms of capitalism against
itself this is perhaps the most perverse
part of the socialist worldview much
like Islamism socialism wants to use our
freedoms against us until it attains
complete power for example they use the
tools of Twitter and Facebook companies
created through the ingenuity of
individuals and the freedom of
capitalism to attack the very system
that they often live in by the way I'm
all for them being able to do this even
if I don't like what they're doing
that's the tricky part of freedom it
even applies to people and ideas you
don't like just think for a moment if we
had a socialist government in charge
right now how do you think it would be
going for free expression and free
speech how tolerant would they be of all
the people that they label Nazis and
bigots whatever you may think of Donald
Trump and the evil capitalists are they
the ones coming for
anyone's speech right now reporters
being put in jail actually President
Obama used the Espionage Act to put a
record number of reporters in jail and
as far as I know Trump who dislikes the
press to put it mildly hasn't put anyone
in prison for the crime of journalism
fortunately I see a rising tide in
America based on liberty freedom and
individual choice note how those words
themselves are somehow thought of as
evil in the socialist lexicon liberty
freedom and individual choice must all
be sacrificed for the greater good but
what they're not telling you is that the
greater good is usually for the tiny
minority in the elite protected class
their ideas have never worked and will
never work because a system built on
stripping our humanity is in direct
conflict with what it means to be human
I've said it before and I'll say it
again this perfect system which they
wish to create can never be perfect
because we humans as flawed as we are
are part of it imperfect beings cannot
create a perfect system but what we can
create is a system that always does its
best to further the advancement of human
freedom for all its flaws this is what
capitalism is which is why if you're
watching this from a capitalist society
you should consider yourself one of the
lucky ones of course in America
politicians don't outright call
themselves socialists they say that
their Democratic socialists this is
Bernie Sanders mantra as he calls for a
revolution of every kind to be a
political social or even environmental
whatever that means what Bernie forgets
or intentionally obfuscates is that the
Democratic part of this of course will
always be tossed away as socialism takes
root it's also why there's no doubt in
my mind that eventually the social
justice movement will turn on Bernie
himself and I think there's already
plenty of evidence of that democracy is
the enemy of socialism and Bernie's
trying to have it both ways there's also
a reason that the social justice
movement has such a socialist strain
within it both of these movements based
on frowning on achievement and
accomplishment and a resentment of
those who break the mold need people to
be oppressed or at least believe that
they're oppressed to survive creativity
free thought and the pursuit of your own
happiness is the antidote to both social
justice and socialism it's either that
or a life of bitterness resentment and
jealousy which in my view is less
socialism and more just anti-social
[Music]
joining me today is the founder and
director of turning-point USA a student
organization for young conservatives
which advocates for free markets and
limited government charlie Kirk
welcome to the Rubin replied to be here
big fan that's great Young Conservatives
I thought there was no such thing that
was like the Yeti or the unicorn or
Falco or something there's more of us
than you might imagine it's not all
conservative summer libertarians some
are free thinkers independence people on
the center-right we just had that
amazing conference that you were nice
enough to come down and speak at in
Florida 2600 700 students from all 50
states and it was so funny I couldn't
pay the the media outlets to cover the
same you know that's calling up in New
York Times Washington Post here we had
you know thousands of students giving up
their winter break to come here from you
know you and me and the best speakers
you know that advocate for freedom and
none of the media outlets in the
traditional media outlets covered it but
it's amazing there is a there is a
revolution happening on these campuses
but it's not it's not against you know
conservatives all this it's it's it's a
new train of thought that we want
freedom we want smaller government but
it's also fighting the culture war which
is for free speech for diversity ideas
and really against what these college
campuses have created yes so you're in
the thick of a lot of the things
obviously that we talk about here so
first I just want to talk briefly about
how we met because I think it's kind of
it kind of shows sort of how you operate
and why turning-point has taken off so
we had met about a month and a half ago
at the Horowitz Freedom Center event in
Palm Springs were you were you a
panelist there yeah I was a panelist it
is kind of helicoptering around a lot of
friends that you know attend that
conference yeah so so you were there and
everyone was like oh you gotta meet
charlie
Charlie we met for two seconds you said
a couple nice things about me and you're
like you know we're doing this our gig
in Palm Springs and a couple weeks money
to come down and talk and and then and
immediately we worked it out and and
your guys send me the paper that work
the next day and it was done and I think
that does illustrate something because
we're going to get into some of the
issues that vary agree on and some of
the things we disagree on but basically
you were like look you're you're down
for free speech that's the main thing
here and I want my audience to hear you
talk about well I you're a rational
thinker which is really rare to find in
California I'm kidding but no I mean I'm
a big fan of the show and I watch a lot
of you interviews and I know you're you
know you have a huge following amongst
young people and I mean I might you know
met you I was like yeah let's get you on
board I'm oh I've always been a gut
player for better for worse it's got me
into a little bit of trouble at times
yeah but I think net it's been positive
you just have to you have to go with
your gut and make quick decisions and
similar that's where I met Candis Owens
- who is now doing a wonderful job with
us and yeah it took me about 45 seconds
until I offered her a job so literally I
think it happened right in front of me
and then you walked up to mr. Candis was
like I just got a job and you were like
let me do something with you it's like
all right look this guy's obviously open
to some different people it's totally in
the schema what's going on you need the
diversity of ideas right if you if
you're in a room where everyone thinks
exactly the same that would be a
university so you need the diversity
ideas and you need you need to be able
to challenge your viewpoint around a
broader theme of freedom that really is
okay to have that sort of discussion
yeah so to illustrate that point so then
about I think it was the week before
Christmas you guys do this I was it the
largest conservative college we're
waiting for we're waiting for someone to
correct us we've done some research we
have never found anything been closed
yeah
you have two thousand six hundred and
fifty students from all 50 states no
one's really found anything even
comparable of size so we call it the
largest until someone corrects us yeah
well there were you had some protesters
out there yeah they they show up all the
time to everything there but but there
was true diversity of thought there only
you it was also sort of a Rubin report
reunion for me because Prager was there
and Gutfeld was there all my best friend
Candace was
they're obviously and and a whole bunch
of Sherpa Tom jr. was there is just a
series of people I went up there and I
talked about being gay married and I
talked about being pro-choice and and a
bunch of other things that if you were
to poll the average conservative that
perhaps they're not for I think gay
marriage maybe it's a little a little
different at this point but I got a
standing ovation and everywhere that I
multiple times well yeah yeah budget
times and and everywhere that I went for
those two three days that I was there
and have been by no means was this just
me I mean Ben Shapiro came out it was
like it was like Elvis it was yeah I'm
gonna say it was like the Rolling Stones
seriously is nuts but that happened to
everybody I went for breakfast I need
coffee before I talk to people yet I'm
literally there's a line of 100 people
start popping up it's like they start
swarming yeah but that said something to
me beyond the politics that there's
something else going on with young
people right now where they actually as
the young people say they're they're
really woke yes what's happening here
well and it's that diversity idea is
that I think illustrates what makes our
organization so unique so a reporter
came up to me and he was totally
dishonest guys like well this this feels
like a Donald Trump rally and I said how
could you possibly say that sure we have
Trump jr.
we have Gorka we also Austin Peterson I
ran for president on in the Libertarian
Party all right we have Ruben who is not
a leftist anymore but he's somewhere out
there right he believes in freedom Yeah
right
we've been Shapiro who literally led the
nevertrump in it
right we have a huge diversity of ideas
and each speaker was respected was given
standing ovations was challenged
appropriately and I think that really
says something about this new
Conservatory in movement that we're
helping create yeah which is we don't
have to agree on 100% of conservative
dogma let's just get the big stuff right
the big stuff is America a great country
yes it's free enterprise a good thing
yes you know its freedom something that
we should really embrace as a general
idea yes is socialism bad yes that's
just pretty much the main key points and
the rest of the stuff we can argue and
disagree with respectfully yeah when did
you wake up to some of this stuff just
tell me a little bit about your growing
up and your situation I was
crazy crazy kid growing up grew up in
the northwest suburbs of Chicago always
was a conservative Republican growing up
around a lot of leftists and liberals in
my public high school and our you young
and conservative like I because I love
history and I was always contrarian
right so I'd always be challenging my
teachers my parents were generally
Republican right they weren't you know
necessarily political but they were
center-right O'Reilly Factor watching
you know Republicans that I always used
to say and then I would always just
challenge teachers that would say that
you know all conservatives want to do is
kill poor people and you know pollute
the environment the typical talking
points right and being the kind of you
know rebel I guess you could say I'd
always challenge the teachers and say
well no Ronald Reagan lifted more people
out of poverty than your crazy social
programs that Jimmy Carter drove nuts
and I found enjoyment in it and you know
the further down that rabbit hole you
get the more you read Milton Friedman
the more you understand the foundational
principles and ideas at a young age I
just became on fire for politics and for
economics and long story short I started
this organization when I was 18 instead
of going to college and ended up being a
wonderful decision and helped really
place myself in a movement that was
waiting to be grown and this is
something a lot bigger than just
politics this is the fight for the soul
of the country and it has to start on
college campuses and it's really the
struggle for our generation and it's
it's really if you divide it it's do we
want do we believe America is the
greatest country in the history of the
world and do we believe freedom is a
good thing or do we want to go a
completely different direction that
looks much more like a European
socialist democracy that does not honor
civil liberties that does not honor
private property and really deteriorates
everything that made America a great
place that that's the decision our
generation has to make it's kind of
funny you're sort of like the non
Silicon Valley version of like Bill
Gates or Steve Jobs didn't quite
flattering did you go to college or
dropped out of college and but now
you're talking to college people when
did you realize that that was the place
that that this battle had to be yeah and
the first couple years of starting
turning-point USA it started as kind of
a generic student organization but just
like any good innovator and entrepreneur
I listened and I learned and I realized
there was such frustration amongst
self-identified conservative
libertarians on campus that were not
being properly channeled and organized
they felt as if they were being targeted
and that they were being suppressed and
their ideas were not being allowed to be
heard and we made a decision that
turning-point the for a couple years is
let's not just fight the political war
let's double down and fight the culture
war and that we can be the champions of
free speech and we can be the
ambassadors of freedom we're really you
see these campuses I call them islands
at the Talat arianism you know their
idea of diversity is a group of people
that all look different but they think
the same yeah
that's not diversity and so Turning
Point is benefited tremendously over the
last couple years of really being the
champions of free speech and also saying
hey we're not Republicans we're not
conservatives we're not libertarians you
can call us all that stuff that's fine
we have members that are across that
whole spectrum as long as you believe in
freedom you believe America is a great
country welcome aboard
do you think the idea of having that
kind of wide tent is part of the appeal
like I think people are so sick of the
labels and all that was cool
I spend actually most of the weekend
hanging out with with Austin but part of
it also hanging out with Tommy and
Candice and a whole bunch of other
people and I was like there really is
and then and then you know Alison
Stuckey was there and a couple other
people and I was like wow these people
actually really do think different
things totally and and my libertarian
side usually goes to kind of where
Austin that but I was like we we're
we're all having dinner after that's a
great thing and I was like this is great
we're having real discussions yeah we're
really digging into it and there is that
disagreement but if you put them all in
a room they but they get the big stuff
right yeah right you know do we believe
that free enterprise has been a net
positive for humanity do we believe the
Constitution is a great political
document that should be preserved
protected and better understood do we
believe America has been a wonderful you
know net benefit for Humanity you know
over the last 200 years they probably
agree wholeheartedly and all that it's
the other stuff where they start to have
a little philosophical differences but
that disagreement is not being found on
the left right now if you disagree with
one core tenet of leftist dogma you're
ostracized you're kicked out and that
shows there they're not a diverse
political movement the new modern
[Music]
alright let's shift a little bit to some
religions okay you are a Christian
conservative that's correct just that
phrase trigger is a certain amount of
people so first off what what is a
Christian conservative
yeah which always which always stuns me
so I do a lot of campus tour I'll tell
you a quick story a lot of campus tours
and I go through my litany of what I
call hard truths told by Charlie Kirk
and I'll say you know socialism is the
greatest killer of human in the last 100
years and I'll say free enterprises of
the greatest economic system ever and
then I'll say three words and it drives
them so crazy I say God is real and it's
like they just start shaking the left
they think they don't know how to handle
it and half the place loves it half the
place hates it I don't know why that's
so triggering so I'm a Christian first
and foremost I believe you know Jesus
Christ was the son of God and he came
down and we you know he died for all our
sins and we have a good documentation of
that and we could debate and discuss
that whatever but as a Christian I'm you
know I believe that you know we are
called to try to advance the kingdom of
God and the Ministry of Jesus Christ as
many people as possible and as
peacefully as possible obviously right
so that's how I try to live my own
personal life and make my own personal
decisions as a conservative I'd say let
me provide everything so I I don't see
you proselytizing religion though in the
public way I've heard you speak before
sure and I've never heard you push that
so I say it every so often when when
asked but I look at my speaking no
different than sometimes doing a job
right so a plumber electrician that is
not going to tell every person he turns
around the corner like hey have you
heard this Craig you know what I mean so
you have to you don't want to be too
offsetting and off-putting but I also
try to you know through my some of my
platforms you know talk about my
personal beliefs no matter how
triggering it might be to other people
and I'm like campus tours I try to you
know advance but of course I could
probably do a better job of it but with
that being said I would consider myself
more as a Conservatorium which I find to
be a new breed of you know ideology
which you and I talked about and some
people have already been labeling
themselves as such and I find no
contradiction between my Christian
worldview and my political philosophy in
fact I find great amount of you know
synchrony actually between what I find
would I believe theologically and what I
believe spiritually and religious
to also what I advocate for politically
which is essentially the non-aggression
principle and you know believing in
productive people and free societies
should be able to make your choices as
you see fit as long as you're not
harming someone else how did Christians
end up as so much of the but of what the
left hates because you can open up every
day another BuzzFeed article mocking
isn't it right Chris items and Mike and
HuffPo and the they all love the Bible
oh yeah them oh yeah it's nuts but how
did that happen well so I think what
happened is that Christian conservatives
fell for a trap that they really should
have rejected which is we might hold
these truths very near and dear to our
heart theologically and biblically and
spiritually and religiously but I think
where the line was crossed is in the 60s
and 70s and 80s where we tried to impose
those beliefs through government policy
where people then inherently have a
rejection to it similarly how people are
rejecting the left imposing their crazy
worldview upon us right I think that was
a big mistake because it created this
kind of counter-revolution which is I
don't want to have to live the way some
Christian and Alabama wants me to live
does that make sense so it's it's the
imposition of those values through
legislation and government which is
something I don't necessarily support
right so I try to always advocate for
everyone my political positions through
a secular worldview because that is the
vast majority of people and that's the
actual the government system that we
have all need to decided to create we do
have a separation of church and state
and we should support that with that
being said I can still have my own
personal opinions and my own personal
you know ways to go about changing
public policy but when we start to say
we should support this law because it's
the Christian thing to do that is I
think beginning that has turned people
off for the last 30 years what does it
say also about Christians that you know
we talked about gay marriage before that
there was a shift sure there actually
has been a shift now you're basically
arguing it's a political shift or
utilitarian yes you're just you're sort
of giving me just a realist argument
yeah but is that is there something else
going on there to where there is so
could be amazing tolerance to tolerance
and
yeah and here's the other problem with
Christians and me being a card-carrying
member of this community and I try my
hardest and I fail is and I'm around a
lot of these Christians and I sometimes
fall into it is this legalism right is
that I'm somehow better than you because
I'm a Christian and I really think
that's done such a disservice to the
Christian community especially the
Christian conservative community it's
this sanctimonious approach to lifestyle
that I find to be really off-putting to
a lot of non-believers and people say
well I don't want to be a Christian
because they're always going to talk
down to me or they're gonna make me live
by this set of beliefs so they think
they're better than I am it's a
number-one critique I get it's not that
oh I don't believe Jesus Christ is
actually the Son of God or I don't
believe the Bible you know those are
actually things I think that could be
ironed out it's more so like I've always
been talked down to her when I was a
young kid I was in Catholic school and
they gave me these 15 things I couldn't
do and because of that I rebelled and
rejected so I think this idea that
actually Jesus Christ advocated for
which is hey I dined with the tax
collectors I was best friends with the
prostitutes right like I never thought
that they were any better than the my
disciples right and I and of course I
don't live this out the best I should
but where Christians have gotten it
wrong is this fierce fire and brimstone
legalist thou shalt homosexual you know
like that's wrong man yeah that's not
that's not what the the teachings and
the evidence we have of Jesus Christ
life ever taught us he was welcoming he
was tolerant he was accepting he had
standards he was fierce when it came to
eternity in the standards of God but he
wasn't afraid to go chill with tax
collectors which were considered like
the lowest form of individual possible
in the Middle East during that time
right and so I think we as Christians
can learn a lot of that in modern
societies and when we wrap this thing up
you want to go have lunch with some
prostitutes I mean if they want to hear
about the good news of Jesus Christ but
even so right he's sometimes some people
are like oh you know but the point being
is we should we as Christians have to do
a better job of not being the
sanctimonious moral conjectures which we
get labeled at summit and so much so
when you see a guy like Shapiro or a guy
like Prager preggers more than my heroes
I love them Prager basically a secular
view at this point but grew up wertha
Docs Shapiro obviously is
observant religious there have been
Orthodox Jew you guys basically from
what I can tell agree on pretty much
everything politically you're obviously
more Trump than than Shapiro is pretty
fine on any given day Prager definitely
is more proton but this does any of your
religious differences does I know that
doesn't matter to you in terms of
poverty that's very obvious but just in
terms of like your humanity or the way
your worldview does any of that matter
here you know I've had wonderful
discussions of Dennis Prager about what
he believes theological II and I mean
look first of all I think Dennis Prager
is like the Yoda of the conservative
movement he's like unbelievably
brilliant told you isn't it I know
exactly he's he's fantastic and same
with Ben I mean I listen to their stuff
every single day and Prager University
does a heroic job but it doesn't bother
me at all but I always challenge right
so I I challenge you know religious and
observant Jews with some pretty good you
know questions I think cuz I'm very big
in the apologetics of the New Testament
and the Christian you know the evidence
for you know Christianity I ask
questions I'll say do you believe Paul
existed in you know II think Paul Osiris
existed and they'll say yes I'll say
doesn't don't you think it's kind of
like weird that a Roman Jew dropped this
whole amazing lifestyle and like went
all-in for this Jesus Christ thing and
then got persecuted put in jail six
times and then reverse crucified like
would someone do that if they actually
didn't believe this that's a provocative
question obviously right but I love that
and I love that kind of you know
discussion and look Paul said very
clearly in the New Testament bless the
Jews you know these are your brothers
there is no New Testament out the Old
Testament so we agree you know with the
Jewish people and all that and look I
think we need more Jews to actually
become more observant and to understand
the roots of the Torah and the roots of
what God commanded through Moses and
through David and the the major and
minor prophets and I have such great
respect for them because they've done a
great job of I think awakening people
that there are you know Jewish
conservatives out there and it's okay to
believe these things well it's
interesting because there's someone that
doesn't come from this from a religious
perspective I agree with the wider
principle that you're pushing here which
is that some of these minority
communities so in this case you're
talking about Jews but you reference
black people earlier which I want to
talk a little short that working with
Candace
but now I see it within the Asian
community I don't know if you just saw
in the last couple of days there's this
email that got leaked from Google where
they're basically were saying we're
gonna hire people but not white men or
Asian women will be treated like white
women or something something to that
horribly racist it's it's the real
reason it's real racism though yeah it's
this kind of like it's just there's this
ranking of oppression Olympics like
somehow your skin color makes you
somewhat more you know worthy of a
position and a company or in a
university because you've been through
more just because you look different or
the scary part especially for the asian
community is that your skin color and
the way you look is makes you less
worthy because you're gonna work real
hard and you're gonna have the right
decisions on the right decision i mean
make no mistake it's like an anti asian
american worldview that the left is now
essentially embraced it's like oh
they've been successful enough now we
must discriminate against them so we can
help the it's like it's it's it's it's
lunacy but going back to your point of
the christian conservative kind of
worldview i think there's a lot there's
a lot of us that hold these beliefs very
personal but also that's that's kind of
where we draw the line is you know we
have these personal beliefs and they're
gonna dictate how we want to live
individually but how do we advocate for
a society that allows the most amount of
people to advocate for their own
personal beliefs whatever they might be
as long as it doesn't harm someone else
so your basic argument i think you hit
on this a little bit earlier would be
that the part of the reason that europe
is crumbling which it is crumbling what
the West is crumbling except for America
yeah I mean we're so we're taping this
it's gonna go up next week but we're
taping this today is the three year
anniversary of well Charlie Hebdo was a
couple of years ago three years but
today was the day that they finally
caught the guy and then there was the
shooting at the kosher supermarket in
Somers and all that today a different
supermarket was burned down I mean this
is this is still happening in Paris
right now and this is happening all
across Europe we know what's going on in
Sweden all those your basic premise
would be that if they had held on to
some of their judeo-christian values
instead of trading them in for what what
do you think secularism essentially
statism right like you but yet you're
also a secularist which is an interest
well no but no I don't think it's not I
don't think it's contradictory because I
would make an argument
that actually the separation of church
and state found in America has helped
the church we still have the highest
church-going grades rates in the West we
still the highest levels of private
philanthropy have more churches opening
than ever before the evangelical
community is growing in most states as
Alan Dershowitz would say the separation
of church and state has been the best
thing for the church because it's not
imposed upon people it's not mandatory
as you and I both agree when as soon as
you start to tell someone to do
something it becomes a lot less sexy and
appealing yeah it actually want to rebel
against that you want to reject it I
would argue Europe through their social
welfare programs have deteriorated the
church as soon as they start to say
government is gonna take care of people
government is going to be the most
important thing in your life
government's gonna fix these vastly
complex social problems then all of a
sudden the church and the individual
becomes far less significant as Dennis
Prager says the larger the government
the smaller the citizen you're seeing
that play out in France and Spain and
Portugal and Italy where you have
individual philanthropy disappear where
you have business startups neccessity
totally evaporate and the final point is
what it really lends itself to is more
dangerous ideologies to take forms such
as radical Islam which is I think one of
the most dangerous widespread
ideological movements happening the West
that no one is talking about and here's
I can understand I mean you're a gay guy
I mean I would probably be worried if I
start to see you know radical Islam
start to take root in Europe right
you're a Christian I'd be worried too no
I mean trust me I'm on that program okay
they want us both dead my friend Yeah
right
I mean they and that's something I find
to be horribly inconsistent with the
left is they try to be the champions of
all these minority groups and all these
supposed to depress groups yet here they
are kind of joining forces with
countries and movements and you know
theocratic fascists in the Middle East
that give homosexuals flying lessons on
the top of buildings all right so then
how do we I spend I think a good chunk
especially the first year of this show
trying to talk about radical Islam
making a distinction between radical
Islam and the nominal Muslim person who
practices their faith privately however
they do just like most sure people I try
to separate Islam as a set of ideas
worthy of criticism as Christianity is
and you
service and republicanism and all of
that okay
versus people versus criticizing people
and treating people differently I think
a lot of people in our space have tried
to do that and you don't get a lot of
credit for it but okay fine I don't I
don't need bonus credit but how how do
we talk about radical Islam well in an
honest way and I do there is a
differentiation that needs to be drawn
but it also we also do need to talk
about the broader implementation of an
is of an Islamic government and
worldview
right so Islam as its core at its core
has always been and will always be tied
into the state and as soon as they can
demonstrate that they can be a majority
in a country and not be a theocratic
government then I'll start to cede some
territory against that so for example
Saudi Arabia right so if you are
Christian and Saudi Arabia you lose your
head if you're a Jew they'll find your
family and kill all of you that's
there's something wrong about that right
so I think we need to draw a great
critique of that same in a land which is
Shia and Saudi which is Sunni and
there's something really I think not
correct about in modern society that you
have obviously a Muslim majority country
and you know there's no Christians and
no Jews and no churches and no
synagogues there's something very
intolerant about that however people
that want to reform Islam I'm your
biggest advocates right people that want
to go through a reformation of you know
Islam and try to differentiate that know
Islam does not have to be tied to the
state and yes Islam can be tolerant of
Christians and Jews and gays and the
modern feminist movement and they should
be allowed to vote and drive and you
know be able to make decisions as they
see fit and not have to wear a full
hijab
I want those Muslims that succeed I'm
frightened that the more radical voices
which are in the tens of millions if not
hundreds of millions are actually
getting more more of an audience they're
they're they're creating you know
sectors of Europe that are quite
troubling that are advocating for the
advancement of these more dangerous
ideologies that support honor killings
and don't think women should have the
right to drive or to vote or to be able
to have representation in any sort of
form of government and so I think a
broader critique of Islam needs to be
put forth because they've been doing it
against Christianity for the last 100
years I walk into a lecture hall and I
hear about how important
and Christians are and how they're
terrible people find hard stop you go to
the Vatican a woman is allowed to wear
shorts and you know a cut-off t-shirt
you go to Mecca and you're a Christian
you get your head cut off I mean you
literally can't go no you literally are
not allowed they're literally not a lot
so there there's there's a discussion
that needs to happen where a broader
Reformation is necessary but the more
radical voices of Islam are actually
succeeding right now
you look at the most viral members of
the YouTube community in the Sunni you
know Saudi region though they're the
ones that are advocating for a holy war
and the extermination of Christians
they're the ones that are really taking
root we have to support we have to
reinforce and we have to really
encourage the more reformist muslims to
get a broader you know platform but i'm
just not seeing it yeah i mean i've
tried to do a little bit of it you know
[Music]
joining me today is the founder and
director of turning-point USA a student
organization for young conservatives
which advocates for free markets and
limited government charlie Kirk
welcome to the Rubin report glad to be
here big fan it's great Young
Conservatives I thought there was no
such thing that was like the Yeti or the
unicorn or Falco or something there's
more of us than you might imagine it's
not all conservative summer libertarians
summer free thinkers independence people
on the center-right we just had that
amazing conference that you were nice
enough to come down and speak at in
Florida 2600 700 students from all 50
states
and it was so funny I couldn't pay the
the media outlets to cover this thing
you know that's calling up the New York
Times Washington Post here we had you
know thousands of students giving up
their winter break to come here from you
know you and me and the best speakers
you know that I have a key for freedom
and none of the media outlets in the
traditional media outlets covered it but
it's amazing there is a there is a
revolution happening on these campuses
but it's not it's not against you know
conservatives all this it's it's it's a
new train of thought that we want
freedom we want smaller government but
it's also fighting the culture war which
is for free speech for diversity ideas
and really against what these college
campuses have created yes
so you're in the thick of a lot of the
things obviously that we talk about here
so first I just want to talk briefly
about how we met because I think it's
kind of it kind of shows sort of how you
operate and why turning-point has taken
off so we had met about a month and a
half ago at the Horowitz Freedom Center
event in Palm Springs were you were you
a panelist there yeah I was a panelist
it's kind of helicoptering around a lot
of friends that you know attend that
conference yeah so so you were there and
everyone was like oh you gotta meet
charlie Kirk you gotta meet Charlie Kirk
we met for two seconds you said a couple
nice things about me and you're like you
know we're doing this our gig in Palm
Springs in a couple weeks money to come
down and talk and and then and
immediately we worked it out and and
your guys send me the paper that work
the next day and it was done and I think
that does illustrate something because
we're gonna get into some of the issues
that vary agree on and some of the
things we disagree on but basically you
were like look you're you're down for
free speech that's the main thing here
and I want my audience to hear you talk
about well I you're a rational thinker
which is really rare to find in
California I'm kidding but no I mean I'm
a big fan of the show and I watch a lot
of you interviews and I know you're you
know you have a huge following amongst
young people and I mean I might you know
met you I was like yeah let's get you on
board I'm oh I've always been a gut
player for better for worse it's got me
into a little bit of trouble at times
yeah but I think net it's been positive
you just have to you have to go with
your gut and make quick decisions and
similar that's where I met Candace Owens
too who is now doing a wonderful job
with us and yeah took me about 45
seconds until I offered her a job so
literally I think it happened right in
front of me and then you walked up to
mr. Candace was like I just got a job
and you were like let me do some of the
with you it's like all right look this
guy's obviously open to some different
people it's totally in the schema what's
going on you need the diversity of ideas
right if you if you're in a room where
everyone thinks exactly the same that
would be a university so you need the
university ideas and you need you need
to be able to challenge your viewpoint
around a broader theme of freedom that
really is okay to have that sort of
discussion yeah so to illustrate that
point so then about I think it was the
week before Christmas you guys do this I
was it the largest conservative college
we're waiting for we're waiting for
someone to correct us we've done some
research we have never found anything
been closed yeah now have two thousand
six hundred and fifty students from all
50 states no one's really found anything
even comparable of size so we call it
the largest until someone corrects us
yeah well there were you had some
protesters out there yeah they they show
up all the time to everything there but
but there was true diversity of thought
there okay
you it was also sort of a Rubin report
reunion for me because Prager was there
and Gutfeld was there all my best friend
Candace was there obviously and and a
whole bunch of others chervil clunk Jr
was there is just a series of people I
went up there and I talked about being
gay married and I talked about being
pro-choice and a bunch of other things
that if you were to poll the average
conservative that perhaps they're not
for I think gay marriage maybe it's a
little a little different at this point
but I got a standing ovation and
everywhere that I multiple times oh yeah
yeah budget times and
everywhere that I went for those two
three days that I was there and been by
no means was this just me I mean Ben
Shapiro came out it was like it was like
Elvis it was oh yeah I'm gonna say it
was like Rolling Stones seriously is nut
but that happened to everybody I went
for breakfast I need coffee before I
talk to people yet I'm literally there's
a line of 100 people start popping up
it's like they start swarming yeah but
that said something to me beyond the
politics that there's something else
going on with young people right now
where they actually as the young people
say they're they're really woke yes
what's happening here well and it's that
diversity idea is that I think
illustrates what makes our organization
so unique so a reporter came up to me
and he was totally dishonest guys like
well this this feels like a Donald Trump
rally and I said how could you possibly
say that sure we have Trump jr. we have
Gorka we also Austin Peterson I ran for
president on in the libertarian Park all
right we have Ruben who is not a leftist
anymore but he's somewhere out there
right he believes in freedom Yeah right
we've been Shapiro who literally led the
never trumpet right we have a huge
diversity of ideas and each speaker was
respected was given standing ovations
was challenged appropriately and I think
that really says something about this
new conservatory and movement that we're
helping create yeah which is we don't
have to agree on 100% of conservative
dogma let's just get the big stuff right
the big stuff is America a great country
yes it's free enterprise a good thing
yes you know its freedom something that
we should really embrace as a general
idea yes is socialism bad yes that's
just pretty much the main key points and
the rest of the stuff we can argue and
disagree with respectfully yeah when did
you wake up to some of these stuffs just
tell me a little bit of sure growing up
and your I was crazy crazy kid growing
up grew up in the northwest suburbs of
Chicago always was a conservative
Republican growing up around a lot of
leftists and liberals yeah in my public
high school and our you young and
conservative like I because I love
history and I was always contrarian
right so I'd always be challenging my
teachers my parents were generally
Republican right they weren't you know
necessarily political but they were
center-right O'Reilly Factor watching
you know Republic
I always used to say and then I would
always just challenge teachers that
would say that you know all
conservatives want to do is kill poor
people and you know pollute the
environment the typical talking points
right and being the kind of you know
rebel I guess you could say I'd always
challenge the teachers and say well no
Ronald Reagan lifted more people out of
poverty than your crazy social programs
that Jimmy Carter drove nuts and I found
enjoyment in it and you know the further
down that rabbit hole you get the more
you read Milton Friedman the more you
understand the foundational principles
and ideas at a young age I just became
on fire for politics and for economics
and long story short I started this
organization when I was 18 instead of
going to college and ended up being a
wonderful decision and helped really
place myself in a movement that was
waiting to be grown and this is
something a lot bigger than just
politics this is the fight for the soul
of the country and it has to start on
college campuses and it's really the
struggle for our generation and it's
it's really if you divide it it's do we
want do we believe America is the
greatest country in the history of the
world and do we believe freedom is a
good thing or do we want to go a
completely different direction that
looks much more like a European
socialist democracy that does not honor
civil liberties that does not honor
private property and really deteriorates
everything that made America a great
place that that's the decision our
generation has to make it's kind of
funny you're sort of like the non
Silicon Valley version of like Bill
Gates or Steve Jobs that didn't quite
flattering did you go to college or
dropped out of college and but now
you're talking to college people when
did you realize that that was the place
that that this battle had to be yeah the
first couple years of starting
turning-point USA it started as kind of
a generic student organization but just
like any good innovator and entrepreneur
I listened and I learned and I realized
there was such frustration amongst
self-identified conservative
libertarians on campus that were not
being properly channeled and organized
they felt as if they were being targeted
and that they were being suppressed and
their ideas were not being allowed to be
heard and we made a decision that
turning point in the for a couple years
is let's not just fight the political
war let's double down and fight the
culture war and that we can be the
champions of free speech and we can be
the ambassadors of freedom where really
you see these campuses I call them
Islands a totalitarian is
you know their idea of diversity is a
group of people that all look different
but they think the same yeah that's not
diversity and so turning-point has
benefitted tremendously over the last
couple years of really being the
champions of free speech and also saying
hey we're not Republicans we're not
conservatives we're not libertarians you
can call us all that stuff that's fine
we have members that are across that
whole spectrum as long as you believe in
freedom you believe America is a great
country welcome aboard
do you think the idea of having that
kind of wide tent is part of the appeal
like I think people are so sick of the
labels and all that was cool
I spend actually most of the weekend
hanging out with with Austin but part of
it also hanging out with Tommy and
Candice and a whole bunch of other
people and I was like there really is
and then and then you know Allison
Stuckey was there and a couple other
people and I was like wow these people
actually really do think different
things totally and and my libertarian
side usually goes to kind of where
Austin that but I was like we we're all
having dinner after that's a great thing
and I was like this is great we're
having real discussion yeah we're really
digging into it and there is that
disagreement but if you put them all in
a room they but they get the big stuff
right yeah right you know do we believe
that free enterprise has been a net
positive for humanity do we believe the
Constitution is a great political
document that should be preserved
protected and better understood do we
believe America has been a wonderful you
know net benefit for Humanity you know
over the last 200 years they probably
agree wholeheartedly and all that it's
the other stuff where they start to have
little philosophical differences but
that disagreement is not being found on
the left right now if you disagree with
one core tenets of leftist dogma you're
ostracized you're kicked out and that
shows they're they're not a diverse
political movement the new modern
American Left they're extremely
intolerant of differing opinions and I
don't have to talk for yeah I mean I'll
just let you think that you're acting as
my agent but listen I would gladly I
said this when I had Shapiro on last
week I will gladly give the exact same
speech that I gave to you guys a couple
weeks ago I would love to give that
exact same speech to any progressive or
Democrat and you got a standing ovation
but I'm looking to go with my mag a hat
wearing students right but you give that
speech to the young Democrat socialist
of America conference coming up in a
couple months
you'll get boos and you'll get
shouldn't hear things we disagree with
yeah you know bolshevik you know forever
it's these people have have translated
into total authoritarianism do you see a
moment where both of the movements sort
of where you would argue the
Conservatives sort of lost their place
thus lost the culture war or and where
they left sort of went bananas yeah I
think the length has gone bananas just
by default of their positions they
really inside of every leftist is a
totalitarian waiting this you know
screaming to get out is a great quote I
always use yeah it's because when you
argue for total government power and
total government control of health care
and schools and private economic
decisions that can easily be translated
into the monitoring of personal capacity
decisions right that that translation is
quite simple and I always say to a
leftist that says well I believe in you
know civil liberties but I also believe
in government-run schools and health
care as I say if you don't trust the
government to help you know to monitor
your own personal life wine earth when
you trust the government throughout all
these other institutions where I think
conservatives have gotten it wrong over
the last thirty years is where
conservatives have become mislabeled and
sometimes some considers believe this to
want to do social engineering I think
I'm gonna have angelical Christian I'm a
pro-life conservative but I also believe
government should have barriers in
trying to instill those values upon
society I think the best persuasion the
best capacity for good is done through
churches and local community movements
and individuals persuading individuals
and writing books and doing podcasts not
through government doing massive social
engineering programs so I think that's
where conservatives have lost their way
and that's where the left is currently
trying to stake their claim is there
anything that you think government does
well no no I think government is a
necessary evil I think it's necessary
for providing from the National Defense
because that is something that whether
we like it or not you have to you have
to delegate some of our personal freedom
to you know have a some sort of a civil
society but government by its essence if
you read what Milton Friedman has said
they're incentivized to be inefficient
they're incentivized by definition to
not be able to provide the best possible
good or service for the individual so
look the private sector does everything
better whether it be the inefficiency
post office Medicare is bankrupt Social
Security doesn't serve the people you
know effectively everything government
touches goes to crap and the private
sector is by definition more efficient
because if you don't do it well you're
not going to exist much longer what do
you think is the best way of getting
that message across that government just
doesn't do things well because I think
it's just so built-in to people partly
because our education is sure-tan
screwed up or whatever that they just
feel the government should just do
things so I saw Bernie tweeted the other
day this video of all these millionaires
saying I responded yeah so I retweeted
it which got like twenty thousand
retweets because it was like it's all
these millionaires saying we should be
taxed more we should be taxed more well
what what intellectual hip-hop it's such
lies it's like boy a what's stopping you
from pay that's what I see boys just
send more money to the IRS numbskull or
it's right but it's like but okay so but
yet
Bernie's tweet gets something like fifty
thousand retweets and not that it's all
about retweets and all but it's true he
has high engagement with this but to me
it's just lazy thinking it is lazy so
virtuous if it's so virtuous to keep
giving money to the gods right why do
you need the government to tell you to
do it and really at its core if you look
at the philosophical difference between
really the culturally Marxist left which
is what they're becoming and the free
thinking individualist you know
individual libertarian conservative
right which is the new you know
intellectual position that is growing
you know quicker than even the left it's
we might want good things to happen in
society but don't tell me to do them at
gunpoint yeah and the left on the other
hand I don't think their intentions are
very good I think they want permanent
political power but Bernie Sanders for
example he's so convicted that he is
right he wants to use the absolute
authority on and unlimited power of the
state to put a gun to your head and say
you have to have a 70 percent tax rate
because someone is starving on the
street I would rather live in a society
that has the same tax rate for everyone
10% and we dig deep we say are we gonna
take care of that person on the street
through charity through private
philanthropy and through being better
people and if you look at when
socialism's implemented you see the
moral disintegration of society you look
at Spain you look at France you look at
Europe they don't have anything as
private philanthropy anymore private
charity has
in Europe because government takes care
of it and that I think that is such an
important point to make so going back to
your question how do you illustrate this
to a young person you asked the
fundamental question do you trust a
government that word Trust is so
important because in in that word trust
that really feels personal all right do
you trust the government 99% of young
people will say no then you ask the next
question then why do you want to make
government bigger as soon it and they'll
say I don't well then you're not a
social so you're not a leftist then
let's talk about how we can really
shrink the size of government and put
power back into the hands of people and
it's important to note also even though
you think government might want to do
something doesn't mean federal
government has to do it local government
is much more accountable to the citizens
than some bureaucrat in DC that you're
never going to meet and so those are
those are arguments that you know we've
[Music]
if you follow me on the Twitter you know
that I'm not a big fan of award shows in
general but all the talk post Golden
Globes this week is about Oprah Winfrey
potentially running for president in
2020 mainstream media is in love with
the idea of Oprah for president and CNN
the New York Times Time magazine and a
slew of others have all already run
think pieces on her chances in just
three short years Hollywood of course is
also in love with the idea the
conscience of lefty Hollywood Jimmy
Kimmel has already said that he's on
board with Oprah 2020 and NBC even
tweeted from their official account at
NBC that Oprah is our next president
though they eventually deleted the tweet
make no doubt the elite class that was
dealt a swift blow by the election of
Trump in 2016
will quickly fall in line if Oprah
decides to make a run for 2020 Oprah has
an absolutely remarkable life story she
grew up in a milling house in extreme
poverty she survived absolutely horrific
physical and sexual abuse including
being raped by her own cousin when she
was only nine years old from these
unimaginably difficult beginnings Oprah
eventually made it to local news in
Chicago and then on to her syndicated
talk show which not only changed the TV
landscape but had a cultural relevance
unlike almost anything in the
pre-internet age every politician
pop-culture icon an ordinary person
doing something extraordinary seemed to
make it to Oprah's couch since she ended
the talk-show seven years ago Oprah's
had many professional ups and downs
continuing to navigate Hollywood
starting her own TV network own which
has in quite caught on doing plenty of
charity work and of course and perhaps
most importantly always making time to
eat bread with very excited strangers
around a fancy table in a forest as for
Oprah's politics I'm not sure anyone
other than Oprah herself has a full view
of them she was a big Obama supporter
during his first two campaigns and I
have no doubt that she falls on the
Democrat progressive side of things how
she Falls specifically on every issue
I'm not totally sure but we seem to be
veering towards a cliff where the issues
will have almost nothing to do
who gets elected the cult of personality
we're building around politicians and
what that means for the health of our
society in the long term is quickly
becoming a massive problem that's hidden
in plain sight
I'm pretty sure I don't have to say much
on the cult of personality that is
Donald Trump
make no mistake whether you love or hate
Donald Trump we elected a reality TV
star a man created by and now hated by
the mainstream media Trump's rise used
all the tools of the media against
itself and that's why right now the
media is endlessly looking to destroy
him they want their narrative and
control back notice the shift in TV
coverage and articles about Trump in the
last two weeks or so it's shifted from
endless Russia stories to Trump's mental
health in most cases the people writing
these stories are the same people who
said that stories about Hillary's health
were conspiracy theories even after she
collapsed and was dragged into an SUV by
security guards that autumn day in New
York City so what we have right now is a
cult of personality Trump versus the
cult of the media this has made a lot of
people a lot of money as long as they
keep churning out articles and think
pieces true or not people do get paid to
this end Trump is their perfect foil he
has no shortage of tweets to send out
and people to mock so we've got a match
made in hell playing right in front of
all of our eyes now back to Oprah for a
moment
Oprah is basically the exact reverse of
Trump even at the identity politics
level she is a black woman and he is a
white man she grew up poor he grew up
rich but more importantly than these she
says all of the right things she talks
about love and spirituality and is loved
by the Hollywood and media class as one
of their own Trump on the other hand is
their perfect enemy as if they had
written the script themselves alas Trump
was one of their own until he became too
powerful and now he is enemy number one
because they've lost control of the
narrative their hope is that they can
win some of that narrative back with
another celebrity who will play by their
rules but I think that this is
short-sighted at best and disastrous at
worst just imagine what kind of insane
polarizing sensationalized lunacy the
potential matchup of Trump verse
Oprah will lead to as we head into 2020
it'll be great for clicks and ratings
but it'll be terrible for ideas and
debate you thought Hillary verse Trump
was polarizing just wait until Trump and
Oprah battle it out in the Thunderdome
on prime-time television sadly it
doesn't look like we'll ever turn back
to being governed as our founders
intended with a limited federal
government and strong states that
empower people to control their lives at
the local level while Trump has done
some good work in limiting the power of
the federal government he's obviously
happy to govern by executive action as
Congress seeds more and more of their
duties to the executive branch instead
of the legislative branch where laws are
supposed to be written his Justice
Department too is happy to step on the
Tenth Amendment and allow the federal
government to trample on states rights
just look at Attorney General Jeff
Sessions decision to allow the feds to
crack down on state's ability to
legalize marijuana so to sum up we'll
have a president that will most likely
be a celebrity whether it's Trump or
Oprah or Mark Cuban or the rock along
with an executive branch that'll
continue growing and growing in power
this cult of personality will
continually put people into office not
on what they believe and whether they
understand or even care about how
government is supposed to work but
rather by what they make us feel and how
they can manipulate us into thinking
exactly as they do that feeling coupled
with the growing power of the office of
the presidency is a recipe for the
authoritarian control we all should be
wary of the only way to fight this tide
of celebrity induced idiocracy is to get
involved now before it's too late either
that or get ready to bow to supreme
leader Justin Bieber in 2024
[Music]
joining me today is a New York Times
bestselling author a presidential fellow
at Chapman University the founder of
skeptic magazine and now a four-time
Rubin report guest Michael Shermer
welcome back to write my fourth time
here at times that's a record or without
it you are close you are you're
definitely in the top two or three oh
cool all right
depending on how this goes do I get a
pay bump yet no but there's plenty of
booze okay that's right yeah that's
right
so all right there's a ton I want to
talk to you about you've got a new book
coming out I was saying to you right
before you started you're the only guest
that has two books all right moral or
skeptic okay good well you you are doing
well we can bump the skeptic and put
heavens on earth there because I hate to
be the lifeboat guy that kicks the other
person hosta out of the lifeboat we will
swap those two I thought a fun way
though to start this conversation with
you would be to tell a little story that
happened to us both when we spoke at
University of Arizona about two or three
months ago we were we were speaking
there with who were with that night we
were with Steve Simpson yes from the ein
Rand Institute we're just gonna talk on
free speech about an hour talk half hour
or so Q&A and in the middle I jokingly
said to the audience by a show of hands
are there any Nazis here it's very edge
to our surprise someone raised their
hand or a woman raised her hand and said
that she was a Nazi and she started to
ask a question I said you know what hang
tight respect to our free speech we're
gonna do our thing but then when we open
this up to the Q&A we're gonna throw the
first question to you so this person
then proceeded to ask a question can you
paraphrase what the question was
basically oh well it was something about
she had encountered me before it's some
public event about the Holocaust story
and you know some details about the gas
chambers and you know one of these kind
of technical arguments that they come up
with that are supposed to stump
Holocaust historians but that I've
refuted before and then she wanted to
revisit that so basically it
was she was a Holocaust denier and the
beauty of what happened why I wanted to
start this conversation with this
antidote was she asked you this question
about the doors at Auschwitz and why
they didn't lock and all of this I'm
sorry was bad that's right the doors of
madhouse and yeah that's right yeah
right yeah yeah and basically you gave
her a great answer of why the doors in
lock and they didn't want to scare
people with doors that lock at an
obviously very scary place and all this
stuff and it was it was a really nice
moment for free speech I thought she
actually respected our free speech we
then allowed her to have the question
you then answered her question now it
was pretty obvious to me that you didn't
change her mind at the end and that's oh
that's the first question I'm gonna ask
when you when you come by as someone
that debunks conspiracy theories all the
time and created skeptic magazine when
you come across these people that are so
sort of tightly held to their conspiracy
theories or the ideas that they can't
prove but they just believe them
right how often can you actually break
through you can actually I get letters
all the time I don't have it like a data
set from 25 years with 10,000 subjects
or anything like that but I get a ton of
letters just from people saying you know
I used to believe X and now I believe
why I changed my mind after reading your
book or you and Dawkins or Paris or
hitch and so you know whatever this sort
of a list of people that we know and so
I do think this idea that you can't talk
somebody out of something that they
didn't you know you can't reason
somebody out of a belief they didn't
reason their way into I think it's not
true even though probably they didn't
reason their way into the art the belief
in the first place once you have the
belief in place then you find reasons to
believe it and smart people are really
good at this
educated will verse people can pile up
the arguments and data in favor of their
belief and disconfirm ignore the
disconfirming evidence you know the
confirmation bias so but you can do that
you can and so and now they're Studies
on on this by cognitive psychologists
like you know if you're teaching
critical thinking and and the students
believe this how do you get them from
there to there
whatever it is ESP or UFOs conspiracies
ER or some political economic idea so
you can do this
not standing at the blackboard yammering
away but by getting them to debate and
engage with each other like okay so
you're pro-choice okay you're now gonna
argue the pro-life position against this
person here who's going to take the
opposite position what they believe and
that sort of forces them to think well
okay what are the arguments in favor of
this now I got a make up and then that's
forces them to listen to the other
person and think about that and then
they can they really have a sense of
what's the best arguments because they
have to make them so really it's just
engaging in a process it's like you're
not gonna learn to play the violin by
reading a book about violins or
listening to a lecture about how the
violin works you got to just do it in
your years of doing this have you
learned anything about the mind of the
type of people that are prone to
conspiracy theories is there like a
certain set of ideas that they more
broadly subscribe to before it gets to
whatever the yeah yeah so there's kind
of a global cognitive style that
everything happens for a reason
now for religious people this is you
know Jesus or God is sort of directing
things everything from the parking spot
you got to the college you went into
your spouse that you met and and so
forth the little to the big questions
for the conspiracists it's the
government it's a little g-god
government that's you know pulling the
strings and even if it's you know if the
Illuminati or the one-world or whoever
the Rockefellers the Rothschilds it's
still kind of a government type that
there's somebody up there pulling the
strings so that everything that happens
for a reason so and we know that from
surveys that people that tick the box
that that you know JFK was assassinated
by a conspiracy are also more likely to
take the box that Princess Diana was
murdered you know Elvis is still alive
you know that you know the aliens are
being hidden in area 51 you know so they
they go down the path they tend to
accept more and more ideas now we might
call that you know a gullibility
tendency or something like that but
there's something beneath that which is
everything has a reason for why it
happens and that they downplay the role
of chance and randomness so it's
interesting how you relate that to the
religious mind because there's a desire
really to
and what's happening and yet right the
desire I think you would argue that you
then have to take a lot of things that
aren't true for fat like there's sort of
no ending to it right that's right they
never get to the end of the conspiracy
theory and then it's exposed really it
just sort of takes you further and oh
that's like an x-files series obviously
one it's episode leads to the next and
they keep pulling the strings the thread
and that keeps unraveling forever so
it's really a self-fulfilling prophecy
in a way right if you can never be
proven wrong because that's right yes
yes yeah so I was just debating just
online for the UFO people about this new
story about the Pentagon had this
program to study UFOs
now they call them unidentified aerial
phenomenon UAP sounds more technical
right and that is goofy but but of
course you know they're interested in an
unidentified aerial something or other
because it could be the Russians or the
Chinese or who knows what you know so
it's perfectly reasonable to also then
understand that well the government's
that you know they lied to us yeah no
kidding governments do lie to their
citizens right you know but but a good
counter to this is you know the the
WikiLeaks you know here here we have you
know millions of documents that were
secret that we weren't supposed to see
and now we see them and there's nothing
in there about 9/11 was an inside job
the alien bodies are being held at area
51 the UFO was engineering technology
was back engineered and this is how we
got the Space Shuttle nothing nothing
like that so this is a good example that
they've released yes that's right yeah
yeah well but presumably you know the
WikiLeaks guys weren't you know hiding
the good stuff and and releasing only
because they've released you know
millions of documents so this is an
example of the absence of evidence is is
evidence of absence in terms of that
argument usually that doesn't that
doesn't hold water but in this case I
think it does so where are you just sort
of personally are you feeling good about
the state of skepticism at the moment or
are you feeling that fake news and the
authoritarian control on both sides
these days just that everything so up in
the air
you know feel good about what it is that
you do and what the things that seems
like we're not supposed to and they are
of Trump and all this stuff but really
things just keep grinding along and in a
positive fashion the counter to the fake
news and alternative facts are all the
new fact-checking sites like politifact
and Snopes has gotten huge now and that
skeptic we're just we're gonna launch a
fact-checking site because this is the
kind of thing we should be doing and and
there's I don't know there's half a
dozen of those sites that every
political speech now given is followed
by really clickbait tweets on here are
the 27 facts that are wrong in this
speech Oh might want to see what they
are yeah so really that's the market
counter to that not censorship or we
need laws about fake news no we just
need people back Jackie and then when
having problems with even that that
people go to those sites and then even
if you fact check it they still don't
believe the facts that they don't like
like we've really yeah that for the
ground sort may be but on the other hand
the moment like post modernists and or
even like behavioral economists say that
you know we're incapable of reason yeah
what are your arguments and reasons for
that statement then the moment they open
their mouth they've refuted them so
right because we still use arguments and
reason even if you're even if your
arguments or your data or fake or you
know questionable you're still trying to
make a good argument so that
enlightenment program of we use science
science and reason to make political
progress is still in place yeah well
that concept I think is really
interesting because you have all these
people right now who think either you
know Armageddon is coming tomorrow or
everything everything's never been worse
I think we hear that over here we've
never hated each other more bah-bah-bah
and I'm pretty sure it was the first
time I had you on the show and we were
talking about the moral arc which is
right over there that you were saying
that the arc of progress has bent so
that actually things are better but but
it seems like we don't really stop and
smell the roses
that seems like a group rotten to me at
the moment and if and when something
does get exposed as you know here's this
evil in society that now we're alerting
to like the me to movement and and some
of the other ones that have
in the last year or so that just exposes
how far we've come and how sensitized
our moral compass is to things that are
really bad and that we're going to jump
on it and not allow this anymore so that
if anything gets us and like with the
stuff we've talked about with the
student protests you know complaining
about Halloween costumes okay this is
actually a sign of progress I mean no
one worried about Halloween costumes in
1950 okay the moral Crusaders like
Martin Luther King weren't you know oh
what are the Halloween costumes good
they're worried about you know the KKK
costumes that are real okay so that's
how far we've come when it can be so
finely tuned that we're gonna pick these
little knits over here does that also
show you why the level of hysteria maybe
is ramped up so much because the less
stuff there is to really fight about
yeah there isn't some stuff but the less
stuff that really we don't this isn't
the 1950s KKK it's and run it maybe a
[Music]
all right your new book it is out this
week it is sitting right in front of me
heavens on earth the scientific search
for the afterlife immortality and utopia
well did you figure it out is there a I
have the answer got the answer is there
any scientific evidence for any of those
things Michael Shermer toyou know I'm
sorry to say that there's not there's
actually some good news at the end of
the book but I do address all of the
different versions of the afterlife
heaven I go through the monotheism
Judaism Christianity and Islam of course
and right off the bat you see there's a
huge body of literature in those areas
of the history of heaven and the fact
that history that heaven has a history
and now I'm a historian of science so
like cosmology has a history the history
of cosmology how did how did we figure
out how big the universe is and all that
stuff but there there's kind of a sense
of progress like we're getting ever
closer to understanding what's actually
out there with these history of Heaven
literature there's no sense of progress
at all it's like well this group used to
believe that and then they encounter the
Egyptians and then they change it to
this and then then they the Babylonian
captivity and that the ink of the Jews
inculcated their worldview and there's
no sense like oh well there's something
out there and we're getting closer to it
not at all
so that was kind of interesting and also
how they change depending did that
surprise you because they are just
hearing I mean I kind of knew that thank
you yeah no I mean that wasn't a big
thing it was just sort of an interesting
observation and then do also have to
deal with the non monotheism's you know
what it's called the eastern wisdom
traditions Buddhism Hinduism Taoism
soive old chapter on that I went to
Deepak Chopra Center down in Carlsbad
and got into the whole meditation and
yoga and chanting and the tea and the
incense and they're like okay Deepak
let's talk about this and so he gave me
the whole thing so I really that was
kind of my Avenue into talking about
consciousness and you know their view
the Buddhist view is there's no life and
death in the sense there's a beginning
an end like in Western culture we have
this idea of a linear linear time
there's a beginning and an end
big bang that you know and so forth but
in in in this world view you know the
physical universe including us we're
just visit just temporary physical
instantiation of consciousness
consciousness is pervasive it is well
okay
detox language the ground of all being
you know the ontological primitive okay
so he says these things and it takes me
you know page what do you mean by the
ontological primitive and part of the
problem is that is a Western scientists
you know we use words in a certain way
that and they don't and they use words
in a different way so we're off to just
talking cross purposes there so much of
my conversations with Deepak have been
just stop tell me what you mean by this
word because else we have our words you
know I can't read your thoughts so
anyway but the core of the book really
is scientific attempts okay I call this
the afterlife or atheists you know these
are all the the people that are don't
necessarily think that that that there's
a heaven in fact they're pretty sure
there isn't anything like a traditional
heaven because there's no evidence for
that so but interestingly in in surveys
I was looking up about a third of
atheists think that there might be an
afterlife okay so they say they I don't
believe in God but there might be
something now what are they talking
about well you're a star wars fan you
know something like the force right you
know there's something out there that
you continue on and you know and some of
them do find that kind of Deepak
worldview that sort of Buddhist you know
Buddhism has quite a resurgence now
there's a number of books you know Bob
Wright's book Buddhism is true and so on
what do you mean it's true okay that's a
that's a big statement the truth
statement okay well okay so they think
when you die you just go back to where
you were before you were born is I open
the book saying what when people say
where do you think you go when you die
Shermer I sit the same place I was
before I was born
what are you talking about you weren't
anywhere right well did a Buddhist you
you actually are returning to where you
were because consciousness is just
always there's no beginning area and
it's just always was and is and
everywhere okay that's really hard for
us to grasp
what they what the the scientist group
these communities I delve into the cry
on assist the transhumanists the extra
pians there against entropy good luck
with that and they're against and
yeah you know that's a theory well just
you know let's they start off simple
enough which seems obvious you know diet
nutrition exercise you know be healthy
and so on in a way all of life is
pushing back against entropy this is
most of what we do is a push back
against entropy you know we have you
know house we have a ceiling to protect
us from the weather that's fighting
entropy basically nature just wants to
kill us all all the time that's
basically what it does and so natural
selection selected those that were able
to push back against it but ultimately
you can't defeat it right so but this is
you know they so you start off it's a
transhumanist sixth rope and they're all
in the same category like the soul is
your genome and your connectome the
pattern of all your information all of
the stuff that your body is made out of
gets recycled about every decade or so
your skin cells blood cells it's it's
all none of the material almost it is
the original from ten years ago even
much less when you were born so you're
not the Dave Rubin you were a decade ago
I know your friends tell you that you've
changed a lot so when we say well
there's a there's a unit there called
Dave Rubin who's a person and Anna self
who has a sense of self and I have a
sense of who you are that's not the
material that's the pattern of
information that's in your memories and
your genome and so on that gets the keep
that keeps it going okay so their idea
the singularity people the mind
uploading and so somehow you got to keep
that going alright so it starts super
basic diet and exercise just kind of
keep the body going but no one's ever
gone above the ceiling upper ceiling of
about 120 125 now so first of all one of
the myths I debunk is this idea that
people live twice as long as they used
to know more and more people are getting
up to the upper ceiling thanks to public
health measures and vaccinations and
things like that but it's not like no
one 100 years ago or 200 years ago live
to be in their 80s or 90s
lots of people did just not as many as
do today so to get that the upper
ceiling there is blocked by a bunch of
different systems that all fall apart at
the same time around a in your 80s or so
you know just the telomeres at the end
of your chromosomes that break off every
time a cell divides they can only do
that so many times it's called the
hayflick number
so one of the goals of the science of
aging is to somehow figure that out well
there's lots of claims about well if you
eat this supplement every day you're
telomers will be better yeah
acai berries yeah yeah red wine actually
sleep apparently is really good for
keeping your telomers more in place it
doesn't allow your cells to divide more
but but that they they don't die quiet
as quickly okay again these are all
measures to just get more and more of us
up to the upper ceiling the only way to
break through there would be a complete
genetic reengineering of the genome to
stop that from happening without because
there's a there's a name for cells that
divide indefinitely
it's called cancer yeah alright so
without turning people into cancer is
blobs you know and that's just one of
you know dozens of systems that all fall
apart so this we're not even close to
the science of like figuring that out
and breaking through but when you hear
this and then you hear about who's the
Google guy I'm blanking on his name
suddenly that's doing the singularity
yeah Ray Kurzweil yeah when you hear it
like he's taking like what it like some
infinite number pills supplements a day
yeah what is it
supplement 5757 today do those he's
trying to to break that time that's
right absolutely totally ya know so
their program okay so every aging expert
I've talked to they have world's leading
this is all it's not gonna
happen
not without program you'd have to so
maybe a CRISPR a future CRISPR
technology where you actually reprogram
the genome to stop the telomeres for
breaking off so frequently and the cell
then divine without creating cancer okay
that's a huge problem but that's just
one of many you know Aubrey de Grey any
documentary you've ever seen on aging
and longevity and immortality you've
seen him he's got long red hair a long
both ooh Scylla a beard he loves beer he
has he's British that these British guys
he's a great British accent and you know
the first person to live a thousand
years is alive today and you know he's
got a whole program sends Sen s this is
basically these seven things you got to
do to reprogram yourselves okay so you
can you could read about it look him up
it's great stuff but okay and and and he
likes beer and beers on the lit list so
that's good
coincidence but ultimately know that
none of this is going to work now the
Kurzweil program is it goes beyond that
okay even if we don't succeed you can
you can have yourself chronically frozen
and maybe a thousand years from now okay
well first of all you're being frozen on
the worst day of your life the day
you're dying the state treats cryonics
is a form of burial right so you can't
like prep yourself with the antifreeze
stuff or all that because they'll kill
you and then that would be murder so you
actually have to just let her let things
take their course and you're dead then
the team rushes in and packed you a nice
and ships you off to
Alcor one of these places and they pump
you full of this antifreeze stuff to try
to prevent the freezing from destroying
your cells anyway it doesn't work
because a like a human brain is it's
huge compared to an embryo so you can
freeze an embryo and bring it back
IVF it works not brains they're too big
and so so far everybody frozen today
they're never being brought back it's
not going to happen
Disney frozen or nothing no no that was
that's just not even true the day he
died was the day that I think it was Al
Khor one of them opened their doors and
there was the two complaining press
releases Ted Williams though is
apparently his head is frozen that Al
Gore apparently that is true yeah and
the first person ever frozen was a
Glendale college psychology professor
where I went as a student no he was
already dead and frozen by the time I
got there but I thought well that's a
weird thing yeah
now so here's the other problem with
Kurzweil is idea okay so in the meantime
if we could copy your connectome again
this it's it's you are represented by
your memories all your pattern of
information in there put it in a
computer just scan every synaptic
connection and put it in a giant compute
ok so first of all we're not even
remotely close to having a big enough
computer dolt even one brain much less a
hundred brains of the elite or
everybody's brain but even so let's say
Moore's law you know carry it out a
hundred years from now the problem here
is the problem of identity who are you
so let's say we we scan your brain and
put it in the computer at what age you
know when you're 29 they're 30 you know
because that's supposedly the ideal age
cuz that's when Jesus died right because
in Christianity there's a debate about
when you wake up in heaven with Jesus
there and so on who's there
is are you physically there you know
some of them say yeah you're physically
there
how old yeah well
okay 30 30 okay nobody wants to get to
heaven as the 95 I guess not but but if
you think about that well then what
about all the memories I've had since I
was thirty because I've had 33 of them
33 years of memories that they'd be lost
I that would be tragic and but but it's
okay know you can have the memories of
your total life
yeah but the memories now I'm 63 now the
memories of when I was 40 now are very
different from the memories when I was
40 when that was happening yeah whatever
it was my interpretation of that now is
different everything is different so
even scanning every memory isn't really
capturing you as is a harder problem
that would be and and then there's also
the point of view problem like when you
go to sleep tonight you wake up tomorrow
morning you're a little groggy but
consciousness comes back and you're
looking at the world through your eyes
so it called this the point of view self
instead of the memory self so the point
of view self is there's a continuity of
consciousness and and perspective now
you go under general anesthesia you wake
up little groggy or five hours later and
it comes back if you are copied and put
in a computer then they turn it on like
Johnny Depp and transcendence he's in
the computer looking out through the
little camera you know and there's this
girlfriend with the guy who what yeah
you're doing what and yeah no no that's
not gonna happen because your point of
view isn't going to transfer from your
body into the computer because let's say
we did this to a fancy fMRI brain
scanner and we did this while you're
standing there you just like we slide
you in scan your brain we get every
single synaptic connection put it in the
computer turn it on
and you're still standing there next to
the machine you all of a sudden don't go
into there your point of view you're
still standing there going eight no I'm
Dave over here and then the computers
going no I'm Dave it's just a copy right
and no twin ever looks at their sibling
and go well there I am yeah no no no not
now
so the Kurzweil is of the world will say
yes there's there could be 10 Dave
Reubens but each of them thinks they're
the real day of Reuben but of course the
moment you diverge and have different
life experiences you just go left and
the other one goes right out of the room
and all of a sudden life becomes
different you're gonna have different
memories in different connections and so
who's the real you okay so it's really a
problem a philosophy
these guys have you're not gonna wake up
in the computer it's just a copy so
where are you yeah and religions kind of
have the same problem you know you're
dead in the grave and what Jesus takes
you up there well what's going up there
well the soul what does that means
pattern information at what age they
have the same set of logical problems
because it for Jew for Jews in
particular the body is still in the
grave and many Christian sects say you
know your body is not resurrected it's
just your soul the body says yeah but
the your memories are in there in the
grave
no no they get taken up there how does
this happen you know God works in
mysterious well gate boom man I just
watched I just watched the matrix for
like the thousandth time there's a lot
of matrix ways I can go with this but
I'll try to
I'll try to keep it a little more narrow
for this so is there an inherent problem
discussing all this that you're trying
to look at something through a
scientific lens that the people who are
the believers simply don't look through
that lens so you're never gonna get to
uh I guess this is the struggle of the
skeptic all times right you're it's hard
to get to somebody to break through to
somebody that is going off a different
set of premises to start yes okay that's
it that is a problem right so but my
book is a work of science and the
primary focus is you know not not only
that I'm skeptical of religious versions
of the afterlife but all these
scientific attempts they're not going to
succeed therefore what we do now is all
the more important our lives our loves
our connections and all that so I end
with a you know a really uplifting
chapter but ultimately yes I do think in
the chapter on Deepak I talked about
this problem of language you know the
see in the world through a scientific
perspective is very it's not in the
majority position most people are
duelists they're Paul bloom calls them
calls us natural-born duelists and in
his lab with children he shows that like
if it'll two-year-old you know here's a
mouse and it gets munched by the
alligator now the mouse is dead you know
what where is the mouse oh the mouse is
off in this other place and he misses
his mommy and he's hungry and from a
very early age we have the sense that
something continues on mm-hmm
so I actually opened the book by talking
about this problem of imagine you're
dead you know most people say well I see
my body in the casket
my friends and family are there and
hopefully they're mourning but of course
you wouldn't see anything because you
know to be conscious of anything you
have to be alive and so you know imagine
you can't imagine anything it's it's a
it's like imagine there's no universe
not not just no planets stars and
galaxies no space-time no light nothing
you can't you can't actually imagine
that in the in so here we we bump up
against the epistemological wall and the
language wall like Vic and Stein talked
about this you know these words we use
they get reified into things even the
word nothing it's no thing it's a thing
that doesn't exist
well when you're dead it's not like
you're going to this place called
nothing no you see all of a sudden we
just hit this word like if there's no
universe there's nothing as if nothing
is a thing it's not even that so the
that you ended this book on a positive
note I guess by arguing that there's no
scientific basis for an afterlife or a
utopia or whatever else you're really
putting the onus I think this is what
you were just saying sort of you're
putting the onus on us right this moment
absolutely yeah which is scary for a lot
of people well I think it's it should be
uplifting it's like because instead of
thinking well either I don't matter or
none of this really matters I'm just
waiting for the next stage or the next
play the next act in the play and this
proscenium drama were in here it's just
a temporary thing you're gonna miss out
on something now look I don't know that
there's no afterlife nobody does for
sure
so whether there's an afterlife or not
this is the life we live in right here
right now I call this
alvey's error so in Annie Hall is a
[Music]
joining me today is a New York Times
bestselling author a presidential fellow
at Chapman University the founder of
skeptic magazine and now a four-time
Rubin report guest Michael Shermer
welcome back is right my fourth time
here at times that's a record or without
it you are close you are you're
definitely in the top two or three no
cool all right depending on how this
goes do I get a pay bump yet no but
there's plenty of booze that's right
yeah that's right so alright there's a
ton I want to talk to you about you've
got a new book coming out I was saying
to you right before you started you're
the only guest that has two books all
right mark skeptic okay good well you
you were doing well we could bump we
could bump the skeptic and put heavens
on earth there because I hate to be the
life book guy that kicks the other
person off the out of the lifeboat we
will swap those two I thought a fun way
though to start this conversation with
you would be to tell a little story that
happened to us both when we spoke at
University of Arizona about two or three
months ago we were we were speaking
there with who were with that night we
were at Steve Simpson yes from the I
Rand Institute we're just able to talk
on free speech about an hour talk half
hour or so Q&A and in the middle I
jokingly said to the audience by a show
of hands are there any Nazis here it's
very and to our surprise someone raised
their hand or a woman raised her hand
and said that she was a Nazi and she
started to ask a question I said you
know what hang tight he'd respect our
free speech we're gonna do our thing but
then when we open this up to the Q&A
we're gonna throw the first question to
you so this person then proceeded to ask
a question can you paraphrase what the
question was basically oh well it was
something about she had encountered me
before it's some public event about the
Holocaust story and you know some
details about the gas chambers and you
know one of these kind of technical
arguments that they come up with that
are supposed to stump Holocaust
historians but that I've refuted before
and then she wanted to revisit
that so basically it was she was a
Holocaust denier and the beauty of what
happened why I wanted to start this
conversation with this antidote was she
asked you this question about the doors
at Auschwitz and why they didn't lock
and all of this I'm sorry was bad that's
right the doors of mad housing yeah
right yeah yeah and basically you gave
her a great answer of why the doors
unlock and they didn't want to scare
people with doors that lock at an
obviously very scary place and all this
stuff and it was it was a really nice
moment for free speech I thought she
actually respected our free speech we
then allowed her to have the question
you then answered her question now it
was pretty obvious to me that you didn't
change her mind at the end and that's oh
that's the first question I would ask
when you when you come by as someone
that debunks conspiracy theories all the
time and created skeptic magazine when
you come across these people that are so
sort of tightly held to their conspiracy
theories or the ideas that they can't
prove but they just believe them right
how often can you actually break them
you can actually I get letters all the
time I don't have it like a data set
from 25 years with 10,000 subjects or
anything like that but I get a ton of
letters just from people saying you know
I used to believe X and now I believe
why I changed my mind after reading your
book or you and Dawkins or Paris or
Hitchens or you know whatever this sort
of a list of people that we know and so
I do think this idea that you can't talk
somebody out of something that they
didn't you know you can't reason
somebody out of a belief they didn't
reason their way into I think it's not
true
even though probably they didn't reason
their way into the art the belief in the
first place once you have the belief in
place then you find reasons to believe
it and smart people are really good at
this educated will first people can pile
up the arguments and data in favor of
their belief and and disconfirm ignore
the disconfirming evidence you know the
confirmation bias so but you can do that
you can and so and now their Studies on
on this by cognitive psychologists like
you know if you're teaching critical
thinking and and the students believe
this how do you get them from there to
there whatever it is ESP or UFOs
conspiracies er or some political
economic idea so you can do this
by not standing at the blackboard
yammering away but by getting them to
debate and engage with each other like
okay so you're pro-choice okay you're
now gonna argue the pro-life position
against this person here who's gonna
take the opposite position what they
believe and that sort of forces them to
think well okay what are the arguments
in favor of this now I got a make up and
then this forces them to listen to the
other person and think about that and
then they can they really have a sense
of what's the best arguments because
they have to make them so really it's
just engaging in a process it's like
you're not gonna learn to play the
violin by reading a book about violins
or listening into a lecture about how
the violin works you got to just do it
in your years of doing this have you
learned anything about the mind of the
type of people that are prone to
conspiracy theories is there like a
certain set of ideas that they more
broadly subscribe to before it gets to
whatever the yeah yeah so there's kind
of a global cognitive style that
everything happens for a reason now for
religious people this is you know Jesus
or God is sort of directing things
everything from the parking spot you got
to the college you went into your spouse
that you met and and so forth the little
to the big questions for the
conspiracists it's the government it's a
little g-god government that's you know
pulling the strings and even if it's you
know if the Illuminati or the one-world
or whoever the Rockefellers the
Rothschilds it's still kind of a
government type that there's somebody up
there pulling the strings so that
everything that happens for a reason so
and we know that from surveys that
people that tick the box that that you
know JFK was assassinated by a
conspiracy are also more likely to tick
the box that Princess Diana was murdered
you know Elvis is still alive you know
that you know the aliens are being
hidden in area 51 you know so they they
go down the path they tend to accept
more and more ideas and we might call
that you know a gullibility tendency or
something like that but there's
something beneath that which is
everything has a reason for why it
happens and that they downplay the role
of chance and randomness so it's
interesting how you relate that to the
religious
because there's a desire really to
understand what's happening and yet
right the desire I think you would argue
that you then have to take a lot of
things that aren't true
for fat like there's sort of no ending
to it right that's right they never get
to the end of the conspiracy theory and
then it's exposed really it just sort of
takes you further and uh and the rest
like an x-files series it's like one
episode leads to the next and they keep
pulling the strings the thread and that
keeps unraveling forever so it's really
a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way
right if you can never be proven wrong
because that's right yes yes yeah so I
was just debating just online for the
UFO people about this new story about
the Pentagon had this program to study
UFOs now they call them unidentified
aerial phenomenon UAP sounds more
technical right and that is goofy but
but of course you know they're
interested in an unidentified aerial
something or other because it could be
the Russians or the Chinese or who knows
what you know so it's perfectly
reasonable to also then understand that
well the government's that you know they
lied to us yeah no kidding government's
do lie to their citizens right you know
but but a good counter to this is you
know the the WikiLeaks you know here
here we have you know millions of
documents that were secret that we
weren't supposed to see and now we see
them and there's nothing in there about
9/11 was an inside job the alien bodies
are being held at area 51 the UFO was
engineering technology was back
engineered and this is how we got the
Space Shuttle nothing nothing like that
so then this is a good example that
they've released yes that's right yeah
yeah well but presumably you know the
WikiLeaks guys weren't you know hiding
the good stuff and and releasing only
because they've released you know
millions of documents so this is an
example of the absence of evidence is is
evidence of absence
in terms of that argument usually that
doesn't that doesn't hold water but in
this case I think it does so where are
you just sort of personally are you
feeling good about the state of
skepticism at the moment or are you
feeling that fake news and the
authoritarian control on both sides
these
just that everything so up in the air
yeah I feel good about what it is that
you do and I know it seems like we're
not supposed to and they are of Trump
and all this stuff but really things
just keep grinding along and in a
positive fashion the counter to the fake
news and alternative facts are all the
new fact-checking sites like pull it
effect and Snopes has gotten huge now
and that's skeptic we're just we're
gonna launch a fact-checking site
because this is the kind of thing we
should be doing and and there's I don't
know there's half a dozen of those sites
that every political speech now given is
followed by really clickbait tweets on
here are the 27 facts that are wrong in
this speech oh my I want to see what
they are yeah so really that's the
market counter to that not censorship or
we need laws about fake news no we just
need people thank Jackie and then when
you're having problems with even that
that people go to those sites and then
even if you fact check it they still
don't believe the facts that they don't
like like we've really yes yeah that for
the ground sort may be but on the other
hand the moment like post modernists and
or even like behavioral economist say
that you know we're incapable of reason
yeah what are your arguments and reasons
for that statement then the moment they
open their mouth they've refuted them so
right because we still use arguments and
reason even if you're even if your
arguments are your data or fake or you
know questionable you're still trying to
make a good argument so that
enlightenment program of we use science
science and reason to make political
progress is still in place yeah well
that concept I think is really
interesting because you have all these
people right now who think either you
know the Armageddon is coming tomorrow
or everything everything's never been
worse I think we hear that over here
we've never hated each other more ababa
and I'm pretty sure it was the first
time I had you on the show and we were
talking about the moral arc which is
right over there that you were saying
that the arc of progress has bent so
that actually things are better but it
but it seems like we don't really stop
and smell the roses that's that seems
like a bigger problem to me at the
moment and if and when something does
get exposed as you know here's this evil
in society that now we're alerting to
like me to movement and
and some of the other ones that have
happened in the last year or so that
just exposes how far we've come and how
sensitized our moral compass is to
things that are really bad and that
we're gonna jump on it and not allow
this anymore so that if anything it's us
and like with the stuff we've talked
about with the student protests you know
complaining about Halloween costumes
okay this is actually a sign of progress
I mean no one worried about Halloween
costumes in 1950 okay the moral
Crusaders like Martin Luther King
weren't you know Oh what are the
Halloween costumes good they're worried
about you know the KKK costumes that are
real okay so that's how far we've come
when it can be so finely tuned that
we're gonna pick these little knits over
here does that also show you why the
level of hysteria maybe is ramped up so
much because the less stuff there is to
really fight about yeah there isn't some
stuff but the less stuff that really we
don't this isn't the 1950s KKK it's and
maybe a couple losers with a truck that
it could be that's why the people that
scream don't have to scream louder
because they sort of need it you know I
think so yeah
yeah and I you know the fact is they say
students at colleges like at Evergreen
they have their moral modules ramped up
to 11 like any of us do on a cause we
believe in it's just that from a bigger
picture when you look at well what are
you all ramped up about what why is your
moral module dialed to 11 over this
silly little thing here well they don't
know what it used to be like you know
half a century ago they weren't even
alive so they have the issues they're
concerned about but they have the same
moral modules everybody else is so what
do you make of the state of education in
general I mean everything we talked
about everything you've written all
these books about yeah it's based in
educating some people first yes yes it's
still the most important thing we can do
I don't think higher education is gonna
disappear I don't think brick-and-mortar
universities are gonna disappear I think
they'll just be more options
online options say you know all these
MOOC courses and and you know teaching
company courses and audiobooks and
podcasts and so on these are just more
avenues for dispersing information and
ideas and discussing them I think that's
just going to continue and along with
standard educational things now again I
mentioned earlier about you know the the
professor standing at the
blackboard yammering away for hours
while the students are on there now
they're just on social media not even
listening okay so that's what has to
change I think professors teachers need
to get more engaged I'm a professor I
know this is harder to do it's easy once
you've got the lectures written you got
the PowerPoint setup you just walk in
boom and off you're off and running 50
minutes later you're done and you're off
having your coffee okay
it takes more preparation to think about
okay I got how am I going to get these
students to engage in this subject in a
way that they'll actually get something
out of it and that takes more work so I
think you gave me an example already but
tell me a little bit about how you
prepare so you're teaching skepticism
101 yeah Edmund from everything I know
about Chapman who's the the Dean that
danielle east Rupa yeah is the president
is the president yeah so I heard him
speak a couple months ago in Alice at an
event and it was an absolutely wonderful
defense of free speech of seers of
enlightening values of what academia is
supposed to be that's right I wanted to
say hi to map an adventure that you've
been on my show a couple times but so it
seems like you guys are doing something
right over there is that fair they are
yes absolutely they they are not a
politically left or right University
they're just open to ideas the fact that
they have the you know statues of the
civil rights champions like Martin
Luther King but also economic freedom
champions like Hayek and and von Mises
you know they're on campus you know
others might think oh this is a right
wing you know libertarian nut job can't
no actually I had my students one
semester for their research project new
try to sample the faculty on their
political beliefs now I talked to
Danielle about this and he and the
administration are not allowed to do
this they can't ask professors what
their political persuasions are but the
students can just you know just sort of
email take my little survey and it was
pretty centrist there was still you know
a slight leaning toward the left you
know I don't know where you'd put it on
the scale but left-leaning and but but
by Berkeley or evergreen standards this
would be right wing all right you know
nutjob campus but really they're just
kind of centrist and I actually think
there's probably a little bit of a bias
that you and I have been subject to in
the sense that we focus on the
evergreens and in the Middlebury
incidences because they do stand out and
we forget all that you know so evergreen
has like 4,000 students right there was
maybe 200 involved in the whole Bret
Weinstein thing all right what were the
other 3,800 doing they were probably
holed up in their dorm rooms they don't
want to get involved they're not
interested they just want to study you
know I but I think but my fear with them
is that it's a little bit of
intellectual hostage-taking that yes you
might be right the the large bulk of
them may not care about this or may
think it's silly or whatever but I think
there's a huge percentage I don't know
what the percentage is that are just
afraid to speak you know every time I
speak in colleges that's what they asked
me in the Q&A s what can i I don't want
to get kicked out of college right at my
fraternity
I had my professor flunk me all that
that there is this feeling of that I
don't know that anyways I've never seen
numbers on that that would be a good
question hard to get the data itself
report data and people it's hard to get
people to be honest about that sort of
thing but I'm let's say it's 50/50 half
don't care have to care and keeping
their mouth shut
every semester I ask my students how
many of you self-censor because you're
afraid to say something like the
politically correct language or whatever
and you know the most of them raised
their hand yes they do some self
censoring so for sure that that happens
but I was encouraged by the Reed College
incident where you know the humanities
101 was protested its to white male you
know Shakespeare and Greeks and Romans
and then filing some black students you
know said get out I want to get my
education I'm paying $50,000 a year yeah
and it's like good alright so fighting
back what do you think it makes it the
audacity of an 18 year old to get up I
mean I watched that video people can
find it on YouTube I think the classroom
is about Greek the history of Greeks who
have given us over but every balance
that logic and reason that we have right
now yeah and talking about how it's
white supremacists and all the usual
nonsense but to me it was like those
kids who get up and do this it's not
like the level of self-importance Maury
so off the charts that you dare it's not
even what you're doing to yourself it's
what you're doing to all of these other
prime paid to go to school and you think
you're wiser right the professors and
all right people we are live on the
YouTube and we're kicking off 2018 with
the editor-in-chief of The Daily wire
and a man whose facts don't care about
your feelings Ben Shapiro
welcome back that's not news work I am
doing well we just did a major download
on Star Wars for the past half-hour we
did we should have been streaming a hit
of it say I'm not trying to talk Star
Wars than anything else we're getting
talked about yeah we're gonna talk about
Empire's building and crumbling and
ilium poll and good and light and dark I
don't know how much is gonna be related
to the force but yeah I don't know
either
and how much is gonna be related to that
horrible subplot on Kent you know like
whatever it is the gambling planet that
was the gambling planet that was he's
doing okay first of all when they free
let's do it when they free the kangaroo
camel okay and then she finally says now
it's worth it yeah like you should you
should die in a fiery ball of hate that
was just that entire subplot just
garbage all they to do was change two
things in the movie works they have to
make kylo call off the attack on the
transports and raise sides with him and
then we don't know what's going on we
don't know if there's a light side and a
dark side we don't know if it's all if
they've finally critted the unified
force or what the deal is and Luke and
Leia are still alive out there going
what is going on there have been so
interesting they do that and also they
just get rid of that entire horrifying
subplot that never should have happened
and all could have been done away with
by Laura Dern just saying to Poe first
of all I know weather learns there but
they've been by Laura Dern saying to Poe
by the way we're going to fly to that
planet right there that we're looking at
that one yeah right as opposed to well
now have a 35-minute waste of my time
yeah the Lightspeed thing was pretty
cool but that should have been at bar
you know fingers wrap yeah then should
have died in both movies not even about
snow so here's my Lightspeed thing okay
yeah if that is a weapon if Lightspeed
is a weapon yeah then why wouldn't they
have used it in the first Star Wars film
right well they're so for right they get
in and it's this whole thing about how
they have to shoot the proton the the
photon torpedo down there down the hole
instead it why doesn't when they just
like go to that place and then shoot
through the through the Death Star why
do you ever get tired of being so
factual Shapiro
does it ever get exhausting for you yeah
I mean that's why you talk about Star
Wars but it
all right we got a lot to do here I do
have a few of these I don't know that
I'm gonna get any on that first off I
want you to know in the years that we've
been doing the Reuben report I've never
had to spend money on security but it
cost me six hundred thousand dollars to
secure my home and this studio my garage
just for you to be here that's how can I
help it's worth it I mean see I've sized
the cost I have the Mossad on the roof
the whole thing incredible yeah well
thank you for that I appreciate it I
feel very secure did you ever think if
if I would have talked to Ben Shapiro
five years ago before I knew you and
before so much change in these last
couple years that talking about the
things that you talked about that to me
are whether I agree or disagree and
we're gonna get into both of those but
that are basically mainstream
conservative views did you ever think
you would be thought of as so
controversial I can safely say that the
last five years have been one giant what
the WTF because yeah I mean the idea
that they would require over half a
million dollars of security and hundreds
of police officers for me to go and say
that identity politics is stupid at
Berkeley yeah like I literally said that
the year before with no security right
so it's it's all bizarre and it just
shows you that everyone has lost their
minds I think that work through the
looking-glass at this point do you see a
moment when it happened because I think
there's a couple points we can all look
to that it started to happen and I think
a little bit of our old former friend or
whatever you want to call him Milo add a
lot to do it didn't Trump and just the
trolling and it reaching out into the
world and all about I actually think
that if I were gonna peg a moment when I
think that it really when America may
have jumped the shark when when things
started to go awry in a serious way I
probably would look to Ferguson what
happened in Ferguson because they having
the president of the United States
basically say that riots are justified
if you like what the rioters are
standing for even if the facts don't
even support the story that the rioters
are standing for I think that drove
people out of their minds and on both
sides I think that it made people feel
like the narrative was more important
than facts on one side and if the
narrative is more important than facts
on your side then it must be more
important on my side too so we'll just
hunker down in our respective identity
politics bunkers and it's a night but
each other yeah and get very angry over
over without any common basis of facts
because I mean this is why I focus so
much on facts and listen I'm not gonna
pretend that every opinion I have is if
but when there's a fact I try to
distinguish it from my opinion I'll try
to give you the fact and then say and
now here's my opinion on the fact once
we got away from the common basis of
fact it's very difficult to have a
conversation at all and that's why I
think people are always surprised when I
speak on campus and then when I speak
with people who I disagree with on
politics all the time and we can have a
nice cordial conversation so long as we
agree what's a fact and what's a what's
an opinion yeah but that's getting
harder right I mean just getting people
to agree on the set of facts is becoming
virtually impossible people are offended
so much by the fact that they feel like
a fact is is offensive to who I am as a
human being and this is the one that
I've run into the most obviously this is
whenever I say if I say that I think
that you know poverty is largely caused
by human behavior as opposed to by
identity then people take that as though
I'm casting aspersions against their
identity if I go on campus and I say
that according the Brookings Institute
right just get married before you have
babies hold a job graduate high school
and you won't be permanently poor in the
United States people get offended cuz
they say well but I'm poor and I didn't
fulfill maybe one of those rules but I'm
still the person so why would you say
something like that so it's it's much
easier I think to be offended than to
take responsibility for your own actions
and that has unfortunately I think
fallen on all sides to where do you
think the Conservatives then dropped the
ball on this like the fact that so many
people are turning to you right now and
I think I messaged you my husband was at
Home Depot and there was a guy working
there who was you know a stock guy
Mexican stock guy and he was blasting
ben shapiro show on his and every like
you know Blasi no head yeah yeah just
blasting it and it's like I'm two aisles
over and I'm like is Shapiro over there
but that what if something happened
obviously to conservatives that they got
completely tuned out and then you sort
of have led this I think resurgence of
this I mean I think the point is there a
fourth guy on that I mean in terms of
fault I think that conservatives have
never spoken well in terms of morality
in terms with with it out of politics
they've always spoken in terms of
statistics and data and they do the Paul
Ryan accountant routine and so when
people think of conservatives they think
of one or two things they think of Paul
Ryan with an accounting briefcase or
they think of Pat Buchanan or maybe
Donald Trump saying something that they
find offensive and those are the ways
that people
identify with conservatism or identify
what conservatives are and what I've
tried to do is say that there is a moral
tenor to the facts here's my moral
narrative but here are the facts that
I'm drawing them from and I'm less
concerned about how you feel about that
than I am about whether it's true or not
and that seems to be in an era where
people's feelings are so high somebody
just coming out and saying listen your
feelings don't matter to me like at all
yeah and here's what I think is true and
if you like it if you don't you know and
I'm not coming out to try and hurt you
or anything I'm just saying what I think
is true if you're offended tough badugi
is like and you know that's that seems
to have found a place for some people so
I was actually going to do this a little
bit later but since you just emphasized
the feeling things I thought we'd dive
into this now so you know one of the
things that that a lot of people like
you for and I think a lot of people
criticize you for is some of the trans
stuff now I think we're in complete
agreement on what actual biology is and
you know in that very chair and she sat
on this side once I had Blair white I
wouldn't you're probably familiar right
okay so Blair barest it is it okay so so
Blair is a good friend of mine she just
had dinner here and she look
biologically she is a man and I think
she would more he acknowledges it yes
okay so that's the part that I want to
talk to you about so when I say that
when I say I figured you I figured that
that is why cuz I think you can get to a
place here that might actually be
positive for people that view this both
ways so when I say Xian that I to me
that is I I know this person I respect
this person I like this person and I'm
just showing them a little bit of grace
and dignity to what I'm doing now if the
government but you so you take like the
Jordan Peterson problem in Canada right
if the government was saying to me you
have to use this pronoun right now I
have a major problem with that right but
your knee-jerk response to that is what
where I think the Conservatives maybe
are missing something here and I think
you can bridge the gap and I want to
tell me okay
well that big damn deal so your desire
to say he I just mean that's only
because I'm a public figure meaning that
when we're discussing policy issues in
public and want to discuss some whether
a man is a man or a woman is a woman
which is the reason you're having Blair
on right if Blair we're not discussing
trans issues unless you were talking tax
policy with Blair which is probably a
secondary priority I think then
the reason they're having Blair on is
that you can talk specifically about
these issues and so in the context of
discussing those issues I think that it
is very necessary to draw definitional
lines and that doesn't change based on
who I'm talking to right I mean like I
wouldn't and and there are issues of
self-identity and then there are issues
of what is the definition that we are
currently using like if Rachel Dolezal
we're sitting across from Rachel Dolezal
thinks that Rachel Dolezal is is black
person right right I assume that you
wouldn't say Rachel Dolezal as a black
person in front of Rachel Dolezal just
to make Rachel Dolezal feel better you'd
probably say no your white person why
are you making the argument that your
black person okay so this is where
you're giving me a good dose of ben
shapiro logic so if i was to compare
these two right Rachel Dolezal is white
says she's black no one in their right
mind thinks she's black I don't so this
is so it's I got you your time color by
the way if letters you want to be called
he then I'll just call Blair Blair right
but it but and and I'm happy to do that
in interpersonal relations but but it's
a different thing we're constantly
interacting in the public sphere and so
interacting the public sphere means that
I have to use these definitions because
otherwise the way the game is played is
the minute that I say that Blair White
is she then it's that I'm now
acknowledging that Blair White is a is a
female witch Blair White is not okay so
I'm glad you said that so okay so you're
making a distinction between the public
way we talk about things and sort of
your own private interactions are privy
to your interactions 100% and I think
that's important because that's the part
here where I see this I mean you know
this you know this personally I like we
you and I have talked about public
policy with regard to with regard to the
same-sex marriage you know that when it
comes to same-sex marriage I don't
believe the same sex marriage and
heterosexual marriage are on a par even
though I don't think the government
should be involved in that but I'd have
you and your husband over my house right
I've been in dinner with you in your
house yeah so that it's different
talking about public policy or marriage
accordingly should and it its stellar by
the way being so is your husband medal
so in terms of that part though do you
think it in some way does you a slight
disservice that that you're staking out
a position that I understand why you're
saying it out and also right you're
staking it out sort of because your
enemies will take advantage of it
intellectually honest and I
respect that and I understand that but
the other piece of this to me and maybe
this is where I just still have a little
guilty liberal yeah you know what I mean
perhaps it is but where I see this as
sort of this is just sort of grace and
dignity and and where I want to judge
people as the individual that they are
and and I and I would also like to judge
people obviously as an individual which
is why I say that when we're not in
public setting then you know things may
change but yeah the the entire purpose
of bringing people forward to discuss
trans issues who are trans themselves
the entire intent of doing that is to
prevent you from having an honest
conversation sometimes about the issue
yeah not because the expertise per se
because there plenty of experts on trans
issues who are not themselves trans I
mean they're professors so I think know
a lot more about trans issues than some
of the trans folks people sure are out
there who are making some absurd Clint
and we can argue about the data but
usually the the reason that you have
this argument with somebody who's trans
or a trans advocate who happens to be
trans is specifically so that there is
this element of shame that's injected
into the conversation where if you
really felt that way would you call this
person a he right and the answer is yes
I would call that person to he because
the person is a he like that's not and
that's yeah as you say that's that's
where I think I'm polarizing right
that's where my popularity may come from
in some of these areas and it's also
where my unpopularity may come from in
some of these areas but it's not meant
to be
I'm here to offend you it's we are
literally here discussing the issue of
whether you are a key or a shape right
that is the entire basis of this
conversation is are you a he or a she
yeah and so I'm not going to grant you
the point in the middle of a
conversation about this by giving you
the opposite of what my opinion is on
the issue like that that completely
defeats the purpose of the conversation
right and I do understand that line of
thinking it's just so interesting to me
because you're conceding the fact that
because as a public person you're held
to a different level of honesty or at
least in your own mind right like you're
trying to be honest yeah you try to be
intellectually honest it would be
interesting if we had this conversation
and neither of us were public people at
all if maybe your thoughts on I mean I
think different I think my thoughts
would probably be almost entirely the
same but I think the question is what
level of politeness is necessary for a
public conversation about a public issue
yeah and that's why I don't like the
game that's played by the media this is
the this is the problem that I had with
you know when when I originally wanted
me to prominence was the Piers Morgan
interview yes my problem with Piers
Morgan doing the whole here's a 50
here's a gunshot victim now talk to the
gunshot victim about gun control yeah
and the answer is well why do I have to
talk to a gunshot victim why can't we
just talk about the policy yeah right
whenever a shame tactic is brought into
the conversation as a way to make me not
give my true opinion because I'm
supposed to be ashamed of my true
opinion in front of this person I'm not
ashamed of my opinion and I'll say
exactly what my opinion is in front of
this person and the camera yeah right so
this it changes the conversation
slightly when you're having a public
discussion about a public issue with a
public person yeah how much of this is
just the way that I mean it's that type
of thing that happened with Piers Morgan
that I'm sure most of these people have
seen it's like that the media has used
has used shame it's used sound bites
it's used selective editing all of the
tricks that we know about that you know
you and I are constantly mocking CNN for
that they brought this a brought this
upon themselves I mean they did and it's
and one of the things that I I will
admit I get a kick out of calling out
their on this kind of stuff you
know the when you have the when you have
Jimmy Kimmel bringing out his kid and
using his kid as a lever for his
politics that bothers me no and in the
same way that the gunshot victim bothers
me in the same way that a trans advocate
who may not know that much about actual
biology talking about trans issues but
it's supposed to be from a position of
sympathy the injection of emotion into
political issues does not make things
better it makes things worse typically
yeah right for people that didn't see
your bid on that can you just do like a
quick two minute download on what Kimmel
did and why you thought it was so rude
as I was disgusting I mean well Jimmy
Kimmel who is bi from what I hear I mean
he's for his friends and Adam Carolla
with a guy with him I'm very friendly
you know he's he seems like a nice
person but but what he does is he brings
his his kid into it by suggesting that
his kid who had open-heart surgery at
Children's Hospital with dr. Vaughn
Starnes that his child was a good reason
why Obama care should be upheld in
current form now Jimmy Kimmel doesn't
know anything about Obama care it's
obvious he knows nothing about Obama
care and then after the after the
Republicans were trying to repeal part
of Obamacare then he actually brought
his child on air with him to make the
case that they shouldn't repeal Obama
care and he actually brought his little
kid who's going through surgery now I
have a few problems with this number one
I have two kids who are under the age of
four I would never inject them in a
public conversation ever I don't even
post public pictures of them because I
don't think they should be subjected to
that I think using children like that is
cruel beyond that my daughter had
open-heart surgery at the same hospital
[Music]
all right people this is my last direct
message of 2017 so hopefully I'll make
it a good one last week we put up five
shows in five days for Ruben Report
YouTube week this week we've gotten I
sit down with former National Public
Radio CEO Ken Stern and next week we'll
be highlighting some of my favorite
episodes of the year today's direct
message is going to be quicken to the
point with the incredible gratitude and
a humble heart I want to thank all of
you who helped make 2017 such a
memorable year here at the Rubin report
the ride to get here from 12 years of
stand-up comedy in New York City to my
pop culture radio show at Sirius XM to
hosting on The Young Turks to joining my
friend and mentor Larry King on Ora TV
and finally to this independent show
funded by you has been a long and
winding journey one which I wouldn't
trade in for anything it's only been a
year and a half since we made the move
to independence and as some of you have
heard me say the night before we
launched on patreon I literally thought
that my career as well as the careers of
my team might actually be over
fortunately within hours of launching we
quickly realized that not only was it
not over but we were just at the
beginning in the 18 months since then I
bought a home in which we built this
totally professional home studio we
expanded the team behind the scenes the
show absolutely exploded with almost
400,000 new subscribers and most
importantly we've continued to have
honest civil conversation that hopefully
has left you feeling a little more
enlightened and a lot less alone this
year we did an on-location shoot with
ayaan Hirsi Ali I interviewed Richard
Dawkins in front of a live studio
audience in New York City we helped put
important voices fighting for academic
freedom on the map like Jordan Petersen
Brett Weinstein and Lindsay Shepherd we
hosted a conversation on religion and
morality with Dennis Prager and Michael
Shermer we introduced you to incredible
voices fighting for liberalism like
Yasmin Muhammad and Lube de Achmed we
also introduced you to some previous
guests like Peter bagozzi and Eric
Weinstein and GAD said all of whom who
are great guests but more importantly
have become great friends of mine as
well and of course we also hosted the
infamous debate between
Blair White and Candace Owens which got
me trending on Twitter for the first
time in my life hashtag save Dave your
support also allowed me to take some
time off in August to work on my book
and take 30 truly life-changing days off
the grid in an age when we never get off
our devices when we're slammed with news
about terrorism right after we scroll
past a cat video and a picture of your
high school friends kid you guys gave me
the greatest gift I could possibly ask
for a little time to reset and to
rejuvenate and in exchange for you
giving me some of that precious time we
made sure to have all new shows for you
throughout August ready to roll while we
were gone I've got a long list of people
to thank for making everything happen
here but I have to give personal
shoutouts to David - a mirror - Alexis -
Talia and even - Emma there's an
incredible amount of work that goes into
producing these shows and the only
reason that it looks so easy is because
of the team that I have making it look
just that way I also want to give a
special shout out to those of you who
provide us with monthly support on
patreon and on PayPal or who have done
one-time donations via Bitcoin your
support not only keeps us independent
but has given me the luxury of saying no
to several big-money offers this year as
long as that support remains I see no
reason to change that and I promise that
I will do my best to make sure that your
continued support is well worth it and
of course thanks to all of you who watch
share and like these videos we've never
put a dollar into YouTube ads but the
show continues to grow because you
helped it do so the emails that I get
from you saying how you're putting the
ideas we discuss your into action or
changing what you believe because of
something you've heard or just talking
to people in a new way because of the
tone we've set here is incredibly
inspiring and I'm sorry if I don't write
everyone back immediately trust me I'm
trying so thank you thank you and thank
you this time of year is when we give
thanks and show gratitude and it's all
of you who have given me so much to be
thankful and grateful for I look forward
to kicking off 2018 with you soon enough
but in the meantime Merry Christmas
Happy Hanukkah happy New Year and may
the force be with you
[Music]
joining me today is the former CEO of
National Public Radio and the author of
Republican like me how I left the
liberal bubble and learn to love the
right kenster and welcome to the Rubin
report thanks Dave thanks for having me
on the show
you left the liberal bubble and have
survived I did you're a survivor so live
on 94 percent Democratic ninety-four
percent Democratic Ward in Washington
you see 100% Democratic household
increasingly concerned about this we may
kick you out of the house so under
debate and my 10 year old son booed my
first television appearance when the
book came out and I've been crease ly
concerned about sort of the polarization
how much we hate the other side often
without really knowing the other side so
I decided I'd spend I'd do something
about it for myself
recognizing I am in a bubble like all of
us are I wanted to spend time as much as
I can
it could trying to understand things
from some things from the someone else's
point of view and that's been a year
traveling the country communing with
conservatives with Republicans really
trying to see things from their point of
view
yeah and that did survive so yeah or we
get well you've survived so far let's
see it let's see how this hour okay and
there's a lot that I want to talk to you
about because even the use of the word
liberal in the subtitle I think is
interesting because I always talk about
the difference between the left and
liberalism and and a few other things
but first let's just find out a little
bit about your your back story what we
are doing that led you to be the the CEO
of NPR so I've spent a good part of my
career in media spent on some
international broadcasting Voice of
America and joined NPR in 1999 first as
chief operating officer and then
eventually became CEO and was there
during it for about a decade have spent
time in almost all the unpopular
professions there are law politics and
media so
thank you from EDC all right so the
whole thing here yeah so there's there's
a lot to dislike about my background
parently for most of the country tell me
a little bit about just the NPR machine
I know half my audience the my audience
that leans right is probably hearing NPR
and they're going oh I like this guy
because he left the bubble butt but NPR
like raises some flags for them and then
my audience on the left is going NPR
they're the they're the the new Bible of
truth and all that tell me a little bit
about just the ecosystem of NPR so
impera interesting place it is a really
collective of public radio stations from
around the country so NPR is a company
which I ran for for a number of years of
journalists and similar people it's
essentially a news organization but it
is connect to do 500 public radio
stations around the country so it's
unique in the sense that you know most
of its reporters are located Washington
see in similar places but you can go to
virtually any community around the
country the wilds of Alaska you'll find
public radio stations which I think
makes it sort of a unique place yeah do
they have any other connection the radio
stations other than that they fall under
the NPR well there are there all part of
the nut NPR they're all part of the
public radio system and the thing that
often people key on is that they are not
through NPR through the corporation
public broadcasting the recipients of
various federal funds support their
operations yeah what does it say that if
we were to look at all of these radio
stations that I would guess that
probably every single one of them leans
left yet they're funded by the
government so this isn't this isn't a
nonpartisan radio operation really right
yeah so I've made myself somewhat
unpopular in public radio over the last
few months by saying two things which I
think you can hold in your head at the
same time I actually have a lot of
admiration for virtually all the
reporters I know at NPR and poetry or
stations they try to do tell stories
from both sides they're dedicated to the
craft of journalism sometimes I think
they are often even to almost metronome
like and here's one point of view here's
another and so I think it is appropriate
to acknowledge that they are serious
journalism doing journalists trying to
be balanced and fair to appropriate a
slogan from Fox right I think the
challenge that I raised with emoji made
me unpopular is they all probably not
offer many of them come from the same
these are self-perpetuating
organizations they hire people who are
like them who tend to think like them
came from similar backgrounds all
problem many of them I think if you took
our census of them you'd find very few
vote for Donald Trump right it's funny I
can see how carefully you're trying to
be with your words that you don't want
to say all and of course you don't mean
every employee there but probably the
vast vast majority if not 90% or more
are progressives I think is basically
what you're trying I think that a
probably right and so I mean so I think
the challenge is not that they're
progressives but there is a consequence
of group think about what stories are
important what what policies are right
and wrong what what voices should be on
the air and I think that's a real
challenge for a place like NPR and
really for mainstream media as a whole
you know it's what I said to the folks
at NPR was you know they would never
think of covering racial issues only
with white males no matter how good
those white males are and really should
be the same with with politics they
should shouldn't cover it only with
people who largely come from a
progressive background no matter how
dead hear the craft of journalism there
what kind of racial they should be made
where well it doesn't matter I just mean
any sort of you know if they wanted to
cover you know if they had a beat on
race in America right they would not
only have they wouldn't just wouldn't
have whites on it white males only on
and they shouldn't it shouldn't cover
gender issues on okay with men I mean I
think you need to have people of
different backgrounds and different
ideas to have the right type of creative
tension that a newsroom needs right
you're not saying exclude those people
you're saying there's no of course not
all right I'm all for white male last I
checked yeah you know they it's it's
it's that you need to have divert not
only diversity of gender and race in in
newsroom you have to diversity of ideas
and backgrounds yeah so where were your
politics so you started there in 99 were
you a hardcore lefty were you a centrist
yeah liberal there I don't think a
hardcore person to write the book I'd
and take the experience but I spent time
to democratic politics on the real life
for Bill Clinton I think you know I
think I say in the book my voted
straight Democratic ticket except for I
think I probably voted against Barry and
Barry and there's various quest to be
there for life and that's about it so
the crack arrest was too much for you
that's where you drew the line with
Marion Barry yes that's right that's
right
yeah so when did you sort of start
realizing that there was this
ideological lockdown on alternative
opinions there you mean it so I think
there's an alternative lockdown and
ideas generally yes does not make this
about NPR one place because I think
that's unfair because what has happened
in this country is we've all become in
our own bubbles liberals conservatives
and it's it's a product of a number of
different things that's going on it's
really quite extraordinary it's we now
choose where we live based upon
political ideology and try to find
homogeneous neighborhoods politically
homogeneous neighborhoods it didn't
exist before our political parties are
increasingly political homogeneous
they're no such thing as conservative
Democrats or liberal Republicans anymore
they don't have homes yeah where's the
dog Democrats go they guys that I would
love to be voted right they died I mean
the Blue Dog caucus was quite important
15 years ago now doesn't exist anymore
there is no Democrat who is more
conservative than the than the most
liberal Republican and vice versa
they're the Venn diagram does not meet
anymore in the Congress and now we've
our all of our own media right so
conservatives Gillison Fox or any other
or Rush or any other place Democrats had
liberals and progressives have plenty of
choices that fit their own and it's a
credibly destructive and it means we're
all increasing their own bubble and when
that happens it's not that we actually
begin to disagree more becomes easy just
easy to demonize the other side when you
don't know them well you don't hear from
them when you don't dialogue with them
it's really easy to hate each other and
that's what's happened this country we
really hate the other side in ways that
are very different than 15 years ago
well I think that's why I do this show
and why you wrote this book yeah but
before we get out of the fully the the
radio part yeah you mentioned Rush why
does it seem
that right-wing radio so rush and Glenn
Beck and Michael Savage and the list
goes on and on seems to be commercially
viable gets tons of listens and all that
and left-wing radio it simply doesn't
work outside of what's funded really by
the government so Air America was a
catastrophe
right right example I don't have a good
answer that so let's let me admit up
front I don't think it's good answer
I'll tell you what conservatives will
say they will say I don't think this is
either I think it's a little bit of
truth and a little bit of falsehood in
is what liberals find a home a place
like the New York Times and NPR they're
comfortable with him there their needs
are met and they'll say that Rush and
others sessile because conservative
needs are not met in mainstream media
yeah
and that's you know I'm not gonna make
it equivalency between left and right I
think that's a false equivalency in
terms of media and how they operate but
it is clearly true when you look at the
the psychographics of the of the readers
and your times or the listeners NPR they
come primarily from the left yeah when
you hear people on the right it's
usually people on the right say well why
are we funding NPR I mean why is the
government and even funding public radio
at all at this point and especially if
there is an ideological bent to it how
do you respond yeah again I don't want
to let's not take this too far because
that ideological bent is it is right in
sort of an unconscious way a
subconscious way it doesn't have I think
no one sits at NPR ordinary we didn't
used to and says you know let's tell one
side of the story and not the other yeah
I suspect that's actually not quite true
I mean I think they're in their bubble
as you talked about here so much that I
don't know that they're consciously
doing it but they've sort of decided
what yeah I think it's everything I
think it's a fair criticism right but
there's a difference I mean there's a
very significant difference in how
mainstream media works and conservative
media works unless there's new knowledge
without sort of attributing anything
good or bad to it and some knowledge
that they come from a different place
and a different sort of journalistic
ethic you know a public fraud funding
for broadcast public broadcasting is an
artifact of a different era you know
they they they started in 1970
when there was no three networks and
there were just no real alternatives to
those three networks and a handful of
newspapers and it was really important
that the government as they do in
England in a lot of other places support
the public radio and public televsion
and they exist I'm probably true that if
if Paul grade and Public Television did
exist no one would create it now because
there's so many different outlets the
reason is I think it's interesting
though to actually explore the reason
why public broadcasting funding still
exists it's not because of NPR and PBS
it's because of the local stations the
people who you know don't bang on NPR
and PBS but those at least in my day the
people who actually stood up for public
broadcasting and when it came to
probation time it was Ted Stevens as
conservative a senator you ever get from
Alaska because he didn't really care for
NPR more psp2 but he loved Alaska
problem casting and he knew that that
was Alexia lifeline lifeline brought
service to parts of Alaska that didn't
get content local news and others and
that's why I think it still gets pokes
but spoke support not because of like or
dislike for the National content
providers that's interesting I don't
know too much about Ted Stevens
specifically but I wonder was he
fighting would he been okay with well
let let's the state fund it then you
know not instead of the federal
government or is this all funded I
assume is it is a partnership partly
with the states with put ups it
so public broadcasting is complicated
but yeah state we don't have to go to do
you think it's interesting
relative to so many not all many
broadcasting stations get significant
support from local jurisdictions whether
it's a state or a municipality
yeah so even though he probably wasn't
thrilled with what they were putting on
air he just wanted some of the federal
funds that helped allow it cuz he liked
it for his state's purposes yeah he knew
it was a lifeline service to Alaska and
Wyoming and other places like that they
don't have major media markets that's
really who and that's where the money
goes is to those stations right it's
interesting because the world has
changed so much obvious so 1970 and the
idea that the government I mean
me and I get access to me streets great
and I was just watching it with my niece
a couple weeks ago but the idea that the
government is funding any of these ways
that we get media now it seems very
archaic to where we are in 2017 it is
you know the interesting to think about
and we could spend the whole hour
talking about it and hope we don't get
my book yeah we'll get there but if
federal funding went away tomorrow on
the radio side I know much more about
rare than television
[Music]

federal funding went away tomorrow on
the radio side I know much more about
regular in television NPR ultimately
fine
many of the stations in big cities would
be fine it's actually the rural stations
that would collapse mm-hmm
and that's why you know I think there is
that support for public broadcasting
funding as it goes forward yeah just
generally speaking do you think that if
funding was slowed down or cut or
whatever that wouldn't private people
that feel that this is important jump in
on that I mean that's one of the themes
that I talk about here a lot about how
much should the government do and if the
government stopped doing so much maybe
if these things are vital and important
that private people would and they
didn't take on some of the burden yeah
uh great at all I think principled
support I mean ten years out of date so
at least when I was there the principal
revenue came from listeners like you
yeah that's where the the largest source
of revenue comes from so as the host of
the PBS fundraiser in New York City yeah
Manhattan right many years ago I gave
away some totes and all that data for
free yeah no yeah so again I think
wooden in New York WNYC would be fine
they probably hate me for saying this
but I don't know that poll asked a
public radio would be fine because the
amount of people to give them money
pretty pretty low I'm just a number of
people and the wealth available tap is
is very different there yeah it's just
an interesting dilemma because I could
see some valuable stations in these
local markets these small markets that
there's worth to them and then on the
other hand it's like why should we be
funding all of these things if they
can't just exist on their own so it's an
interesting philosophical a because it's
one those issues which I think if
conservatives talk to conserve is about
and liberals talk to liberals about they
come to very different points of view
yeah if you actually talk to people who
know and put people together actually
realize it's actually a fairly
complicated nuanced issue that has no
sort of obvious right or wrong answer
it's actually true when you go out and
talk to people about issues people
actually you know in social media
they're angry and mad but no life
actually pretty moderate and that's one
of the things I discovered in my year
traveling the country yeah well people
are always there seemingly worst online
and snappiest and very rarely do that
you know when you're standing across
somebody or sitting across somebody just
like this so let's talk about the word
liberal for a second the subtitle is how
I left the liberal bubble and learn to
love the right yeah what does liberal
mean to you so I think that's a
catch-all phrase for progressive
Democrat in some type of gross way
describe Democrats progressive people of
the left I don't mean necessarily
classical liberal as you might be
thinking of it yeah has it meant because
I think today it means it's the
catch-all for I know it's a very poor
ssin of the of the spectrum yeah it's
unfortunate for me because I've tried
really hard to show people that if
you're a classical liberal and you
believe in the individual and
live-and-let-live that actually that is
virtually nothing to do with
progressives but even even some of my
allies now who are on the right well we
say liberal liberal liberal and of my
guys let's separate from left but yeah
yeah I don't know if I gave it that
careful thought the ends of the term I
mean I think it's a catch-all for the
people whose environment I was shared
yeah who I lived with the people I
worked with the people who ran the
meteor ization is that I used yeah did
you find those people to actually be
liberal though I know this is a little
bit about the definition of the words
but did you find that they really at
their heart were liberal I mean that
they really were tolerant and
understanding and liberalism in its best
sense good god no and I think this gets
us to where the book is yeah I think the
thing that's worried me absolute truth
it's one of which is I think that's
share we're increasingly intolerant of
anyone who disagrees with us it's strong
airily so and it is angered me a little
bit so ruining me personally because
I've always thought of like you thought
of liberals one of the tenants of modern
liberalism is tolerance of perspective
different perspective and belief that
really we need
the diversity of ideas and there is
value in different ideas and value in
listening and engaging that is not a
value of modern American politics as we
know it and that is her wounds me
personally and one of the things that
led me to this book yeah do you remember
a moment when you started seeing that
more amongst your kind so to speak so
I'll tell you story no not particularly
[Music]
YouTube week in partnership with library
continues this week and joining me today
is a stand-up comic a writer and an
actor
Yoko Dakar welcome to the Rubin
reporting of having me Dave glad to be
here you're looking sharp man thank you
it's not very stand-up is it the suit
and things like that I feel like I
should have come in just like a t-shirt
looking you're looking sort of old pro
standup oh wow not candy three year olds
okay but I just won't have the wisdom
that an old pro has not yet but I'm glad
you like the dress yeah very very I like
when a guest says I'm you know I'm not a
big show this thing's on the YouTube
thank you yes a great job being a fan
for a long time and I'm very happy to be
here
cool well I'm happy that you are here
and I look fan of yours as well thank
you thank you very much and there's a
lot that we're gonna talk about from
from stand-up to the videos you create
you live in Australia which is a far-off
I darius place for us american 15 our
flights geez yeah it's it's forward
right as it's a day forward in Australia
so when I'm talking to everyone I'm
talking to them in the future
Oh what you did you wouldn't think about
it cuz Australia is kind of sort
backward anyway so it's kind of an
oxymoron going on there yeah so this is
part of YouTube week what we're doing
here and I get to be when all these
youtubers this week I don't know that
you quite consider yourself a youtuber
but you consider yourself a stand-up
robably more than anything else right
that's see I used to be a really
skeptical skeptical of the term youtuber
because there was a certain stigma
attached to that because you generally
be associated with people who just do
pranks or vloggers but since then I've
kind of learned it and I thought yeah
I'm a youtuber because it's the medium
where I put out a lot of my content
which is comedy and short films but I'm
happy to be referred to as a youtuber
all right would you say stand up first
though if we were raised a comedian
first yes I think a lot of the writing I
do is very comedic even the acting it's
quite based in character comedy and
things like that so I just comedian yeah
so you came onto my radar about two
three years ago you did a video called
modern education yeah pretty much tore
up the internet yeah where did you get
the it we're gonna play a little clip
from it I static him but where did you
get the idea for this video modern edgy
well I was doing a lot of comedy as I
said and there seems to be this
pervasive idea of like what was good
comedy and there was like a lot of
social policing going around and I
always considered my comedy quite
progressive if anything I mean at face
value some of the jokes could be quite
broad aja sand in your face and
aggressive but underneath all that there
was an underlying message of you know
social liberalism basically but I
constantly got attacked for being racist
and sexist and I suppose I had my like
red pill moment then and yeah exercising
your white privilege exactly all right
like I'm clearly like I'm a white
nationalist I'm all of that and from
there I I didn't really look I wasn't
too interested in politics or anything
like that but I started to research a
bit more into it and and look into it a
bit more and and I sort of understood
the underlying cultural themes and ideas
that were you know contributing to this
kind of left-wing authoritarianism I'd
call it in I wanted to create something
that as you said told them apart because
I really I just didn't like that at all
and I've done a sketch a few months
earlier called hashtag equality you
might have seen that one as well that
one went quite well
my audience was very Australian prior to
that sketch so it was reaching an
audience here in North America and all
across the globe and and then I went
with modern education I really wanted to
go even deeper and try to not just sort
of say like hey look the left is
annoying in there they're LCCs or
whatever but I wanted to try to go
deeper a bit more and try to say like
that the emphasis on continued social
equity as the major aim is actually very
detrimental to just basic meritocracy
and that's probably the main message I
wanted to get across with modern
education I wanted to make it funny it's
quite a dark it's a very dark tone yeah
but you know I wanted to go for the
humor and the satire and I put it out
there and we were you know I mean my
friend Tim who I worked with on that
video and a lot of my other short films
we were skeptical as to how it would go
because it's the internet we thought you
know any video that doesn't get to the
punchline with
thirty seconds it's not gonna go well
yeah and this one there's no dialogue
for the first minute yeah and overnight
it got about twenty thousand views we
thought well that's quite good we're
happy with that
yeah then when we woke up Australian
time in the morning it had about 700,000
I think in a matter of hours it had
literally blown up and once you guys are
from the future over there so exactly
portend what was gonna happen yeah we
knew that was gonna you know we could
predict that and that week it just went
it went truly viral like I got millions
of views you got reuploaded on a lot of
Facebook pages we counted something like
20 million views all up when you take
into account the views on the YouTube
upload and all of the Facebook uploads
so it's very gratifying and there's a
lot of hate surrounding it okay we'll
get to the heat after so let's play a
little clip and and I just want to add
what was so beautiful about it was not
only because it was funny and because it
was poignant and relevant all that but
it was beautifully shot it wasn't
professional you know I try to put out a
professional show on YouTube and you
made a professional video on YouTube and
you see so many things that are just you
know webcam this or yeah silly graphic
this or that but you you actually made
saying that is really great I think we
talked it up enough let's throw out of
the clip
well done little bees you do Simon six
out of ten hey be careful you've been
staring at her for ten seconds what it's
a form of harassment to stare at a woman
for more than 15 seconds straight and
when I used to turn straight I don't
mean to offend any persons of a
non-traditional sexual preference and
when I used to turn non-traditional I
don't mean to offend any persons who
oppose historically normal eyes okay I
get it
unfortunately sunshine your research
assignment is only worth a word out of
10 I've used Fourier transform in
mathematical methods in the electronics
to analyze the electro diagrams of
at-risk patients and calculate their
risk of experiencing a heart attack I
mean it's a new method but it could
potentially save thousands of lives
seven you barely even read it you used
red pen what ready is considered
offensive in many religions why would
you belittle everything down to a
singular color
well Humanity is a rainbow of beauty and
spirituality yeah okay fine
seven out of ten but that still means I
get to go to the summit right the
marking process isn't over yet now
because we live in a society based on
equality the total amount of marks are
to be divided equally among our students
you've got to be kidding me
well that students we're all equal we're
all but then who gets to go to the
summit hi we haven't added our
privileged points yet don't you know
anything that is correct now never pee
you are females or that's passed one
privilege point
however you were white so that's minus
one I will do bisexual plus one that
leaves you with a total score of six out
of ten Simon unfortunately you're
straight white and male and cisgender
yes so that's minus four privileged
points which leaves you with a total
score of one so me fair now you your
mail and I don't like you so that's
minus two privileged points but you are
brown and sexually ambiguous so that's
plus two that leaves you with a total
score of five wait why am i sexually
ambiguous and finally sunshine I'm gay
I'm trans I'm Asian I'm overweight I'm
lower class I'm unintelligent
unattractive I've got hairs on my
nipples and I always caught body odor
and I can't really run properly or tie
my shoelaces by myself I once watched
the pigeon die wonderful sunshine that's
thirteen privileged points that leaves
you with a total score of 18 out of 10
well done sunshine you're going to New
York
sunshine you could do it let me see this
they've just written equality and drawn
love hearts on a piece of paper he
expressed himself and it's beautiful
he didn't even spell equality correctly
we don't discriminate he says nothing to
do with mathematics you think you're so
great with your maths and your signs and
your backs
what about feelings what about feelings
what does that mean that's the perfect
point to end it yeah what I like about
watching that with you is you still get
a kick out of it which out sometimes
it's hard to watch your own stand-up or
some of the things you produce yeah
usually we might stand up in other
sketches I find it a bit mmm a bit
disconcerting to watch but that one I
like I like it yeah yeah what's that
feeling like when something that you do
like kind of rips through something else
you like when it really actually makes a
mark it's very satisfying sorry sighs
well because that's what you want to
achieve as a
as a writer as any artist in general and
to just observe how well it went and to
see how many people caught on to it and
that it meant a lot to a lot of people
and it really resonated it's very
gratifying
what does it say that comedy is heading
in that direction because one of the
things I've noticed lately is that the
left unfortunately has sort of killed
comedy at least here in America and I
want to talk a bit about the Australian
scene as well but that what I find funny
these days is coming more so from the
right sort of the libertarian right
yes but the same people that are mocking
the same things that that you're going
after yeah I I agree and that's really
interesting because growing up you know
was the opposite yeah it was always the
left that were the the funny ones
basically because they were fighting
against the the authority yeah and now
the tables have turned essentially
because the left is kind of one the
culture war sorry to fight against that
is provocative were you worried at all
yeah will you worried though that you're
gonna put this out it goes against what
all the sort of norms are even accepted
just career-wise like the accepted like
oh I want to get the right agency to
pick me up and I want to get the
television show and all that but I'm
gonna do something that goes against the
very grain of what they sent as funny
even if it is funny you know yeah I was
very worried very well and especially
when it went really well to begin with I
was quite shy and a lot of institutions
were offering interviews and things like
that and I kind of backpedal and I
thought ah what's happening like what
have I done I've ruined my career
forever yeah but I like to think the
film itself is is quite accessible
because I think a lot of people on the
Left would also watch that film and say
that's true see I think I've what I've
done with it as I've created a picture
and like Illustrated an argument that
it's not just your typical like all the
left is stupid all the left is annoying
I've kind of gone a bit deeper than that
so it's it's not that easy to just kind
of dismiss it as like oh this is just
some right-wing trash yeah I like to
think anyway I did check yeah on the
Google today and what you said earlier
is true you did get a certain amount of
hate I did I saw articles written about
you yeah you know you're in it with the
all right I'm yeah I'm fine all right
that's naughty
insult any mother's makes you're not far
left so I'm just like yeah whatever I'm
all right like cool what was that like
yeah we could snip that and like ruin my
career just make sure you use all of
what I said before that it's all snip a
bow and the fact now you asked them to
do that means that they can't do that
that's sort of how it works I've ruined
it now now I'm OVA now you've really
ruined it what was it like though
getting that level of hate
it was surreal it was a bit I felt a bit
uneasy to begin with I had luckily I'd
had a big viral video a couple of years
ago within Australia that had achieved
like a million views in Australia within
a week which is like one you know five
percent of the population so I kind of
knew what I was dealing with bits
I just became a hermit for a week I
didn't really look at social media too
much Tim my friends in here now directs
a lot of the films he would kind of keep
me updated with what people are saying
and and and things like that i well i
backpedal backpedal a little bit which I
kind of regret right now I did these big
posts saying like hey look I'm a I'm a
centrist don't like bucks me in with the
riot and things like that which no I
kind of regret that because like I'm
giving in in a way but at the time when
older heat was coming on me I think that
was just like a natural response yeah
but they never stop right so you could
you could say that as many times I'm a
centrist I'm a good guy don't worry
Bobby well there's never enough that
they're like are he's cool he's cool
well they just throw out those like
labels so much that they've just lost
all meaning so I got like I said I don't
if people say like your race is still
like internalized racism or something
like that I'm just lying yeah yeah
doesn't affect me one of the things that
I thought was so cool about it was that
I I mean I didn't know who you guys were
beforehand but the fact that it came
from Australia I thought wow yeah the
stuff that I've been talking about that
so many people are talking about right
now that's just kind of bubbling up they
get it in Australia too and that means
how many other countries do they really
get it it's glow and then when I did a
little more research on you and I found
out that you're Indian and all that I
was like wow it does show that none of
this has to do with the immutable
characteristics that color your skin or
your sexuality or any of that it's what
it's what's right and what's wrong
that's it and that was
the beautiful moment for me which is why
I shared that thing like a thousand
times
it's about your opinions and your values
as a person and you know your skin color
or genders shouldn't matter I'm am I'm
not entirely dismissive of identity
politics I think there are some
conversations that identity politics is
relevant like particularly if you're
talking about issues that do affect
certain race or gender it does hold some
authority to say like hey look I am that
race I am that gender my opinion should
be given a certain level of authority
but this idea that like because you know
because I'm brown I'm only allowed to
talk about Brian issues and like a white
male is just not allowed to talk about
it I disagree with that
yeah if anything I think that's well
that's quite patronizing cuz it's the
the assumption is that like as a
minority I can't handle views that like
opposed mine and I'm such a snowflake
that like anyone that says anything
against me I'm gonna just crumble and
that's actually quiet
well it's discriminatory because it's
assuming that like I'm less like well
that's what a lot of people describe is
the soft bigotry of low expectations
exactly yeah
which is pretty depressing when a watch
how I'll use that to get to this next
question yeah I wasn't thinking of until
just now
okay but did you see that there's this
documentary now about a poo from from
The Simpsons I did say that yeah it's
called I think that the trouble with a
poo or yeah it's not something like that
but in effect basically saying that this
is somehow a bad stereotype and now
meanwhile everything in the Simpsons is
awful stereotype exactly the clown is
James the worst type of Harold a
stereotype but but the idea I haven't
seen the documentary yet I will watch it
maybe in my opinion will change after
but the idea of up who being offensive
or something they've taught so much
about Indian culture and had an Indian
wedding and yeah family and the children
and you've met his parents and the
episode where he's going to be deported
and he becomes the you know proud
American and shows Homer not to be a
bigot and all of this stuff it's like
man this is actually becoming racism
this is your coming what what did you
want them to do you know is a beloved
television character on probably the
greatest comedy
in modern times exactly I mean I do a
joke about that where I do say like it
is there's a bit of complexity to that
issue because I think as a growing up
like when up who is the only
representation of brown people that can
be quiet it's it's just it's not nice
and I used to be more like Oh get him
off the air like any sort of like
stereotypes like that are harmful but
I've sort of realized there's a bit more
nuance to that in that when you're in a
minority
you can't expect like everyone to kind
of bow down to you like you're in a
minor I'm understanding in Australia
like brown people are not like they're a
very small percentage of the population
so like not everything's going to like
revolve around us I do I do think like
the outrage that's happening now I mean
that was a show that came out in the 90s
so it would be different if they created
that character today that's
yeah like the whole outrage machine it
just doesn't it's it's like just just do
it then like the best way rather than
sort of complaining and saying like hey
change this change this to the people at
the top do something yourself you know
that was my philosophy like yeah I don't
like this like taxi driver kind of
character that much but I'm gonna show
that like not all Indians elect oh I'm
gonna do that myself and be an
individual and like I like to thing I've
done that you know there's not many
videos where I'm just like a very
stereotypical India I do make jokes
about that like don't get me wrong
particularly in my comedy I have all
sorts of you know Brown jokes in there
as I'm sure many people would know but
yeah that kind of like dependency and
and like sort of like demanding that
like you know this this character needs
to be taken down it's just it's not
empowering because you're saying like I
can't do it myself therefore someone
else has to like change that for me it's
also it's in a ratio of history don't
you think like even if they yeah if they
[Music]
we've got more Rubin report YouTube week
in partnership with library today and
joining me is a social commentator a
failed musician and a mediocre gamer
some black guy welcome to the Rubin
report and thanks des for having me it's
great to be here surreal dude I took
that bio right out of your YouTube by
yeah so I don't want people to think
that I'm calling you a mediocre gamer as
we start because we've already talked
video games I suspect you know slightly
better than a mediocre game I'm I guess
I'm moderately ok but on the grand scale
of things when you watch pro gamers and
stuff I'm terrible you know can when you
really when you really think about it
yeah I'm pretty bad too - slightly tell
you that we have a bit of an age
difference here just the idea to me that
there are pro video gamers now like if
there had existed when I was closer to
your age man I mean that's what I would
have wanted to do right in a pro gamer
right yeah yeah definitely uh that's
something that I actually had some what
if I wanted to dabble in in it but I
remember I had a kind of slap into
reality when I bought it was the Marvel
vs. Capcom 3 back in like 2011 I started
playing online thinking that I was great
because I was great at the second one
yeah I think I won like two matches and
I lost like twenty that dude no no that
there's people that are just amazing
what system was that on that was on Xbox
360 that was on that and I was trying to
like say maybe if I can if I'm good here
then maybe I can compete and I couldn't
just beat your regular everyday people
that probably grind all the time same
thing with Call of Duty just there's
people are just too good men and then
it's not fun anymore that's the problem
right for these guys like they love it
they're great at it but then at some
point it's almost like everything with
our yeah someone in it when it stops
being fun it's it kind of sucks oh yeah
and that's something that it kind of
taken just taking a step back from it
and then having it be a hobby that
that's the best thing you really can't I
don't know if I i would probably love it
being a ha being pro and being in my job
but then at the same time then when it
becomes your job you lose that pureness
and that just the fun it'll probably
suck a lot of it out of it which I know
a lot of people feel that way about
YouTube to a certain
and we are gonna get into all of that
and much more you know I used to work I
don't want to brag but I was assistant
manager at Electronics Boutique which
you know I remember you guys know now
known as Game Stop and I remember by I
thought it was going to be like the
coolest job in the world I was right out
of college I was like oh I'm gonna be
like in the video game world yes selling
video games I thought it's gonna be so
awesome but selling video games and
playing video games very different
things like it was not nearly as fun as
playing video games oh yeah I imagine so
I actually tried to get a job in it
wasn't uh wasn't eb games but it was
game crazy they had games crazy and it
was for Hollywood video and my friend
got the job instead I don't know why I
don't I don't want to you know say
anything people were probably my fans
like the method or what you're implying
my fans like the message me but you know
where I'm going what they would probably
say but uh yeah he told me about how
ridiculous it was and people are always
trying to steal stuff yeah and one guy
actually he put it was when Xbox 360 was
brand new he put it on the counter dude
ran out with it Jesse's looked it and my
friend tried to chase after him and he
got fired because of it
I once tackled a guy that's really you a
dad I mean imagine going to electronics
blue team this guy just stole turbo tax
it wasn't even stealing something good
not even stealing like some car chase
game or something somebody should say
steal a turbo tackle I literally ran out
of store and tackled the guy I quit I
quit like I was like what am I doing
with my life alright wait let's rewind
for just a second so I intro you as as
some black guy yeah but you have a real
name I believe I need Derek yes and it's
funny because when I was doing a little
research
Derek Blackman came up and I thought
wait a minute now is his name really
Derek Blackman and he goes by some black
eye how do I ask this question because
YouTube's waiting to call me racist so
you're really so your name is Derek mr.
Blackman is not it's not it's an alias
it today yeah a lot of people you know
when they see that like wow is it really
black man like no unfortunately it's not
it's something that I just I like to put
out there because you know I don't like
people I don't mind people knowing my my
first and my last name my surname it's
pilot by the way like a regular
playing airplane pilot that's a cool
name yeah it's not mean it's pretty
unique I don't know other than like my
family and a couple other people I've
searched up my brother's like obsessed
with looking for other people with that
name but Derek pilot I mean you sound
like a video game character like Derek
pilot you know it gets totally work it
could I just I just put Blackman there
just take it plays off my name it also
there's uh there's a pro wrestler he's
uh he doesn't wrestle anymore his name
was Steve Blackman and I really liked
him he was a martial artist so I kind of
like always liked that last name
Blackman so it just I just put it in
there and it works and it's just like
you know it's kind of weird when people
are searching you and you know I have a
life of a lot of other things that I've
done a lot of other music projects and
everything and I didn't want people just
like looking for a that's fine if they
do but I just like hey Derrick Blackman
that's that's what you'll find if you're
looking for me anything that has to do
with YouTube you'll find Derek Blackman
it's so cool to me that like this
generation of people who grew up that
like made something out of the things
that I love so much I mean the things
that are here from you know all like the
sci-fi stuff and the video game stuff oh
yeah cartoons and wrestling and all that
stuff like that was all the stuff I
loved and it was just like a little bit
before YouTube although ironically we're
doing this on YouTube right now yeah but
you guys were able to like all make
careers that are talking about that
stuff and being in that world it's so
cool to me it's it dude it's not it's
surreal I still haven't fully processed
it even I one of my friends that one of
my like closest friends he was like dude
how does it feel that people are buying
shirts with your face on it and I'm like
I don't that's it's so crazy to me man
and I mean I I it's it's it's pretty
great though it's it's I I wouldn't have
any other way I love that that the
Internet has you know as gotten cave-ins
given so many people opportunities to do
things that they never even imagined
it's this and sky's the limit just gonna
keep growing from there yeah so alright
so some black guy yeah that's what you
came up with and I think it kinda you
know from all your videos that I watch
it does kind of caps lately you like
you're not trying to be holier-than-thou
you're trying to just kind of do your
thing and like you're some guy doing
this you happen to be black there yeah
how did you come up with that name like
was it just like one day you were like
that it was it was but it was back in
that on myspace days it was that was my
username probably when I was like 16 or
something it was just like oh you can
choose your name it was some black guy
and it really hit home when one of my
friends I added him and it said you know
he told me he laughed after he accepted
me it said that oh it says some black
guy wants to be your friend
so he thought I was pretty funny right
yeah and then I'll say you know this
this can I can use this for other things
I try to do a podcast like four years
ago and that was my alias some black guy
that thing failed and you know never see
the light of day but then it was that's
what it was like what should I call me
YouTube channel couldn't think of
anything some black guy then and it's
worked it people really seemed to like
it even when I said that you know what I
think I kind of want to change it maybe
I want to change but it's a Derrick
Blackman so it can be more of a personal
thing people can know me better if
you're like no you don't you dare change
it and it's also kind of an interesting
way of attacking identity politics which
we'll get into in a little bit but I
know you obviously don't like identity
politics so you're kind of throwing it
in their face yeah kind of right up
front which is which is pretty cool
let's talk a little bit about your
history that I think people don't know
about a little bit like just tell me a
little bit about where you're from
family that kind of stuff okay well I
initially I grew up in well I didn't
grow up and I was born in LA I was in
Inglewood and my father when he died
about then I was four years old I didn't
I didn't you know I didn't really know
what's going on so forcefully processing
everything and we moved to a North
Orange County like not like fancy OC
than the south it says regular might as
well be LA or a little part of some
people even called it like Mexico cos it
was La Habra Guadalajara people called
it and so this wasn't MTV OC definitely
not not even but that's what people
assumed if especially if they didn't
live in the area yeah and sometimes I
lived in Arizona a couple of times and I
tell people I'm from Orange County not
LA and like oh so you're so fancy and
I'm like no not at all dude not even a
little bit yeah but I grew up in there
and I was mainly I was interested in
just music and and there was a little
bit of sports but I got injured a few
times and when I was playing football
and I gave that up but I was always I
thought
I was always gonna do music I never
thought that I was gonna be like you
know speaking to people or like say
trying to entertain people in that way I
thought I was just gonna like try to
serenade people oh I try to be a
frontman I wanted to sing or do
something like that but I ended up
playing the drums more because drums
drummers were so scarce it was easy for
me to get a gig it was easy for me to
join into stuff like that and I mainly
played with like people can probably
tell I was more into like metal and punk
and that was always always a little bit
different because of just little things
I bumped into here and there and it
really kind of put me on that path of
like where I am now just always kind of
searching for alternative things and
like alternative thinking the certain
type of ways of thought and even in the
political realm or just do you have this
like left-right paradigm that was going
on and I just wasn't really as like I
don't really buying this stuff - to be
more things out there and then my friend
was tell me about what about independent
candidates and it kind of just
manifested from there yeah it's
interesting so you describe you're
obviously being tongue-in-cheek but into
your YouTube bio it says failed
musicians
yeah well that that was your first thing
now it's obviously the failure part of
that kind of led you to some success
here in the other world do you miss that
part though yeah dude I actually I've
been I've been kind of inspired to get
back into music I really I really wanted
to start making music again I always do
it on the side there is uh there's a
part of me on like Instagram I always
put up little clips of me I'll either be
seen playing the guitar and sometimes I
play the drums and people like you got
to do something and I just can't like I
just need a little bit of a push you
know but I do miss that and I say I say
failed musician because yeah I'm not I'm
not of touring or a career musician and
I got close I got close my this band
that I used to be in I quit and then
they soon after got signed to a major
record label but they fell apart - so
wouldn't matter in any way but I did
every once in a while I do get
recognized for being the drummer of that
band because you know it's a-okay in in
the metal in the metal genre how many
black people are in it
yeah you know so the black drummer and
have long braids at the time to be black
it's pretty interesting though but I do
I do miss plane and I might I sometimes
rap on the side but I might go on I
might do that because let's be honest
it's a little bit easier than trying to
get like a five piece 4 piece five piece
people together and try to have them all
work together it it it fails so many
times you know what I mean sure though
you do have a gig that's working right
now yeah this is this right now is
definitely paying the bills it's pretty
no I'm doing I'm definitely grateful for
it yeah so you know it's so interesting
so I have five youtubers on this week
and I should have asked everyone this
but I'll ask you this where do you think
talent actually comes from do you think
you were born with the musical talent
and the way you connect with people and
the humor and all that stuff or was this
like just through work and work I think
some of I think some of it is I think
there's certain aspects that are they're
kind of inherited that you're kind of
born with certain things like say I know
my family my mom and my dad they both
had a music year and it wasn't the
playing guitar was not natural for me
there was actually I was self-taught and
for a while I was playing guitar
completely wrong I was always playing
and standard and which is you know okay
you have your standard tuning which is
like you know 6e and I was playing it
like say what most metal musicians and
like the certain genres into they would
drop it
one down and it was that drop D and what
you can do is these bar chords and I was
playing it you don't do bar chords on
Ani I don't want to get too technical
but now I'm just saying that lightly
over my head yeah yeah people that play
a lot of people don't know what talking
about I was playing it wrong for a very
long time until I started you know
learning a little bit more so I
definitely wasn't just able to pick it
up and like I know what to do and I know
what everything sounds right but I put
in a little bit of work to where I can
play the guitar and the drums decent
enough to I could probably being a
successful band but yeah it's all about
work and so the talent aspect I think
there's some people that it's so much
easier but I didn't have like the I
didn't really have it just it wasn't
just a total like gift to me or whatever
I from a very young age I was performing
at I went to a private school and we'd
always have to do these performance
pieces we'd have to do like lip-synching
and all these different things that you
know your kid you hate doing this stuff
I didn't understand why I was doing it
but
it was it was essentially for the
parents right like it's just like
playing football and baseball and stuff
when you're a little kid you don't
really understand what's going on and
until you get older like okay I get it
now yeah and that's all that things it
kind of it worked it all the little doll
the singing and the dancing and all the
crap that I used to do it kind of
manifested into this you know now I feel
pretty comfortable in front of a camera
yeah well that's why I wanted to ask you
that because now when I watch yourself
it's like you strike me as like a pretty
full performer you know to me and like
you've got the tools and it's
interesting how you've kind of kind of
put them all in there when did you make
that shift to YouTube to YouTube
it was it was funny because I had a
channel that was not entertaining it all
back in 2010 where I was just talking
about politics it was more of us right I
mean uh well actually I also was talking
about cuz my first video was uh was
about religion or atheism because I kind
of got sucked into the the New Atheism
the you know the four horsemen and and
so I got sucked into that so I started
making some videos but then it just
quickly shipped into politics so there
was a lot of people especially there was
a lot of there wasn't a lot of black
people talking about politics in general
didn't matter where what side what
political you know affiliate or what a
partisanship you you you had it was just
people weren't really saying anything
and I was like you know what do not want
to like talk and see if people want to
listen and they kind of were they were
they were surprised that oh wow here's
this a young black man that's talking
about some really interesting stuff you
know where were your politics at that at
that time I was still I mean it's it's
kind of still words that were just more
like people call it a centrist now you
can say independent just more trying to
be left or right of center because I'm
just kind of like trying to be you know
figure things out and and I don't have
one just super left or right leaning
because there are some things that I'm
conservative bound there's some things
I'm liberal about and I think I mean I
think a regional perspective the best
way to go when you went on when it comes
down to it it's it reminds me of Chris
Rock where he had like a stand-up and he
was talking about things like no decent
person is just one thing you have some
things there that you're gonna tackle
the issue by issue case by case and
that's what I was trying to do when what
I whatever subject came up I was trying
to think of
rationally what's the best thing for me
or for the people and not just oh I'm on
the right or I am conservative therefore
I have to follow and abide by these
rules and like nonets I think that's
silly
yeah and it's just they draw us over the
head with this nonsense I always think
it's interesting on election day when
they're like well you know they show you
the map that got the big map and you
know John King at CNN is going in the
white working-class people voted this
way and the black inner-city people
voted this yeah but that's like that's
actually not really what happened here
yeah some of the they may
demographically it broke a little more
one way or another way partly having to
do with where you live or race but yeah
like just summing it up like that it's
like that's the stuff that separates us
that brings us together definitely
there's there's a part of like
collectivism that that is rampant more
like now more than ever and it's I feel
like the media they're trying their best
to keep it like that because it it keeps
you watching because conflict keeps you
watching right if everything is peaceful
and if everything is great you know
would you want to watch any any movie
would you want to play any games that
there was really nothing to do you know
no like there has to be something going
on that's why people click on the news
there's always bad stuff going on it's
not like hey this this person did
something very well or this happened
this happened maybe like that's like two
percent of the news so I feel like when
there is something going on kind of like
[Music]
we're continuing YouTube week here on
the Rubin reporting partnership with
library to bring you five shows with
five youtubers in five days joining me
today is a skeptic a musician a model
and one of the first guests on the old
Rubin report many lifetimes ago
Jacquelyn Glen welcome back to the Rubin
report it's been a minute it has been
like 27 years I think since we did this
on camera Wow I was really young that
first time Oh 29 you're 29 you know two
years old years old we were talking
about atheism in skepticism it was a
pretty advanced two-year-old yeah yeah
so yeah you used to be one of the
regulars when the Rubin report was on
The Young Turks now yeah it was a
different show we did more of a panel
thing and did sort of hot topics yeah I
was it was more controversial back then
oh yeah Burnett but we did you know we
sort of click baby it was just it was
just a different thing but you were one
of their regulars on there that
legitimately seems like a lifetime ago
to me yeah it was a long time ago but
here we are again reunited here we are
here you are one of the first people
that we brought on we were like oh
that's someone doing something
interesting on YouTube you were sort of
an early success of YouTube what
possessed you to get on YouTube in the
past oh man well it was a hobby of mine
actually that just kind of turned into
something more I just would go onto the
internet to rant about things that I
couldn't talk to like friends or family
about because they were all very
religious and conservative so I just
kind of used the internet as an outlet
to vent yeah people started listening so
for the people that don't know you at
all so you are you're an atheist that's
what sort of got you that sort of was
your claim to fame or something or a
skeptic or saying we're gonna get in to
some of that stuff but tell me a little
bit more about what it's like growing up
as a conservative having sort of these
other feelings and then going to the
internet to express them yeah I mean I I
did I grew up very conservative and very
religious I went to a Catholic school
from kindergarten through my senior year
in high school and actually after I
graduated high school in college I
became even more
just so that was a very interesting slow
painful transition for me but actually
whenever I started making videos I was
making videos as a Christian but I had
these ideas that didn't go along with
like the Christian traditions so I would
say things like this was before you know
gay marriage was legalized so I would
say things like you know as a Christian
I think people should have equal rights
and I just liked at the time that was
like such a you know controversial
statement right now it's more accepted
but whenever I started making videos
like that was just not something that
you said especially to my family yeah so
it's a-you know it's changed now how did
your family take it that you started
putting these videos out there did they
know any of your sort of evolving
feelings as you were putting this out on
the Internet yeah we would have some
conversations like I remember whenever I
first started talking about equal rights
that was kind of a hot-button issue for
some for some people but they didn't
know that I was on the internet I kept
that to myself that was like my dirty
little secret he was my safe little the
Internet was my oddly my safe place yeah
the most public places your private
place no one was really watching me like
no one you know cared what I had to say
so it was just you know I had like a
small group of people that I felt like I
could relate to and it was a community
for me I wasn't doing it to get viewers
or anything like that I was doing it to
talk to friends and find people who
would agree with me because I didn't
have that in my personal life yeah and I
kind of kept it as a secret I was in
medical school at the time and I didn't
tell any of my classmates and I didn't
tell any of my family and then it kind
of just started picking up momentum and
people started finding me and I was
mortified it's kind of funny that yeah
in medical school and have to kind of
keep it a secret that you either
that you're an atheist or a skeptic or
questioning I mean seems like that would
be pretty pretty okay in medical school
there's no way that they would have been
cool things I was saying in my videos
though I was very I was very opinionated
and I would use profanities and make sex
jokes and all those things so there's no
way that my very professional school
would have been like it's okay that
you're doing this yeah I just kind of
was you know but pretty stupid because I
used my name
as my channel so whatever was it the gay
rights thing was that the first thing
that sort of woke you up out of whatever
the religious dogma was yeah that was
the first thing that got me questioning
the you know traditional values of the
Bible I was just like well you know
maybe I would but I slowly moved away
from it I was like maybe God's cool with
this mm-hm you know maybe I'll just I'll
just call myself an agnostic not even
really knowing what that is and slowly
like move away like maybe I'm not
Catholic maybe I'm Protestant and then I
just kind of slowly stepped back maybe
I'm just a deist maybe there's just
something out there and then I was like
just eventually I landed here yeah but
it was a very slow thing because I
didn't I didn't want to be an atheist I
wanted to be religious like it was
something that I grew up with it was
important to me important to my family I
felt like it was core to my being and
it's nice to think that there's someone
out there or there's afterlife or you
know that when you die it's just it's
not all gone it's comforting to have
that so I didn't want to let it go but I
did yeah yeah let's knock out I know we
did this way back and on my show before
you had your natural hair color that you
have now yeah this is my color you were
dying it I believe Brown at the time
yeah that's to see the natural color
[Laughter]
let's just define some of the terms
which I know we've done together but our
so you mentioned
well obviously atheist agnostic and Di's
let's go through each one
okay well ideas to someone who
disbelieves in a God and they don't put
a label on it like they're not a
Christian God or a Muslim God or
anything is just like there is a being
out there that I can look up to and pray
to and is watching over me it just
doesn't have like the the organized
religion part of it or any set of rules
it's just like a broad like there is a
god thing yeah there where can it be a
there is something out there because I
think that's where probably most people
if you really believers and
non-believers if you really whittled
them down I think there's a huge chunk
of people they'll just be like there's
something there's something yeah maybe
not watching me and judging me yeah yeah
they just believe that there is more
mm-hmm and that's that is you know
comforting and
it's it's harder to debunk that kind of
thing because you know with with
Christianity you can look at specific
parts of the Bible and be like well
that's not true that's not true because
you know facts but whenever you just say
I'm a deist and there's like a thing
that there's no definition to you know
it's more difficult to you know ask
those types of like very specific
questions so it's easier to believe and
more comforting I think for some people
mm-hmm
also it doesn't come with a lot of a
negativity that specific religions might
have so there's that but agnostic is
another word that gets thrown around a
lot and and that's I mean I identify as
an agnostic still but but people kind of
make the mistake in thinking that
agnostic can be a position of belief and
that's where I think the confusion is
because the root of the word agnostic is
Gnostic which means knowledge so to say
that you're agnostic just means you
don't have knowledge which everybody
should admit to like if you're being
intellectually honest like no one knows
the facts of what happens after you die
like there's just you know no one's died
legitimately and come back and been like
yeah I met God he's cool dude
yeah people claim you know it's funny
because there's a lot of like there was
a story of a boy who said that he died
and came back and then later admitted to
all of that big faith just for the book
sales yeah so you know there's a lot of
there's a lot of people who claim to
know but no one actually knows so for
being completely honest everyone should
be agnostic whether you believe in God
or you don't because you know you can
believe in something without having like
concrete evidence you know well that's
sort of the point of belief right I mean
you're sort of you're choosing to behave
in something that you would Hallett
prove right so taking that leap of faith
everyone should say they're agnostic
because no one has the knowledge but if
you're talking about whether or not you
believe something that's where the word
theist comes in so you can be a theist
and believe in these things or an
atheist and not but agnostic should
apply to everyone hopefully right so you
put these videos out there you start
talking about this stuff when did the
family realize what you were doing those
naughty things that you were doing on
the YouTube oh man
probably a good year and a half into be
doing it it took a little while and I
think it came as a shock because I was
living
in Florida at the time and I decided to
I was very unhappy with my life for a
bunch of different reasons when I
decided to make the move to California
with my very small youtube following and
try to pursue that and I think at that
point they were like wait with your what
yeah and then I had to have that
conversation which was weird which led
to them looking at my videos which
caused some problems yeah so what was
that huh
you know it was just really hard for
them because they took my my positions
and my beliefs or lack thereof as a
personal attack on them like they had
failed somehow and raising me that I
didn't hold on to my faith or that I
thought they were stupid for having it
which wasn't the case I was just talking
about my feelings and why I didn't agree
with certain things and why certain
people who are very religious do things
that I don't
epically agree with and they took that
as an insult to them saying that I think
you're stupid and that's never never the
message I wanted to or want to send how
do you talk about these things without
doing that you know because I think
there's a lot of you know I'm my
audience I think all over the map I you
know in terms of belief and lack of life
and all that I really don't know
actually but I get emails from plenty of
atheists and plenty of Christian
conservatives and Muslims and Jews and
everybody and I find that there's a
certain set of the of the atheist
community that does this thing where
they are making it seem like if you're
not an atheist that you're just an idiot
like oh that all the believers are
idiots yeah how do you avoid that hmm
maybe you don't know that I you know I'm
sure I don't know the time you know it
depends on two things it depends on the
person you know in the video and it
depends on the person watching the video
for me for example when I first started
I was much more angry at things and I
was more along the lines of a person
that you would think is judging you
mm-hmm and I've made an effort over the
years to change that I think I've calmed
down a lot and realized that maybe
aggression isn't the best approach for
these types of things I mean I still do
get fired up about certain things but I
don't attack it as hard as I used to and
I think it also depends on the person
watching because you can choose
to view a person simply asking questions
and get offended like if I if I sit in a
video and I could be as calm and
collected and kind as I want to be and
just be like you know this thing doesn't
make sense to me and I wonder this and I
you know ask this and this and that
question people sometimes get mad at at
even questioning their beliefs and they
take that as a personal attack so if you
can view another person going through
their own you know mental process and of
like figuring things out and sorting out
their own ideas and if you can separate
your views from their views and
understand that this is just their
experience and not take it personally
that's way more effective but some
people some people just take any
disagreement with them even if it's your
own as as an attack on them which is
really sad yeah we seem to be suffering
that in like every part of society right
yeah just everyone you say anything
everyone feels like it's like a personal
attack when it really is that you know
we're all sort of evolving on all sorts
of things that's really the point of
having a human brain I think yeah I mean
no way I mean people do want to live in
an echo chamber but I don't think that's
healthy
yeah I like to surround myself with
people that have different thoughts and
opinions than me because otherwise I
would never grow as a person and over
the years I have changed a lot you you
actually I can't quite explain what I'm
trying to say at the moment but you do
seem a little different to me like you
seem a little more like confident or
something I mean I mean the best sense
like yes I appreciate that yeah I mean
it's been a couple years well I think
what it is is I'm more just I settled
and in my in my beliefs you know I I
don't need necessarily to get angry
about them or you know rant about them
all the time I just kind of know that
that's who I am and I let that kind of
guide my life and sometimes it comes out
in videos and sometimes it doesn't
yeah you get sick of talking about the
atheist stuff hmm sometimes yes and
sometimes though I think what it is is
like you know there's only so many times
in so many different ways you can say
I'm not religious this is a thing I
don't believe right but you know with
you even like you know recently with
with Trump he brings up religion a lot
he talks about the war on Christmas and
it's like there's always always
something coming up yeah
politics that relates to religion yeah
so it's it's very easy for me to
continue talking about it not
necessarily directly in a video being
like I don't believe in God but you can
make a video talking about how religion
is affecting politics in the world in a
certain way that maybe you disagree with
or wish we're different so that's kind
of a way that I can continue talking
about it without driving myself nuts
yeah yeah what do you make it like the
sort of broader skeptic community in
general because there's a lot of
skeptics I don't YouTube yeah and I see
a lot of infighting these days it's so
sad yeah that's so sad because we are so
few a number yeah that the infighting is
you know not productive well what does
that mean - if I say skeptic community
what does that even mean to you well
that's that's another thing I feel like
the skeptic community has changed also a
lot over the years whereas like a couple
of years ago it was very heavily focused
on atheism mm-hmm and now it's social
justice or anti social justice warriors
yeah so that's kind of where the
conversation is shifted and I think that
anything how do you think that happened
cuz I do see a lot of that - it's like
they were always talking about the god
stuff and yeah and all that and then
just in these last couple years and
obviously I talked about a lot here yeah
something did shift where they became
sort of the leaders of the anti SJW
stuff yeah I mean I think it's because
you can be skeptical of more than just
religion and it's a reflection of you
know the society that we're in right now
the super PC culture has kind of
affected us in a way that you know has
caused a backlash I mean you see it even
in like South Park you know like there's
just this this conversation about these
just really ridiculous people who are
just so offended at everything and
you're like walking on eggshells
constantly and it's gotten to the point
where this just victim mentality has
taken over so many people and it's very
frustrating to see happen so I think you
know the skeptic community reacting to
that is just kind of a natural response
to what's going on around us and I think
it's good I think it's I think it's a
good conversation to have but I tend to
stick more with the religion stuff still
yeah I do talk about social justice is
there anything you don't like about the
skeptic community
the infighting that you said that kind
of makes me sad because it can get so
vicious but like if you look at the core
of what a lot of these people believe it
is similar mm-hmm and I kind of wish I'm
so idealistic I wish we could all just
work together for a common good because
honestly there aren't a lot of people
out there asking these questions there
aren't a lot of skeptics a lot of people
just kind of accept things or they don't
think about things at all yeah and you
know I think it's important for people
to be outspoken and I wish there were
more people that were willing to go on
the internet and like face the criticism
that you get with being skeptical of
things and and criticizing things and
thinking you know in ways that might be
offensive to people not caring but you
know the few people that are willing to
do that it's it's a little sad to see
constant fighting yeah do you think some
of the fighting is just the nature of
YouTube I mean we're doing YouTube week
week where I tried to pick people that I
think are doing interesting cool stuff
but there's so much of it where it's
like you know I could love 99% of what
Jaclyn Glenn does but she said one thing
and now I have to make a video about it
and I got to make 20 other people get
angry about it so I can get clicks like
it becomes this sort of self-fulfilling
prophecy or this monster that just keeps
yeah eating itself that is the nature of
YouTube drama gets views yeah so if
there is a controversy somewhere it
it pays literally to indulge in that and
also people do have a hard time
separating like if there is like just
feel like you said if I agree with money
if I agree with 99% of what somebody
says and they say one thing I don't like
I have to hate that person right well
why do you have to hate that person
because of one thing they said that you
don't like just be like okay yeah we're
not the same human that one's the same
is there anyone you agree with a hundred
percent I find the phrase all the time
I'm hearing I don't agree with him a
hundred percent right to me it's the
most idiotic thing ever if I've never
met someone I agree 100 percent
including myself you don't agree with
yourself upon two percent right
sometimes I'm not exactly yeah I change
yeah that's true
yeah no I mean there are people that I

say to imagine yeah to present what do
you mean present by in the moment yeah
in the moment yeah well I'm very in the
moment on Twitter but you know you've
been booted from Twitter yeah oh you
were in that exclusive group oh wait
let's pause for a sec before we go to
that okay I'll try to do a little
research just about your background and
a little you know a little family stuff
and that kind of thing
really I could not you tryna docks me I
was gonna no it's good yeah I'm gonna
have my guys release it while we're
doing that's great
I couldn't find a tremendous amount
about you so give me give me a little
bit about your history and that kind of
thing okay so you want me to start that
you want me to start with my my mom my
dad stuff like that
mom dad sure growing up education that
kind of thing yeah well my dad he he
grew up in a region of India called
Madhya Pradesh and and he grew up in a
town called Jabbar pool and he grew up
with a silver spoon in his mouth he was
a his his father was in his grandfather
actually was in the British Navy he was
a doctor
and he served in the First World War and
the Afghan war and I for the longest
time thought it was the first world war
in the second world war but it's
actually first world war Afghan war and
and yeah he so he is pretty much living
on land that was granted to him by the
by the by by the British yeah and so my
dad had a pretty nice upbringing he went
to British schools English education you
know Catholic education on top of that
like you really just all around my
mother was a national like we're just
gonna skip over my mom my mom grew up in
poverty right so she had to really kind
of climb the ranks and she ended up
becoming a national field hockey coach
in India and yeah yeah she was on her
way to really becoming very very
successful and I don't rub my makeup off
ya know it's really good yeah cuz I mean
I look obvious so it's really it's
quite exactly that's it that's it we did
an I'm just I'm literally just the voice
box for the right here guys the voice
box for the right yes yeah I know I'm so
I mean that might you know my dad came
to Canada
and he you know he got his he got his
degree in computer science I came here
to become a systems analyst and he went
back met my mom brought her here and my
mom actually abandoned all her dreams to
pretty much raised me and my sister so
for the longest time I didn't truly that
didn't click with me and we just I would
say in the last like year year and a
half it really has dawned on me that my
mother sacrificed her entire life to
turn me into the human that I am now
Wow yeah how did you have that moment
with her did she bring it up it wasn't
actually was brought up based on all the
the stuff that I was watching on YouTube
just the this this anti you know like
this whole
just do the anti feminist movement
things like that like things like about
you know how I think one of the things
that really stood out to me was this
this this this fight back against the
traditional woman you know and which i
think is okay I mean I'm cool with women
doing whatever they want to do and they
should they totally should but there's
this there's this beautiful thing about
about a woman that wants to be a mother
a woman that wants to take care of her
kids a woman wants to take care of the
home it just it's so there's so much
value in it right and the amount of
sacrifice that it requires so I got to
really appreciate that about my mom so
yes that and it's kind of funny I mean
without going too deep into feminism
specifically it's kind of funny how this
is flipped right like yeah taking care
of the home and the family and all that
is sort of looked down upon in a weird
way by modern feminism my mom worked
before she had kids then she was a
stay-at-home mom took good care of us
cook meals me after we got to school on
time all of those things was home when
we got home after school and then went
back to work
after when the kids grew up and I think
now that back that like what a cherished
amazing thing that was it is it totally
is and and you know I the the the idea
that I get from a lot of the women that
I interact with is that it's okay it
totally is okay a lot of the stuff that
we talk about is really just present
online it's a lot of these voices online
and because these voices are crazy
they're amplified yeah you know so I
don't get that how do you gauge how much
of its online versus how how much of it
is real before I got into YouTube I was
I'm a fully established person in real
life like I have people I have a network
of people in real life yeah these are
people who I care about these are
friends that I've known for 14 years
like these people who know me way more
than anyone online is ever gonna know me
let me get the straight you exist
outside of I exist outside of the real
friends yeah family and places that you
go and exactly do you eat exactly
incredible I know right isn't it nuts
yeah it's just not so I feel like that
is uh that's a people are a little
contemptuous about that because I
haven't shied away from showing that off
or like being like yeah let's um connect
I know people in real life I was
involved in local politics like that's
the kind of stuff that I kind of try to
do what the hell are we talking about
talking about I know you don't worry
about that let's just keep let's just
keep going here because I think what
we're getting at when we're getting at
best we're I think being part of a full
person is why I like your videos and I
like when you were on Twitter and we're
gonna get to why you're not on Twitter
anymore well I like what you're doing
cuz there's a good mean it's very
obvious now sitting in front of you like
there's just a good nature about you
Thank You sort of like a fullness thank
you and I feel like most people right
now are walking around with like a half
miss you know they're walking around in
this constant state of hating everybody
you're not sure what they think or
they're they're now enemies with family
and friends that two years ago they
weren't yeah and I think what you're
doing is kind of showing people you
could you could smile you can laugh you
can totally smile and laugh yeah cuz I
talk about serious stuff I do I do I I
think that ultimately here's the thing
right I'm privileged right and probably
should be a Canadian alright and and we
don't have the issues that the state of
the states have we really don't we don't
have we you know if a mass shooting were
to happen we were not gonna have people
who are lined up with medical bills that
they can't pay that's something that's
not gonna happen we don't have race
issues to that degree we have a problem
with in terms of how we've treated
Native people in the past but those are
things that where our government is
willing to address or is addressing in a
manner that you know they're addressing
it they're trying to and they're a lot
more empathetic about it right so I have
something I'd like to call you know
Montreal Canadian privilege it's just
something that it's like I grew up in an
environment where it wasn't easy for me
growing up as a kid a brown kid in the
90s but it was I would say a lot easier
for me than it would have been if I was
like in South Chicago South Central LA
or you know Baltimore yeah you know like
I just this it's I have this this I'm
happy because I'm privileged to be happy
yeah it's ultimately yet yeah that's
interesting so you are Sikh which I
think yeah well have no idea I don't
know what he knows about the secret I
know is the Sikhs are inconspicuous like
they're just chillin their chili no need
to push their on anybody I love it
I think well the Sikhs not try to
convert people they I think they
definitely do not try to convert people
they're there to live their lives and I
mean definitely they're down to talk
about it if you want to talk to me like
right now you're but you're talking
about I'll talk to you about it but but
ya know Sikhs and this is a great thing
this is something that nobody talks
about but Sikhs were born out of war
with Islam
and and this was during the Mughal
Empire they were invading India and they
were pretty much converting trying to
get two people to convert or kill them
mm-hmm and nobody wants to talk about
this you know because a lot of people
want to go ahead and say that you know
because it's not nice to say things
about Islam right for some reason you
can say things about Christianity you
could on it all you want
yeah that's it yeah exactly you could
shut up Mormons every was on
Mormons Mormons don't do anything yeah
anyway so anyway so uh so yeah so Sikhs
or Sikhs are interesting because they
were born out of war and and they were
pretty much like almost the first line
of defense against the Muslims when they
were invading and and I'm not saying
like this is this is you know this is
not something that reflects on all
Muslims a hundred percent this is not a
thing that's just it's like I know right
but it but it's people you know I
realized what my culture was that
obviously you know is still around right
Sikhs are still around which means that
at some point they won right and and and
what I've loved about the culture is
that they've been very respectful of
other cultures in the sense that they
are willing to adapt to whatever their
host country is so Sikh Canadians are
very Canadian you know Sikh British
people are very very British you know
and another thing that I find to be
really fascinating is that they don't
have this animosity towards Islam they
don't it's it's very much a very much
religion that from the ground up you're
taught to pretty much be like listen let
bygones be bygones treat things as they
are at the very moment so if something
is happening and you defend yourself
well then you it's fair game yeah but
you know if something happened back in
the day and it's not happening now we're
not gonna hold you hold against you I
don't I don't think about oh my god like
I should be upset at Muslims for what
happened in sixteenth-century yeah you
know that's something else so it goes
back to that be present thing that you
were talking about before right oh yeah
yeah that's is that really why it's so
built-in to you do you think I would say
so I mean listen man I'm telling you
dude I I was not the happiest person for
the longest time um I would say I would
say I would say I spent maybe about like
the last the last
I mean I'm 29 years old I would say I
spent 27 years of my life just being
miserable hmm yeah miserable and I went
through multiple changes for the longest
time I thought I was maybe I want to be
so American so North American so
accepted by by people that I was
becoming someone completely different I
hated the fact that I was brown and and
then eventually that went away and I
realized oh wait wait a minute I'm brown
I don't give a it's great I like my
brown skin I don't give a what's
that like growing up when you're you
know 6 8 15 like what is that how does
that actually come out struggling with
that it was uh I don't know it was weird
it was for me you know one of the things
that I noticed was that was that when I
met other brown people I want to be
friends with them right because I saw
them as allies you know and that's I
think a very normal thing they were like
oh they're brown - I should be friends
with them because they're brown - and
they're like we're in among the sea of
white people but I noticed that a lot of
them would actually kind of like either
want to be they want to be the best
brown person they'd want to be the token
and and that pushed on to me like I want
to be the token as well mm-hmm and I
mean when I was like eight between that
between that period time I would get my
I'll get my ass kicked by this kid
across the street all the time I never
wanted to go outside because any time he
was outside it was gonna be a problem
for me and a lot of it's very like hazy
now because I don't spend too much time
dwelling on my my past in which I was I
felt like a little bit disadvantaged
because it doesn't matter like my past
doesn't matter to that degree
it matters he people love dwelling on
that stuff don't they yeah they love it
sets up the excuse it's literally what
we the reason why we have channels the
reason why we do we do is because people
just spend so much time dwelling on the
past and and I agree the past is
something that needs to be looked at in
reference to regularly you need to look
at the that we did right but it's
it's come to the point now where we're
spelling the password either super proud
of things that you know that have
nothing to do with whatever we just did
right now right or we're just really
pissed off about things that happened to
us back when the people that are alive
today I mean I'm sorry the people that
are alive
have nothing to do with at all and yeah
there's you can go ahead and talk about
how you know like the system is set up
and start such a way and it kind of led
led to this point but like I mean when
you at most of the time when you're
talking to people you're not talking to
a crowd of 1000 people you're talking to
I'm talking to dave rubin right now i'm
not talking to anybody else I mean I
know this bunch of people watching right
now but like we didn't even turn the
cameras on yeah it's okay we just been
talking just been talking that's it we
just it's just it's just you and me yeah
it's the individual level I know they're
like if you if you look at Paul's so you
can look at the individual you have to
look at you'll have to look at
everything you know and that's where
race realists come in and that's where
like all these kind of like these
policies come in right but as human
beings as viewers as content creators we
are not we're not in charge of creating
policies we have to be in charge of
owning our lives and interacting with
people in an authentic way in a way
that's gonna be like you know what I I
you have to care about people I'm not
gonna interact with someone I don't care
about I swear like if there's someone I
look at someone I'm like I don't care
about that person I'm out yeah
if I care about them I'm gonna chill
with them it's just that simple
how did you have that wake up he said 27
years yeah other way what happened I was
trying to be somebody else and then I
realized that myself was good enough and
you know how I realized that it was a it
was I did it ended up dating a girl and
and it was so funny dude just the things
that she would say to me insane like
completely politically incorrect it was
amazing it was incredible was like a
really funny relationship where we just
be able to say whatever the hell we
wanted to each other right and I was
like wait a minute this is what I was
like because back in college I was like
I was like the Van Wilder of my college
I would I stayed around for way too long
yeah I feel way too long I wrote a
column in paper was very politically
incorrect and then at some point I I got
a job at Apple I started becoming very
politically correct I was like you know
what I'm just gonna go say these words
you say these words really really bad or
you and it was very it was political
correctness on a very elementary level
and and then at some point yeah I'm
dating this girl I was like wait a
minute this is the person I need to be
and she really appreciated me for who I
really was cuz I was really myself
around her mmm-hmm I'm gonna burp soon I
apologize you are a decent man you're
giving me a pre apology for a burp yeah
it wouldn't have been necessary yeah
well no it's just so you know it's you I
don't want to burp in front of people
it's like gross you know let me hang out
with Chris Reagan the guy's been burping
all the time he burps a lot he broke up
but you know what it's great it's great
he drinks a lot of Mountain Dew no he
doesn't he doesn't he strikes me as
someone that would dream that I he's on
a mountain Dew guy come on what do you
think of him
really Mountain Dew I kept dealing with
the jump cuts and everything like I'm
not gonna tell you what kind of I'll
tell ya I'll tell you off there what
kind of kind of guys it's actually very
offensive that's really that's really
 up or you say that's really
screwed up man but you accuse me being a
mountain Dew guy what is he of all the
offensive things you know the the PC
ways yeah so pretty cool pretty much
what end up happening was was that I I
just kind of I shed that I became me and
I started I took to Twitter yeah
and Twitter video was an excellent it
was just an excellent way to be me
online something would happen and I
would record a video I'm telling you
dude like the amount of time it my
videos Michael fer that's pretty much
the amount of time it took me to record
that video I just turned it on start
saying something probably laughs because
[Music]
as I'm taping this right now there is a
massive wildfire burning about 70 miles
north of here in Ventura County as of
just a couple minutes ago it had already
burned over 50 thousand acres and over
30,000 homes have been evacuated I'm
sure by the time you see this those
numbers are gonna go up significantly
here in Los Angeles there's soot flying
around all over the place and there's a
dark gray haze and deep smell of smoke I
just walked my dog for literally two
minutes two minutes and not only
couldn't I see all the way down to the
end of the block because of the smoke
but my clothes absolutely stink right
now we just finished up our interview
for this week with Jessica Flanagan from
the University of Richmond and although
we never edit for content on this show
we actually are probably going to edit
out a couple coughs and hacks as the air
quality in the studio is pretty bad
right now
ironically our interview had a lot to do
with Public Health so stay tuned for
that I don't mention any of this for
pity for me dealing with some soot and
some smoke today as much as how things
can be put into perspective pretty
quickly of course a quick perusal of
Twitter allowed me to see people saying
California's burning because of its
leftist sins and others saying it's
burning because of global warming and
lack of regulation yes even natural
disasters are political these days as
we're in the midst of the holiday season
perhaps let's try to be a little less
political as we run out 2017 the spirit
of the season is about joy and giving
not fighting and bickering yet
unfortunately it seems we do the latter
too a lot more often than the former to
these days the people being affected far
worse than me by these fires are on the
left and on the right they're pro-choice
and they're pro-life they're black and
they're white and they're Christian and
they're atheist it's not just good ideas
that can bring us together but also bad
events so let's not make them worse with
an extra helping of hate I'm gonna try
to be a little less partisan a little
more open and a little less political as
the year comes to an end I think I do a
pretty decent job of being fair and
open-minded in general but a touch more
of those traits never hurt especially
around holiday time politics is
important but it isn't more
port and then finding some room in your
life to be grateful to be decent and to
be tolerant my challenge if you're up
for it is to perhaps try being a little
more tolerant yourself in the spirit of
the season I know that your intellectual
opponents and sometimes even friends and
family members often won't make it easy
but I think it'll be worth the effort as
we wind down this crazy year whether we
like it or not we're in this thing
together and perhaps putting out some
brush fires now will spare us from some
major fires in the future
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty this week and joining me
today is an assistant professor of
philosophy politics economics and law at
the Jepson school of leadership studies
at the university of richmond jessica
flanagan welcome to the Rubin report hi
how are ya do it well yeah let's learn
some Liberty it's kind of funny we're
gonna talk about a whole slew of things
here but medical ethics are involved and
act them as we are taping this at this
very moment there is a massive wildfire
about 45 minutes from here the smoke and
soot outside right now that's even
seeping into the studio at the moment I
was just sneezing right before we
started I can feel it in my lungs are
you are you feeling it at all yeah no
it's pretty intense out there yeah you
were you were gonna walk here from the
hotel which is only about four blocks
away and you were like no yeah I bailed
so there's something about medical
ethics or something with smoke and fire
or as you said right before sorry maybe
that's more environmental ethics perhaps
yeah I don't know what it is out there
but yeah it's a lot it's alright alright
so we're gonna talk all sorts of things
but let's start with medical ethics we
talk a lot about health care in America
and there's this sort of endless crazy
debate about Obamacare and Trump care
and Olson single-payer and all the buzz
words and phrases what do you think
we're really missing when it comes to
the general health care debate or what
do you think of the tenor of the health
care debate in general I think a lot of
what people focus on in the health care
debate is with regards to access with
health insurance like how
insurance we have single-payer a
free-market healthcare and I think
that's an important debate and that's
been the focus of a lot of political
philosophy and a lot of political
conversation about health care but one
thing I think we overlooked our kind of
clinical ethics like the ethics of what
happens and within that clinical context
within the system setting aside who pays
for it how we pay for it
things like pharmaceutical regulation
drug policy public health issues so I
think that a lot of times people will
sort of think about public health more
in an instrumental way of like how do we
promote the public health like what's
going to save lives and balance in terms
of public health policy but not asking
the broader question of should we be
involved in thinking about public health
as the kind of thing that public
officials should be promoting so those
are some things I think are overlooked
so things like regulation public health
ethics criminal justice and at health
like how those two areas of policy
intersect and the clinical context
informed consent and self medication
things like that things that happen in
the doctor's office yeah so I want to
dive into - all of those things for sure
so in terms of just the the general idea
of healthcare are you for having the
government have people buy into the
exchanges and all that one thing to say
about the United States system is like
here's like a place for like everybody
can totally agree like this is not the
ideal system I think you might not a
good system yeah whatever your favorite
system is I think this is like like a
non-ideal non-ideal solution yeah it's
like very robustly bad is there a system
that you look at elsewhere and say
they're they're really doing it right I
mean not really I think that a lot of
other systems have advantages and
disadvantages that we could learn from I
think that it's sort of a weird
historical accident that we have this
crazy Rube Goldberg of the health care
we have here I think that Australia may
be on the right track and having like a
kind of basic minimum but then like
markets on top although I don't my
impression is that they don't really
do like drugs the way that I would like
with respect to allowing more price
competition in pharmaceuticals but I
kind of favor a more market-based
approach is my own view but again
because we have a global marketplace
like the markets themselves are like not
ever going to be necessarily what like
your ideal of a market would be for
health care um but so you the first
question you asked was like should the
government be requiring people to buy
health insurance yeah I don't think that
they should I think that how having
health insurance fits into you know a
person's values isn't really a choice
that a public officials like well-placed
to make for everybody it might be the
case that you know people don't benefit
dollar per dollar for health insurance
as much as they do for just having the
money and so I think like a good
benchmark for like is this a good policy
is would a person benefit more if you
just gave them the money instead of like
spending the money on them or requiring
them to spend the money on a certain
things from their own money on a certain
thing I also have written elsewhere
about so that's like about individual
mandates or individual requirements to
pay into health care systems
mmm in particular I've also written
elsewhere about like employer mandates
so should employers be required to pay
for health insurance if they're they
have more than 50 employees for the
employees I don't think so
where does the 50 number come from I
think that's just in the Affordable Care
Act it's like it was I don't know how it
being implemented now but it was about
the time that I wrote that paper about
it right so the implication being that
if you're if you're that big at that
point then it's something that the
government should handle know that then
they could mandate that employers
provide health insurance over 50 yeah
employers and I think one thing I think
is that freedom of contract is an
important freedom and I think that when
the government says oh you and I we
could negotiate a contract but the
contract has to contain certain terms
like a certain wage or a certain
provision of benefits I think that would
violate individual people's freedoms of
contract and so I think people should be
able to make
agreements under whatever terms they
want for the most part and so the
requirement that the government could
say like well you have to pay people in
health insurance and that bad
requirement would fall on people who are
employing people who are already
benefiting them much more than any other
random people in the community are
benefiting there these employees I think
that that would be a violation of
Fremont contract so yeah I'm sort of
against both yes I have my gets them
individual and employer based mandates
because I think that we should trust
people to decide what in the cotton and
their contracts are in their personal
spending choices are best for them yeah
so in a weird way as at least a one-time
Obama voter right you voted for Obama at
least one yeah yeah that sort of puts
you a little bit at odds with Obama care
though
or not a little bit that kind of really
puts you at odds with Obama care
ya know yeah so is that something you
really struggled with as you were voting
for him cuz right I mean that's really
the landmark piece of legislation right
I mean that's that's the thing that
he'll most likely be remembered for the
most yeah I think you know why do people
vote the way they do I mean a lot of
reasons but no I disagree with the
Affordable Care Act right yeah so did
you make any sense of when they were
trying to pass Trump care or whatever
his version of did you know or now even
they're scaling back little bits of it
or they're defunding parts of it it's
hard to pay attention or not even pay
attention it's hard to track actually
what the real world resolution is with
this stuff did did you see any goodness
in any of that that they were scaling
back some of it I mean who's changing
like every week it wasn't hard to even
keep up when that was that health care
debate was happening my impression was
that it was worse for people in that it
like didn't really solve the fundamental
objections people had to the Affordable
Care Act but then it created other
problems in the markets and the
exchanges but so what so what are you
doing cases of if you let it completely
free market and you didn't have
companies have to do anything under 50
over 50 whatever it is what do you do
for all the people that will just be
left behind
all the people that were just going
we're either just flat-out dying because
they weren't seeing a doctor or the
people that were then going to emergency
rooms which we know the costs of doing
that are actually way higher than if
they had had you know care when when
they should have what's the free-market
sort of answer to that yeah it depends
on whether or not so oftentimes people
will say health care is a right and what
do you mean by that Bernie says another
thing right I believe it what do you
mean by right so you might think that a
right is always enforceable if somebody
has a right to something then they have
right against other people to provide it
to be clear you don't think it's a right
I don't think right well I just think it
depends on what you mean by right right
but I mean I don't
all right I mean we have the right to
life liberty the pursuit of happiness
really the right the Bill of Rights yeah
I don't think there's anything in there
that says you have the right to health
care certainly not an enforceable right
right that other people provide you with
it I'm skeptical of that claim and so
what would it mean for there to be an
enforceable right to health care what
would it mean for their beauty right
that you had to claim that another
person provide it with you well it means
that you could use the enforcement power
of the state public officials could use
their enforcement power to compel other
people to provide their compete reott
swith health care and then my question
about that is why health care like why
is the thing that people are required to
be providing their compatriots health
care and not something like a basic
income which I do support income or or
they could kind of decide how to
allocate their resources themselves in
accordance with our own value or
providing people with something like a
basic standard of well-being and then
like if you one until I provide people
with a you know set standard of
well-being a set of opportunities and
health outcomes it's not clear that like
having them buy health insurance or have
health insurance would be the thing that
would promote that mmm-hmm so it does
not even seem like health care is there
it's like health insurance is the thing
that people are saying is their right
and so in order to establish that
there's an enforceable right for the
public officials to compel people to
fellow citizens to provide other people
with health insurance it would have to
be that health insurance in particular
was this thing that was so important
like human autonomy flourishing and
well-being that it could warrant like
coercively you compelling people to
provide it now once we have that as our
bar like it was like this is the bar
like I think a lot of other things we
clear such a bar before health insurance
would I think it look like why for
example well a basic income for one I
think that like having some kind of
floor of material security we pry it so
basically once you've said this is a
right that we should have there's a
whole bunch of other things that using
that standard you think would be on the
list before health insurance right and
so if you think that there's an
enforceable right that people should
have health care you'd have to explain
in virtue of what do other people make
themselves liable to be coerced by the
government in order to provide their
fellow citizens with that right mm-hmm
in virtue of what value and whatever
value that is I would worry but there's
like a lot of other stuff we do putting
on the list before health insurance yeah
if they're also like a part of it that
it almost hardly sets people up against
each other in a weird way so if you take
good care of yourself and you exercise
and you eat right and you pay into the
system and you're healthy but then you
know you go to the supermarket and you
see someone buying a ton of soda and
eating horrible foods that's overweight
never exercising but you know that
they're going to be more of a strain on
the system than you and you're basically
paying for them you know and so it's
sort of it would make you sort of almost
angry at people for not taking care of
themselves because they there then
expending the resources that you're
putting into the system because you're
living better so to speak I do think
that there is sort of a link between
support for like kind of spreading
across the house of health care and
support for public health paternalism I
think that and I think that is the link
which is that people think that if
they're paying taxes to support programs
that are going to provide health care
for people that that gives them and
or a stake in the health of other people
right but then think it through so say
that you do think that health care or
health insurance is an enforceable right
then everybody has a right to it no
matter what
mm-hmm then people don't make themselves
preemptively liable to have their other
liberties limited on the grounds that in
virtue of their choices or permissible
choices they're gonna make it more
expensive to enforce those rights so by
that I just mean like say that you're a
person that just wants to eat like
Doritos and coca-cola all day which is
delicious
why do you college I'd be sympathetic I
do that you know and then people say
well like no you can't just do that or
you can't smoke cigarettes because if
you do then we're all gonna have to pay
for it well then you might say like oh
wait a minute
like who cares like you have an
obligation in virtue of my enforceable
right to pay for it anyhow and so like
you don't get to tell me what to do just
because subsequently you're going to
have to give me what I'm owed which is
high health care if you owe me $50 and
you don't like how I'm gonna spend the
$50 you don't get to write you know tell
me to change my behavior before you give
me the $50 I just think it could it's
not an enforceable concept but it's just
I think it would just cause resentment I
think in general like if you're just
like I don't I don't expend a lot from
the system I don't take a lot from the
system and here are other people that do
it's just sort of human nature I think
to resent like yeah just sort of resent
it yeah yeah yeah maybe I mean I don't
think that they should if they really
think that they have a duty to provide
it right well I don't know that people
really think it through all the way and
maybe a certain amount of people don't
think they have a duty to provide yeah
don't think I would do provide it their
issue isn't with the people eating
Doritos and smoking cigarettes their
issue is with being forced to provide at
other people with health insurances you
know a different gripe so either way you
don't have any kind of grounds to
present or to want to limit the freedom
of the people who just want to smoke
cigarettes named Doritos because like
which I feel like I'm like hating under
readers it's not maybe it's about to
read
everybody loves the Cool Ranch yeah
right but so I feel like you know if
you're a person who thinks health care
is a right then you have no grounds to
want to limit the choices to those
people because you buy your own lights
think that you have a duty to provide
them a health care whatever their choice
is all right and if you're you know
irritated by people making public you
know making choices that could be
prevented with public health paternalism
that you disapprove of on the grounds
that you don't want to pay for their
health insurance then what's doing the
work is really just that you don't want
to pay for their health insurance and so
then you also don't have any real beef
with people making bad health decisions
[Music]
you're a proponent of effective altruism
that sounds pretty good what is
effective altruism
so Peter Singer is known for as a
repellent of this and I really admire
Peter Singer I think that he's pretty
persuasive on this which is that though
I'm not a utilitarian and I don't agree
with him on a lot of other things I do
think that he's right that a lot of
people who are in rich countries have
the capacity to do an extraordinary
amount of good by donating to effective
charities and that is morally good if
they do and so the idea of effective
altruism has two parts the first is the
all tourism part that comes first which
is that it's morally good to give uh a
morally good if you're fortunate enough
to be able to to give and what they
recommend is ten percent of your income
and then if you are going to give once
you're like onboard with a view that
it's morally good to give to people to
you know promote well-being to promote
people's health well why why what where
should we be giving who should we give
to and you should give to the place
where your donation can do the most good
and so charities that I favor as an
effective ultra star the against malaria
foundation which mostly focuses on bed
nets mmm-hmm bed net distribution and
give directly which is cash transfers to
poor families in Kenya and Uganda yeah
how do you figure out who's using the
money properly you know you always hear
a story every now and again of
nonprofits that you think you're giving
all this money to them and that they're
gonna you know clean water or whatever
it is but then later you find out like
eighty percent of the money goes to
administrative costs or for them to
throw parties fundraisers to just get
more money to throw more parties or that
there's a great website give all calm
and give well has a team of researchers
but to try to evaluate which charities
they think are going to be the most
effective and they recommend both give
directly on the against malaria
foundation one nice thing about give
directly is that cash transfers are
pretty easy to administer you can just
do it over
mobile bank transfers and the give
directly team has a lot of people who do
really good follow-up to see what the
effects are so they can see kind of the
randomly assigned villages to get the
transfers and then they can see the
effect of having the trance cash
transfers as a poverty anti-poverty
intervention and it does look like cash
is like a very effective anti-poverty
intervention yeah is this also in effect
an argument for lowering taxes in
general that if people had more money in
their pocket perhaps 10% more they could
give 10% more to things that they really
cared about I think that there are lots
of good reasons to hurt absence because
I think that currently like some of what
the government does with taxes is like
not great you know for example or very
against war I don't know that this is
the best argument for that but that
generally if you had more money in your
pocket you might be willing to give more
money to causes that you really care
about I think people should be willing
to give to causes that they care about
whatever their tax rate is um and I
think that people should care about
causes that do the most good dollar for
dollar yeah so you're also writing a
book on sex worked yeah it's a foreign
against that wasn't a great segue yeah
yeah it's a foreign against book so it's
I'm the for decriminalization man and
I'm writing with a co-author Laurie
Watson and she's against
decriminalization yeah so what's the
argument against it at this point I mean
this is another place that I go very
much to the libertarian side which is
that if a woman a woman or a man or
whatever wants to take control they're
alive and be a prostitute or be involved
in sex work and it's an even exchange
they're doing something for money I have
no problem with any of this alright
coolest person I need to come there you
go alright I'm with you on this one so
who am i arguing again yeah there's a
lot of people so some people have a view
of like sort of sexual moralism that you
know there's certain norms that should
govern people's sexual choices that's
like a kind of more traditionalist
view I think that people who hold that
view aren't entitled to use the
government as a means to force everybody
else to live in accordance with it
there's a feminist argument people worry
that having sex work especially
pornography but sex work more generally
will contribute to the subordination and
objectification of all women by
promoting sexist ideas of female
subordination or views of women as
objects but to be clear sex work isn't
only about women I mean their planning
involved etcetera yeah but feminists
focus on the detrimental effects of the
sex industry for women as a whole right
often their arguments about occupational
health and safety related to the dangers
associated with the profession I don't
think that the profession is more
dangerous and being a commercial
fisherman right and aren't there studies
that show that like in in Amsterdam for
example that you know the women that are
involved in sex work are in unions and
that they've been able to bargain for a
better health care and things like that
to be sure I think about our ideal
that's policy that I favor is out of New
Zealand where it's just treated like all
other kinds of work but of course if
you're concerned about the risks the
occupational health and safety risks of
sex work you should be concerned by
black markets as well equally and black
markets are more dangerous so yeah
there's a kind of kind of traditionalist
argument there's a feminist argument
there's a kind of a labor argument a lot
of people worry that it's exploitative
by that they mean that if a person makes
a decision without having any acceptable
alternatives then though the decisions
not coerced it's not sufficiently
voluntary to merit respect mm-hmm
I think that that could apply to a lot
of work a lot of low-wage work
especially people only choose to take
those jobs at the waves the daheia
because they lack acceptable
alternatives I think that we should
therefore favor a basic income so I do
think that it's a problem that people
only choose certain types of jobs or to
work at all because they lack acceptable
alternatives and I can talk more about
why here a basic income yeah but I also
think that you know if you don't favor
basic income the voluntariness concerns
don't more in prohibition of sex works
if the problem is that people who are
choosing to work in an industry only
choose because they have very few
options I don't think that an acceptable
solution to that is to just
straightforwardly prohibit the few
options that they do have this parallels
arguments in international global
justice about sweatshops where it's like
like only choose to work in sweatshops
because they lack acceptable
alternatives I don't think the solution
would be to ban spot shops or to even
enforce regulations that would lead
sweatshops to go to another place right
then half the people screaming about it
or holding you know have iPhones in
their pockets you know yeah right I mean
it's just a fact and I think that you
know when people are concerned about
these types of labor issues sex work
sweatshops they are genuinely concerned
for the workers like I don't think that
there's a sort of bad faith there but I
would press those people to say like
well what is the alternative that goes
along with the bad I mean it's very easy
to say I don't approve of this
circumstance but I'm like what is your
solution you know I mean yeah like I
favorite basic income - but like the
only failing a basic income I don't
think that further eliminating the
options of people who are already
suffering for lack of options helps them
yeah so what would a basic income look
like to you I've done correctly well I
don't take a big stand on like how much
it should be why do I favor a basic
income you might think like oh you're
libertarian broadly like why have the
government redistribution pupils income
and that's what you were saying like oh
I'm against like a high tax it's like I
don't really have too much of opinion on
how high taxes would be necessarily per
se or like but I have more of an opinion
on what they spend it on um
public officials spend it on yeah well I
do agree it's mostly about spending and
I've got to cut the spending down and
then the government would just need to
take less from you if it would stop
overreaching on what it thinks it's
supposed to do yeah and so like I'm
against a lot of what public officials
spend the money that they tax people on
but taxes in particular I'm a little bit
more ambivalent about I mean I kind of
think given the political institutions
we have right now like no we should
we should oppose a kind of raising money
to go to war I mean that that's that'd
be bad because I think war is bad but
should we be in principle opposed to
taxes per se that's a little bit more
complicated so say that you're a broadly
kind of libertarian person a lot of
people will say that means that you know
nobody should violate another person's
natural rights but do people have
natural rights to not just their bodies
but external objects property out in the
world so one of my favorite philosophers
Michael humor kind of like an
anarcho-capitalist and he's like well at
least some stuff out in the world if you
build a hut like in the woods and like
you live there someone can't just like
roll in and like knock it down like you
have a natural property to that but some
other property rights are going to be
conventional some property rights are
going to exceed whatever natural rights
we have so like money that's a good
example that's a very conventional
system so now you have a government and
the government says okay here's the
property system that we're going to
enforce well one thing that property
system should do is it should respect
everybody's natural property rights and
natural rights to their own bodies
whatever that is mm-hmm but then the
government goes further and they're like
and also we're gonna enforce all of
these property conventions and we're
gonna use the coercive power of this
government that nobody consented to like
none of us signed up right to enforce
these kind of property conventions and
the thing about these property
conventions let's call them capitalism
is that they're gonna make people
generally better off but they're gonna
pick winners and losers are gonna make
some people worse off some people really
really badly off some people
fantastically well off so we have the
government that's enforcing you know
protections for people's natural rights
but also establishing these property
conventions how are the property
conventions enforced oh the property
conventions are enforced in part with
violence with coercion which is a threat
of violence against people's natural
rights their rights against being
threatened with violence and so I don't
think that you know I feeI don't favor
basic income as in like I deal with
theoretic solution I think ideally no
violence against anybody without their
consent but given that we have
governments which are using violence to
enforce laws and property conventions
against everybody without their consent
a basic income is a way of compensating
people for that injustice for the
injustice of the enforcement of a
coercive property system that forces
conventions which the enforcement of
which requires violating people's basic
rights yeah it's interesting cuz I've
heard a couple of different libertarian
arguments for basic income and on its
head if you were just looking at it you
would think that just makes no sense and
yet I I completely understand what
you're saying there
what is the inherent problem though that
once you set this income and I'm not
asking you for the number you're giving
everybody but once you set this that
just the way economics works I mean
you're just gonna increase the cost of
everything else for everybody right so
they've seen basic income studies and I
mean the evidence this week of course
like there's not been like a full-scale
like great you know ideal basic income
and forest but they're giving you a
basic water level thank you how are we
talked to death um but they're all still
be incentives to work and there will
still be positional goods and positional
advantages all of these that can come
sure do I think is give people the
freedom not to participate in the labor
economy right if they don't want to I
guess the thing that I struggle with is
that once you said it that you will
always have politicians coming in that
want more votes from the people that are
getting it and they're just always gonna
say raise it raise it raise it and that
every year that goes by we're just going
to raise it and raise it and raise it
and that will raise the cost of
everything else like if that to me is
the human part of it yeah that I
struggle with that it's just nature
every politician is gonna be like well
if I look at my district we have a lot
of people on it let's raise it I want
more votes yeah and so I don't think
that the basic income and this is true
of basic income advocates across the
political spectrum very few will ever
say the basic can compete should be
raised so high that it depresses the
total pie you know so like you wouldn't
like the basic game to be as high as it
can up until the point that it doesn't
you know swing over each in the other
direction right but is that just not the
way politics works I think
that's sort of what is the problem that
I get you I'm with you no I mean like I
completely understand that but just the
nature of the political system you're
gonna give them this this power to do
this and then always they will raise it
and whatever that threshold is that
you're talking about of course they're
gonna run over that yeah but that's
going to be true of whatever your kind
of political ideals are is that you're
always going to be have to have a
concern about these sorts of public
choice worries or like moral incentives
that are gonna cloud people's vision I'm
interested in like what does justice
require like what's the truth about what
justice requires and I think that a
mistake that libertarians often make is
that they they're sort of like question
begging and their arguments for having
property rights will just be like people
have rights to their property rights
without explaining why would where those
property rights came from and I think
that what justice requires does include
a respect for certain kinds of property
rights whatever the kind of natural
rights are but that often times the
enforcement of a property system far
exceeds that and so as a matter of
justice the basic income could be a form
of compensation for that initial
injustice so that's a very in principle
argument you're kind of asking like oh
but like in practice what did that like
right I'm just giving you the rubber
meets the road one like I get it at the
philosophical level for sure but then so
you might think like what's the point of
what's the point of this defense the
basic income it's like in practice it
wouldn't mm-hmm but you always have to
have some kind of ideals about what you
think is true about justice just to
ground like what are your kind of North
Stars for like what policies you
advocate for now and so like where the
rubber meets the road you might think
like is well now given that we have this
view how do we assess existing policies
here's one way to think about this being
informative think about cash transfers
as benchmarks for any kind of assistance
program so like I think that cash is a
more respectful way to help people
because it respects their authority to
decide how best to help themselves or
how to make choices that reflect their
own values and so you know whatever
intervention public officials want to
enforce on behalf of people in order to
help them out let's just hold it up to a
benchmark up
person benchmark of like how people
could have used used that money
individually if you just like sent them
that money as a check and like I think
that some programs will probably beat
that benchmark but just thinking in
terms of using a cash transfer as a
benchmark for evaluating the justice of
different things that public officials
use redistribute of Taxation to do
that's like one practical implication of
thinking about a basic income is being
required by justice yeah it's
interesting all right I want to finish
strong on critical thinking cuz it's a
phrase that I mention often on this show
that I think if we're lacking one thing
in this country more than any of those
it's critical thing and the ability to
think clearly look at a problem
understand your intellectual opponents
argument as opposed to just what you
think their argument is not impugn
everyone's motives I mean that's
basically what I've tried to do on the
show consistently for a couple of years
right now do you think we're like a
critical thinking disaster moment right
now like we don't see it we don't like
it just in the public course like well I
think in the public discourse maybe not
when you're with a lot of academics that
you're spending time with but I think
the general public discourse is really
lacks critical thinking it's like we've
picked our sides we're yelling at each
other all the time we're demonizing
constantly all of that we're not
thinking about issues really clearly and
critically more so than in the past do
you think I think partly the Internet
has has caused this you know the Twitter
a'f occation basically of everything and
the short way we think about things and
we go from one crisis to the next crisis
/ outraged about something one day and
then we forget about it the next day you
know even if you look at the the
shooting in Las Vegas it's about two
months ago you know I think 58 people
dead it seems like there's almost no
information about it like we just let it
go we just forget things which i think
is a part of critical thinking like we
just don't look at things sort of
holistically and and try to figure out
what really is true yeah I mean you
might fall into like a sort of
availability bias where like you see
people on the internet shouting at each
other and being
and make people kind of acting in bad
faith or be critical you're like oof
critical thinking worse than ever
then like look at the past where which I
think like the past was by and large was
a terrible place yeah yeah I'm not
saying it's worse than ever there's
something about it that fuels perhaps
because of the internet worse but
generally I just don't think we're in a
good state right now the critical
thinking but I mean what's your
counterfactual I mean cuz like like when
was it better yeah
and though you might look at the
internet now I would guess he would I
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty this week and joining me
today is an assistant professor of
philosophy politics economics and law at
the Jepson school of leadership studies
at the university of richmond jessica
flanagan welcome to the Rubin report hi
how are you doing well yeah let's learn
the Liberty it's kind of funny we're
gonna talk about a whole slew of things
here but medical ethics are involved and
at them as we are taping this at this
very moment there is a massive wildfire
about 45 minutes from the smoke and soot
outside right now that's even seeping
into the studio at the moment I was just
sneezing right before we started I can
feel it in my lungs are you feeling it
at all yeah no it's pretty intense out
there yeah you were you were gonna walk
here from the hotel which is only about
four blocks away and you were like no
yeah I bailed so there's something about
medical ethics or something with smoke
and fire or as you said right before you
serve maybe that's more environmental
ethics perhaps yeah I don't know what it
is out there but yeah it's a lot it's
alright alright so we're gonna talk all
sorts of things but let's start with
medical ethics we talk a lot about
health care in America and there's this
sort of endless crazy debate about Obama
care and Trump care and all single-payer
and all the buzz words and phrases what
do you think we're really missing when
it comes to the general health care
debate or what do you think of the tenor
of the health care debate in general I
think a lot of what people focus on in
the health care debate is with regards
to access with health insurance like
health insurance we have single-payer
with free market healthcare and I think
that's an important debate and that's
been the focus of a lot of political
philosophy and a lot of political
conversation about health care but one
thing I think we overlooked our kind of
clinical ethics like the ethics of what
happens and within that clinical context
within the system setting aside who pays
for it how we pay for it
things like pharmaceutical regulation
drug policy public health issues so I
think that a lot of times people will
sort of
think about Public Health more in an
instrumental way of like how do we
promote the public health like what's
gonna save lives and balance in terms of
Public Health policy but not asking the
broader question of should we be
involved in thinking about public health
as the kind of thing that public
officials should be promoting so those
are some things I think are overlooked
so things like regulation public health
ethics criminal justice and health like
how those two areas of policy intersect
and the clinical context informed
consent and self medication things like
that things that happen in the doctor's
office yeah so I want to dive into all
of those things for sure so in terms of
just the the general idea of healthcare
are you for having the government have
people buy into the exchanges and all
that one thing to say about the United
States system is like here's like a
place where like everybody can totally
agree like this is not the ideal system
I think you might add but this is not a
good system yeah whatever your favorite
system is I think this is like like a
non-ideal non-ideal solution yeah like
very robustly but is there a system that
you look at elsewhere and say there
they're really doing it right I mean not
really I think that a lot of other
systems have advantages and
disadvantages that we could learn from I
think that it's sort of a weird
historical accident that we have this
crazy Rube Goldberg of a health care we
have here I think that Australia may be
on the right track and having like a
kind of basic minimum but then like
markets on top although I don't my
impression is that they don't really do
like drugs the way that I would like
with respect to allowing more price
competition in pharmaceuticals but I
kind of favor a more market-based
approach is my own view um but again
because we have a global marketplace
like the markets themselves are like not
ever gonna be necessarily what like your
ideal of a market would be for
healthcare yeah but so you the first
question you asked was like should the
maybe requiring people to buy health
insurance yeah I don't think that they
should I think that how having health
insurance fits into you know a person's
values isn't really a choice that a
public officials like well-placed to
make for everybody it might be the case
that you know people don't benefit
dollar per dollar for health insurance
as much as they do for just having the
money and so I think like a good
benchmark for like is this a good policy
is would a person benefit more if you
just gave them the money instead of like
spending the money on them or requiring
them to spend the money on a certain
things from their own money on a certain
thing I also have written elsewhere
about so that's like about individual
mandates or individual requirements to
pay into health care systems
mmm in particular I've also written
elsewhere about like employer mandates
so should employers be required to pay
for health insurance if they're if they
have more than 50 employees for the
employees I don't think so
where does the 50 number come from I
think that's just in the Affordable Care
Act it's like it was at the I don't know
how it being implemented now but it was
about the time that I wrote that paper
about it right so the implication being
that if you're if you're that big at
that point then it's something that the
government should handle
know that then they could mandate that
employers provide health insurance to
that older 50 yeah larger employers and
I think well one thing I think is that
freedom of contract is an important
freedom and I think that when the
government says oh you and I we could
negotiate a contract but the contract
has to contain certain terms like a
certain wage or a certain provision of
benefits I think that would violate
individual people's freedoms of contract
and so I think people should be able to
make labor agreements under whatever
terms they want for the most part and so
the requirement that the government
could say like well you have to pay
people in health insurance and that bad
requirement would fall on people who are
employing people who are already
benefiting them much more than any other
random people in the community are
benefiting there these employees I think
that that would be a violation of
Fremont contract so yeah I'm sort of
against both yes I am against the
individual and employer base mandates
because I think that we should trust
people to decide
what in the cut and their contracts are
in their personal spending choices are
best for them yeah so in a weird way as
as at least a one-time Obama voter right
you voted for Obama at least one yeah
yeah that sort of puts you a little bit
at odds with Obamacare though we're not
a little bit that kind of really puts
you at odds with Obamacare yeah no yeah
so is that something you really
struggled with as you were voting for
him
cuz right I mean that's really the
landmark piece of legislation right I
mean that's yeah that's the thing that
he'll most likely be remembered for the
most yeah I think you know why do people
vote the way they do I mean a lot of
reasons but no I disagree with the
Affordable Care Act right yeah so did
you make any sense of when they were
trying to pass Trump care or whatever
his version of did you know or now even
they're scaling back little bits of it
or they're defunding parts of it it's
hard to pay attention or not even pay
attention it's hard to track actually
what the real world resolution is with
this stuff did did you see any goodness
in any of that that they were scaling
back some of it I mean who's changing
like every week it wasn't hard to even
keep up when that was that health care
debate was happening my impression was
that it was worse for people in that it
like didn't really solve the fundamental
objections people had to the Affordable
Care Act but then it created other
problems in the markets and the
exchanges but so what so what are you
doing cases of if you let it completely
free market and you didn't have
companies have to do anything under 50
over 50 whatever it is what do you do
for all the people that will just be
left behind I mean all the people that
were just going we're either just
flat-out dying because they weren't
seeing a doctor yeah or the people that
were then going to emergency rooms which
we know the costs of doing that are
actually way higher than if they had had
you know care when when they should have
what's the free-market sort of answer to
that yeah it depends on whether or not
so oftentimes people will say health
care is our right and what do you mean
by that Bernie says another thing do you
think a right is all right I believe it
what do you mean by right so you might
think that
a right is always enforceable if
somebody has a right to something then
they have a right against other people
to provide it to be clear you don't
think it's a right I don't think right
well I just think it depends on what you
mean by right right but I mean I don't
write I mean we have the right to life
liberty the pursuit of happiness really
the right the Bill of Rights yeah I
don't think there's anything in there
that says you have the right to health
care certainly not an enforceable right
right that other people provide you with
it I'm skeptical of that claim and so
what would it mean for there to be an
enforceable right to health care what
would it mean for their beauty right
that you had to claim that another
person provide it with you well it means
that you could use the enforcement power
of the state public officials could use
their enforcement power to compel other
people to provide their compete reott
swith health care and then my question
about that is why health care like why
is the thing that people are required to
be providing their compatriots health
care and not something like a basic
income which I do support income or they
could kind of decide how to allocate
their resources themselves in accordance
with our own value or providing people
with something like a basic standard of
well-being and then like if you won
until I provide people with a you know
set standard of well-being a set of
opportunities and health outcomes it's
not clear that like having them buy
health insurance or have health
insurance would be the thing that would
promote that mmm-hmm so it doesn't even
seem like health care is there it's like
health insurance is the thing that
people are saying is they're right and
so in order to establish that there's an
enforceable right for the public
officials to compel people to fellow
citizens to provide other people with
health insurance it would have to be
that health insurance in particular was
this thing that was so important for
like human autonomy flourishing and
well-being that it could warrant like
coercively you compelling people to
provide it now once we have that as our
bar like it was like this is the bar
like I think a lot of other things we
clear such a bar before health insurance
would I think it look like why for
example well a basic income for one I
think that like having some kind of
floor of material security we probably
so basically once you've said this is
right that we should have there's a
whole bunch of other things that using
that standard you think would be on the
list before health insurance right and
so if you think that there's an
enforceable right that people should
have health care you'd have to explain
in virtue of what do other people make
themselves liable to be coerced by the
government in order to provide their
fellow citizens with that right mm-hmm
in virtue of what value and whatever
value that is I would worry that there's
like a lot of other stuff we do putting
on the list before health insurance yeah
if they're also like a part of it that
it almost oddly sets people up against
each other in a weird way so if you take
good care of yourself and you exercise
and you eat right and you pay into the
system and you're healthy but then you
know you go to the supermarket and you
see someone buying a ton of soda and
eating horrible foods that's overweight
never exercising but you know that
they're gonna be more of a strain on the
system than you and you're basically
paying for them you know and so it's
sort of it would make you sort of almost
angry at people for not taking care of
themselves because they there then
expending the resources that you're
putting into the system because you're
living better so to speak I do think
that there is sort of a link between
support for like kind of spreading
across the house of health care and
support for public health to turn ilysm
I think that and I think that is the
link which is that people think that if
they're paying taxes to support programs
that are going to provide health care
for people then that gives them an
entitlement or a stake in the health of
other people right but then think it
through so say that you do think that
health care or health insurance is an
enforceable right then everybody has a
right to it no matter what mm-hmm then
people don't make themselves
preemptively liable to have their other
liberties limited on the grounds that in
virtue of their choices or permissible
choices they're gonna make it more
expensive to enforce those rights so by
that I just mean like say that you're a
person that just wants to eat like
Doritos and coca-cola you're all day
which is delicious
why do you college I'd be sympathetic I
do that you know and then people say
well like no you can't just do that or
you can't smoke cigarettes because if
you do then we're all gonna have to pay
for it well then you might say like but
wait a minute
like who cares like you have an
obligation in virtue of my enforceable
right to pay for it anyhow and so like
you don't get to tell me what to do just
because subsequently you're going to
have to give me what I'm owed which is
high health care if you owe me $50 and
you don't like how I'm gonna spend the
$50 you don't get to write you know tell
me to change my behavior before you give
me the $50 I just think it could it's
not an enforceable concept but it's just
I think it would just cause resentment I
think in general like if you're just
like I don't I don't expend a lot from
the system I don't take a lot from the
system and here are other people that do
it's just sort of human nature I think
to resent like yeah just sort of resent
it yeah yeah yeah maybe I mean I don't
think that they should if they really
think that they have a duty to provide
it right well I don't know that people
really think it through all the way and
maybe a certain amount of people don't
think they have a duty to provide yeah
don't think I would provide it their
issue isn't with the people eating
Doritos and smoking cigarettes their
issue is with being forced to provide
other people with health insurance it is
you know a different gripe so either way
you don't have any kind of grounds to
present or to want to limit the freedom
of the people who just want to smoke
cigarettes named Doritos because like
which I feel like I'm like hating under
readers it's not about everybody loves
the Cool Ranch
yeah right but um so I feel like you
know if you're a person who thinks
health care is our right then you have
no grounds to want to limit the choices
to those people because you buy your own
life think that you have a duty to
provide them a health care whatever
their choices are right and if you're
you know irritated by people making
public you know making choices that
could be prevented with public health
paternalism that you disapprove of all
on the grounds that you don't want to
pay for their health insurance then
what's doing the work is really just
that you don't want to pay for their
health insurance and so then you also
don't have any real beef with people
making bad health decisions right and so
either side I don't
should support public health paternalism
interesting you know you mentioned
cigarettes a couple times it's funny
because literally my chest is tight
right now I don't smoke cigarettes but
from the smoke outside like I can feel
it at the end of this moment and I
always think the cigarette thing is kind
of interesting cuz I used to live in New
York City and I'm pretty sure cigarettes
for something like 12 or 15 dollars a
pack like taxed beyond imagination which
I always thought was was an odd thing
because it's like you're taking people
with this vice yeah and then you know
and an addiction a true addiction to
tobacco and all the other stuff that's
in there and then you're you're making
all of this extra money off it that the
government then needs to do whatever its
doing so it's like a doubly abusive
thing in a way not that you should just
be giving cigarette cigarettes away for
free but taxing these vices these
addictive vices you're just taking more
money from those people and putting it
now you're gonna need the government
never wants less money so it's never
gonna be like alright we're gonna lose
tax that lower or we're gonna stop
spending there is some evidence that
cigarette taxes do reduce smoking which
makes sense unless you think that
cigarette is like this cigarettes are
sort of this like uncontrollable
compulsion that people have which would
be interesting that and that if you
increase the price of it by a dollar
then people stop doing it right you're
saying to poor people then it's probably
poor people that men can't afford it so
then it's like well poor people
shouldn't be allowed to smoke cigarettes
which I think some people would have
that is the way it goes down I don't
know but I do think that sin taxes in
general are like cigarette taxes taxes
on things that the government doesn't
want people to do like soda taxes are
another example they are regressive for
sure I mean just because you know the
marginal value of that dollar is going
to be disproportionately the marginal
impact of being taxed an additional
dollar will be disproportionately
harmful to people who have less money
right and so we have these regressive
public health taxes that are gonna
disproportionately burden the
economically worse off and I also think
that they're very expressively harmful
because they express disapproval of
certain people's choices on behalf of
the government which it's not morally
wrong to smoke cigarettes it's not
morally wrong to drink soda and so I
don't think that the government should
be
expressing disapproval or limiting
people's rights to make choices that are
permissible right again I think there's
some sort of argument that says if the
government is gonna give health
all right people we are live on the
YouTube and joining me today is a grad
student at Wilfrid Laurier College who
wasn't even on Twitter a month ago and
is now a major player in the free speech
Wars Lindsay Shepard welcome to the
group and report thank you I think
you're the first guest I usually tell
people right before we start that
there's booze behind you and you're the
first guest I think that was about to a
bottle of some take out the current
predicament you find yourself in yeah
sure
well first off thanks for coming in I'm
glad we were to get out here you came
from the great white north of canada to
be your story is completely crazy and
yet totally obvious to people i think
that have been paying attention to
what's going on sort of at universities
and it free speech in general and
crossing the border by the way of canada
the united states and plenty of other
countries so first off before we get
into the details we're gonna play some
audio and we're gonna read some
statements and all that stuff how are
you I'm doing well it's been a pretty
crazy time and for example earlier this
week I had a six page paper and a
presentation do didn't do it couldn't do
it right I don't have time this has kind
of taken over my life for now but I'm
okay with that
yeah and I'm willing to make sacrifices
yeah well we need people like you in
this fight and I think you kind of got
thrust into this almost almost
accidentally but it's pretty clear to me
that you're willing to be in the fight
and that's sort of what we need so
before we get into the all the specifics
for the people that don't know anything
about you tell me a little bit about
what you study in the first place what
are the things that actually brought you
here in the first place sure so um I'm
doing my Master of Arts in cultural
analysis and social theory but my
bachelor's degree is in communication so
that's why I'm a teaching assistant in
communication yeah alright so we're
gonna play some audio we have two
separate audio parts that I want people
to play there's how long was the whole
chunk of audio about 42 minutes okay so
about 40 minutes so we're gonna play a
piece right now that's about five
minutes and then later with a piece
that's about three minutes I'm sure many
of the people have listened to the whole
thing but we tried to parse out the
parts that I thought were that I thought
were most important but before we play
them why
you record the audio so I got an email
summoning me to the meeting and the
audio is of the meeting that I'm yeah
yeah so actually why don't we why don't
we set it up first so what did you
actually do that caused you to be
summoned to a meeting and again this is
what about six weeks ago or so right yes
it was that November first
so I played about four minutes of a
debate between Jordan Peterson and
another fellow at the University of
Toronto named Nicholas Matt so two two
scholars on a show called the agenda
with Steve Paikin which is just like a
great moderate talk show produced by TV
Ontario which is like a public
broadcaster in Ontario mm-hmm
but it turns out someone was offended
and it all went down from there so yes I
got an email saying that there were some
concerns about the content of my
tutorials okay but then it said the this
was from Professor Ram pukana who was
writing this email yeah I'm asking
someone from the diversity and equity
office to come in to meet with us and I
thought like if they're gonna bring a
diversity and equity official in over
this I need to record this because if if
this ends up being ridiculous winning it
was then I want to have proof that this
is happening man so you really were
tipped off to some of what has been
going on this didn't come as a complete
surprise to you in that case so that's
so a professor so what we're gonna hear
is the professor and the diversity
officer talking to you and how did you
do it by the way I think people would
like to know did you have the was it
your iPhone in your pocket with
something in your pocketbook what do you
actually do it was just my laptop out in
front of me
really did they wonder why your laptop
was right in front of you while you were
having this meeting I said I was taking
notes yeah yeah so there was three
people in the meeting professor Rambo
Kenna and then dr. Herbert Pimlott who's
my program coordinator my master's
program and then the diversity and
equity official is adria Joel and she's
in charge of gendered violence inside
actual assault prevention right and a
couple other things that we should just
clarify the complaint was anonymous
correct so no one so they were saying
someone was offended but no one stepped
forward to say that they were the person
that was offended
and also just to be very clear the piece
that you showed this wasn't about
whether trans people should have rights
or be treated poorly or anything like
that this was about the debate over the
words that we can use related to their
pronouns correctly yeah okay I think
have we set it up properly you feel good
about that
all right so we're going to throw to
about it's gonna be roughly about four
or five minutes of audio here and then
we'll be back with Lindsay in a moment
so if you okay so um we we have to teach
about grammar and in the Pearson book
there was a section about pronouns and
using like gendered language so I wanted
to make it more engaging so what I did
is we were talking about in papers using
a as as like a singular and then we were
also talking about like his and hers and
like how to construct sentences with
that and then to contextualize it I
brought up like a YouTube debate so a
debate with both sides during Peterson
sides and this this fellow named Nicolas
Matt who is also a prophet Youth T okay
and they do have a name of the video um
it was from the agenda with Steve Paikin
okay it was like a YouTube debate it was
one hour long but I showed about five
minutes and then some I mean the
students were we're very interested I
could tell that all of their eyes were
on the screen and after when we had a
debate there were people of all opinions
and like from from what I could see it
was a very friendly debate obviously
this person who had an issue did not
express it to me they just went straight
to whoever I don't I don't really know
what happened so I'm just for some
additional context so you come you can
turn mutti all right no no you fell from
SFU okay so you weren't like one of the
George Peters of the students yeah so
just to give you some context that have
turned theaters and
he is a figure that's basically highly
involved with the with the alt-right he
yes the website rabble media which is an
all right website has been involved in
raising multiple hundreds of thousands
of dollars for his research
it's he has gave a lecture in which he
identified student protesters like by
posting their social media accounts so
that people would bully and and threaten
them online he lectures about basically
like critiquing feminism critiquing
trans rights I'm familiar like I gotta
see
the thing is can you shield people from
those ideas am I supposed to comfort
them and make sure that they are
insulated away from this like is that
what the point of this is because to me
that is so against what a university is
about so against it I was not taking
sides I was presenting both arguments so
the thing is about this is if you're
presenting something like this it you
have to think about the kind of teaching
climate that you're creating and this is
actually these arguments are counter to
the Canadian Human Rights Code ever
since then you know that you talked
about
c16 ever since this past it is
discriminatory to be targeting someone
due to their gender identity or gender
expression so bringing something like
that up and class not critically and I
understand that you're trying to like it
was critical why I introduced it
critically how so like I said like I
said I it was in the spirit of debate
okay in the spirit of the debate is
slightly different than being like okay
this is this is like a problematic idea
that we won make me wanna unpack but
that's taking sides like it
taking sides for me to be like oh look
at this guy like everything that comes
out his mouth is BS but we're gonna
watch anyway okay so I understand the
position they are coming from and your
positionality but the reality is that it
is created a toxic climate or some of
the students hey you know I mean it's
great oh how many okay one yeah it might
be I know I have no concept of like how
many people complain like what their
complaint was you haven't showed me the
complaint yes I understand that this is
upsetting but there's also confidential
at comfy and confidentiality matters the
number of people is special
yes okay is one or multiple students who
have come forward saying that this is
something that they were concerned about
it and that it means I'm not comfortable
if this is for example a trans student
this is basically debating whether or
not a trans student should have rights
within one of their classes and that's
not something that is really acceptable
in the context of the kind of learning
environment that we're trying to create
it would be the equivalent of debating
whether or not you know a student of
color should have rights or should be
allowed to be married
do you see word like how this is not
it's not something like that's
intellectually neutral that is kind of
up for debate this is I mean this is the
Charter of Rights but it is that's for
debate but I mean you're perfectly
welcome your own opinions but when
you're bringing it into the context of
the classroom that can become
problematic and that can become
something that is that creates an unsafe
learning environment for students but
when they leave the university they're
gonna be exposed to these ideas so I
don't see how I'm doing a disservice to
the class by exposing them to ideas that
are really out there and I'm sorry I'm
crying I'm stressed out because this to
me is so wrong okay so that is just
about a five minute portion of the forty
two minute video I just want to be very
very clear before I give this back to
Lindsay here
every thing that you heard that
professors say is complete drivel I was
making notes while we did it we were
kind of shaking our our heads together
first off let's just talk about Peterson
for a second Peterson is highly involved
with the alt-right rebel media company
out of Canada which is owned by Ezra
Levant a Jew is part of the alt-right
what what did that stay like did that
even mean anything to you when he said
that actually I shake my head when he
says it and that's why he says yes after
cuz I was I'm still under the impression
he's not involved with the alt-right
yeah and I mean interestingly now rebel
media which was referenced they've
interviewed me and that's how I've now
become also associated I met Azra like
two weeks ago at an event in Florida and
he's a completely nice guy I don't know
all of his politics about everything but
the guy couldn't be nicer just silliness
all right so you're creating a hostile
teaching climate by presenting ideas
yeah what are we supposed to make of
this I mean when he was saying these
things you obviously you were getting
emotional but did you want to fight back
more like you were really kind of taking
it and I think you you stood your ground
where you felt you had to but did you
really want to push back on that like
creating a hostile teaching environment
you did exactly what a teacher is
supposed to do I mean it's almost like
my mind just doesn't work the way that
theirs does that's what I was kind of
realizing is like they're making these
huge stretches that like talking about
they in the singular is tantamount to
debating someone's humanity in addition
to debating like whether a student of
color has rights I mean they're just
making these huge stretches and I my
mind doesn't work that way and I'm just
you know I'm more reasonable reasonable
about things and yeah so then he
referenced C 16 which is this new
I guess directive the human rights the
Canadian Human Rights Code this is what
put Jordan Peterson on the map a year
ago when he basically in effect but
correct me if I'm wrong there and it's
basically he said I have no problem with
trans people but you meaning the
government can't tell me what labels to
use or what words come out of my mouth
we'll come from my mind and that's all
so this Peterson was proven right here I
mean that's what I kept thinking the
entire time is that Peterson was right
he was warning about this a year ago and
now look how it has been turned on to
someone like you yes and even people who
don't agree with professor Peterson are
angry that professor Rambo kind of used
that argument because now it's kind of
proven him right right which is a really
interesting the other line that really
got me was he said that this is like
debating whether a trans student has
rights just to be very clear what are
your feelings on trans people and the
rights that they should be afforded I
believe they should have all the rights
they you know everyone should have I
have no problem with trans people and
like I it's so strange because I'm just
such an empathetic and kind person and
so to to suddenly be transphobic it's
like wow like what do you call the
people who are actually transphobic then
because I'm just so okay with it right
which is the irony of what they do in
general then they call someone like you
a transfer band then they call someone
like you and all right and what it does
is it makes it seem like the all right
or being a transfer that this is must be
the widest tent ever because they take
they take everybody in there so ok so
you record this thing I assume it when
worse than you anticipated like did you
really think I mean that you recorded it
so you must have you know sort of guess
what was gonna happen what did you do
right after that um right after that I
sent it to media outlets just right
after I was really not happy with the
way it went
especially how they were accusing me of
violating this policy in that law and
you know one of the most frustrating
things to me though was that I didn't
get to know what the complaint even said
and also this is not a formal complaint
that went through any kind of you know
university body this was from what I
assume an email to the professor that
said I'm unhappy and at this point we
don't even know if that actually exists
correctly we have no indication whether
it was as he said it was one or many or
something to that effect we don't even
know that even one existed this may have
come from them we just simply don't know
we don't know was there any other
recourse you know I've heard some people
say well she went right to the media was
there any other recourse you think you
could have taken at the University or
did you feel you had exhausted that
because this was there this was the
diversity people yeah and and the
diversity and equity people control a
lot more than we might realize I think
and just seeing the president of the
university's response to all this what
would have been the point of going to
her I mean look at how she's reacting
she's she's publicly made it clear that
like she's not willing to support what I
did yeah she's not willing to support my
stance and really she which is a stance
for freedom of inquiry which is a stands
for freedom of speech
it's a stands for actual education
mm-hmm not willing staff ready of those
things exactly yeah we should read some
of the Vice Chancellors statement what
do you think all right so I'm gonna read
some of this we're gonna we're gonna
throw it up after listening to this
recording an apology is in order I
should say this is Vice Chancellor
Deborah McClatchy after listening to
this recording an apology is in order
the conversation I heard does not
reflect the values and practices to
which Laurier aspires I'm sorry it
occurred in the way that it did and I
regret the impact it had on Lindsey
Shepherd the university is committed to
ensuring that the vitally important role
of teaching assistants supports an
enriched learning environment for all
students let me be clear by stating that
Laurier is committed to the abiding
principles of freedom of speech and
freedom of expression giving life to
these principles while respecting
fundamentally important human rights and
our institutional values of diversity
and inclusion is not a simple matter the
intense media interest points to a
highly polarizing and very complicated
set of issues that is affecting
universities across the Democratic world
the polarizing nature of the current
debate does not do justice to the
complexity of issues so that statement
sounds pretty good basically right does
that sound there's a little bit of I can
see where there's a little bit of a
slide in that but pretty good pretty
good but I mean at the start there it
was you know I'm sorry for the way the
meeting occurred in the way that it did
and you know what I get from that is I'm
sorry it was like three on one I'm sorry
you had no
representation I'm sorry that they they
weren't nicer to you but I'll just be on
it's like when I was in that meeting I
didn't feel like I needed anybody I
didn't particularly feel bullied either
which is kind of interesting because
that's a point that so many people bring
up is like she was bullied like this is
three-on-one this is not fair this is
like basically harassment so it's kind
of interesting to me that like I
actually like never felt that way
because all that really mattered to me
was the content of what they were saying
which was that like there's only one
brand of acceptable ideas here and
because you're not promoting that you're
in trouble
yeah so the inherent conflict here is
that the President and the Vice
Chancellor is sort of saying different
things right I mean they're based the
Vice Chancellor in this statement is
basically saying we stand by Lindsay the
president is sort of saying that these
are at the idea that diversity and
inclusion supersede well the President
and Vice Chancellor at the same person
it's Deborah McLeod Shay's both
positions oh yeah
well that changes everything for me I
suppose well then okay so then what well
then what does that prove other than
that I'm confused about this um yeah I
mean I've been she also did an interview
with Steve Paikin yeah and remember that
clip I showed is from the agenda with
Steve Paikin so just a couple days ago I
think she was on the agenda with Steve
Paikin and he kept asking her like did
Lindsay do anything wrong and you know
she she wouldn't give a clear answer
yeah but because her argument would have
to be that by c16 that show shouldn't
[Music]
joining me today is the editor of spiked
online and a true free speech warrior
Brendan O'Neil finally welcome to the
Reuben reply day I've been trying to get
you for like a year and a half
you are not on Twitter what kind of
human in 2017 public and hers in editor
is I hate her I hate Twitter I think
it's become incredibly toxic yeah
and it's become it was supposed to be a
tool of free speech where you could
express yourself and say what you think
and maybe even a space on the internet
for people who have different crazy or
alternative views but in many ways
that's become the opposite it's become a
tool for shutting down free speech you
know the whole twitch phenomenon Twitter
mobs anyone who thinks outside of the
kind of mainstream liberal PC box can be
hounded quite easily yeah so I'm not a
fan of Twitter
also I have a short temper oh they do
really doing the right side I think I'd
be suited to Twitter because I would end
up getting two arguments I didn't want
to get into yeah for a free speech guy
in and an absolutist in this regard the
mobs and all that and the twitch
policing and all of that you're for them
doing all that I said you're not for
stopping them doing those things just
talking about the process yeah everyone
doing all the stuff yeah it's a
difficult one because you don't want any
clamp down or restrictions on their
right to be a mob right you want to
defend the right to form a mob and to
say things as a mob but it is it does
have an impact on freedom of speech and
freedom of thought and it's a point John
Stuart Mill makes in on Liberty John
Stuart Mill often argued that the worst
kind of censorship is not necessarily
legal or state censorship it's often
what he called the informal tyranny of
custom where there's just this
expectation that you will go along with
the conformist mainstream view and if
you don't you will in some subtle way be
punished maybe acid from polite society
may be a signal will be sent that you're
not a good person
I think the Twitter mob from phenomenon
feeds into that so in many ways it can
be a more insidious form of censorship
than even government censorship yeah
it's so interesting cuz I say all the
time now it's that at the moment and of
course this can change but at the moment
I'm not that concerned about
government censorship at the moment that
being said what I am concerned about is
that we're silencing ourselves really
because everyone is afraid of the
outrage machine and that's why I've
tried to consistently bring on people
like you who although you're not on
Twitter who are just out there doing it
and you're still alive and as Douglas
Murray said to me the water ain't that
cold you guys get out there and do it
yeah I think the worst kind of
censorship now is self censorship almost
cowardice is a strong word I think with
some people it's a cowardice of about
saying what they really think other
people with other people who said
genuine genuine fear that if they say
what they think they will be hounded or
demonized and so on self censorship is
the real danger now and there's a lot of
it going on people who are not speaking
freely and openly because they fear the
consequences and the consequences can be
quite severe you can have your workplace
hounded with email saying you should
sack this guy because he thinks a B or C
of course you can be hounded off campus
by informal gangs of feminists or PC
people or or even trans people the
government has no involvement in that
but it does nonetheless have this very
insidious profound impact on the general
freedom of society and the general sense
that everything should be sable
everything should be debatable
everything should be up for discussion
that idea is being demolished not by
government jackboots but increasingly by
these informal gangs of PC enforcers
yeah where do you think that the
companies themselves the tech companies
so Facebook Twitter YouTube etc what
responsibilities do they have because
everyone knows they have their own Terms
of Service nobody we're putting this on
YouTube nobody's forcing me to be on
YouTube nobody's forcing me to be on
Twitter again you're not on Twitter a
wise man but what responsibilities
related to free speech do you think they
have because they've booted off some
people yeah that I think are actually DC
I'm not talking about some of the you
know people that are actually making
death threats which of course is a legal
issue but they put some people like
sargon of akkad i've had on my show a
couple times they've booted him off
twitter i think they have a large
responsibility in relation to freedom of
speech and there was a Supreme Court
case in this country decades ago about
corporate towns which are these towns
bill
tap around corporations and so on and
one of these corporate towns are a few
of these corporate towns argued that
they didn't have to adhere to the First
Amendment because they were private
entities and the judgment that was made
in the Supreme Court case was that if
you are a private enterprise which is so
large that you legitimately incorporate
a huge amount of public space a huge
amount of the public sphere in which
people speak and which in which people
interact then you do actually have a
responsibility to defend freedom of
speech and I think that certainly goes
for social media companies yeah that's
interesting that's now the that's now a
public arena that's the if you look at
Facebook like a seventh of humanity is
on Facebook or Twitter millions of
people on Twitter millions and millions
of people on YouTube these are the new
public forums these are the new public
squares these are the new spaces in
which people stand up make
pronouncements get on soap boxes hand
out pamphlets engage their fellow
citizens so I think it's entirely
legitimate to expect that the same free
speech that we hope would apply in a
public square would apply in these
forums too so is there a little bit of a
problem there because we're going to
talk about your your Marxist libertarian
views in a little bit but as someone
that at least going off the second part
of that the libertarian side I know for
me the idea of having the government
come in and now tell Facebook and
YouTube
what to do even though I had my
frustrations with them I don't really
see that as the answer here what I see
is the answer is capitalism in a
competition and let other companies come
and hopefully you know give a little
competition so they have to give us a
better service but but I struggle with
this one and interestingly I see a lot
of people on the right who were supposed
to be the libertarians and limited
government guys calling for these places
to be regulated you know sort of like
they did to AT&T a year you know years
ago yeah it's a difficult one because on
the one hand you don't want the
government to tell these social media
companies to prevent people from saying
certain things which is happening in
Britain at the moment lots of
politicians are kind of ganging together
to force Twitter and other forums to
restrict certain things in a speech and
so on so you don't want that but on the
other hand you don't necessarily want
the government to force these companies
to preserve freedom of speech or
publish things that they might not want
to publish Nathan private organization
so it is difficult there's no question
about that but my preference would be
that we would encourage these kind of
companies and encourage social media
platforms to value freedom of speech in
its entirety which means freedom of
speech not only for people who we like
and who are agreeable and who are
interesting and sensible and and and
liberal and nice and so on but also for
people who are edgy and difficult and
controversial and contrary in' and maybe
even hateful on the basis that is only
by having the fullest freedom of
expression possible that we can all then
work out what we think is right and
wrong
but you know that's the only possibility
of having of arriving at any kind of
truth where everything is up for grabs
everything is stated publicly and then
you trust the audience you trust the
viewers you trust the listeners to
decide for themselves using their
autonomous minds what's good and what's
bad that's the kind of culture we need
to cultivate yeah is there a doubly
difficult problem here because also we
don't know what's going on with the
algorithms that these companies make so
publicly they could say we're for free
speech yes all these things but actually
they might be writing in code that could
you know stop some of my subscribers
from seeing videos or putting me aside
could you know wipe out people's Twitter
accounts or whatever does it's like we
actually don't know now the math behind
how people get information
unquestionably that happens and I don't
I don't have a Twitter account but I
sometimes look at to it so you can't
live in the modern sphere without
looking at it and seeing what people are
talking about on there and what amazes
me if you look at Twitter stories for
example all the things that Twitter
emphasizes it's always stuff that goes
along with the Twitter mindset with
Silicon Valley mindset with that kind of
fairly mainstream conformist mindset now
you know they they emphasize the if
Twitter has a kind of intersectional
outburst and it attacks someone for
being sexist on the sojanet or racist
and so on often overblown accusations
Twitter will emphasize that up
and turn it into the daily story so
Twitter undoubtedly has an editorial
input and control and in a sense you
want to say fine that's you can do that
but then they've got to stop calling
themselves the free speech wing of the
Free Speech Party because increasingly
they do appear like a publication just
happens to let other voices chip in
every now and then so basically what I'm
sensing from you is that there really is
no good answer here yet right because
what you're saying is you want them to
self-police you don't want the
government to come in you want them to
be transparent but you don't want to use
force to make that strap in so there
really is no answer that we can walk
away from and be like well alright
that's the sensible way to deal with it
that's not the idea that you're talking
about that way yeah I like the personal
responsibility of the individual and the
company but that's sort of separate from
what actually happens when the rubber
meets the road
yeah there's no easy answer except that
we should defend freedom of speech every
single time it's under attack whether
that's in the Academy on some informal
part of campus in relation to the
government in social media in the press
wherever freedom of speech is under
attack we should defend freedom of
speech and we should defend it for the
very simple reason that everyone should
be allowed to say what they want to say
and everyone else this is the part of
freedom of speech that people forget
because they always say oh you're
defending free speech for horrible
people
the second even more important part of
freedom of speech is defending the right
of the audience to decide for themselves
what's right and what's wrong
yeah and that's the most important part
because the problem with censorship of
course is that it infantilizes people in
tells you you don't have to think we
will think for you we will decide for
you and that really weakens people's
moral muscles weakens their intellectual
muscle muscles encourages them to be
child like an infant like and and to
never think about the world yeah if it
directly feeds out raid culture it
actually feeds a if it's a very
simplistic reader of the world a very
childish reading of the world and it
dumbs down culture censorship is a far
greater threat to
intellectualism and peace and liberty
and all those things we think are good
then freedom of speech ever could be so
it's important to always defend freedom
of speech in every sphere and through
doing that I think we might eventually
encourage people rather than forcing
them to protect freedom of speech within
the spheres in which they operate yeah
do you think we're getting some wins
right now I mean I you're doing a tour
with a bunch of people from Brett
Weinstein and Laura Kipnis and Steven
Pinker and a whole bunch of people in
this space and you know I'm doing the
college thing too and obviously spiked
is working this show is working other
people in this plate in this space it's
all working do you think we're actually
starting to win here I'm you know I'm
hopeful as a human yeah I know I'm an
optimist yeah otherwise I couldn't do
this but there's so much bad stuff it's
hard to it's hard to place it I there
between optimism and pessimism and which
are both valuable emotions as it happens
optimism is good because you feel
buoyant and you want to go out and fight
in the world and pessimism is good
because it makes you reflect and think
well what's going wrong so I don't have
a problem with either of those takes but
I flip between the two on the one hand
I'm optimistic because I see lots of
young people and on this tall that
spiders doing the unsafe space tour
whether they're on two campuses and what
we're trying to do in fact is move away
from the pantomime debates that have
been taking place on campus in recent
years where some member of the so-called
alright we'll come in and irritate all
the feminists and the idiots in the
audience and then they will you know the
alt-right gets a kick because they wind
everyone up and then the audience
members get a kick butt because they get
to shout fascist at people they don't
right and all you do is strengthen the
extreme you straighten these dreams and
it's all heat and no light and it's
entertaining and everyone watches on
YouTube and it gets hundreds of
thousands of hits but no one learns
anything so what we're trying to do with
this tour is go onto campuses and and
convince people using hopefully
intellectual rigor and and substantial
historical arguments and and clever
people yeah that freedom of speech is
the most important value in a civilized
society and in fact civilized society is
not possible without it so we're trying
as best as we can to
the discussion away from the rather
pantomime black and white unhelpful
clash that it's become the cultural war
that it's become to explain the origins
of freedom and the importance of freedom
and I'm optimistic because we've were
having a good reception and I'm meeting
young people in New York and Washington
and and other places in America who are
really really keen on freedom of speech
but feel like they don't have a place in
which they can say how keen they are on
freedom of speech yeah so I'm optimistic
in that sense I'm pessimistic in the
sense that I fear that the argument of
freedom is being colonized by people on
the right who I don't think are always a
hundred percent convincing in their
defense of freedom and the thing that
particularly worries me now is the
left's abandonment of the ideal of
freedom I think that's actually the real
crisis we face in Western societies now
which is that the left and so-called
liberals and you know the word liberal
is about the word liberty you know are
turning their backs on Liberty that's a
real problem yeah okay so I really want
to dive deep into this one because
everyone watching this at least my
audience knows that I mean this is where
I've spent most of my time you know I
came from the progressive world I wanted
to fix the left subsequently two years
later after endlessly talking about this
I did a video with Prager you which day
titled why I left left because I've come
to the position that liberalism in the
classical sense the John Stuart Mill
sense no longer has anything to do with
modern leftism yeah so let's really go
deeper yeah so first off let's start
with why are you let's start with the
roots of why liberalism should be
connected to the left let's just start
there
well the way I put it is that I didn't
leave the left the left left me because
the left abandoned everything that it
used to represent and the way I see
political correctness which is this kind
of rehabilitation of the racial
imagination so everyone is now black and
white or man and woman in this constant
divisive nurse and shoving people back
into biological boxes from which they
spent 200 years trying to escape or it's
a liberalism so it doesn't want you to
be
controversial or daring or contrarian
what's everything to be sedate or even
the modern PC people's agitation with
things like economic growth or exploring
nature or even dare I say exploiting
nature for the good of mankind on all
occasions right I mean that's super
controversial yeah all those things
suggest to me that the PC culture you
know people call it left in my mind it
runs counter to everything the left used
to stand for I think it is reactionary I
think if anything is right-wing I happen
to think left and right aren't
particularly useful the categories now
but it's certainly more right wing than
it is left wing do you might remember a
moment when it happened because that's
what a lot of people ask me they ask me
when my specific wake up was or when
your specific wake up was but do you
think there was a cultural or political
moment that really was the hammer that
kind of whacked it and then started to
go in the wrong way I think it's been a
long-standing process I think it's been
growing for a long time I think you
could even trace it back to the 60s when
the left shifts from being interested in
economic issues and the working class
towards being interested in you know the
new left interested in cultural issues
and the problem of advertising and
consumerism and so on and that shift
from being interested in production how
are things produced and who owns them
towards being obsessed with consumerism
why are we always pressured to buy
things and so on and that was a very
important shift from economy and power
towards issues of culture and then that
grows through the 70s and the 80s and it
becomes the dominant theme of the left
and you know the way I see it is that if
I look back because I still call myself
a Marxist libertarian I partly do it
just to we're gonna do it just to annoy
people
because no understands what it means
yeah even I don't understand what he
owns but I always considered the left to
be universal pro-growth that was one of
the most important parts of the left and
interested in autonomy interested in
pushing away all the priests and princes
and and bureaucrats who wanted to tell
ordinary people how to live and trusted
ordinary people more than
experts that's how I saw the left now I
see a left a so-called left that has
abandoned those three things
so it's ditched universalism in favor of

what's right and what's wrong yeah and
that's the most important part because
the problem with censorship of course is
that it infantilizes people in tells you
you don't have to think we will think
for you we will decide for you and that
really weakens people's moral muscles
weakens their intellectual muscle
muscles encourages them to be child like
an infant like and and to never think
about the world yeah if it directly
feeds out raid culture it actually feeds
a if it's a very simplistic reader of
the world a very childish reading of the
world and it dumbs down culture
censorship is a far greater threat to
intellectualism and peace and liberty
and all those things we think are good
then freedom of speech ever could be so
it's important to always defend freedom
of speech in every sphere and through
doing that I think we might eventually
encourage people rather than forcing
them to protect freedom of speech within
the spheres in which they operate yeah
do you think we're getting some wins
right now I mean I you're doing a tour
with a bunch of people from Brett
Weinstein and Laura Kipnis and Steven
Pinker and a whole bunch of people in
this space and you know I'm doing the
college thing too and obviously spiked
is working this show is working other
people in this plate in this space it's
all working do you think we're actually
starting to win here I'm you know I'm
hopeful as a human yeah I know I'm an
optimist yeah otherwise I couldn't do
this but there's so much bad stuff it's
hard to it's hard to place it I there
between optimism and pessimism and which
are both valuable emotions as it happens
optimism is good because you feel
buoyant and you want to go out and fight
in the world and pessimism is good
because it makes you reflect and think
well what's going wrong so I don't have
a problem with either of those takes but
I flip between the two on the one hand
I'm optimistic because I see lots of
young people and on this tall that
spiders doing the unsafe space tour
whether they're on two campuses and what
we're trying to do in fact is move away
from the pantomime debates that have
been taking place on campus in recent
years where some member of the so-called
alright we'll come in and irritate all
the feminists and the idiots in the
audience and then they will you know the
alt-right gets a kick because they wind
everyone up and then the audience
members get a kick butt because they get
to shout fascist at people they don't
right and all you do is strengthen the
extreme you straighten these dreams and
it's all heat and no light and it's
entertaining and everyone watches on
YouTube and it gets hundreds of
thousands of hits but no one learns
anything so what we're trying to do with
this tour is go onto campuses and and
convince people using hopefully
intellectual rigor and and substantial
historical arguments and and clever
people yeah that freedom of speech is
the most important value in a civilized
society and in fact civilized society is
not possible without it so we're trying
as best as we can to
the discussion away from the rather
pantomime black and white unhelpful
clash that it's become the cultural war
that it's become to explain the origins
of freedom and the importance of freedom
and I'm optimistic because we've were
having a good reception and I'm meeting
young people in New York and Washington
and and other places in America who are
really really keen on freedom of speech
but feel like they don't have a place in
which they can say how keen they are on
freedom of speech yeah so I'm optimistic
in that sense I'm pessimistic in the
sense that I fear that the argument of
freedom is being colonized by people on
the right who I don't think are always a
hundred percent convincing in their
defense of freedom and the thing that
particularly worries me now is the
left's abandonment of the ideal of
freedom I think that's actually the real
crisis we face in Western societies now
which is that the left and so-called
liberals and you know the word liberal
is about the word liberty you know are
turning their backs on Liberty that's a
real problem yeah okay so I really want
to dive deep into this one because
everyone watching this at least my
audience knows that I mean this is where
I've spent most of my time you know I
came from the progressive world I wanted
to fix the left subsequently two years
later after endlessly talking about this
I did a video with Prager you which day
titled why I left left because I've come
to the position that liberalism in the
classical sense the John Stuart Mill
sense no longer has anything to do with
modern leftism yeah so let's really go
deeper yeah so first off let's start
with why are you let's start with the
roots of why liberalism should be
connected to the left let's just start
there
well the way I put it is that I didn't
leave the left the left left me because
the left abandoned everything that it
used to represent and the way I see
political correctness which is this kind
of rehabilitation of the racial
imagination so everyone is now black and
white or man and woman in this constant
divisive nurse and shoving people back
into biological boxes from which they
spent 200 years trying to escape or it's
a liberalism so it doesn't want you to
be
controversial or daring or contrarian
what's everything to be sedate or even
the modern PC people's agitation with
things like economic growth or exploring
nature or even dare I say exploiting
nature for the good of mankind on all
occasions right I mean that's super
controversial yeah all those things
suggest to me that the PC culture you
know people call it left in my mind it
runs counter to everything the left used
to stand for I think it is reactionary I
think if anything is right-wing I happen
to think left and right aren't
particularly useful the categories now
but it's certainly more right wing than
it is left wing do you might remember a
moment when it happened because that's
what a lot of people ask me they ask me
when my specific wake up was or when
your specific wake up was but do you
think there was a cultural or political
moment that really was the hammer that
kind of whacked it and then started to
go in the wrong way I think it's been a
long-standing process I think it's been
growing for a long time I think you
could even trace it back to the 60s when
the left shifts from being interested in
economic issues and the working class
towards being interested in you know the
new left interested in cultural issues
and the problem of advertising and
consumerism and so on and that shift
from being interested in production how
are things produced and who owns them
towards being obsessed with consumerism
why are we always pressured to buy
things and so on and that was a very
important shift from economy and power
towards issues of culture and then that
grows through the 70s and the 80s and it
becomes the dominant theme of the left
and you know the way I see it is that if
I look back because I still call myself
a Marxist libertarian I partly do it
just to we're gonna do it just to annoy
people
because no understands what it means
yeah even I don't understand what he
owns but I always considered the left to
be universal pro-growth that was one of
the most important parts of the left and
interested in autonomy interested in
pushing away all the priests and princes
and and bureaucrats who wanted to tell
ordinary people how to live and trusted
ordinary people more than
experts that's how I saw the left now I
see a left a so-called left that has
abandoned those three things
so it's ditched universalism in favor of
the rabbit-hole of identity politics and
the rabbit-hole of biological difference
[Music]
joining me today is the first investor
in Bitcoin comm blockchain comm and
several other cryptocurrency websites
who's also a libertarian an
individualist and a peace advocate Roger
Vere welcome to the Rubin report thanks
for having me on I was gonna savor but
when I did a little research and it's
actually veer even though most people
savor this would lead one to getting
into cryptocurrency wouldn't it that's
the exact reason that it's very easy to
see that that's why I would get into
cryptocurrency yeah alright I am looking
forward to doing this conversation cuz
as I mentioned to you briefly before we
started for about two years or so I've
sort of been kind of looking into this
world a lot of my audience the
libertarian side of my audience of
course is very much into Bitcoin so I
think probably for the first half of
this we have to just do do 101 stuff are
you ready to have your your thinking cap
on you bet all right for someone that's
watching this Bitcoin they have no idea
what that means they think it has some
connotation to Super Mario you know
punching the question mark and getting
coins out of this thing which makes some
sense I guess at some level what the
hell is Bitcoin
so Bitcoin is thanks to the invention of
Bitcoin for the very first time in the
entire history of the world any human
being can now send and receive any
amount of money with any other human
being
anywhere on the planet instantly
basically for free you don't have to get
permission from a bank you don't have to
get permission from the corporation you
don't have to get permission from a
government not only do you not have to
get their permission it's impossible for
any of those entities to stop it so you
can now send money from from here in LA
to Tomas Cao instantly just like that
for a less than a penny and there's
nothing that the Russian government can
do there's nothing that the Chinese
government can do there's nothing that
the American government can do so if you
think that it's a good thing that people
have control of their own money and
they're not susceptible to things like
we had happened in Cyprus a few years
back where the government just came in
and said okay we're going to take I
think it was a third of it everybody's
money in their bank accounts if you
think things like that are bad you
should love Bitcoin and even if you
haven't used Bitcoin yet it
might sound complicated and difficult
but think of it like email if I sat here
trying to explain to you how email
worked it would sound really hard and
confusing and how could anybody figure
out how to do this sort of thing but
once you've used email it's not hard
it's easy you just type in the person's
email address and you send them a
message
bitcoins the same way you just paste
copy and paste their Bitcoin address and
you send them some money yeah and so the
best advice I can give to anybody that's
new to Bitcoin don't be afraid of it go
on the internet and get a Bitcoin wallet
and give it a try it's really really
easy to use once you've actually used it
yeah I mentioned to you that we take
donations at Rubin report.com slash
donate and we take Bitcoin donations we
didn't do it for awhile and we had all
these people saying why aren't you doing
it you're missing a great opportunity
here so we did it we've about I think
around two and a half Bitcoin right now
and I've seen it kind of you know go up
and you can't really watch it every
though at least from where I sit you
can't watch it every day because you'd
start going crazy it's just like
watching stocks every day but what is it
what actually is it so I get the ease of
transfer and I want to talk to you about
why some governments kind of embrace it
more and some really or against it and
all that stuff but like people that's
what people know like what like gold we
know what gold is it's a thing you can
put it in your hand what actually is
Bitcoin
so with traditional money's that people
are used to using like the dollar or the
Euro or traditional payment networks
like PayPal or Visa or MasterCard all of
these things have one ledger that keeps
track of for example PayPal they have a
ledger at the PayPal world headquarters
and maybe a couple of backups they keep
track of how many dollars you have in
your account and how many dollars I have
in my account and when I transfer some
PayPal dollars from my account to your
account they update their ledger but
because they're the ones that are in
charge of that ledger and keeping track
of that ledger at any point they can
reverse the transaction I made to you
they can take all the money out of your
account they can take all the money out
of my account the IRS can go to them and
say take the money out of both of our
accounts anything can happen at any time
that's beyond our control even though we
like to think of the money that's in our
PayPal account as our money but in
reality we have to trust PayPal to hold
it because PayPal has that one ledger
they're at the mercy of you know their
higher-ups which are the government
people with Bitcoin instead of there
being one ledger that keeps track of who
has how many bitcoins and what
there's a copy of this ledger but it's
on everybody's computer around the world
that's running a copy of the Bitcoin
full node software and so instead of
there being you know one or two or three
copies there's a more than a hundred
thousand copies of this ledger around
the world and those a hundred thousand
copies of the letter all stay in sync
with one another and those Ledger's are
in you know every country around the
world so let's say I send some money to
you be a Bitcoin for something that a
government doesn't like there's no
Bitcoin company that they can call
there's no Bitcoin server that they can
unplug all they could do is arrest the
two of us but that doesn't stop the
Bitcoin network as a whole it keeps
right on going so the real powerful
invention of Bitcoin is this ledger
that's not on any one computer the
ledger is distributed across the entire
planet so there's no single place that
anybody could go to to stop or modify it
or unplug it or turn it off and so for
me that's what's so exciting about
Bitcoin is the only way to stop it would
be to turn off the entire internet in
the entire world and keep it turned off
and in 2017 I don't think that's a very
likely proposition I suspect there's
some bad guys there's got to be an evil
guy somewhere twirling his mustache code
we can shut off the entire internet
right
maybe but hopefully not and hopefully we
can build even more technologies to
prevent bad people from turning off the
whole world's Internet and we saw what
happened when they tried in in Turkey
previously they turned off the internet
we just within the country and people
were instantly rioting in the streets
and uh it led to an entire revolution in
that country and I suspect that what
happened in a lot of countries around
the world if they tried to turn off the
internet completely okay so I'm with you
I understand that basically the ledger
the information the true information of
who has what and when they have it and
all of that I understand that when
people say we're we're mining for
Bitcoin what does that actually mean
so this ledger that's all across the
entire world gets updated once on
average every ten minutes but it's who
gets to decide who gets to make that
update so the way that problem was
solved is all these people are doing
these really complicated math problems
and the only way to find the answer to
this maths problem is just to guess and
you have to guess over and over and over
again so these Bitcoin mining machines
are guessing millions of times a second
or even more than that and when they
find the
you ever machine and there's you know
millions of these around the world
whichever machine finds the right answer
to this math problem is then the one
that's designated to be able to make the
next update to this worldwide Bitcoin
ledger so then all these different nodes
around the world make their update and
boom the transactions at the networks at
the next state and then all the
computers start trying to guess again
but the benefit of finding the right
answer to this solution is at the moment
you get 12 and a half bitcoins if your
computer is the one that finds the right
solution and twelve and a half bitcoins
at the moment is worth what like 80
$80,000 or so yeah oh I should mention
by the way that we're taping this
probably about two weeks before it's
gonna air so anything we say related to
the specific numbers I don't want people
to take out of context they got here
doesn't know what he's talking about
because there was 2.4 it you know ok and
it and almost certainly by the time this
airs it'll be something like that what I
said so basically even if we were doing
this live right now things would be
changing on the fly I'd have to check
live on the on the phone to see what the
current price is to figure it out and
and Bitcoin is volatile but from my
point of view I want to be exposed to as
much of that volatility as I possibly
can because Bitcoin allows you to send
and receive any amount of money with
anyone anywhere in the world basically
for free and there's nothing anybody
could do to stop it and there's a
limited supply a Bitcoin there will
never ever ever be more than 21 million
bitcoins so if you stop so how does that
work exactly because that's oh I've
heard that so they'll never be more than
21 you've got all these computers that
are constantly working to get the next
solution to the mathematical equation so
how is there a finite number of so if
one of these come if one of these
computers decided to give itself more
than the 12 and a half bitcoins that are
supposed to be allocated all the other
computers will reject that and say no
that's not part of the rules of the game
that it's in our software code so any
computer that deviates from that their
transactions and whatever they're trying
to do just gets rejected and ignored by
the rest of the network so right from
day one it was programmed into the
software code that there wouldn't be
more than 21 million bitcoins but those
are released over time so half of the
remaining bitcoins are released every
four years so in the first four years of
bitcoins Bitcoin ten and a half million
coins were released in the next four
years half of that in the next four
years half of that and it drops by by
half every four years so what year will
they all officially we have more than a
hundred years until the
the bitcoins are released out into the
public so uh you know it's that's not a
pressing problem at the moment but uh
right what would even I mean we don't
have to go too far down that since it's
a hundred years from now but what would
happen when we hit when we hit the point
that they're all out there does that
somehow drastically change the way the
game is played well the idea is that by
that point people that are doing the
quant transactions even if they're
paying a fraction of a penny per Bitcoin
transaction of people are doing billions
of transactions per day those fees of a
fraction of a penny per transaction will
incentivize the miners to continue
mining and we have a hundred and
something years to find out to figure
that out yeah I suspect there will be
some other excuse yeah there's more
pressing problems than that one at the
moment sure right okay so how so it
sounds to me that it's incredibly secure
right can you just talk a little bit
more about the general security yeah so
the the Bitcoin network all these
computers around the world that are
doing mining a more accurate description
of what they're doing is actually
they're securing the Bitcoin network so
the more computers that are mining the
more secure the Bitcoin network is and
the Bitcoin network is somewhere on the
order of several thousand times more
powerful now than the world's top 500
supercomputers combined so it's
absolutely an incredible feat of
Engineering yeah wait so how do you get
that kind of computing power like are
there just I assume there's farms of
servers just like it's just someone that
invested in it in a farm right I mean is
that what works and initially it was
just people at home in their bedroom
because you know you if you found a
block you would get a dollar I mean so
it wasn't that excited but now today
when you find a block on the blockchain
you get you know 80,000 plus dollars so
now it's big big business so people have
big giant warehouses filled with tens of
millions of dollars of this mining
equipment using you know tens of
megawatts of a power per per location
and it's a big big business at this
point and you can still do it at home
one of the most important factors though
is the cost of electricity so the
cheaper your electricity is the more
profitable your Bitcoin mining can be so
I assume there's some Bitcoin people
that probably want to go into solar and
move to Nevada or something yep and then
there's people going around looking at
buying power plants and buying
hydroelectric dams and all sorts of
stuff it's really become a worldwide
major industry at this point yeah I
mentioned to you the BNA we're gonna
have to do some definitions here so
blockchain what
is blockchain so blockchain is just a
fancy name for this worldwide ledger
that's kept on everybody's computer
that's running up this copy of the
software and the ledger stays in sync
with every other copy so that's a that's
basically what a blockchain is and the
reason it's called a blockchain is that
ledger it's not updated all the time
it's updated in steps and each step or
update is a block of new information
that's attached and they're all chained
together mathematically so they're all
in order so of a new block gets added to
the end of the blockchain on average
once every 10 minutes and now the the
blockchain is I don't know
coming up on half a million blocks long
and it's been going on for nine years
now something like that yeah what are
most people who use it actually using
Bitcoin for right now like are they
using it mostly just to transfer money
from person to person or I noticed
actually just two days ago I bought
something on overstock.com and it was
the first time that I ever saw on an
e-commerce site that I could have paid
in Bitcoin I had actually never seen
that before but what are most people
using Bitcoin for I think it depends
it's kind of like asking what do most
people use money for and it varied up
fair in my book Bitcoin is money so
people use money in different ways some
people save with it some people spend it
some people gamble on the internet with
it some people buy drugs with it some
people do whatever it is they want with
it but in my point of view each each
person owns their own money and they
should be free to do whatever they want
with it so long as they're not
initiating force or fraud against other
people and yeah but I'm curious do you
know it what any of the trends are like
our people really at the moment just
getting into Bitcoin so they can save it
hoping that you know treating it more as
a stock than an actual cash or are they
all right then we can also talk about a
little bit about the split with Bitcoin
cash - that's probably a good Segway to
that but do you have any sense of what
the actual habits are yes I think that's
a great segue into that so when I first
got involved in Bitcoin I was the first
person the entire world to start
investing in Bitcoin startups so my
first step what let's pause there for a
sec so this is 2011 right right what are
a 2011 bitcoins are less than $1 each
okay and what possessed you to get my
kid you see that you were like alright
this is going to be something so um I
grew up in Silicon Valley been playing
with computers since I was a little kid
love computers all the time and my hobby
was studying economics and just kind of
by chance I came
macrosse1 economics book in in junior
high when my mother told me I couldn't
play anymore Nintendo I had to go and do
something else I'd pick up a book off
the shelf and just by luck it was a book
called socialism by Ludwig von Mises and
some people may know who that is and
what that book is and a lot most people
I expect won't and when I picked up that
book I thought it was a pro socialism
book and I didn't really even know what
socialism was but I kind of knew that
Americans were supposed to be opposed to
socialism but I thought you know I
should have an open mind I should at
least hear what the other side of the
the you know this point of view has to
say and it turned out that I think was
the Wall Street Journal referred to look
mom uses his book socialism as looted
von Mises is devastating critique of
socialism and in this book he kind of
points out that prices are incredibly
important and without the pricing
mechanism you don't know what raw
resources should be used to produce what
consumer goods so this you my glass of
water here is made of glass that I don't
know how I don't even know how they make
the glass but I guess some sand and they
melt it down or something like that but
without the price we got it from Target
for the record so we spare no expense
around here you know everything right
and with the prices that go into the
sand and then the factory and this and
that they know that maybe they should
make glasses out of sand rather than
glasses out of gold or glasses out of
copper or take your pick and so all the
prices all over the world allocate all
of these resources and all of these
companies and all these factories and
people and individuals all the way to
the time when you get to Target and you
look at the different glasses there and
you think this one's glass this one's
plastic this one suits my need better
than this one and this one cost this
much and it allocates the resources of
the entire world without a pricing
mechanism you have no idea what raw
resources should be used to create what
consumer goods and reading this book was
like wow any time the government gets
involved in any area of the economy
they're causing a misallocation of
resources and resources are being
diverted from their most economically
efficient use to something that's less
economically efficient and saying
something's less economically efficient
is just a fancier way of saying you're
making the world a poorer place than it
otherwise would have been and so I found
these ideas incredibly interesting if I
it gave me a better understanding of the
world and so I read one economics book
after another after another half
or another and so I I got to read these
theories about the origin of money and
what the origin of money is and the idea
if the origin of money is that it starts
out as a commodity but not just any
commodity it has to be commodity that's
easily recognizable easily divisible
easily transportable you can store it
easily for a long time and it won't you
[Music]
in case all of you in the good old US of
A have missed the turkeys running around
for dear life this week tomorrow is
Thanksgiving without even a close second
Thanksgiving is by far my favorite
holiday of the year
I find that focusing on the three EPs
family friends and food usually brings
out the best in just about everybody
between the tryptophan from the turkey
your booze of choice and football in the
background all of us at least in my
experience are just a little bit better
on this day which we've set aside to
give thanks for all the goodness in our
lives
Thanksgiving is the ultimate reminder of
what it means to be American while most
of us have the usual staples of turkey
mashed potatoes stuffing and cranberry
sauce around the table we also bring in
traditions from our own cultures
ethnicities and nationalities this
blending of flavors languages and
customs from all over the world is what
makes Thanksgiving a uniquely American
holiday no offense to Canadian
Thanksgiving the melting pot that we've
created here has given more freedom to
more people from more walks of life than
any other country in the history of the
world today people still yearn to come
to America to take part in our freedom
and pretty much nobody wants to leave
America no matter how often celebrities
say that they will this doesn't mean
we're perfect or anywhere close to it
but it does mean that our tradition of
freedom based on and rooted in the
pursuit of life liberty and happiness is
a pretty good starting point for how to
build a truly liberal and tolerant
society while politics will undoubtably
be discussed around the Thanksgiving
table this year I'm gonna do my best to
try to viewer the conversation always to
what brings us together rather than what
rips us apart maybe your uncle is
pro-life and you're pro-choice maybe
your sister voted for Hillary but you
voted for Trump maybe you want low taxes
and your dad wants to redistribute
wealth whatever those differences are
they are actually the very reason that
this country is so great we all get to
have our own opinion and fight for what
we believe
Eve but beyond just the ability to be
tolerant of people who are different
from us it's more important that we can
still learn from live with and even love
people who think differently than we do
I hope you have a wonderful day tomorrow
filled with those 3 FS I mentioned
earlier friends family and food and
maybe one more F if you get lucky either
way let's give thanks tomorrow for all
the goodness we have but often forget to
even acknowledge Happy Thanksgiving to
you
and all your loved ones joining me today
is the creator of the Dilbert comic
strip author of the new book win big Lea
and a guy who seems to make some pretty
spot-on predictions scott adams welcome
back to the Reuben report thanks for
having me
before we begin I got to tell you I was
looking at these blurbs on the back of
this book how did you get these people
William Shakespeare
Mark Twain Alexander the Great Abe
Lincoln and even the Scott Adams guy I
mean how in the world did you pull this
off I stick with dead people because
they can't complain later
it's like not one of them has complained
that I've misquoted him you know Mark
Twain he said nothing about this quote
so what I saw this I thought immediately
there must be an estate for some of
these people that monitor these types of
things do you even have to think about
that does the editor or the publisher go
Scott you can't Wayne come on well
luckily my job is parody yeah and so so
I know those laws pretty well okay as
long as it's obvious parody you can do
anything you want yeah so we checked
right before you walked in we had you on
the show September 1st of 2016 about two
months before the election and when I
had you on you were one of the only
people that I thought basically was
making sense of what was going on with
Trump at the time you you didn't say you
were a trump supporter I think you
actually said you were not a trump
supporter you had sort of said the thing
about your you know in a hostage
situation with Hillary but you know
basically you were saying here's what
Trump is doing I I don't necessarily
support it I think you by the election
time you officially did support him
right
yeah the because of one issue basically
when when Clinton came out with the
a state tax plan and I realized that I
personally would pay roughly 75 cents on
every dollar I would earn for the rest
of my life which would basically make me
retire
yeah I wouldn't possibly work for that
so that that changed my mind yeah I
wasn't gonna jump into the estate tax
but I do find it one of the interesting
things I don't stand to make a windfall
from the estate tax but I find it one of
those things where it's like this money
has been taxed for someone's entire life
your money that you earn through all
your hard work has been taxed your whole
life hopefully you've made good
investments and whatever else you've
done I met at the end the government
just says okay we're gonna just
basically take more than half of it at
that point after we've already taken it
the whole time the whole tax thing
there's no way to make it fair because
there's always somebody who's gonna
complain but some things just feel less
fair and that feels more like
confiscation than tax yeah but I guess
it's easy to be one of those people that
just are like well I'm not involved in
this I don't stand to win anything of it
so why wouldn't I want to take the money
from other people right yeah yeah that's
the big problem with a democratic system
people can vote vote other people's
money into their pocket if there are
enough of a motive yeah all right so
it's a little over a year ago
that we had you on you're making some
sense of the techniques that are that
you're writing about in this book about
persuasion and what Trump is doing and
all that around that time just like two
months before the election did you
really think it was real I did really
believe that he was going to win those
weeks that we're talking about and most
of the time up to them the only time my
confidence was really shaken was at the
same time everybody else was you know
after the Access Hollywood was a
gay thing got dropped I don't think
anybody thought that day that he could
get out of that I haven't heard of one
person who said yeah that didn't bother
me at all but it was just amazing there
was so much news that that whole cycle
and so much more came after that that
even something that large didn't have
the impact it would have had because it
got lost and you know the the the
enormity of it all yeah what does that
tell you generally about truth right now
now the subtitle of your book is
persuasion in a world where facts
don't matter facts and truth have a
little something to do with each other
what does that actually tell you that
something like that could happen
regardless of whether you think it was
just something he said or locker room
talk or all that nonsense but that
things don't stick in a way yeah they
used to let me give some context for
people or new to me yeah in addition to
cartooning and writing and stuff I'm a
trained hypnotist yeah and I've been
studying persuasion in all its forms for
four decades so I was looking through
that filter and one of the things that
hypnotist learned is that people are
irrational pretty much all the time and
they just rationalize their decisions
and believe that it made sense all along
and that's the normal way of things
until you get in that mindset the whole
world looks confusing you can't
understand why you gave your good
reasons and your facts and your logic
and and the person you're talking to
didn't change their mind
so my view on the election was that our
certainly by the time that the excess
Hollywood tape dropped probably almost
every mind was made up they didn't know
why but they had made up their minds for
emotional irrational whatever reasons so
it's tough to dislodge somebody you know
he would have had to murder somebody in
public to change minds at that point
that late stage because people are
really hardened in their opinions by
then yeah what does that tell you I mean
as we're taping this this will be up
next week so a little right before
Thanksgiving we're taping this me
today's the 8th yesterday they done
right okay that sounds you're good
you're a pro what does that tell you as
I'm watching all these people on Twitter
in the last day or so with this Thank
You Hillary hashtag and all this stuff
and this continued worship of her even
though by every estimation she probably
was the worst candidate in the history
of American politics pot that might be a
bit of an overblown statement but what
is it what does that day that they're
still on this they're still on this
thing that but Rumble but consider that
statement we consider it now a given
that she was one of the worst candidates
we've ever seen prior to the election
and really maybe up right up until
election day the general thought on both
sides was this is one of the strongest
candidates we've ever seen for
everything from funding to experience to
it was
time for a for a woman people were you
know emotionally in every other way the
world was ready for that so it's only
after the fact that we've now
reinterpreted what we saw as well she
was the worst candidate ever and I don't
know if either one of those is true I
think we had two candidates who had some
real big pluses she had lots of pluses
and some real big flaws in both cases
yeah do you think that basically Trump
from before the elections oh so during
the process until now after a year of
governing basicly or ten months or so of
governing has basically used this book I
know he didn't have it but you know what
I mean like has he is this really what
he has done from beat one that you saw
before a lot of people did so you have
to understand his entire life arc starts
with going to a church where his pastor
was norman vincent peale the famous
author who wrote the power of positive
thinking and so that's that's the first
place you probably learned persuasion at
least one corner of persuasion because
in his time norman vincent peale was
actually accused the big a hypnotist he
was that influential so that optimism
you see him using it all the time to
make us think into the future when he
talks about the GDP he doesn't say well
we got 3% that's pretty good that's what
a normal president would say he says
we've got 3% but without the hurricanes
I think it would have been four we'll
probably got 4% I think we'll do better
than that he's actually talking us into
the future and if you if you consider
how an economy works unless you have
shortages of stuff and we're really you
know in a great time because we don't
have shortages of anything it's
psychology that drives it so if people
think we're heading to 4% they're gonna
invest a little bit more this year to
get ready for that and that's what makes
it 4% he's actually taking what he
learned as a child and you know that
that persuasive thinking into the future
and driving the economy that way and
then if you look at his full full range
of he you know sort of cell marketing
branding nobody doubts any of those
skills at this point and then
negotiating he wrote literally you know
authored with a co-author a book on
negotiating so
Sene persuasion from every every angle
including design you know he is the one
who I believe came up with or at least
approved the the hats and make America
great again and and I think people will
look back at this for four years and say
that was the best branding we've ever
seen yeah it's interesting to me because
you said the the positive way he speaks
and then you gave some examples but if
you listen to the just the general
narrative out there this is the most
divisive president all the time he says
all these horrible things what do you
make of that portion of him the the
Twitter portion that's fighting with
people still all the time doing things
that in my opinion are below the office
of the presidency and I say that as
someone that that I really did the
reason I wasn't surprised when Trump won
was because I actually sat down with you
right before and I listened and I
started seeing this stuff so I wasn't
thoroughly I was on Brogan Joe Rogan the
day before the election or maybe it was
election day actually and I was like
yeah I think it's possible and did I
actually change your mind on that well I
don't know that you I don't know that
you fully changed my mind but you made
me aware of what was happening I think
basically before I sat down with you I
was sort of where I think a lot of
people still are which is they're just
grabbing for anything you know what I
mean like they're just they have nothing
that they're really basing any decisions
on they see the tweets they scream about
the tweets or they don't even have a
chance to scream about the tweets
because the media gets outraged before
they can even process it and and you
sort of framed it in a way that's
basically said to me there's something
sensible about this yeah what I think
most people have kind of missed that one
of the things that is deeply important
for a persuasion is first you have to
get people's attention that's like you
know phase one at this point can can
anybody argue that he's the best we've
ever seen at getting attention all right
let's think that one even his biggest
haters might say yeah like the way he
has dominated the media and every
conversation yes
so step walk and get attention and the
way he does that because he he operates
in what I call a narrow band of
wrongness meaning that if this is
appropriate behavior he just takes it up
to this band you know with the nicknames
and the the provocative things he says
but he never goes up here where you'd
get impeached
be put in the insane asylum and start a
nuclear war if you look how long he's
been doing this and how how consistently
he stays in that narrow band of
wrongness which is persuasion perfection
because you can't look away and then
you're thinking about why he wants you
to think about now consider also that
he's also been meeting with a lot of
world leaders at this point he doesn't
do that in that context so it's clear
that he can modify his behavior to get
the effect he needs we didn't know that
for sure I'll say other people didn't
know that for sure you know when he was
running it looked a little crazy and
maybe out of control but now we've seen
the fine control he puts on it you know
on Twitter that narrowbanded wrongness
every time in real life he can modulate
everything being equal as a smart guy
and a bright guy and an author and
someone that cares about words and all
of those things putting Trump aside for
a moment would you prefer that we just
had a president that was a little more
within the common standards of decency
or seemed to really appreciate you know
I keep telling the story that I was in
DC a couple weeks ago and I went to all
the monuments I was reading all the
great things that Jefferson wrote and
George Washington all like it's very
different then when they look back and
they put Trump's tweets next to all of
it well I have I have mixed feelings for
one a lot one of the things that the
people on the left let's say the the
anti-trump errs whoever they are don't
get is how entertaining he is to his
base the people who actually like what
he's got to offer find it amazingly
entertaining and funny so the things
that people are saying oh I can't
believe he said that he's he's an
affront to all civilization that's why
it's funny it's funny because we know he
does it intentionally and we know the
effect it'll have on us or a group of
people and that's sort of the joke that
it has that effect now to answer your
question we were never offered somebody
who had his his talents and his specific
policies that appealed to a lot of
people who voted for him without the
flaws you know nobody offered the you
know the Trump without the tweets that
make people angry and I would argue that
probably 80% of the things that feel
like they're over the live actually are
functional and the 20% then there's you
know how do you mean functional gets
attention it puts a nickname on somebody
that actually takes them completely out
of the primaries we saw that with Low
Energy jab and I think the crooked
Hillary thing was was quite effective
but there are other things that are
maybe just too far you know a little
they don't have they're not so far I get
some peach but they're you know not
useful but they also don't seem to hurt
him in the long run we've seen something
we may never see again which is a
complete disconnect between approval
ratings which are terrible mm-hmm and
people's image of what the economy is
doing for example business confidence is
great yeah yeah I don't think we'll ever
see those disconnect again and it's
because of his style does that also show
you that people just don't care about
polls anymore I mean I saw a poll on
Sunday on CNN and it said you know half
of Americans don't trust Trump and I
thought well half Americans don't trust
CNN I mean that all of the nut you know
you mean it's like you guys threw all
these numbers at us before you through
all this nonsense at us before and now
you're still throwing nonsense and I
don't try I really almost trust none of
it and I it makes it harder to siphon
some truth out and now the onus is on I
was just saying a poll that was saying
that something about what people think
the leaders think of the president and
I'm thinking how do we know what leaders
in other countries think of the
president what what good is that poll
right oh yeah we're a little why is that
even relevant in an odd way you know so
if they fear us certain countries we
want them to fear us so they probably
won't like the president whether it was
Trump or Obama or anyone else well I've
been saying from the beginning one of
the big things has scared people about a
president Trump was that how our other
leader is going to deal with this guy
you know is are they going to be
frightened will they make them you know
the nucleus just in case no problem so
far it turns out that if you're the
President of the United States and you
have good table manners when you when
you talk to other leaders there's
there's nothing that they would rather
do than deal with you because it's in
their best interest and it works so I
listen to you
on Sam Harris's podcast and Sam
obviously been here a bunch of times I
find him to be one of the brightest and
most thoughtful people that I know you
guys obviously differ greatly on the on
the Trump thing probably more than
anything else but when you hear him make
a couple of those arguments
[Music]
joining me today is the creator of the
Dilbert comic strip author of the new
book win big Li and a guy who seems to
make some pretty spot-on predictions
Scott Adams welcome back to the Reuben
report thanks for having me before we
begin I got to tell you I was looking at
these blurbs on the back of this book
how did you get these people William
Shakespeare
Mark Twain Alexander the Great Abe
Lincoln and even the Scott Adams guy I
mean how in the world did you pull this
off I stick with dead people because
they can't complain later it's like not
one of them has complained that I've Mis
quoted him you know Mark Twain he said
nothing about this quote so what I saw
this I thought immediately there must be
in a state for some of these people that
monitor these types of things do you
even have to think about that does the
editor or the publisher go Scott you
can't Wayne come on well luckily my job
is parody yeah and so so I know those
laws pretty well okay as long as it's
obvious parody you can do anything you
want yeah so we checked right before he
walked in we had you on the show
September 1st of 2016 about two months
before the election and when I had you
on you were one of the only people that
I thought basically was making sense of
what was going on with Trump at the time
you you didn't say you were a trump
supporter I think you actually said you
were not a trump supporter you had sort
of said the thing about you were you
know in a hostage situation with Hillary
but you know basically you were saying
here's what Trump is doing I I don't
necessarily support it I think you by
the election time you officially did
support him right
yeah the because of one issue basically
when when Clinton came out with the the
estate tax plan and I realized that I
personally would pay roughly 75 cents on
every dollar I would earn for the rest
of my life which would basically make me
retire yeah I wouldn't possibly work for
that so that that changed my mind yeah I
wasn't gonna jump into the estate tax
but I do find it one of the interesting
things I don't stand to make a windfall
from the estate tax but I find it one of
those things where it's like this money
has been taxed for someone's entire life
your money that you earn through all
your hard work has been taxed your whole
life hopefully you've made good
investments
whatever else you've done I met at the
end the government just says okay we're

of that I haven't heard of one person
who said yeah that didn't bother me at
all but it was just amazing there was so
much news that that whole cycle and so

listen to you on Sam Harris's podcast
and Sam obviously been here a bunch of
times I find him to be one of the
brightest and most thoughtful people
that I know you guys obviously differ
greatly on the on the Trump thing
probably more than anything else but
when you hear him make a couple of those
arguments
whichever one you can pick any one does
any of it get to you does any of it you
know the the moral Center just what the
what's really going on if things really
escalated with North Korea you can pick
one out of the bag well for those who
didn't hear my conversation with Sam
yeah I knew
Podcast i was not addressing the moral
ethical dimension because i figured
people are on their own for that in
other words my moral center is not much
different than everybody else's i have
exactly the same preferences if you
could do things without lying without
insulting people of course i prefer that
but nobody gave us that choice you know
we didn't get that candidate we had to
leave the choices that we had so I think
there was there's an illusion that Sam
and I disagreed on the ethical moral
stuff I simply take the position fair
yeah right because it really wasn't
addressed specifically you know was it
wasn't directly asked I don't think I
take the position that if if if a
terrorist was holding your child and the
only way I could save him is lying to
the terrorists I will lie to the
terrorists to save your child now if you
wouldn't I'm not sure that you can claim
a moral high-ground
there are some situations such as
beating Isis you know having a good
economy these are fantastically good
things for human beings if you had if
the only way you could get there is
bends bend some truths then I'm a little
bit more flexible about that but I don't
think my moral look on this is any
different than anybody else's yeah but
what about just the concerns that Sam
and others like the people that are the
real critics oh forget it forget we can
put Sam aside because I don't know if
people haven't listened to it it's not
important but when you hear people say
well Trump is so erratic and he's
dealing with an erratic leader in North
Korea and all of those things you you
basically think that that's all just
playing that that other higher bar this
way and that in reality we're still
doing well well we could talk about
North Korea separately cuz that's really
kind of it there's nothing like that
that's sort of its own situation and at
the moment I think he's handling that
right well let's talk about that yeah
what do you think about North Korea
so for however many decades we haven't
really had any progress because we they
promised things and then they don't do
them this is probably the first time
that little rocket man shall we call him
is literally worried that he'll be dead
in the next 30 days I don't think
they've ever had that thought before
and that's gotta help in the
negotiations now if you're thinking but
[Music]
one of the things we consistently talk
about here at the Rubin report is why
it's important to judge people as
individuals and not as a collective you
as an individual are much more than your
immutable characteristics be it your
skin color your religion or your
sexuality to judge you on those
characteristics is actually what the
essence of prejudice really is prejudice
of course means to prejudge so if you
look at a black person or a Muslim
person or a gay person and think that
you know what they think or more
importantly how they should think based
on those characteristics then you are
actually the one who's being prejudiced
sadly many of the people who accuse
others of bigotry and racism these days
are often the people who practice this
brand of prejudice the most without even
realizing that they're doing so just
look at some of the things that my
friends larry elder Maajid Nawaz and
ayaan Hirsi Ali are called
by the so called tolerance side when you
look at a group of people and you think
you know what they should think or
what's best for them based on those
outward characteristics and not what's
going on in their own minds you not only
lock people into your preconceived
notions of what they are but stifle the
voices of the minorities within these
minorities this is why the voices of
black conservatives and gay Muslims for
example are so relevant and interesting
today if you really listen to these
minorities within the minorities you
will judge these people on their
thoughts their logic and their reason
instead of simply how they look or who
they love in a way the very existence of
these free thinkers within these
minority communities flips identity
politics on its head showing the flaws
of this postmodern intersectional way of
thinking just see how quickly those who
preach identity politics turn on black
or Latino people who have conservative
political beliefs or how easily they
dismiss gays or women who dare talk
about how poorly they're treated in
Islamic societies identity politics only
works if you believe that the most
important quality about each of us are
the attributes which we are born with
thus cannot change rather than the ideas
which we come to learn I view this
twisted ideology as a true
essential danger for the tolerant and
liberal albeit flawed country that
America is Martin Luther King Junior's
desire for his children to be judged by
the content of their character and not
the color of their skin is being
undermined by the very people who
purport to be the tolerant ones
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is
the CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College
Fund Johnny C Taylor the organization
represents nearly three hundred thousand
students who attend the 47 historical
black colleges in America today
I heard Johnny speak at an event in
Dallas a couple months ago and was blown
away by his passion his commitment to
educating young people and his desire to
move past identity politics we're going
to talk about politics race and much
more has the role of the black college
changed as we've become a more fair and
just society that's just one of the many
questions I'll ask Johnny and I'll only
judge him by the content of his answers
not the color of his skin
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is
the president and CEO of the Thurgood
Marshall scholarship fund the only
national organization representing the
nearly three hundred thousand students
attending America's 47 historically
black colleges Johnny C Taylor welcome
to the Reuben report so glad to be here
I got to tell you man I and I just did
tell you but now I'll repeat it since
the cameras are on you we've been doing
this thing with learn Liberty for a
little over a year so and they've sent
us some great authors and professors and
thinkers I've never requested any one
you sir
are the first person I requested because
I saw you speak a couple months back at
a conference for academics had to do a
lot about free speech and liberty and
all sorts of things and you gave the
keynote address on the final night and I
thought this guy is possibly the most
passionate speaker I've ever seen in my
life thank you
where does that passion come from well
let's start there before we even talk
about what you do just the passion that
you had I was just like that I gotta get
that guy on the show so yours
interesting I spent my career in the
entertainment space the media space
Paramount Pictures Spelling
entertainment blockbuster entertainment
so all of
life was doing that kind of stuff making
money that's right but I always had this
yearning for the community and and how
higher education could play into in you
know sort of fixing what was going on in
my community and I say the community I
mean all of Americans but particularly
african-americans and there were so many
conversations that didn't occur weren't
allowed to occur and so I took this new
role at the Thurgood Marshall College
Fund representing black colleges I
didn't attend a black college I often
say I'm a beneficiary of it because so
many of my teachers and doctors and
lawyers did but I didn't my parents
didn't attend a black college but I
thought this was such an opportunity to
come in and really begin to influence
how young people you know our future
leaders how they think about the world
and then to challenge them my legal
education by definition sort of taught
me to challenge the status quo to be
able to argue both sides or in some
instances three sides of any argument
and so that's what came from I really I
don't sleep at night sometimes thinking
about where America is headed and that's
where the passion comes from I'm
genuinely concerned about where we're
going yeah I feel that too and we kind
of hit that a little bit before now we
got to do it all over right now tell me
a little bit more about your resume
before we get to what you've been doing
these last couple years because yeah you
just mentioned some of us up I mean
you've got a pretty prime your Lincoln's
got to be pretty fast in the last
somewhat like eight pages that's right
god is good but tell me a little bit
about that because I think it does form
sort of you know how you end up sitting
across from me here yes so I began my
career well let me back up I did the
undergraduate work in the University of
Miami I'm a born and raised in Florida
so I'm for you I gotta give my shout out
to my school and even I finished school
went to law school in Iowa Drake
University and I came back to South
Florida to practice at a big law firm
Janet Reno was one of my was the first
female partner so I'm hating myself it
takes your way back yeah and then began
my practice sat on a plane one day now
met a I did not know at the time a
billionaire wayne Huizenga who had this
small little business called blockbuster
that he was building I went in as the
third lawyer on staff and
we went through this huge acquisition
spree and you know you remember
blockbuster was on every corner yeah so
did that Vikon bought us so I've spent
my time as a lawyer as an HR executive
and then ultimately once Vikon bought us
and worked for Sumner at Viacom Sumner
Redstone and then my last corporate gig
was running a business a subsidiary for
Barry Diller in New York so I literally
have had all the back office functions
and then ran front line operator running
a business for Barry yeah came to TMC up
in 2010 as the CEO so you've been doing
this for now about seven years and
you're actually about to shift onto
something else which will which we'll
get to a little later yes but tell me a
little bit about what the scholarship
fund actually does what is the purpose
because I know a certain amount of
people because I know a lot of your
thoughts on on the diversity memo and
all that stuff it almost sounds counter
to what the Thurgood Marshall
scholarship fund might do right so the
college fund was actually created by the
way we were created as the scholarship
fund Thurgood Marshall scholarship fund
about a decade ago we changed the name
to broaden the remit to the College Fund
so they're good Marshall college fund
and we really only do four things
scholarships we provide scholarships for
the absolutely most talented students so
this is not sort of a social services
feel-good for kids who didn't get a shot
K through 12 these are the brightest
kids who frankly just have money not
what they need so scholarships that are
needed and sort of need and merit-based
then capacity building we've talked with
our schools a lot about there was a time
when HBCUs captive market if you were
black anyone to go to college you
attended a black college well everything
changed be careful what you pray for we
asked for diversity we got it we asked
for integration we got it and so now
black students have options and so black
colleges the historically black colleges
have got to step up so the second thing
is to build their capacity to be
attracted the third thing that we do is
government affairs I mean a lot of
advocacy and policy work to make sure
that we're not making emotional
decisions we want to do what is good for
our communities and what's good for this
country those are really the three
things that we focus on as as a fund and
that's
work that we do and the thing that that
most of the folks frankly don't realize
is historically black colleges are not
EBC use they're not exclusively black
colleges in fact or currently four of
our member schools aren't majority white
really majority white so they are still
historically black colleges because the
H is historically black no necessarily
currently black yeah so West Virginia
State in Bluefield State College both in
West Virginia Lincoln University in
Missouri Kentucky State these are
schools that while technically are not
technically are actually HBCUs are have
more white students than black students
and those are some of the things that
people don't understand this is not
about race per se yeah
how much battling is there over what it
means to be historically black versus
currently diverse because I would
imagine you've got you know ideas and
and academics and administrators who are
probably pretty entrenched in keeping
things just looking at it by numbers not
necessarily diversity of thought that's
and all that so you must be dealing with
that constant oh you have no idea ugly
and it's interesting because I'm
surprised and I know we'll talk about
some of this but I'm surprised at the
number you'd like to think millenials
you know we think Millennials and we
group the men in their open and they're
diverse in their well I was surprised
we've had some students really not
faculty not alumni but students 18 your
19 year olds take great issue with the
fact that the institutions are more
diverse than they were they wanted to
come to an all-black institution anyway
get there and realize that we have
international students and white
students and Hispanic students they
really push back so that's been a real
surprise to me yeah how do you break
through that well you you continue first
of all you explain to them that HBCU is
not EB C you then you start with it and
then you also then explain I find myself
to often times when I'm talking to them
saying let me just put yourself in this
situation so just recently one of our
campuses really what does a group of
students were really upset because in
fact it was all of the national news
well students came on the campus of
Howard University wearing the make
America great again oh yeah that's right
and I said I just wanted the student
leaders that pull to the status I don't
want you just for a second to ask me how
you think this would play out group of
black students right after Obama
selected go visit Liberty University's
campus they have on the wonderful Obama
t-shirts where they're proud of this new
president and they were literally run
off of campus they were threatened they
were harassed how do you think that will
go over and so what I find myself doing
is just literally put yourself in that
situation and tell me why this is that
different and then you get that pause
that moment by the way that's what
motivates me to do my work because
that's the way you influence the sort of
the narrative yeah and how these young
people think you have to just stop and
say I get how you feel right now
emotionally about this but for just a
second let's flip the script and tell me
how this works and you're smart you're
bright yeah tell me how this works out
that's that's really part of what
motivates me to do the work yeah and
that's what we need more right I mean
because everybody seems hysterics
hysterical over over emotionals that's
like it's see like I can understand that
if I if I was black and I wanted to go
to a historically black college and I
got there and I thought it was gonna be
80% black and I got there and I was like
wait a minute I'm actually still a
minority here the the emotional part I
can understand it being like this
doesn't feel right to me but then when
you hear that and you go what things
actually are changing integration is
really this is this is all good this is
this is the purpose right I'm free to
pray for right you know I often say be
careful what you pray for this is
exactly what we said we wanted is the
opportunity to choose kind of that's
what I can tell you that's what my
great-grandparents yeah that's what my
got in fact Thurgood Marshall himself
well folks don't realize this Thurgood
Marshall didn't choose to go to Howard
University Law School Thurgood Marshall
fact of the matter is applied to the
University of Maryland was denied
admission to that law school well I went
to Howard because it was the college for
black students law students for black
students and so you just have to think
about it he then subsequently brought
lawsuits to actually stop that very
thing again this was an anti HBCU the
message was I want to be able to choose
irrespective of my skin color where I go
to school so all of us should have
predicted that we would be right where
we are today yeah what I find is
young folks just don't understand the
history and then the older people
refused to tell the animist so what's
going on there because I don't play
there is so much nonsense the media is
so complicit in this yes I I don't you
know and identity Pollock says has
become so rooted in everything that I
don't blame the young people who are
misguided yeah I want to get through to
them and and all that it's the other
people that are talking with the older
people and the academics that are afraid
to speak what happened there did you see
it change i I did I saw it you know and
and where when I was in school you're
encouraged to be a little bit of a
provocateur always respectfully you
never there was no no one wanted you to
go out and hurt someone's feelings but
we were encouraged in law school for
example to look at things from all
different sorts of perspectives I was
given a case once where you'd have to
represent the plaintiff and then turn
around and go against that winner
you know defend them so we've just lost
that in education now and I gotta tell
you more and more I'm talking to
students who say you know I feel a
certain way but I know that if I either
utter those my thoughts even in a
question format in the classroom I'd be
attacked by from my professor it would
impact my participation in class Green
that that portion of my grade also and
more importantly what do you say to kids
I say when they say that perhaps you're
at the wrong school I said you got a
vote with your feet College is not about
it's supposed to be a time to explore
and to grow if you already knew what you
needed to know to sort of live in life
and be successful then you don't need to
spend five or six years and hundreds of
thousands of dollars if you aren't the
same person that you walked in the door
at the end of your freshman year then
you were cheated yeah and I tell them
you should challenge the institution and
give you a better education and
sometimes that the way you get better is
to have to confront ideas that you don't
necessarily embrace you don't understand
them one situation that that sort of
comes up and I think it helps my
students a lot understand where I come
from I said you know listen I was an
employment lawyer early in my career and
at that time there was a big question
for example around whether or not gay
lesbian sexual orientation was covered
under title seven okay big question
gender and sex was clear if
you were being discriminated against on
the basis of something else than sort of
sexual orientation that wasn't covered I
actually brought those cases and made
those arguments I defended them that was
not the intent of the Congress and this
was ridiculous
etc even that gender is something that's
innate you're born that way and well gay
and lesbian maybe not so much
fast forward yeah we're here early
that's 1992 ok I think it's important
that's right to context that's right put
it in context now fast forward you began
to evolve and grow you start sitting
down and getting to know people who are
different than you are or that your
family is or that you you just you began
to evolve and it challenges your own
notions of what is right and what is
wrong and maybe you conclude there is no
right or wrong here this is just life
that we're evolving as a human species
kind of even I've had to do that and
there's so many instances of that in my
own life and so when you begin to have
conversations in the context of the
classroom with students you see the
growth that's the beauty that should be
the beauty of it instead what I'm seeing
more and more davidís they're actually
retarding the grad students you're not
encouraged to think you come in thinking
a certain way your professors want you
to think a certain way your institution
wants you to think a certain way but
here's the problem the real problem is
then you go to work and you have to
confront the reality of you know you're
not protected in this bubble you've got
to live and work next to people who
don't look like you and frankly that's a
chalice is something that people talk
about a lot when they talk about black
colleges the only I don't question the
relevancy of HBCUs I think that's a dumb
argument it's a dumb question there is a
fair question
that is posed if you have gone to a
black elementary school middle school
grew up in a black community and then
you went to a black college the first
meaningful interaction that you can add
with people who are not black is in the
workplace you're gonna be at a
disadvantage
yeah just practically speaking and so
you it has some downside tons of upside
by the way being a majority and minority
community black colleges give you a very
[Music]
alright let's shift a little bit to some
specific issues cuz I think we've done a
nice little broad okay job to start here
you mentioned to me briefly something
about daca that I thought was really
interesting how the black community is
sort of split on this can yeah yeah you
know daca is on its surface isn't easy
it should be easy but what I've come
talking about the complexity of and the
nuances so increasingly our students on
HBCU campuses are raising they have real
beef with this is the way they described
it said one of the students put it in it
made me pause cuz I was like that's an
easy one you're not gonna send to a
million people home these kids were
brought here by their parents didn't
have a choice if I tell my daughter
we're going somewhere she's gone right
so that's what it is so I get it yeah
and then one of the young women put it
best she said you know think about the
she called it she said the irony of this
is that they're very the America is our
rallying around providing not only the
ability for these students to enroll in
school but oftentimes full scholarships
for these students the daca students Wow
she said and Here I am the legal
descendant of slaves we were forced to
come here and I have to figure out how
to pay for my education and so there's
this tension there's real tension and
they have to whisper it so I asked her I
said well why don't you just talk about
that in class and she said oh I would be
killed that you can't talk about that in
class she said but there's an
underground sort of conversation about
that doesn't seem that there if America
has enough money to provide additional
scholarship assistance to students then
shouldn't you take care of people like
us who were brought here our parents
were brought here and we truly are and
so I was like wow that's really it was a
really hadn't thought about it yeah made
me pause there's also a recent article I
think it's the Chicago times where a guy
wrote an editorial about Rahm Emanuel
wants to spend 1 or 2 million dollars on
providing IDs for undocumented
immigrants and the black aldermen had a
meltdown I mean literally is quoted all
over the papers saying this is a
and enough so enough we have Americans
here african-americans in Chicago who
need XY and Z and instead you want to go
spend a bit so there's a tension America
is that a really inflection point that's
just not black and white or conservative
and liberal there's tension now amongst
people of color yeah and it seems to me
that obviously that conversation is good
and it's nice to hear that a student
said something to you that made you
reevaluate because that shows you
practice what you preach obviously
that's right is there some is there
who's the leader right now if there I
know I know you probably get this one
all the time and I don't even like the
question in a certain way no but I can
but but who should black America
whatever that is it's so it's so stupid
talking about that stuff like who should
be in your opinion should the black
community be turning to to make some
sense of this because there's the usual
cast of characters right and we can name
all the ones that you don't like that
are on MSNBC today and I don't like them
either so let's just forget those guys
but others some people that we should be
looking at that and I don't even mean
just black America but no for people
that really care that's very that's
right about freedom so you make the good
point I don't even know America
generally you know that we can identify
someone who is sane and rational and
logical and thoughtful but in the
african-american community you've nailed
it I we had a generation of leaders and
they were right for that era and what
was going on fast forward 20 30 years
I'm not sure and I've actually sat with
a group of my counterparts you know 40s
successful and said who's the leader
who's the voice what voice captures
what's happening in afternoon American
community about to be fair it's not
monolithic African of course you know
like any other that's why I don't write
that's why we don't like it yeah but it
was never monolithic but we had leaders
Martin Luther King was a leader although
you know he he wasn't from industry he
didn't you know so but still he
represented just he caught and captured
the voice of the community I have to
honestly say and it's something that
bothers me I don't know who that person
is and and I'm not so sure that if you
asked him like people none of them would
say I'm not sure who that leader is yeah
and it's so complex because do you
remember a couple years ago when Oprah
said the thing about how
what we just need these old racists to
die and issues referee
she was referencing some people's
grandmothers and grandfathers and I
remember thinking and I have no beef
with old but I remember hearing that and
thinking this is so dangerous it gets
back to what we were talking about
earlier about how you just live in your
times and all that like no one wants to
look at their grandparents who live grew
up in a different time thing I don't
wait till you just drop dead so you
can't vote anymore with the and it makes
me think huh you know I had as my
grandmother taught school 46 years in
Brown County Florida and I remembered
she said something to me now and I think
the world of my grandmother she's still
like 93 years old 94 just had a birthday
and I remembered going down to the
University of Miami and I came home and
I was said I think I've met someone and
it was she assumed it was a white woman
because I'm in a majority institution
you know Lily white University of Miami
and she said son I'd rather you bring a
man home Allan
now this is someone who I adore and I
think the world of her but I had to stop
and pause her stuck me I remember that
I'd rather you bring a man home than a
white woman and I had to realize that a
lot of folks hold these racial so that
things and they are products of their
era like right so when I see you know an
older 90 year old lady or old white guy
who has and harbors some racial animus I
wasn't around then I can't really put
that in context I'm not justifying it
I'm not saying it's right or wrong but
what I am saying to your earlier point
is I love my grandmother and if you
tried to attack my grandmother because
she espoused that worldview
I would attack you yeah because I look
at the totality of her contributions to
this country and her her racist
tendencies are one a product of the
error that she grew up in but they are
also a very very small part of the full
woman that I know yes and that's the key
part everyone wants to define everybody
said earlier you could figure out
something that you did when you were 18
but something that I did when I was 26
and go man
right exactly but that's that's the
point that we're just pieces that's
right of all of this easy to and that's
that's a problem we just want to
collapse on the one thing that someone
did that's by the way unpopular now what
do you think Martin Luther King would
would think about the identity politics
stuff it's I I would like to think and
by the way I say that because you read
so many versions of what Martin fought
I've heard people say he was a
Republican and I've heard people help
he's a womanizer he's of this you just
don't know yeah I think you can make
interesting argument sometimes that he
was a conservative and now he doesn't
want his children to be judged by the
color of their skin that actually sounds
a little more like a conservative idea
because that's not an identity politics
idea yeah a lot of his economic stuff
was bearing more towards socialism in a
way so I think you can argue both but I
think on balance I think he would I
believe that he would be looking he's
looking down saying you know no system
is perfect no set of rules is perfect
but this is a lot better people today
than it was what we inherited back then
mmm-hmm is far worse than what you have
today so why don't we look at the
progress that was made and figure out
how we build on it I'd like to think
that because this nature was one of
working together finding commonality and
peaceful protests
you know people now you know not
allowing people to talk when you
disagree with them literally shouting
them down
think about that era when Martin Luther
King we were the minority then we're
clearly I mean really in a literally
they they could have silenced him by
yelling and shouting him down and
somehow the country allowed that voice
to - and people embraced it because they
listened to it even people who were
probably not inclined to agree with him
you know for that at that time yeah but
by listening they said huh maybe he's
done to something and it really piqued
their heart it got to the heart and said
you know what I'm this is probably not
the right way to think about my fellow
Americans it was because they listened
but if you aren't even being if you
can't hear if you're unwilling to listen
Martin has to be
and right now yeah yeah that I was just
at the mind minute I was telling you I
was just in DC gone all these things and
that's what I felt I just felt things
have gotten so much better for everybody
it doesn't let me right there isn't
racism it doesn't mean some people don't
like gay people or any of those things
but we are laws basically are fair yes
and it's like where else are they doing
it better that's right well are you
gonna move somewhere and I said the same
thing right after even after the Trump
election you know I remembered all those
folks if he's elected I'm leaving the
country
no she's still here right all of these
folks who Rosie named the group who all
thought they're gonna leave the country
I'm like you're not going anywhere
I don't want to go too far down the
Trump thing unless you want to go there
but no but do you think that whatever is
happening with him right now and as you
said as we're taping this today metaphor
it was was indicted by the FBI it sounds
like it's not even directly about the
Trump all right aim that it's about some
Ukraine stuff before but but we'll see
where all that plays out but as a
general rule what do you make of what's
happened because to me what I keep
trying to say is if you just let go of
the tweets for a minute you're like over
the media hysteria basically nothing bad
has happened basically well two things
first of all you'll leave on I know it's
hard to get rid of it no no you've only
had eight months up so yeah nothing bad
could really happen in eight months see
anyway this is a republic that has been
around for a very long time it's gonna
be around a long time after you so
that's the beginning the other thing is
it goes back to smiie do thing if you
are continually there's a barrage of
information that says everything this
person does is bad at some point you
believe it mm-hmm right and I think
that's a part of it he's trying to
figure it out
could he stay off the tweet a little bit
Twitter off yes yeah could he be a
little bit more presidential hell he
admitted it this weekend when he said
that but I'm about to say about Michael
Moore great well news alert President
Trump
several of those sorts of things have
not been president I'm glad you're
acknowledging yeah but no way he can't
though great because that's what got him
there that's what's got him there and
that that's what people forget it worked
and frankly as much as we talk about
he's not reflecting America yes he does
he
you know 43 million Americans voted for
him 46 for Hillary and people don't
factor the sin but three million Hillary
won the state of great state of
California or though by 3 million votes
people forget that so pull those that 3
million person spread was like here yeah
well for the record I in California
voted for Gary Johnson judge me however
you and all to another judge me however
you want but I suspect you would have
liked a lot of the ideas of Gary I did
in fact I did yeah but you know we knew
he wasn't gonna win
so that's a whole different conversation
but I but I I'm in California it didn't
matter which right that's like me in
Washington DC yeah oh yeah I know for
the Democratic candidate was gonna win
full-stop right yeah and again that gets
back to the issue this country is just
you're you're in one camp or the other
and it is when you think 46 and 43
million people
we're calling we really divided I mean I
just don't even know where the center is
anymore mm-hmm that's that's troubling
so to me the center basically is
somewhat economically conservative in
that yes you earn your money you should
keep it and I thought sorry always argue
that's the best way if you hate Trump
the best way to limit government is to
stop giving it so much money and power
it's right because sometimes you know
what you might get Bernie and he can use
a lot of power that you like but then
sometimes you're gonna get a guy you
don't like so let's just stop giving
them so much power but in a weird way
does this all show that our system is
working properly well that's you know
you mentioned earlier this is it's not a
perfect system but I don't there's no
other place in the world I'd rather be I
thank God every day when I wake up and
and so you know that I'm here and
because we could have all been born
somewhere else and this could have been
a really bad situation it's not a
perfect union but we're working towards
it and that's the optimism but it's only
if we have conversations like this the
two of us this doesn't appear on
mainstream television oh by the way
that's the thing that I gotta figure out
how to get you up and let me be your age
all right but we have to get out believe
you could do it I don't even know that I
want it but I believe they really could
because this voice is what's missing
you're either MSNBC or Fox News you're
Rachel or you're Hannity
and that by the way doesn't get us any
closer to fixing this because people
then divide out yeah that's what we've
got to do because rational people can I
think reasonable people can come to some
conclusions that this is good for all of
us
yeah you know relating this to sort of
where we started as you're saying this
I'm thinking you know there's something
interesting here if this identity
politics stuff wins the day and they
start taking down more monuments and we
start judging Thomas Jefferson and the
rest of the founders on the morals of
today it's not just that we'll remove
them but we'll actually all of their
good ideas all of their good ideas will
have to go away
they won't even if you like a lot of
those good ideas you mean like they
won't just magically keep some of the
ideas what you're gonna actually remove
all of those ideas and then what are we
left to it and it ain't pretty right and
it's not America that that's the reality
it's not America and that's something
that we've all got to come to grips with
is that this is not a good direction the
trajectory is all wrong I'm pleased to
say and all of us in the markets are
performing the financially you'll do
well but by the way if you don't have
any money you're not participating in
the markets anyway you're right right so
people like the two of us we're gonna do
fine yeah and our families and
significant others and stakeholders all
gonna do fine it's the rest of these
folks who being left out and they
unfortunately are buying into this
narrative that America is bad and
somehow the magic fix is to tax the
wealthy like oh where does that end like
oh and so is there is the appeal of that
just because it's sort of lazy thinking
you know you mean like it just doesn't
take much to be like I want what
somebody else has like it's kind of an
easy answer like I don't have somebody
all got they should give me some of that
like you don't have to think that hard
relax it to think harder to understand
why you shouldn't or don't deserve
someone else's money let's see I don't I
and why maybe but it's also equally lazy
to think if I were you know a
millionaire I wouldn't want to give more
of my money than someone else if I
earned it yeah even if I bought a
freaking lottery ticket you know just
basic take some person who's from a free
who's got limited resources and you say
to them you won the lottery tomorrow you
won two million dollars five million of
it goes to the federal government in
your state how does that make you bad
yes that's lazy I mean you don't think a
lot to say that's not a good result
right yeah
so I don't know why this is I don't know
that it's easy I think it's we have just
pounded into people's heads that taking
that the rich people are bad you're
vilified for going to work every day and
making some good decisions and some luck
and some God and some fate all of that
in the totality you're bad for having
done well and the media plays it
consistent they love it you believe it
yeah you believe it what do you think is
the right amount of government for us to
have as much as we need I know that's
not a great answer but I would literally
I'm sort of concerned not sort of I'm
very conservative in that respect I
don't think you can have no government
cuz then you have an R key we need so
you know what Mad Max right I don't want
that I mean if my house burns down I
want a police department to show if I
don't have to rely on my three neighbors
or the buckets to come so I've got a
fire department to show up so I think
government the infrastructure is
important of any society that will
endure I do think that we've gotten too
far though when you have just huge
bureaucracy and departments designed to
solve problems that frankly will solve
themselves amongst people yeah but we
become completely dependent on it is
there any way to scale it back that's
one of the questions I try to ask a lot
of my more libertarian guests yes like
it seems like this this thing has gotten
so big and when you factor it in with
you know handouts and all of this stuff
that if you were ever to take it back a
lot of people think will you just be
screwing over all the poor people all
that then I have some people who come on
and say no you just cut it tomorrow and
we see what happens will charities come
in will churches and synagogues and
mosques and all that will they pick up
the slack you know will if you cut the
funding to Planned Parenthood would
Barbra Streisand and Rosie and the rest
of them suddenly put some of their money
towards that I tend to think the answer
is yes me too
I do but how do you how do you get that
point across to people well they're not
going to do it unless force to do it so
I think so that's something to be said
for just
stop I mean what we saw Puerto Rico is a
classic example we're all forced you
know worried about what's happening in
Puerto Rico but this didn't start with a
hurricane mm-hmm Puerto Rico was a
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty today and joining me is
the president and CEO of the Thurgood
Marshall scholarship fund the only
national organization representing the
nearly three hundred thousand students
attending America's forty seven
historically black colleges Johnny C
Taylor
welcome to the Reuben report so glad to
be here I got to tell you man I and I
just did tell you about now I'll repeat
it since the cameras are on you we've
been doing this thing with learn Liberty
for a little over a year or so and
they've sent us some great authors and
professors and thinkers I've never
requested anyone you sir
are the first person I requested because
I saw you speak a couple months back at
a conference for academics had to do a
lot about free speech and liberty and
all sorts of things and you gave the
keynote address on the final night and I
thought this guy is possibly the most
passionate speaker I've ever seen in my
life thank you
where does that passion come from well
let's start there before we even talk
about what you do just the passion that
you had I was just like that I gotta get
that guy on the show
so it's interesting I spent my career in
the entertainment space the media space
Paramount Pictures Spelling
entertainment blockbuster entertainment
so all of my life was doing that kind of
stuff making money right but I always
had this yearning for the community and
and how higher education could play into
in you know sort of fixing what was
going on in my community and I say the
community I mean all of Americans but
particularly african-americans and there
were so many conversations that didn't
occur weren't allowed to occur and so I
took this new role at the Thurgood
Marshall College Fund representing black
colleges I didn't attend a black college
I often say I'm a beneficiary of it
because so many of my teachers and
doctors and lawyers did but I didn't my
merits didn't attend to black college
but I thought this was such an
opportunity to come in and really begin
to influence how young people you know
our future leaders how they think about
the world and then to challenge them my
legal education by definition sort of
taught me to challenge the status quo to
be able to argue both sides or in some
instances three sides of any argument
and so that's what came from I really I
don't sleep at night sometimes thinking
about where America is headed and that's
where the passion comes from I'm
genuinely concerned about where we're
going yeah I feel that too and we kind
of hit that a little bit before now we
got to do it all over right now tell me
a little bit more about your resume
before we get to what you've been doing
these last couple years because yeah you
just mentioned some of us up I mean
you've got a pretty prime your
linkedin's got to be pretty fast in the
last somewhat like eight pages that's
right god is good
but tell me a little bit about that cuz
I think it does form sort of you know
how you end up sitting across from me
here yes so I began my career well let
me back up I did the undergraduate work
in the University of Miami I'm a born
and raised in Florida so I'm for you I
gotta give my shout out to my school and
even I finished school went to law
school in Iowa Drake University and I
came back to South Florida to practice
at a big law firm Janet Reno was one of
my was the first female partner so I'm
hating myself it takes your way back
yeah and then began my practice sat on a
plane one day melt met a I did not know
at the time a billionaire wayne Huizenga
who had this small little business
called blockbuster that he was building
I went in as the third lawyer on staff
and literally we went through this huge
acquisition spree and you know you
remember blockbuster was on every corner
in Seville yeah so did that Vikon bodice
so I've spent my time as a lawyer as an
HR executive and then ultimately once
vikon bought us and worked for some
there at Vikon Sumner Redstone and then
my last corporate gig was running a
business a subsidiary for Barry Diller
in New York so I literally have had all
the back office functions and then ran
front line operator running a business
for Barry yeah came to TMC up in 2010 as
the CEO so you've been doing this for
now about seven years and you're
actually about to shift onto something
else between which we'll get to a little
later yes but tell me a little bit about
what the scholarship fund actually does
what is the purpose because I know a
certain amount of people because I know
a lot of your thoughts on on the
diversity memo and all that stuff it
almost sounds counter to what the
Thurgood Marshall scholarship fund might
do right so the the college fund was
actually created by the way we were
created as the scholarship fund
Thurgood Marshall scholarship fund about
a decade ago we changed the name to
broaden the remit to the college fund
since they're good Marshall college fund
and we really only do four things
scholarships we provide scholarships for
the absolutely most talented students so
this is not sort of a social services
feel-good for kids who didn't get a shot
K through 12 these are the brightest
kids who frankly just have money not
what they need so scholarships that are
needed and sort of need and merit-based
then capacity building we've talked with
our schools a lot about there was a time
when HBCUs captive market if you were
black anyone to go to college you
attended a black college well everything
changed be careful what you pray for we
asked for diversity we got it we asked
for integration we got it and so now
black students have options and so black
colleges the historically black colleges
have got to step up so the second thing
is to build their capacity to be
attractive the third thing that we do is
government affairs I mean a lot of
advocacy and policy work to make sure
that we're not making emotional
decisions we want to do what is good for
our communities and what's good for this
country those are really the three
things that we focus on as as a fund and
that's the work that we do and the thing
that that most of the folks frankly
don't realize is historically black
colleges are not EBC used they're not
exclusively black colleges in fact for
currently four of our member schools
aren't majority white really majority
white so they are still historically
black colleges because the H is
historically black not necessarily
currently black yeah so West Virginia
State in Bluefield State College both in
West Virginia Lincoln University in
Missouri Kentucky State these are
schools that while technically are not
technically are actually HBCUs are have
more white students than black students
and those are some of the things that
people don't understand this is not
about race per se yeah how much battling
is there over what it means to be
historically black versus currently
diverse because I would imagine you've
got you know ideas and and
hammocks and administrators who are
probably pretty entrenched in keeping
things just looking at it by numbers not
necessarily diversity of thought that's
and all that so you must be dealing with
that constant oh you have no idea ugly
and it's interesting because I'm
surprised and I know we'll talk about
some of this but I'm surprised at the
number you'd like to think millenials
you know we think Millennials and we
group the men in their open and they're
diverse in their well I was surprised
we've had some students really not
faculty not alumni but students 18 your
19 year olds take great issue with the
fact that the institutions are more
diverse than they were they wanted to
come to an all-black institution anyway
get there and realize that we have
international students and white
students and Hispanic students they
really push back so that's been a real
surprise to me yeah how do you break
through that well you you continue first
of all you explain to them that HBCU is
not EB C you then you start with it and
then you also then explain I find myself
to oftentimes when I'm talking to them
saying let me just put yourself in this
situation so just recently one of our
campuses really what does a group of
students really upset because in fact it
was all of the national news well
students came on the campus of Howard
University wearing the make America
great again oh yeah that's right and I
said I just one of the student leaders
that pull to the status I don't want you
just for a second to ask me how do you
think this will play out good for black
students right after Obama selected go
visit Liberty University's campus they
have on the wonderful Obama t-shirts
where they're proud of this new
president and they were literally run
off of campus they were threatened they
were harassed how do you think that will
go over and so what I find myself doing
is just literally put yourself in that
situation and tell me why this is that
different and then you get that pause
that moment by the way that's what
motivates me to do my work because
that's the way you influence the sort of
the narrative
yeah and how these young people think
you have to just stop and say I get how
you feel right now emotionally about
this but for just a second let's flip
the script and tell me how this works
and you're smart you're bright yeah tell
me how this works out that's that's
really part of what motivates me to do
the work yeah and that's what we need
more all right I mean because everybody
seems
hysterics hysterical over over emotional
steps like it's see like I can
understand that if I if I was black and
I wanted to go to a historically black
college and I got there and I thought it
was going to be 80% black and I got
there and I was like wait a minute I'm
actually still a minority here the the
emotional part I can understand it being
like this doesn't feel right to me but
then when you hear that and you go well
things actually are changing integration
is really this is this is all good this
is this is the purpose right freedom
prayed for right you know I often say be
careful what you pray for this is
exactly what we said we wanted is the
opportunity to choose kind of that's
what I can tell you that's what my
great-grandparents yeah that's what I
got in fact Thurgood Marshall himself
what folks don't realize this Thurgood
Marshall didn't choose to go to Howard
University Law School Thurgood Marshall
fact of the matter is applied to the
University of Maryland was denied
admission to that law school when I went
to Howard because it was the college for
black students law students for black
students and so you just have to think
about it he then subsequently brought
lawsuits to actually stop that very
thing again this was an anti HBCU the
message was I want to be able to choose
irrespective of my skin color where I go
to school so all of us should have
predicted that we would be right where
we are today yeah what I find is the
young folks just don't understand the
history and then the older people refuse
to tell the honest history so what's
going on there because I don't play
there is so much nonsense the media is
so complicit in this yes I I don't you
know and identity Pollock says has
become so rooted in everything that I
don't blame the young people who are
misguided yeah I want to get through to
that and all that it's the other people
that you're talking with the older
people and the academics that are afraid
to speak what happened there did you see
it change
I did I saw it you know and and where I
when I was in school you were encouraged
to be a little bit of a provocateur
always respectfully you never there was
no no one wanted you to go out and hurt
someone's feelings but we were
encouraged in law school for example to
look at things from all different sorts
of perspectives I was given a case once
where you'd have to represent the
plaintiff and then turn around and go
against that winner you know defend them
so we've just lost that in education now
and I got to tell you more and more I'm
talking to students who say you know I
feel a certain way but I know that if I
either utter those my thoughts even in a
question format in the classroom I'd be
attacked but from my professor it would
impact my participation in class Green
or that that portion of my grade also
and more importantly what do you say to
kids I say when they say that perhaps
you're at the wrong school I said you
got a boat with your feet College is not
about it's supposed to be a time to
explore and to grow if you already knew
what you needed to know to sort of live
in life and be successful then you don't
need to spend five or six years and
hundreds of thousands of dollars if you
aren't the same person that you walked
in the door at the end of your freshman
year then you were cheated yeah and I
tell them you should challenge the
institution and give you a better
education and sometimes that the way you
get better is to have to confront ideas
that you don't necessarily embrace you
don't understand them one situation that
that sort of comes up and I think it
helps my students a lot understand where
I come from I said you know listen I was
an employment lawyer early in my career
and at that time there was a big
question for example around whether or
not gay lesbian sexual orientation was
covered under Title 7 mm-hmm okay big
question gender and sex was clear if you
were being discriminated against on the
basis of something else than sort of
sexual orientation that wasn't covered I
actually brought those cases and made
those arguments I defended them that was
not the intent of the Congress and this
was ridiculous etc that gender is
something that's innate you're born that
way and well gay and lesbian maybe not
so much fast forward yeah what are you
early that's 1992 okay I think it's
important that's right to context that's
right put it in context now fast-forward
you began to evolve and grow you start
sitting down and getting to know people
who are different than you are or that
your family is or that you you just you
began to evolve and it challenges your
own notions of what is right and what is
wrong and maybe you conclude there is no
right or wrong here this is just life
that we're evolving as a human species
kind
even I've had to do that and there's so
many instances of that in my own life
and so when you begin to have
conversations in the context of the
classroom with students you see the
growth that's the beauty that should be
the beauty of it instead what I'm seeing
more and more davidís they're actually
retarding the grad students you're not
encouraged to think you come in thinking
a certain way your professors want you
to think a certain way your institution
wants you to think a certain way but
here's the problem the real problem is
then you go to work and you have to
confront the reality of you know you're
not protected in this bubble you've got
to live and work next to people who
don't look like you and frankly that's
the chalice is something that people
talk about a lot when they talk about
black colleges the only I don't question
the relevancy of HBCUs I think that's a
dumb argument it's a dumb question there
is a fair question
that is posed if you have gone to a
black elementary school middle school
grew up in a black community and then
you went to a black college the first
meaningful interaction that you can add
with people who are not black isn't a
workplace you're gonna be at a
disadvantage
yeah just practically speaking and so
you it has some downside tons of upside
by the way being a majority and minority
community black colleges give you a very
special and nurturing environment to
grow in but there's a cost to that yeah
is that just the natural evolution of
the way humans are that if you have a
legit grievance you may need a different
place or for Thurgood Marshall who did
not get accepted to the Maryland law
school so he needed a place to go to
completely legit in that time and place
but that eventually we if equality works
because the arc does bend towards
justice that eventually you slowly need
these things less it doesn't mean that
there's no use for them but you but a
lot of people are sort of addicted to
that original pain or instance or
whatever you want to call it like you
nailed it I mean that none of us it's
it's it's addictive I mean that's a
problem in weaning yourself off of that
is difficult and that's not limited to
black people or any group of people it's
just that you get used to it yeah and
this notion that we were to create
remember you
the concept of affirmative action was
supposed to be remedial mm-hmm it was
not supposed to go on forever right but
what happens is if you get used to it
and it's a benefit that a new verse to
you and people who look like you it's
really tough to one day say okay that's
done I have a seven-year-old daughter
and I you know there's a point at which
she's gonna come off of daddy's credit
card and she's gonna fight me
yeah if it's a teen if it's twenty eight
if it's 38 the day that I decide you now
have to leave the nest and figure this
out yourself if it's 38 came I move in
with you done right but you write your
lunch is something that that's um it's
even think about just in real life
that's the thing that I'm intrigued by
is I could not wait until I turned 18 so
that I could leave my nest to my mama
and my daddy's house and go and start
creating my own and I'm seeing some of
them for economic reasons but just
everyone sort of staying at home and
they want it's a very different world
that we live in right now and I'm
intrigued by it yeah how much of this
also is about the family in general
that's one of the things when I've had a
couple particularly in this case when
I've had black conservatives on you know
like larry elder talking about the black
family you just mentioned your mom and
your dad so i suspect they're still
married no they're not no okay so that
that's interesting but they were for
obviously most of us back childhood how
much of that structure is related to all
of this why then you can't necessarily
deal with outside influences or any of
that stuff so I struggle with that I
struggle with that because because of
the realities of slavery the black
community was always largely maternally
run mm-hmm dad and mom were separated
family the family unit in the
traditional sense didn't exist so and we
were successful in spite of that yeah so
I I'm not so sure that I thought now
would I
all day I think the value of having mom
and dad in the home and frankly at some
point grandparents and home to build
that in that I think it's incredibly
important but I'm not prepared to say
that's why everything is wrong as I
pointed out my parents ultimately got
we're divorced and all two have two
sisters we both went to college all
three of us rather we're successful have
[Music]
on television they tell you that every
episode of every show is a very special
episode well in the hundreds of episodes
of the Reuben report I've actually never
said this is a special episode until
today
joining me is lubed Achmed a free
thinker and chemical engineering student
who has spent her entire life in Iraq
lube mill was a guest on the Reuben
report about two years ago via Skype but
right after our talk Ludo was subjected
to death threats and had to go into
hiding after two long years Lubner has
finally made it to the United States and
now today I welcome my new friend into
my home and into my studio lube nach med
welcome to the Reuben report thank you
for having me again and I'm very
grateful to you and for all the people
who helped in my case and for all who
had seen my first interview and you know
come to conclusion to think about things
again and about situations and you know
in my country and other countries around
in the Middle East yeah so thank you and
um I'm grateful welcome to all of you
know tell of years ago yeah
well I think a lot of people are
grateful to you to for having the
bravery to tell your story and and be
open be who you are even come here now I
mean the other one we did was was two
years ago and at the we reposted that a
few days ago so people have seen that
already hopefully if they're watching
this right now but when we did that
interview two years ago you had reached
out to me and I didn't know I didn't
know if you were legit I didn't know if
this was some sort of hoax or something
but then we Skyped privately and you
told me your story and then I talked to
my friend Faisal who obviously was from
Iraq too and then he talked to you on
the phone and he basically said to me
that if I won't talk to you
and that you're an adult and you have
capacity over your mind and can make
your own decisions that if I won't talk
to you that nobody will talk to you and
that you'll never get any help and
that's why we decided to do it
did you think that after we spoke that
it was gonna get so bad so quickly I
didn't think so actually back that time
I was more into talking I want I wanted
my my voice to be heard to the other
people around because situations in my
country are bad and for you know people
like me you know I'm good I have a you
know a very good family I was raised in
a in a very free space but there are
millions of people in my country they
have no rights they have no space to
even to think about themselves
so it was important for me to share my
story and to share my thoughts so the
other the other side of the world can
get you know a view and an image to what
are the situations in my country and
especially for women
because as you seen after 2003 when bad
and especially for women and for
children so for myself as an educated
person I was so you know I was abused
and treated badly in my society from my
people and you know by my religion so it
was very important for me to speak up
yeah how come it was so important for
you to show your face in the interview
because I remember when we talked
originally I said you know if you want
to wear a mask if you want us to blur
your face out and you said no I want
people to see me because because it's
very important for me see in York all
all kind of all kinds of people are they
have the right to to have their faces to
have their full identity without fear
you have the militias a groups in York
Hezbollah Dawa has been Sahar ocotilla
Hezbollah they you know they come up to
people with their faces
their identities and you have the other
side the terrorists in Iraq as well they
act you know freely in the country but
for people like me you know I didn't
hurt anyone I didn't you know treat
anyone in a bad way so why should I hide
my my identity I mean it's very
important for me to declare Who I am
because everyone has the right to
declare who they are and and and in what
they do believe in for me it's very
important to say that I am an atheist
because in my country everyone is
calling that we are Muslims we are
Sydney's we are Shia and we practice
what we want but for me it became in the
recent years very important to share my
thoughts yeah you mentioned that you
were brought up in a free space so your
mom who actually now is with you in the
United States you guys got here together
and you're living with your sister who
had moved here years before but although
you have two brothers interacts tonight
so your mom basically created a free
space for you to be able to think and
write you told me that you were reading
books by Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins
people that hopefully I'll be able to
introduce you to at some point because
because she's actually an atheist I mean
she started to think about religion from
an early age so she didn't go up in a
you know in our logistic space although
that you know her family were you know
it stricted with her you know but for
her she always thought that she's an
atheist and she tried to to raise you
know her children to be not atheist but
to think for themselves to have their
brain to work out because we were born
without knowing what is God is or what
are religions but we you know brought to
this world to our societies
the idea of God and the idea of
religions was forced into us for me I
didn't know what was God is until I you
know got to high school and you know we
have a classes that teaches Islamic you
know lessons till at that point I
started to realize what is God and you
know and what Islam is so my mom she I'm
very grateful to her because she's I
think she's my God for me huh that's the
yeah yeah this is what I think and what
I do believe in yeah that's a beautiful
thing yeah
it's interesting you talked so much
about why showing your face was
important all these all these bad people
basically get to show their face of them
and then the good people are the ones
that are shamed into it I always talk
about how I get so much email from
people in America a free society that
are afraid to say what they think while
living here which I'm sure is
mind-blowing to you like we don't really
understand the freedoms that we have
yeah I don't know but I mean America is
the land that I think it's magical it
you know it is fun and to protect the
freedom so how come people in here can
you know afraid to show their faces or
to share their ideas or their thoughts I
can understand that but for me I just
want to say something they won't they
might you know want to live one day 24
hours in my country I think that that's
the point that maybe make them try to
think deeply and the rights and the
freedom they have that I and people in
my country don't have any Ark everything
is is tracked you are not yourself in
Middle East in general you had to be
forced into something you had to be
afraid you have to
afraid of who you are you don't know
what you are or who you are until you
die but in the United States from what
you know I've been here six months so I
can see that sometimes I don't feel that
I you know I belong here because I do
miss a lot of things that I used to do
in my country but in other words you
know I enjoy the freedom that I have now
and I'm grateful to the United States of
America it's a very great nation and the
principles and the concepts this country
was built on is I think he's a
humanitarian principles from what I
learned about the history of United
States and I hope all the people and
American I think in in the Western world
and even in my countries get to see this
history so they can learn and they can
build we can build that you know the
future for the next generation we have
yeah it's so nice to hear you say that
because we do forget it here you know
and that's that's why when you reached
out to me that I thought this is
something this is a person who's
fighting for the same things that we're
fighting for here our fight is so much
easier and you were willing to put
yourself out there all right so we do
that interview two years ago and then I
think within almost 24 hours maybe two
days yeah you contacted me and said that
there were Hsieh militias basically that
had either seen the video or had gotten
word of the video and that you were in
trouble and then we had sort of spotty
communication for a couple months and
there were a few other people that tried
to help I know some people that watch
the show were raising funds to help get
you to a safe house and all that but can
you just sort of tell me about those
first few weeks I know your dealer
really was for almost two years but what
was that initial part when you heard
that people knew about what you
it well I was afraid not you know for
myself but for my family although I
asked my mom and you know if I can do
that you know I had the permission but I
was afraid for my family I didn't you
know I wasn't afraid for myself that
much to me quite honest because I mean
this is a case that if you're if I said
yes so I have to take the
responsibilities for that but basically
I was afraid for my mother and mainly so
it was very you know what happened yeah
how did you hear like what was the first
thing that you heard that somebody was I
went to the college actually and I saw
papers you know threats my name was
written on it and it says that death to
the atheists in Iraq that to you and I
took the paper and I turned that tear it
down and I went out of the college and
that's when I actually contacted you and
all the people because a lot of the
people in my community so that interview
and around my university and you know
the nearby universities actually they
even shared their thoughts on the
Richard Dawkins foundation some of this
students oh right because the the
Dawkins foundation had also posted the
video that we did so the video was going
along place and then it was hard we took
the video down but copies had been made
and we tried to contact everybody to get
all the copies taken down when did it
kind of escalate past that like did
anyone actually say a direct threat to
you in that initial yeah yeah a lot of
told me that you will go to hell we will
kill you eventually but did people know
you were an atheist before that I mean I
assume as a as a chem
engineer yeah community yeah yeah and my
college they knew because you know I had
a lot of discussions I mean I can't keep
my mouth I'm sorry shot yeah
I defined in America yeah I do speak and
I what you know every time I you know I
listen to them talk you know delusional
things I had to say something so I was
none for my thoughts and I shared a lot
of articles actually or I thinks in a
lieutenant BC treat by my name but I
didn't put my full name on it but I did
you know separate papers my name on it
just to say my thoughts the same I you
know I used to share my thoughts on
Facebook I used to always opposed verses
of Quran and you know explain it to my
friends American friends and other
people so I was known for you know for
being atheist and I faced a lot of
threats actually before the show
physical threats against me I was you
know once it slapped on the way my home
from my college actually by a guy in the
car and so and I was attacked several
times in my college so I was always done
so that's why I decided to go and you
know because it's there is no point of
you know keeping it silent for me I had
to speak up so yeah I can see it in you
I know you couldn't even if you tried to
not say what what do you think well I
don't know but for me it was important
and I think I want to say that American
people should now read their history
again and remind themselves that what
they have is very great I can't even
describe it in words
they should learn more about it and they
should protect the freedom because
America is you know for all of us for
all of the people who had their rights
gone who don't have any you know hold on
have any rights in their countries I do
think that it is very important to fight
for this country and to stop the Islam
disease to get into it this is very
important for me now so so alright so
suddenly you saw the the letters at
school people were saying things to you
yeah I remember we were trading some
emails and sometimes you didn't have
internet for days and you were moving
around and things yeah kind of tell me
what happened over the next couple
months you were put in a safe house for
a while I know at one point we had some
people that were trying to get you maybe
to the Kurdish regional area because
it's more western friendly there and
there are more Americans there what was
that whole year I went into I think I
moved around
I changed the places a lot how does that
even happen like how do you make the
contacts to know that you're going to a
place that's safe because I didn't know
I just moved around i disguised actually
to be quite honest I didn't go with my
phony face because I would be recognized
but I said meaning you were wearing the
hijab Italian yeah Wow yeah that's how
did that feel for you just knowing
everything with you well I felt nothing
to be quite honest and I'm coward at the
at the end because I do believe that if
you are if you believe in something you
would do it too the last thing that's
right but I pad because maybe because of
the positive feedback
I received maybe because I believe that
although that I'm a very tiny person and
and you know and that there are lots of
you know worse cases than mine but I
thought maybe I can stay alive and share
my my experience with a lot of people so
I think that's what drove me to put a
job and to disguise that just to save
you know my life and to be able to speak
up again yeah but other than that I
don't feel that to be quite honest um
special or or anything it's just um I'm
coward and I I lost the passion I used
to have back in my country now I sense
that maybe a new passion will be I don't
know we'll be starting while you're here
I don't know I used to put myself into
things I think you're doing that right
now and you know I was a stopped by a
lot of you know army soldiers there are
key soldiers for trying to take pictures
of some of the establishment for like
Harrogate Ansar Allah it's in Arabic
there is something like Hezbollah ok
yeah I tried to take some pictures of
their building so I can post it online
and I was started by some of the Iraqi
you know soldiers they told me this
dangerous to take that and they took my
iPad and delete the pictures but I get
the chance I got the chance to post it
it and keep carving my friend yeah he
posted that so for me I do put myself
into things not because I love troubles
no it's just because I wanted you know
share a view of the country that maybe
you didn't see get to see because I
a lot of reporting things they don't
tell you the whole truth about Iraq but
for me you know I can't tell you the
truth so yeah yeah I hope in the future
I might you know change my views I don't
know for now but hopefully yeah well you
just got here yeah you're just getting
your feet wet so to speak so you
mentioned Keith there's there's a couple
other people who we both know that I
don't know that they want to be
mentioned publicly so I'm just not gonna
mention names even though they all did a
lot of yeah a lot of good things but
what was it like to be in communication
with people a crow I mean there were
people literally across the world that
we're trying to help you as you were
yeah running it must have that must have
given you like some a little extra
glimmer of hope or something right yeah
and there are you know special people to
me I can't say names but one person who
put hoping you know in me and uh you
know I believed in him for several
nights I you know I even missed my own
voice I didn't speak I didn't say
anything I was alone and one person who
kept me alive and you know all I owe him
my life actually to be quite honest and
were you with your mom the entire time
that this was all happening from the
beginning now but at some point she got
into with me because she phased try it's
about me so she had to be with me
actually
so um I'm grateful to that person
particular one and all the people who
helped in my case and especially I'm
very grateful to you
I can't I'm grateful to you get the
moment that we talked and and you are a
friend and you're a family for me now so
yeah I'm very grateful to you and
thankful tn all the
people yeah David yeah well I'm grateful
for you two because this is what it's
all about you you're doing something
that right this very second you're doing
something that this is what people need
this is what people need to understand
if as you're saying if we're gonna
protect the things that are great about
this country when we have to hear from
people like you yeah and and the fact
that you were so brave in a place you
know we have people that aren't brave
while they're free and you're brave in a
place where you learn it free it's
incredibly inspired because the
situation's Drive you to because you you
have you don't have the right to be who
you are it's you know a kind of and.and
you know believing in yourself can drive
you to be to talk and to be who you are
for me it's very important from what I
learned about you know nature about size
it's very important to shape who you are
because every one of us has a unique
personality we don't have to be the same
we don't have to follow others to be a
picture of others or if I reflect as you
can say so for me it's very important to
share that with you people and for you
to protect this you know free space so
we can be creative that's what matters
for me yeah so all right let's get I
want I want to get to you're part of
your life in America so how did okay so
you bounced around from these safe safe
houses basically when did you get a call
or where were you when you realize that
actually you could get out because in
the midst of all of this by the way it
was everything happening with this
supposed the Trump travel ban and Iraq
wasn't on the list I guess it maybe is
on I'm not even sure right now where the
list I'm not even sure where that whole
thing stands at the moment actually but
I remember thinking and then we had lost
communication for a while and I had
reached out to some other people and
they didn't know where you were and this
whole thing but when did it actually you
start getting some signs that
right well it's um early and I think in
august-september from the people that
were in touch with me yeah so this is
lasso a little over a year ago yeah
2016 yeah and I was contacted by other
people through my email that I might
have an interview with you know for an
immigration status or something and it
does you know started and I managed to
go and do that actually it was hard for
me but you know I did it basically
because since I told you I disguise so
sometimes it easy for me to move this
you know disguised and I did it and I
think in in the last year but after the
travel ban everything has ended in
earlier in 2017 but another way so
[Music]
some of you may remember that about two
years ago I interviewed a secular
atheist in Iraq by the name of Lubner
Achmed Lubin it reached out to us and
asked to come on the Rubin report to
share her personal story of being a free
thinker living in an unstable closed
society before our formal interview I
Skyped with Lumina privately to check
out her story and then went to my friend
former guest and Iraqi refugee himself
faisal saeed al Matar to ask him if he
felt that putting lube 'no on the show
was a good idea my fear obviously was
that we could end up putting lube in his
life at risk of course I didn't want to
bring harm to her or anyone that she
knew for simply speaking her truth as a
non-believer in an Islamic society
faisal who himself had lived under
Saddam and lost loved ones under his
brutal regime told me that if I wouldn't
talk to Lube 'no publicly that nobody
would he told me that voices like hers
are the exact type of people who suffer
most under theocratic regimes reasoning
that if as an adult she was willing to
take the risk of putting her name and
face out there i should offer her the
opportunity i really struggled with the
decision for a couple weeks and
ultimately took faizal's advice and
interviewed Lubner what you're gonna see
today is the original interview we did
with Lube 'no exactly as it aired two
years ago shortly after the interview
was released luna and her family were
subjected to death threats from Shia
militias had to go into hiding and were
forced to take various other precautions
in order to protect their safety at Lube
News request we immediately took down
the video and we didn't comment publicly
any further as not to inflame the
situation over the past two years though
several people who were viewers of the
Rubin report were able to contact Luba
privately and helped her to receive
assistance and guidance in the midst of
this horrific ordeal I also contacted
several former guests of the Rubin
report who I hoped could use some of
their connections to help lube nough and
many people did just that Lubner was
moved to a safe house at one point some
connections tried to get her to the
Kurdish controlled portion of Iraq and
others donated time and money I give
them all a shout out here but I'm not
sure that any of them even want public
accolades for their effort
I am beyond thrilled today to tell you
that over the past few months Lubner has
actually made it to the United States
and now lives only a few hours away from
me we are reposting this long-lost video
so that you can see our original chat as
a prelude to Lubner joining me right
here in studio which we will post next
Monday
hopefully Lunas journey will be an
inspiration not only to all of the
people across the world who live in
closed societies so that they can
realize that they aren't alone but also
for all the people who live in open
societies but have forgotten just how
truly special
that is alright I'm really excited about
what we're doing today I am here with
Luna Achmed she is a human rights
activist in Iraq and we connected a
couple weeks ago first on Twitter and
Facebook and now we've exchanged a
couple emails
Luga it's a pleasure to actually see you
well thank you it's my pleasure to meet
you I'm very excited about the interview
and I only want to make something you
know in my life and get my voice to
reach other people who lives in closed
societies like Rock and you know Backus
town Afghanistan everywhere so I hope
you know I do good so thank you so much
for having me well the thanks is all
coming from this side but all right so
there's so much I want to talk to you
about first off I guess most importantly
so you're in Iraq right now you're 25
years old is that right no 23 23 sorry
didn't mean to age you there so you're
23 years old you're in Iraq so you grew
up under Saddam Hussein and the bath
party yeah so let's just talk let's talk
a little bit about your history first
from what you can remember I know it was
a long time ago already but what was it
like growing up in that situation and
then we'll get to where we are now it
was like I said was difficult loving you
know under Saddam Hussein time and
my mother she was forced to join his
party but she refused to join in and
thus he you know his people transferred
her to another company and you know
lower salary and that went so bad you
know to me and my my my siblings as well
so it was really hard seeing a lot of
things going on you know a lot of rights
were taken from the people and the women
were suffered a lot during that time and
you know you know I saw a lot of
backboard things going on and especially
you know for the women wearing had this
carve a lot and you know calling for
rights were forbidden at that time so it
was dark
yes you know yeah can you tell me a
little bit more just a little bit about
your family like what kind of family you
grew up in and sort of when you became
you know a secular thinker and someone
interested in human rights and women's
rights and all that well my family from
the beginning my mother she was any
theist so the reason I'm thinking like
that because of her she raised me and my
siblings along to be free she didn't
force us to any to think anything about
you know religions or so she's a
mechanical engineer scientist and like
you know I mentioned in my story she
married to my father which he was turned
to be just like her brother and her
mother he abused my mom he used to hit
my mom and and he used to date my sister
my older sister as well so from that
point my mom tried to divorce him and
finally she got the divorce and another
turn in my life in my family's life
which you know began at that time we
were hated by my mother's family first
in the society we were and there are so
many attacks because my mom she is a
woman and she is divorced and in Middle
East being a woman and being divorced
without a man to identify the women they
will you know they will attack these
kind of women so well for me I started
to think about Islam and calm it since
you know 12 years old I started to ask
what is Islam whose Mohammed what is God
and that's why I kicked out of like two
to three schools I was forced to to you
know to attend the religion lessons in
my school just to get you know my
degrees or so and that's what I did but
in the same time I did search qur'an and
islam and i do think that i want to say
this Islam is an extreme religion
there's no need to have a Wahhabi ism
you know a principal or so is just
itself it's extreme when you read Quran
when you read hadith you will see how
you know how there is so much violence
in it yes there are a few nice verbs
sense but when he came when you come to
the whole text and crowd no it's not
it's not it's not peaceful and I do
think that Muhammed created all this you
know religion and so on so get back to
my point I continued my education and
now I'm doing my master's in chemical
engineering and my field is reactor
design which is you know very
fascinating field and I love it yeah so
there there's so much there so you grew
it so your mom was an atheist so I
assume in your house there wasn't much
religion certainly once your your
left left the house but then you're
saying you had to take religious classes
just so that you could take the other
classes that you wanted to take right
science and math and things like that
what was it like for your mom so she's
obviously a generation ahead of you she
was you know to be a to be a secular
thinker and an atheist I mean was she
opened in terms of friends and and
family it sounds like maybe family yeah
yeah she was open and that's why her
brother abused her and once she told us
one of the times he used he used to hit
her
he used to accuse my mother he and her
mother you know her father was kind of
you know a good guy he he pushed too you
know for my mom to continue her
education but her brother won one of the
times he almost you know tried to kill
my mom with a knife she mentioned that
she was open she escaped from the house
to live in dorms actually when she was a
mechanic a mechanical engineering
student and it was it was really hard
she she she faced a lot of difficulties
having a friends and well and she ended
with my what my father went and like I
said he turned out to be nothing you
know nothing and uh so let's let's flash
forward a little bit so then I guess
it's about ten years ago now a little
bit more probably there was the American
invasion of Iraq so what was that like
for you for your family were you in the
middle of the war zone well at the
beginning we weren't very happy because
Saddam Husein was the dictator and as
you know as you know a lot of people
know about Saddam Husein and what he did
to the Iraqi people we weren't very
happy at the beginning to be honest but
then it turned out it's not it's not the
same I mean we lost a lot of I think
rights back to Saddam Husein time
as women they you know they used to walk
down the streets in the middle of the
night safe but now after the invasion no
we didn't see that a lot of rights were
lost a lot of things are going on and
especially right now
and you know it's after the invasion a
lot of Shia militia took over the the
country so was was really bad and it is
really bad because there is no central
government tuner option no more and I
think I suppose that the Iraqi
government is ruled by Iran I do really
think that so for me and my family
facing all these things was really
difficult and we got a lot of threats
but as you see I am still alive so as my
family and well I was continuing so yes
well that's why that's why we're doing
this and I think you're incredibly
inspiring and I had said to you before
before we started I had said to you you
know I don't want to do anything that
would jeopardize your safety and
basically I don't have to say it for you
but you you could say what you said to
me about that it's okay I think because
I do believe in myself to the ultimate
point that you know I give it all
because it's time to talk terrorists
have the right to exist in Iraq you know
a religious religious man that
pretending you know Islam have the right
everyone you know has their eye except
the people who don't believe in God or
who don't believe in religions it
actually religions I do I kind of you
know define religion as anything that
limit the human beings are going from
thinking freely from being creative
because religious you know do you put
these limits for us to be who we are
so
you know I refuse all these things and I
will not submit to anything at all and
this is this is the reason I'm doing
this and this is the reason you know I
want my voice to reach out others to
start to stand up because we are lost
it's time to be for us to be found and I
do wish people listened to me
yes yeah well listen I I know we're
we're literally something like 8,000 or
10,000 miles apart but I can feel it I
can actually feel that connection
through this this Skype thing so it's
really incredible so I want to hear a
little bit more about your story though
so so there you were hopeful in the
invasion happened then the invasion
happened and America was there for a
while and it seemed like things were
getting better right there were
elections there is a sense that things
were getting better so can you talk
about what what that little period was
like and then when America left did it
immediately get worse where it is now or
was it kind of a slow progression well
well like you said like you mentioned
yes it was good to have the elections
and was good to have some rights
especially for the women they were more
active in the public life and as well
for the children you know and a lot of
things were you know we're very very
good at the beginning and but with time
a lot of things you know eliminated and
for the women for the children and and
for the society yes we do have now
internet and connections to the other
world which Saddam Husein
you know at you know in his time were
prevented you know we are we were
prevented doing these things but like I
said a lot of things you know turned out
to be bad and now
Malaysia's Shia militias are taking over
the government adjacent Mahdi Rossella
salam hezid nusra to allah that he
started to you know to establish there
institutions and they do have now
buildings institutions under the eye you
know under the protection of the Iraqi
government so what I'm saying is the the
militias you know started to take a lot
of areas and Baghdad they killed a lot
of people and as you as you know from
the beginning suddenly I began to suffer
from the elimination in the government
they didn't they don't have the right to
exist in Iraq from blankey Christians
and Christian people left Iraq you know
after the invasion a lot of them left
the country which is very bad a lot of
church in Baghdad I have seen this in my
own eyes the the Iraqis Muslims turn
these truths into like you know trade
like malls and stuff like that and I did
you know take pictures of such these
things but after the US forces left Rock
well it turned out to be more worse than
this yeah now yes now Iran to cover a
lot of cities I do think and I do I'm
sure you know I have people talking to
me in south of Iraq they can see members
of the Iranian militias or you know Alka
this army and you know exist and turned
out like I said to be more worse now
even the cost the Iraqi Constitution
they put a new law for the women to
eliminate you know their rights and it
was bad and even the United Nations
you know they mentioned that but no one
you know in Iraq know and listens to
what is going on so I think you know you
got my point
no it's smaller Wars than ever yes so
what's what's it like actually for you
as a woman just on a day-to-day basis
obviously you're not wearing a head
covering right now I assume you're at
home you don't tell me where you are but
what what is your life you know going to
school work wherever it is that you go
from from morning tonight what's your
day like okay well like I said I'm
student so when I go out without a head
scarp and chart there and you know and
the way I look they pay attention to me
and a lot of attacks you know accuses I
have phased do you know I'm from high
school till this day I was physically
you know harassed and it was a difficult
time but but you know now even their
children now they they teach their
children to criticize me anyway um you
know I go on this street with you know
how I look and I got a lot like I said
Oh abuses but for me you know I fight
back I apply I do not check my mouth and
because there is no reason for anyone to
criticize anyone there is no right for
anyone to you have the right to oblige
others to follow their way you know what
I mean each one of us is free to do
whatever they want so for me you know I
do whatever I want I don't care because
I'm not affecting anyone without with
you know I'm doing so that's for me yeah
so I'm curious how other women react to
you because obviously they're not all as
brave as you are and are going out and
talking about the things you're talking
about and and publicly saying the things
that you're saying and even just going
out without the head are they talking to
you privately
yeah well that the woman are the first
one who attacks me to be honest really I
do
yeah I do have a lot of males you know
they were a you know agreement to my
points but the woman they were attacks
me all the time and you know I don't
care about them and I try to explain how
I think can I try to reach to them but
actually they do not believe in
themselves and actually you know I
joined some of the women local
organizations Karan calling for the
women rights in Iraq and I got shocked
seeing the woman you know under the the
role of this local organization herself
is wearing hijab headscarf and for me I
don't want to look like you know
aggressive in my opinions but once you
put this piece of clothes you know you
are a slave for me I do consider these
women are slaves because it's a human
you know nature to you know for women to
have their hair to look like the men and
it's from the beginning of the you know
of the humanity it's like that and it
was mentioned I want to mention this and
cron and cron it had years the headscarf
was mentioned only for the the women of
the Prophet Mohammed let or not all the
Muslim women you know what I mean and
and in history when when you know when
you follow up and Quran and hadith in
history men were you know wearing had is
carved as well because the nature of the
deserts you know and storms they were
you know used to wear this piece of
clothes to protect them from the Sun
from the the dust so for me I faced a
lot of women attacking me but what I
said
I'm standing for myself and that's what
I'm doing
yes yeah so I know that we also we have
many things
I think in common in a lot of the people
that we both admire and I know that
you're a big admirer of Richard Dawkins
and sam Harris all of all of these free
thinkers and secular people I'm curious
how you got interested in them where it
was this just from being online were you
able to get their books or how did that
happen well my mother because she used
to you know follow them buying their
books because she has a friend you know
for he used to bring books like that you
know in secret because it's you know to
have these books in English it's it's
not isolated to Arabic which you know I
do not trust the translations to be
honest so yes so I knew these people
from my mother and we used to read you
know books for example God Delusion for
Richard Dawkins you know I'm very
faceted it it was a fascinating book we
used to read it with my mother discuss
things we are just like a gang you know
me and my siblings yeah my mother yeah
we're talking about these things so well
and I got interested in in Hitchens and
you know Sam Harris you know online sam
Harris but rich isn't a Dow khun's to my
mother actually yeah yeah well first off
for the record I want you to know that
I'm gonna make sure to send this video
to Sam so he will know who you are and
I'll do my best to get it to Dawkins as
well yeah well you you're a
representation of everything that they
care about everything that's right you
know that that we have to empower people
like you to change your society so I so
we only have a couple minutes left but
so what what can we do on the outside
because that one of the things that I
hear a lot of from people on the left in
my country is that we just have to let
you guys be it's none of our business to
get involved and and I feel the reverse
I feel it's important to talk to people
like you because you're you're a
minority within a minority
want to help your boys spread so for all
the people watching this what can we do
[Music]
joining me today is the author of the
art of the argument western
civilization's last stand and the host
of free domain radio
stephon molyneux welcome to the reuben
report thank you
great pleasure to be here it's been a
while it has been a while i i've been on
your show a couple times
uh before we get into anything of real
substance though i do feel we have to
address the amount of gray that we both
have
in our beards because it what what's
with the chin area though
i don't know i mean first time i had a
beard and it went gray i've been outside
in canada in the winter
and i was like oh it's just a little bit
of you know a little snow a little ice
or something like that it's like doesn't
brush away
because it's father time doing his work
i have never had a beard in my life this
is my first beard ever so i didn't even
know
that gray was there now i feel old and
tired
and here's the thing too once you have
the beard in public view
you can't darken it no you can't because
it's too late like soon as you like
even if you get a bit of stubble because
you know there's people who obsess about
everyone's looks on the internet get a
little bit of stubble
you can't yeah you can't shoot polish it
up you can't do that you know you just
you got to let it go what number are you
buzzing with uh i'm sort of like a
number two kind of thing
i'm like eight oh okay we'll see
see i went into the controversial stuff
well now here's the thing because
you're okay because you have fairly
lengthy hair yeah but i
cannot be the guy with a beard much
longer than
his hair that's a hole like montana
living in the
caves kind of look that has you like
everyone thinks that you're cooking
beans on a fire in an old shoe waiting
for the end of civilization
there's got to be a youtube series about
that i'm sure but yeah so i've got to
keep it fairly trim
no matter which way yeah all right well
we have a lot to get to and i really
want to talk about the book but i
thought the
best way to sort of start this is that i
know i'm going to get a certain amount
of hate just for sitting across from you
and as i said i've been on your show a
couple times before and we've had
nothing but pleasant conversations
have talked about liberalism and logic
and reason and all that stuff
but i think you're you're somewhat aware
of that type of thing that for some
people you are
negative opinions about a a free thinker
on the internet i think actually
pre-internet it was socrates and then
you know copernicus not to put myself in
such lofty categories but
there certainly is when you are an
original thinker and when you really try
and
particularly when you scrub things down
to the bare minimum like
randy dickhardt said like what if i know
nothing whatsoever what if i just wipe
everything out and try and build a
cohesion
uh and rational framework of thinking
and
of understanding the world and of
understanding ethics what if i just
pretend i know nothing which is a
socratic commandment you know nothing
what are you gonna build from scratch
and i think that's the modern world
is when people said we don't know
anything we don't know whether the sun
or the the earth is the center of the
solar system we don't know anything
let's just pretend we know nothing we
don't even know if the king is put there
by god we don't know if the aristocracy
is put there by god we don't know if the
priests are right about everything what
if we just wipe the slate clean and then
we build things up
and we get modern civilization i think
out of that but there are a lot of
entrenched interests
that profit from existing error and when
people come along with better arguments
uh well it can be a little kind of like
it can be a little controversial
toss in a certain dose of twitter and
then yeah you know you get
where we are now it's funny because i've
had a little bit of a change over the
last couple of months where i was kind
of
really just you know everybody talks
about well we've never been more divided
we're all angry at each other we all
hate each other
i think there's actual great opportunity
right now for people that are talking
about ideas and i include you in that
but what would you say is the thing that
people uh
find most controversial about you is
there one topic that you consistently
hit on
that you think people either give you
the most flack or you think is sort of
wading into the most dangerous territory
if i knew that dave i would hit on it
more well
i've got a couple i've got a couple
right here but i thought i'd throw that
to you i think
i would say
i would say that the concept so so
there's some abstract ones and there's
some personal ones yeah and people tend
to get most upset about the personal
ones because that's where people have
kind of like a stake
in in their life in their world so for
me for sure i think
people get most upset when i talk about
say for instance
you don't have to have abusive people in
your life you know whether they're
that's what the one i have that's number
two i have one above that but let's
let's
we can start with that sure so you know
when i was growing up
i don't know for some of your listeners
they may you know paleozoic maybe
but when i was growing up this was
everywhere
when i was a kid and this was part of
the feminist revolution right where they
said
if you are with an abusive man you
should get out
you should you know hit the road jack
don't look back deep in the rear view
nothing but dust right and that was
something that i grew up if you're being
abused if you're in an abusive
relationship
then you should not be in that
relationship now i actually think that's
a little too harsh i think you should
sit down and talk with people and try
and reason things out and so on but
that seems relatively uncontroversial
when you're talking about adults but i
think one of the things that people got
upset about is when i logically at least
to me
extended that to if you're an adult and
you had an abusive parent
do you actually need to continue to
spend time with that abusive parent and
the answer to me is well
no because if you marry someone that's a
chosen relationship right i mean but
your parent is someone
like i'm a parent right and i recognize
that my daughter did not choose me she's
like eating me
there's no there wasn't like some you
know this platonic idea that you're kind
of floating above the world you look
down and you
unless there's some cosmic game that you
don't know about no i don't really i
mean
so she didn't choose me so it's an
involuntary relationship
for for children and to me you have to
have the very highest standards
when you have the least voluntary
relationship and so
when i put that argument forward um
well some people seem to get quite upset
and
it has always been you know from a
logical standpoint it's completely
baffling from a sort of personal
standpoint
i can understand why so on the logical
front it makes sense because you would
just remove bad influences from your
life whether they're
part of your family or not your family
it's just that that
i think well i think talk to them first
yeah i mean you don't that's what you
don't understand
how far do you think you have to go
before you would cut out
something like a parent
i i know it's yeah no i mean i i have
this sort of rule
i don't tell people what to do in the
show because i mean not only would that
be
kind of megalomaniacal but also let's
say somebody just obeys you they haven't
learned anything right so
i wouldn't so to say to people what but
i would say that
it's hard to have a better relationship
in your life than your worst
relationship
and so if you have a very dysfunctional
relationship and there are certainly you
know people out there whose
parents were unfathomably evil towards
them you know like a
molestation rape violent abuse you know
massive neglect and so on right so
i think try and talk to people in your
life
but do not think that it's like physics
that you just have to have relationships
because i'm very big for free will very
big for choices
and i always have a kind of reflexive
pushback
against you have to you know well
it's your father's birthday you have to
call him it's like well he beat me up
every day if our child said do i
do why do i maybe i'll skip this well
because because people don't say well
you chose this man you have to stay
married to him even if he's drunkenly
beating you every night people said no i
mean and
and again that's a chosen relationship
so involuntary relationships
i think there's a higher standard so i
think it's important you sit down you
talk about
if you've had a difficult history with
your family or parents sit down and talk
about it with them and you know if they
want to go to therapy or if they want to
try and find ways to resolve it
so much the better what can be repaired
should be repaired but that's not up to
you in the end
in the end is part of the conflict there
that so many of us walk around not
really
dealing with issues in the first place
so i remember once years ago about 10
years ago
a good friend of mine was telling me
about his relationship with his dad
he said his dad was abusive and was
always drunk and that one night
he came home his dad came home drunk and
basically just beat the living hell out
of him and that he as a 12 year old
knew at that moment this guy is just you
know
a dirtbag and i'm gonna always treat him
as such
and in a bizarre way he had very clean
feelings about it because the the act of
being punched and beaten was so clean
yeah but i think a lot of people if you
don't get
hit there's all sorts of other abuse so
you walk around in this sort of half
truth phase you know i mean you can't
quite parse it out do you think that's
part of it that people don't
quite yeah people have good mental
adventure yeah you know that there's
very few people in the world that's like
well that person was evil
from dawn until desk they woke up they
were evil and there was never i mean
people always have good memories
even of bad people in their life and so
it definitely is complicated and if you
can use the good memories as a way of
hooking
the relationship to a better place
fantastic but
we were talking just a little bit before
about you know the sort of weinstein
scandal and all this kind of stuff and
just while we were talking that the
thought popped into my mind dave that
we look at hollywood and we say oh you
know these people
they seem to know or there's lots of
indications or lots of jokes or lots of
stuff where people said
oh we knew we knew and then people why
didn't they say something why didn't
they say something it's like well you
can
think that the only problem with that is
somewhere out in hollywood some are out
among the rich famous pretty people
who have massive talent more money and
it seems like decreasing
levels of ethics as every day goes
forward but what about people in your
own life do you know
for instance not you personally but do
your audience do you do you the audience
know
somebody who's mistreating a child do
you know a parent who is
and this can be neglect neglect is a
very very powerful form of abuse
that is very hard to um unpack in in
your mind
do you have suspicions you know do you
see parents you know screaming at their
children or spending their whole time on
the cell phone and not talking to them
and so on
is there something that you can do to
improve that to remind them and say you
know
your kids are only young once try and
engage them in a positive way
teach them how to be rational by being
rational to them and love them and be
positive to them
because it's not just out there in
hollywood where there's all this bad
stuff that people
aren't doing people most people if you
have any kind of extended social circle
extended family and so on most people
have something
in their life that they could stand up
for and say this needs to be better this
should be improved
yeah and i think that's one of the
fascinations that's going on with this
hollywood scandal is people are saying
they do say well what about all the
people who knew but didn't do anything
but i think most of us
and i care myself in this as well in
parts of my life i've looked in the
mirror and said
i know that something's not right and
i'm skating over it i'm kind of
you know sidestepping it i'm crossing my
fingers i'm
or maybe just withdrawing contact if
there's some difficult situation you see
between a parent and child or anyone
so i think we all have that
responsibility but i think it's kind of
erupting in our consciousness through
that very distant event that's easier to
talk about for a lot of people yeah what
do you make of
this whole situation i mean we're
watching it seems like the entire
industry is collapsing in front of us
i know you're not a major fan of what
hollywood has been putting out in the
type of moral preaching that these
people do and i i'm not either
i don't mind moral preaching from good
people well right yeah
these people do um so that i i would
assume at some level you're you're
enjoying watching it be exposed but we
briefly for a second before we started
taping we're talking about how
this now could bring its tentacles
everywhere where everyone is gonna look
back and go 20 years ago someone touched
my knee
me too you know like that and i don't
want to really focus on that part but
but we just don't we're sort of opening
a pandora's box here that yeah that is
kind of dangerous
but i think it's essential yeah i mean i
think this has to be done and this
absolutely i'm glad
to be clear i'm glad the monsters are
going down well but who knows who's who
knows who's a monster at the moment
right now it's dark
there are lots of eyes out there there
are tentacles flying around like i don't
know who's a good guy and who's i mean
okay clearly there's some people like
the weinsteins and so on it's like
you know that's some pretty nasty stuff
and i know he's got a bunch of
investigations into rape
i think in new york there's no statute
of limitations so they can go after that
but right now
i think we're kind of in the midst of a
hysteria and and that
is fairly common when these kinds of new
things come out
so when i was a kid this was child abuse
sorry this was um a wife abuse wife
abuse was the big thing
that was going on you know this was not
talked about you kind of
i had um a feminist advocate aaron pitzy
on the show a couple of years ago and
she was saying that she ran one of the
first shelters
for uh women who were being abused and a
lot of times the priests would come down
and say
sorry love you got to go back you made a
vow and and all of this
this was when i was a kid this was the
big thing that was coming out and then
it was child abuse that came out a
little bit later
now this kind of sexual harassment stuff
is um
something that is coming out and
because it's kind of a hysteria it means
you know there are some bad people who
are being exposed
there are people who are kind of on the
line who are going to take some real
hits to their
reputations and of course inevitably
there are going to be some good people
who are taken down
unjustly and the you know what we need
to do is have a conversation about all
of this
as a whole you know where there is this
power disparity whether it's this sexual
exploitation
and i i do believe and i made this case
before that that
there is a very very dark heart
somewhere in in hollywood you know the
stuff that corey feldman has talked
about the stuff that
elijah wood talked about the the
pedophilia and and all of this
there is some very very dark stuff in
there and the what do you think the
genesis of that is do you think it's
just
power and money and then
crazy morals lack of morals i mean what
is it about hollywood
although this could be happening in any
industry right now and we just so happen
to know that we've
you know we're hearing about it in in
the sports world um
we've heard about it in academia i just
did a show recently on how prevalent
this kind of abuse can be in government
schools
it is i think it's just something that
needs to come out
where it comes from in particular
[Music]
okay so we've talked about the family
and that's one of the things people find
controversial about you i think really
though the one that you didn't mention
is the race and iq stuff this is
something you you
dive into a lot and i think people think
that there is somehow
a racist element to it so i don't want
to put any words in your mouth so do you
want to make your basic argument around
race and iq
can you can you sort of no no no listen
i'll be very clear about this because
yeah it's like saying do you want to
make
your argument that the sun is the center
of the solar system it's like well it's
not a personal thing like
this is not an idea i have come up okay
so it's not your idea it's not like
my formulation like i've got some
beautiful mind set of like
uh charts and lines in my basement it's
like it's all about the price of
magnesium man you know i mean
so i'm glad you countered with that
because in a way my question
accidentally was almost a setup so yeah
so i'll take that i'm going to give a
very very brief history of of
what it is and for those who don't know
where the science is and i'm not a
scientist so you know people verify
all of this i've got a whole list of
interviews with subject matter experts
on on the show about this topic so
listen to the experts this is my
amateur summation just for those who
want to know so
the the us army for over 100 years
has been giving more or less iq tests to
people to figure out whether they're
sort of officer material or
you know grunt material so to speak and
what they noticed was
between blacks and whites and this
becomes this bichromatic nonsense
because
the the question of ethnicity and iq is
a whole layer cake
you know just very briefly that the very
top the ashkenazi jews it is the jews
that are the uh the wandering jews so to
speak the ashkenazi jews you're sitting
across from an ashkenazi too can you
feel the iq just i actually am trying to
hoover up some
some language skills from you uh i'll do
it later with a straw but i i've been
dumbing it down for you so i know
and i appreciate that you know you know
as a caucasian i really need to go slow
yeah i love
lots of subtitles hand puppets and
health as well so yeah ashkenazi jews as
you know and
the science is like 115 iq on average
but lower on spatial reasoning and
higher like
even higher than 115 iq on verbal stuff
right i mean
verbal acuity among ashkenazi jews is
through the roof and the highest
recorded that there is
some of how this fits with our general
experience i mean what we're talking
about
everybody kind of knows deep down it's
just that we don't have the scientific
language or the mathematical language to
describe it
and that's what we're trying to do so
you know there's not a lot of famous
jewish architects or engineers because
jews test an average
around the hundreds in in spatial
reasoning
but crazy high on verbal acuity verbal
reasoning so of course you would expect
among novelists among playwrights among
lawyers
where high verbal iq is very important
you're going to find a lot of ashkenazi
jews
and lo and behold you do so what that
means is that let's say ashkenazi jews
said 120 125 verbal iq
and there's a certain proportion of them
in the language field but it's not
anything to do with
judaism it's to do with iq and so what
that means is that
if you look at any group of people
wherein they're in that iq
they're going to be equally represented
or proportioned
and then under that you have i don't
know the word oriental has kind of come
out of favor which is kind of
annoying in a way because how do you
differentiate people from india people
from
east asians whatever the chinese
japanese and so on uh
10300 405 iq in general
very high on uh spatial reasoning which
is why you know
software engineers uh other kinds of
engineers you see that you know like
google has this like it's like 40
or something like that of their
engineers or not much more because after
this diversity thing goes through
they're going to just have to pick
everybody by
color and all that but but this is the
thing right so if you're looking at
east asians with very high spatial iq
they're going to be quote
over-represented in those engineering
fields and so on but
not because everyone who's got that iq
is up there there just happened to be
more of those right
you've got uh your run-of-the-mill
vanilla caucasians coming in
at 100. then 100 is just i don't know
it's just that the baseline they
recalibrate it from time to time and so
on
and then uh below i i did some of this
what kind of mestizos or or uh hispanics
sometimes called oh that's very
loosey-goosey
term and uh that's sort of 85 90
and so on and then you've got uh blacks
uh in
in north america particularly uh african
americans coming in at
85 and there's been some upper drift a
little bit
and then uh below that you start to get
uh sub-saharan blacks
70 there are pygmies at uh in the high
50s low 60s there are
um the indigenous people of australia
i think in the low 60s and some of these
numbers again i don't have them all
tattooed on my you know wrists or
anything but so there is this
range it is unbelievably heartbreaking
i mean just just i'm straight up about
all of this like this is one of the
most difficult facts
i've ever had to absorb in my life i
mean i've gone through a bunch of
iterations
as a thinker you know i was a christian
and and a socialist and and all i mean
i've gone through i'm gonna go through a
whole journey
but i found almost nothing harder to
absorb
than this question of differences in iq
between
groups and this goes back many many
decades uh this was talked about by
hernstein uh in murray of course in the
bell curve
in 94 and nobody's been able to overturn
that and their basic argument
is to say look blacks
make less money than ashkenazi jews
but if you normalize by iq they don't
and this is
again it's heartbreaking stuff and it is
so difficult
to absorb this into your daily thinking
because i'm just going to
well i just want to pause you for a
second because it's interesting you're
describing it as heartbreaking and
struggle because that's what i was going
to ask you is that
because you do talk about this stuff um
i was going to ask you are you troubled
by it because i don't know that i've
gotten that exactly
through your videos but i obviously
haven't seen everything you've done on
this so hearing you frame it in that way
is actually different than the
a bit of the impression i had of you on
this oh
do you know how much i would give
dave to to know that it was just racism
because that's a solvable problem and
and people have been working on trying
to solve the problem of racism
for hundreds of years i mean it is
i mean i wouldn't say i give my left arm
because i'm left-handed but i would give
a lot
to i would give so much for it to just
be racism
so if you look at criminality
right i mean as you know uh black males
are
you know young black males three to four
percent of the american population
responsible for more than 50
of the homicides you look at what goes
on in the south side chicago
it's horrible and yet in general
it is not if you normalize by iq
everybody who has an iq of 85 has
similar levels of criminality
whites in america have a certain
particular
level of homicide that's pretty low and
whites around the whole world have the
same level of homicide
whites in england whites in belgium
whites in america all have the same
level
of homicide and
the question of course is environment
versus
genetics i would love to have a clear
answer to that
um science is making its way forward but
it's such a volatile topic that a lot of
scientists
you know like would rather do anything
than delve into this particular topic
but uh
it is oh it's extraordinarily
heartbreaking and
it means to me that no amount of
screams of racism can be guaranteed to
solve the problem and i think isn't that
what we've seen that the consciousness
about race
and racism has gone up so enormously and
and good you know like this there was
definite
racism in the world but without this
central
fact and it is a fact at the moment even
if we say it's 100 environmental it's
still a fact at the moment
you know even if we say well but is
there evidence that it's genetic
this is i'm not a geneticist genetic in
what regard i mean if we took
the brain of a 25 year old black man in
the brain of a 25 year old white man
what is it that they're doing that
different sizes
yeah yeah and again this is dependent on
every ethnicity the higher iq in general
there's lots of exceptions and so on
there are different sizes there as
evidence that um
if you take a um
a white kid from a middle-class
household for whatever reason ends up
being raised by a black family the white
kids can end up about 100 iq
if you take the average black kid have
them raised by an upper-class
middleweight family or jewish family and
so on they're going to end up
at about 85. so it does not appear to be
strongly environmental i don't believe
that there's no environmental causes you
know i've done
lots of videos where i strongly urge the
black community to
to breastfeed longer to to not hit their
children to do things that
will give their kids the best shot at
having higher iqs because that's going
to make a huge amount of difference in
american society and this is something
that
people need to talk about more is
equality and black parenting the quality
of black parenting
around the world but you know where in
america the most could possibly be done
is still quite
low they hit their kids the most and uh
if that can be improved i mean who knows
what could change how far do you go down
the rabbit hole of where all that starts
you know what i mean that they that the
most black people in america their
ancestors were brought here as slaves
that they didn't have equality for many
hundreds of years all of this
and then end up in poorer neighborhoods
then they get stuck on the welfare
system and
of course we're painting with sort of
broad brushes here of course but that is
the environmental factor right
yes and i you know there's nobody who
says no no sane person who says
any human characteristic is 100 genetic
um but again and i would love to i mean
i'm
very keen on improving um particularly
childhoods that's where i think the big
thing is
but you know a couple hundred years ago
in europe uh people were like a foot
shorter than they are now
and that was not genetics that was
environment you know not enough vitamin
d not enough nutrition as a whole and
back breaking labor and starting
in childhood and so on and so even if we
were to say
it's 100 environmental these are the
issues that we have right now
so let's say that that i could have been
seven feet tall but i didn't get enough
food as a kid
okay so that was environmental but i'm
still not seven feet tall at the moment
maybe my kids it could be different and
so on but uh nobody knows
how to improve it at the moment that's
the challenge you know you get this head
start program
what do they pour 100 billion dollars
into trying to close the black white
achievement gap
and with no effect a few little bits at
the beginning and then
it all generally tends to fade away so
it is something that
it it's a very difficult unpleasant
challenging phenomenon when we have
different iqs and we haven't even talked
about male female which again is a whole
other
challenge to to sort of absorb and
understand but
you know and it's funny because the left
is always complaining about i'm neither
left nor right but the left is always
saying
anti-science people are anti-science and
so on this is science iq
is a very very good measure it's one of
the few metrics in the social sciences
that
is you know measurable empirical it's
predictable right i mean if there was
some if people's iq was wildly different
from where they ended up in life
then it would be less valid but it's
very close it's a very close correlation
to where people end up and nobody knows
how to change disparate iqs yeah well
one of the things that you do in your
videos that i really like
is you often offer your audience a
chance to educate you and you say
send me links send me you know some
information that might change my opinion
on this so i think what we'll do for
this episode is we're going to find a
couple articles about this we'll find
something on the brain size we'll find
something on
ashkenazi jews and all of this stuff and
we'll put it down below and hopefully we
can get some of the conversation going
on this
uh because i think it's just one of
those things that
i it wades everyone into dangerous
territory and especially these days when
when everyone's accused of racism
endlessly
even if you're trying to find answers to
hard questions and i think we actually
i think both of us know we can actually
learn a little something from our
audience so
when i watch you do these videos and i
just watched your syria video that you
did the other day
and you said to people something to the
effect of don't just give me your crazy
theory
like it's not a theory i want a link i
want i want a paper
and some science so and i've i've had
you know i've had the subject matter
experts
on my show the geneticists and and the
social scientists i've had people
who believe that it's almost exclusively
environmental on to make the case i've
had people who believe that there's some
genetic
strong genetic elements and so on so i
am
gosh i mean it would be you know if i
could there were very few theories
that would be absolutely fantastic for
me to find disproven you know because
i've got a lot invested in my belief
system as everyone does but
boy if somebody could come along with a
way to say it it can be solved through
this or this is the cause or whatever it
is right i mean that would be fantastic
but right now
the problem of course is and people say
to me a lot and and this came up in a
conversation i think between
sam harris and charles murray charles
murray was on his show talking about
this
well why do you even want to bring this
up you know isn't this going to fuel
racists and isn't this it's like well
first of all
it's an important fact and and we are
tortured as a society by group
differences i mean i think i think
that's fairly
i mean don't worry we endlessly talk
about groups well they are real
and they're tragic you know when you
look at the the average net income of
ashkenazi jews and you compare it to to
blacks
it's worlds apart and and it's
horrible because if it is just attitude
if it is just
racism that's horrible and needs to be
resolved on the other hand
if it is to some degree genetic or for
whatever reason
it is what it is like let's say that
there's a group of irish people didn't
get enough to eat and they've ended up
being four and a half feet tall well
they're not going to make it in the nba
now we can say well maybe they're kids
and so on but saying the nba is
prejudiced against
these short irish people for no reason
whatsoever would be crazy
i always thought the nba was prejudiced
against ashkenazi jews but
here we go although you know the history
of jews and basketball right
i know you guys got it going right yeah
what are you going to do
i mean that's what i'd rather be doing
for after the show
yeah um but but the other concern as
well and maybe this comes out of being a
parent and so on
and i did weigh you know i read the
bell curve way back in the day and i did
way before i mean i don't just
get up and do shows like hey man
inspiration striking
you know i mean i did sort of weigh the
pros and cons
the issue is that um if the
if the iq differences are significantly
genetic
it's a tragedy but it's no one's fault
i actually think that if you think let's
say that you think that that um
blacks are the exactly the same as
ashkenazi jews and the question is why
the blacks failing
relative to jews you could say

welcome to the Rubin report thank you
great pleasure to be here in a while it
has been a while I've been on your show
a couple times before we get into
anything of real substance though I do
feel we have to address the amount of
grey that we both have in our beards
because it what's with the chin area
that I don't know I mean the first time
I had a beard and it went gray I've been
outside in Canada in the winter and I
was like oh it's just a little bit of
you know a little snow little ice or
something like that it's like just brush
away the father time doing his work I
have never had a beard in my life this
is my first beard ever so I didn't even
know that gray was there now I feel old
and tired and here's the thing too once
you have the beard in public view you
can't dock in it you know you can't
because it's too late like soon as you
like even if you get a bit of stubble
because you know there's people who
obsess about everyone's looks on the
internet you get a little bit of stubble
you can't yeah yeah you can't shoe
polish it up you can't do that you know
you just you got to let it go
what number are you buzzing with I'm
sort of like a number two kind of thing
I'm like an 8 ah okay we'll see yeah I
went into the controversial stuff well
now here's the thing because by now
you're okay because you have fairly
lengthy hair yeah but I cannot be the
guy with a beard much longer than his
hair that's a whole like Montana living
in the caves kind of look that has you
like everyone thinks that you're cooking
beans on a fire in an old shoe waiting
for the end of civilization there's got
to be a youtube series about that I'm
sure but yeah so I've got to keep it
fairly trim no matter which way yeah all
right well we have a lot to get to and I
really want to talk about the book but I
thought the best way to sort of start
this is that I know I'm gonna get a
certain amount of heat just for sitting
across from you and as I said I've been
on your show a couple of times before
and we've had nothing but pleasant
conversations have talked about
liberalism and logic and reason and all
that stuff but I think you're you're
somewhat aware of that type of thing
that for some people you are you may get
negative opinions about a free thinker
on the Internet I think actually
pre-internet it was Socrates and then
you know Copernicus not to put myself in
such lofty categories but there
certainly is when you are enriched
thinker and when you really try and
particularly when you scrub things down
to the bare minimum like car Randy
Descartes said like what if I know
nothing whatsoever what if I just wipe
everything out and try and build a
coherent and rational framework of
thinking and of understanding the world
and of understanding ethics what if I
just pretend I know nothing which is a
Socratic a moment you know nothing what
are you going to build from scratch and
I think that's the modern world is when
people said we don't know anything we
don't know whether the Sun or the the
earth is the center of the solar system
we don't know anything let's just
pretend we know nothing we don't even
know if the king is put there by God we
don't know if the aristocracy
is put there by God we don't know if the
priests are right about everything what
if we just wipe the slate clean and then
we build things up and we get modern
civilization I think out of that but
there are a lot of entrenched interests
that profit from existing error and when
people come along with better arguments
well it can be a little controversial
toss in a certain dose of Twitter and
then yeah you know you get where we are
now it's funny because I've had a little
bit of a change over the last couple of
months where I was kind of really just
you know everybody talks about well
we've never been more divided we're all
angry at each other we all hate each
other I think there's actually a great
opportunity right now for people that
are talking about ideas and I include
you in that but what would you say is
the thing that people find most
controversial about you is there one
time that you consistently hit on that
you think people either give you the
most flak or you think is sort of
waiting into the most inflammatory if I
knew that day if I would hit on it more
I've got a couple right here but I
thought I'd throw that to you you think
I would say I would say that the concept
so there's some abstract ones unless
impersonal ones no and people tend to
get most upset about the person once
because that's where people have kind of
like a stake in in their life in their
world so for me for sure I think people
get most upset when I talk about say for
instance you don't have to have abusive
people in your life you know whether
they're that's what the one is that's
number two one above that but we can
start with that sure so you know when I
was growing up I don't know for some of
you listen if they may hear Paleozoic
maybe something
but when I was growing up this was
everywhere when I was a kid and this was
part of the feminist revolution right
where they said if you are with an
abusive man you should get out you
should you know hit the road jack don't
look back deep in the rearview nothing
but dust right and that was something
that I grew up if you're being abused if
you're in an abusive relationship then
you should not be in that relationship
now I actually think that's a little too
harsh I think you should sit down and
talk with people and try and reason
things out and so on but that seems
relatively uncontroversial when you're
talking about adults but I think one of
the things that people got upset about
is when I logically at least to me
extended that to if you're an adult and
you had an abusive parent do you
actually need to continue to spend time
with that abusive parent and the answer
to me is well no because if you marry
someone that's a Chosen relationship
right I mean but your parent is someone
like I'm a parent right and I recognize
that my daughter did not choose me she
liked eenie meenie there's no there
wasn't like some you know this platonic
idea that you're kind of floating above
the world you look down and you pop some
cosmic game yeah I don't know about no I
don't really I mean so she didn't choose
me so it's an involuntary relationship
for for children and to me you have to
have the very highest standards when you
have the least voluntary relationship
and so when I put that argument forward
well some people seem to get quite upset
and yes it has always been you know from
a logical standpoint it's completely
baffling from a sort of personal
standpoint I can understand why so on
the logical front it makes sense because
you would just remove bad influences
from your life whether they're part of
your family or not your family it's just
that that I think well I think talk to
them first yeah I mean you don't show
that's what I want you know how far do
you think you have to go before you
would cut out something like a parent I
know it's I mean I I have this sort of
rule I don't tell people what to do in
the show because I mean not only would
that be kind of megalomaniacal but also
let's say somebody just Abbes you then
learned anything right so I wouldn't so
to say to people want but I would say
that it's hard to have a better
relationship in your life than your
worst relationship and so if you have a
very dysfunctional relationship and
there are certainly you know people out
there whose
parents were unfathomably evil towards
them you know like a mana station rape
of violent abuse you know massive
neglect and so on right so I think try
and talk to people in your life but do
not think that it's like physics that
you just have to have relationships
because I'm very big for freewill very
big for choices and I always have a kind
of reflexive pushback against you have
to you know
well it's your father's birthday you
have to call him it's like well he beat
me up every day of our childhood do I
really I do i maybe I'll skip this one
the kiss because people don't say well
you chose this man you have to stay
married to him even if he's drunkenly
beating you every night people said no I
mean and and again that's a chosen
relationship so involuntary
relationships I think there's a higher
standard so I think it's important you
sit down you talk about if you've had a
difficult history with your family your
parents sit down and talk about it with
them and you know if they want to go to
therapy if they want to try and find
ways to resolve it so much the better
what can be repaired should be repaired
but that's not up to you in the end Road
in the end is part of the conflict there
that so many of us walk around not
really dealing with issues in the first
place so I remember once years ago about
ten years ago a good friend of mine was
telling me about his relationship with
his dad he said his dad was abusive and
was always drunk and that one night he
came home his dad came home drunk and
basically just beat the living hell out
of him and that he has a 12 year-old
knew at that moment this guy is just you
know a dirtbag and I'm gonna always
treat him as such and in a bizarre way
he had very clean feelings about it as
the act of being punched and beaten was
so clean yeah but I think a lot of
people if you don't get hit there's all
sorts of other abuse so you walk around
in this sort of half truth phase you
know I can't quite parse it out do you
think that's part of it that people
don't quite yeah people have good
memories yeah you know that there's very
few people in the world that's like well
that person was evil from dawn until
dusk they woke up they were evil and
there was never I mean people always
have good memories even of bad people in
their life and so it definitely is
complicated and if you can use the good
memories as a way of hooking the
relationship to a better place fantastic
but we were talking just a little bit
before about you
sort of Weinstein scandal and all this
kind of stuff and just while we were
talking that the thought popped into my
mind Dave that we look at Hollywood and
we say oh you know these people they
seem to know or there's lots of
indications or lots of jokes or lots of
stuff where people said oh we knew we
knew and then people why didn't they say
something why didn't they say something
it's like well you can think that the
only problem with that is somewhere out
in Hollywood somewhere out among the
rich famous pretty people who have
massive talent more money and it seems
like decreasing levels of ethics as
every day goes forward but what about
people in your own life do you know for
instance not you personally but do you
audience do you do you in the audience
know somebody who's mistreating a child
do you know a parent who is and this can
be neglect and it likely is a very very
powerful form of abuse that is very hard
to unpack in in your mind do you have
suspicions you know do you see parents
you know screaming at their children or
spending their whole time on the cell
phone and not talking to them and so on
is there something that you can do to
improve that to remind them and say you
know your kids are only young ones try
and engage them in a positive way teach
them how to be rational by being
rational to them and love them and be
positive to them because it's not just
out there in Hollywood where there's all
this bad stuff that people aren't doing
people most people if you have any kind
of extended social circle extended
family and so on most people have
something in their life that they could
stand up for and say this needs to be
better this should be improved yeah and
I think that's one of the fascinations
that's going on but this Hollywood
scandal is people are saying they do say
well what about all the people who knew
but didn't do anything but I think most
of us and I can't myself in this as well
and play out in my life I've looked in
the mirror and said I know that
something's not right and I'm skating
over it I'm kind of you know
sidestepping it I'm crossing my fingers
I'm oh maybe it's just withdrawing
contact if there's some difficult
situation you see between a parent and
child or anyone so I think we all have
that responsibility but I think it's
kind of erupting in our consciousness
through that very distant event that's
easier to talk about for a lot of people
yeah what do you make of this whole
situation I mean we're watching it seems
like the entire industry is collapsing
in front of us I know you're not a major
fan of what Hollywood has been putting
out in the type of moral preaching and
these people do and I'm not either
you're my moral preaching from Good beep
people do so the I you I would assume at
some level you're enjoying watching it
be exposed but we briefly for a second
before we started taping we're talking
about how this now could wring its
tentacles everywhere where everyone is
going to look back and go 20 years ago
someone touch my knee me too you know
like that and I don't want to really
focus on that part but we just don't
we're sort of opening a Pandora's box
here that yeah that is kind of dangerous
but I think it's essential yeah I mean I
I think this has to be done and this
yeah I'm glad them to be clear I'm glad
the monsters are going down well but who
knows who's who knows who's a monster at
the moment right now it's dark there are
lots of eyes out there there are
tentacles flying around like I don't
know who's a good guy and who's if I'm
you Kate clearly there's some people
like the Weinsteins and so on it's like
you know that's some pretty nasty stuff
and I know he's got a bunch of
investigations into rape but I think in
New York there's no statute of
limitations so they can go after that
but right now I think we kind of in the
midst of a hysteria and and that is
fairly common when these kinds of new
things come out so when I was a kid this
was child abuse oh sorry this was a wife
abuse wife abuse was the big thing that
was going on you know this was not
talked about you kind of I had a
feminist advocate Aaron Pitts see on the
show a couple years ago and she was
saying that she ran one of the first
shelters for women who were being abused
and a lot of times the priest would come
down and say sorry love you got to go
back you made a vow and all of this so
this was when I was a kid this was the
big thing that was coming out and then
it was child abuse that came out a
little bit later now this kind of sexual
harassment stuff is something that it is
coming out and because it's kind of a
hysteria it means you know there are
some bad people who are being exposed
there are people who are kind of on the
line who are going to take some real
hits to their reputations and of course
inevitably there are gonna be some good
people who were taken down unjustly and
them you know what we need to do is have
a conversation about all of this as a
whole you know where there is this power
disparity whether it's a sexual
exploitation and I I do believe and I
made this case before that that there is
a very very dark heart somewhere in in
Hollywood you know the stuff that Corey
Feldman has talked about the stuff that
Elijah Wood talked about
that the pedophilia and and all of this
there is some very very dark stuff in
there and the what do you think the
genesis of that is do you think it's
just power and money and then crazy
morals lack of morals I mean what is it
about Hollywood although this could be
happening in any industry well we just
happened to know that we've you know
we're hearing about it in in the sports
world um we've heard about it in
academia I just did a show recently on
how prevalent this kind of abuse can be
in government schools it is I think it's
just something that needs to come out
where it comes from in particular you
know power corrupts and when you have a
lot of power when you have huge numbers
of people who want the opportunities
that you offer them it's really tempting
and I think easy to use that power I
mean as a public figure I'm sure you're
aware of the effect that you have on
people I'm aware of the effect that I
have on people and it is very very
important to be aware of our everybody's
fundamental capacity to be corrupted by
power and if you have influence in the
world you need to be very very careful
about how you wield it but there is a
kind of a gross sort of sensuality in
certain areas of Hollywood that does not
appear to have any particular moral
restraint and you know I'm not religious
myself but it is a godless in Hollywood
and I don't know that they have the kind
of abstract ethics that would cause that
restraint or that that cognizance you
know the one great thing about
Christianity is how it talks about the
devil and temptations and fallen
humanity that puts you on guard against
your worst self and if you're not on
guard against your worst self and you
have that kind of power I think it's a
real slippery slope it's interesting you
just ended that with that about atheism
in Christianity because I've noticed
lately and I'm around obviously a lot of
atheists and I've talked to a lot of
atheists and believers and half
believers and non-believers and whatever
it is but I do sense a little bit in the
Atheist community that there's because
secularism has gone so arise suddenly or
whatever not secularism as much as just
our systems seem to be struggling right
now that I do sense that people have a
little more respect for certain pieces
of religion a little bit does that
makes sense I would certainly be the
poster boy for that for what it's worth
I was very harsh on Christianity earlier
in my career and I have apologized for
that and I have withdrawn from that
position because the one thing that
atheists I mean intellectually that the
position of atheism is very hard to
assail it because you have to go with
faith and if you have an empirical
rational view of the universe faith
doesn't cut it
faith is you know I'm right it's just
closing your eyes and saying that you're
seeing something different it's not the
same as being scientific so
intellectually atheism is a very very
easy position but the great challenge I
think that has happened you know seeing
how the rise of atheism is for it's
causing also a rise in state power it is
causing a decay in borders and
boundaries and nation-states it is
causing a moral collapse across society
it is causing a blurring of rational
biological categories and empirical
methodologies so I think that the big
concern I have is something like this
that the world is a difficult and
dangerous place and we need in the world
within our own hearts in the world that
is out there we need ways to guide
ourselves we need ethics we need
morality mm-hmm now atheists looked at
the religion looked at religion and said
not true and again metaphysically
[Music]
all right YouTube this is it all of you
all of you out there in the digital
universe have been waiting for this and
especially on the Twitter the anonymous
people and the furry cats and the green
frogs and the rest of you you've all
wanted this so I want to set a couple
things up before I mentioned and I say
hello to my guests today I'm sitting
between two people that I consider
friends two people that I respect two
people that were brave enough to not
just fight about things online and from
the comforts of anonymity but two people
who were willing to sit across from each
other with serious disagreements with
some some bad blood there and some
things being said already but we're
willing to come here and talk about
everything that we're going to talk
about for the next hour and to me that
already is a win for everything that's
going on in the country these days
everything that's going on online these
days and everything else beyond that the
three of us well you know what I'm gonna
do some intros for so of course you guys
know Candace Owens red pill black
Candice was a guest on this show just
about three weeks ago and I think that
was one of the things that kind of put
you on the map and then just literally
about four or five days later it seems
that this whole explosion about what
social autopsy is or and what it was
kind of happened anyway welcome back to
the Reuben report I didn't know was
going to happen that quickly
yeah yeah and to my right is Blair white
who is a friend of mine who has been on
the show a couple of times and third
time now you have entered that is a rare
Nick that is a ray I think we've a
couple four timers but you might be the
one three timer right we will definitely
go for four but you are an absolutely
outspoken and I think irreverent fighter
against so many of the forces that I'm
fighting against all the time and and
both of you I think are fearless
defenders of the things that you care
about just a couple of quick things I
think that the three of us sitting here
if I dare use a little of identity
politics against itself for a moment gay
trans black yeah
yeah a black conservative a trans woman
who really leans right if not I don't do
you call yourself a conservative yes
okay so okay so we've got a black
conservative a trans conservative a gay
liberal but I'm an old-school liberal
which is everything against identity
politics these days and I know none of
us care about that stuff per se but I
think it's important just to put it out
there that we're doing this and that
that didn't of itself is a little bit of
a statement right there and we're doing
this face to face and more portly than
anything else perhaps we all were
lefties yes we all were on the other
side of perhaps where we're at now
politically that's wildly different yeah
three years ago yeah that's not that
long ago you were wildly different 18
months ago 18 months ago and I've kind
of had a slow evolution over these last
couple years and I think all of those
things are worth saying because I think
actually that there's a lot that we do
agree on and hopefully we can get to
some of that but I know you guys are
watching because you want to find out
more about what actually happened with
Candace's website social autopsy now she
explained this fully to me when we sat
down about a month ago and then after
that a bunch of youtubers started making
videos about her comments on it was some
of it true it sounds like maybe some
definitions were slightly confused I
think I've talked enough what I thought
the best way to start would be for you
simply to just explain once again your
involvement in social autopsy and and
why you did it and sort of where it's at
at the moment and then we'll go from
there
right so I just want to start off
because we just had a conversation
off-camera she posted something that
said my predictions that I talked about
I'm not comfortable using the she
pronoun not because it's not anything to
be disrespectful it's just that a lot of
people that follow me don't know that
Blair is trans and a lot of people that
follow her maybe don't know me vice
versa and I think that it betrays the
audience when you make it sound like
this is a petty catfight and there are
two girls sitting across from a table
when in fact it is a grown man sitting
across from a grown woman who has had a
lot of things to say about me when I've
never even met you or said negative
comment about you so I just want that to
be very clear happy to for the rest of
this yeah it should be very clear both
adults you know
no no we're done we're definitely adults
I just think it's interesting how you
act like you're above the ad hominem is
you above attacking someone when in
reality you and I both know that the
situation is you're using those pronouns
and you're saying what you're saying
calling me a grown man that's the kid
attack the notepad and let me finish
that you're doing that in a way to be
passive aggressive and petty but in a
way that your audience doesn't actually
read because you do have the very
hardcore conservative audience and so
they're not really gonna read as petty
everyone else will I don't want them to
think that this is a catfight between
two girls it's not I'm saying that you
are no it's very important because it
really isn't though but we can but we
can move on because it really isn't
about oh shoot me and you care for a man
I'm happy to call you a shoot more the
rest that we can move on from the
pronoun thing but you have to start by
calling me man okay well I don't want to
have to afterwards say well if you are
this is your stance on trans why did you
sit across from a trans person and call
them cheese so I'm making it clear
because as we know you guys like to dig
up every single thing that I do in every
single meal I dug up everything you've
done out of everyone Candice there's
been a lot of youtubers that have come
out against you so I actually have a
question here before we go out of all
the youtubers so Doug stuff up about you
I never made a video I'm a youtuber if I
don't think some junk on a video I
jumped on a video for our stream of
which I was on for probably 15 minutes
now we're in 15 minute I would I was I
was not on a stream for an hour on for
an hour and 15 minutes until Barbara
came on the stream i watch all right so
you know let's do this let's just just
to clean this up so we don't I just want
to get to lost in the weeds of every
little word I think look you guys know
my feelings about free speech and where
I'm not gonna tell you what to say how
to refer to Blair and Blair can
obviously defend herself we can do all
that but just so we don't get too lost
in that stuff let's just try to stick to
the original story here I think it's
fine that you you promised it that way
you defended yourself I think that's
that's totally fine but we could end up
in the in the back part of this forever
so let's just get to the to the how did
this whole thing start okay so the
backstory to the backstory obviously you
know about social autopsy but there's a
very relevant part of this which is
essentially that when I was in high
school had experience it happened to me
and it's something that I like to talk
about factually and I hate talking about
it because it involves other people and
I'm out here talking about my opinions
my beliefs when you're involving other
people I think it's a little unfair when
I was a junior in high school I received
about
one night I was sitting on a couch my
boyfriend I receive anonymous phone
calls and at the end of watching
Talladega Nights with my boyfriend I
picked up the phone I listened to the
voicemails and they were people for boys
that were swimming back and forth
calling me a dirty saying really
talk either your family saying you're
we're gonna do to you like we did in
Martin Luther King put a bullet in the
back of your head made references to
Rosa Parks it was really probably the
nastiest thing that I've ever heard in
my entire life after hearing that and by
the way this is not a victim story it's
just something that factually happened
that you guys can all research after
hearing those voicemails I went to
school the next day and I didn't call
the cops or anything but I was a little
terrified because I didn't know I did
not know four people that wanted to see
me dead and that hated me period I went
school the next day the teacher
essentially was we were talking in a
philosophy class I brought up when it
happened it was like a moment where it
made sense to bring up what happened in
it before and the teacher jumped up and
said like you're gonna the principal
right now you're reporting this like
that's very serious like I want to take
you right now he picks me up go into the
principal's office and she hears the
voice mails which I still had there were
three of them and she made the decision
to call the police like totally I would
have never called the police or have
done tonight before it turns out by some
random stroke of like super misfortune
that one of the kids that was in the car
when they left these voicemails happened
to be the current governor of
Connecticut son and where this would
have normally been like maybe like a tap
on the finger sort of a thing that's
turned into an FBI investigation and you
know the then mayor was making comments
that were very like you know political
became political so all of a sudden I'm
I'm in school and I've got the
n-double-a-cp on the front steps I'm
very if you know anything about me I
hate the n-double-a-cp because of this I
think that they are a trash group and
that they literally extort black
people's emotions for pay which is
another thing Blair you don't know where
I send anything for you to call me a
fraudulent conservative you don't know
the things that I've lived through so
that was something that I didn't really
understand a lot of things I don't
understand to you so I'm I have a
million questions for you because
unfortunately you'd have me blocked up
until like two days ago right over one
tweet I sent to you so no it was a live
stream it was a live streaming on a live
stream for not 15 minutes I hope people
go and fact check back
there for that long that's the first
thing the second thing is again you had
me blocked before the livestream and we
locked before the livestream so and
you've had a million people block you
blocks right well I'm gonna get into
that he's gonna I want to find you I
think first you had it I'm just saying
I'm glad that we're actually having a
conversation because prior to this the
reason why it's actually gone to the
point where have to do on the rhythm of
work rather than just a quick exchange
on Twitter are you making a video on
your own channel it's cuz you've blocked
conversations I just want to be clear
you're allowed to tweet out your trash
and I am supposed to then defend myself
rather than you get on Timmy first for
answered your work you're absolutely not
supposed to you defend your life you
don't have to do anything right usually
your your might might your son say that
I blocked you after and they're insulted
me publicly to what do you have a
hundred and thirty thousand doesn't even
doesn't even make sense to you like
saying that right now Candice Candice
you have every right to block me there's
no you can not respond you can respond
you can block me whatever it is what I'm
saying is people are criticizing the way
that you pay on the situation you have
the backstory which our absolute let you
finish but the way you're dealing people
calling out the story and calling out
things that they think maybe are
fraudulent maybe they're not fraudulent
maybe you can clear that up is you
haven't actually cleared it up you've
blocked everyone people can attest that
everyone Andy wore ski Bungie King Dave
: who actually provided screenshots with
things he said to you so unlike me I can
see you blocking me for calling you
trash and honestly I'll say I'm sorry
for calling you trash that's totally
fine but as far as him he sent like four
or five very respectful tweets just
asking you for questions asking for your
started the story so if he made a video
I would just like to hold on they made
the videos and then ask questions I
don't do that I don't go she ate with
terrorists you know to make it look
Harry you're a lying okay issue and then
saying now you better come to me and
answer me
who does that anything hold on it's an
expression I don't negotiate Aires don't
take it to heart it's an expression not
taking it hard it's just kind of silly
all right an expression oh no we got it
we got to get the full story before
because otherwise there's gonna be
enough people watching this that still
aren't clear on the whole story
right that if we go too far into the
follow-up we're gonna get lost here by
the way I just really quick want to
mention that when you texted me and said
I want to do this on your show and I'd
like to do with Blair I thought about it
for a minute cuz I wasn't even sure if I
wanted to get involved in this I think
that this Twitter YouTube
ramaa I think causes it's partly we're
all here because of just this drama
machine that just endlessly drags
everybody but to to both of your credit
you asked me to do it and I texted you
and literally within 30 seconds you said
you would do it and there that's that's
that people should know that because
this is we live in a time when no one
backs themselves up they hide and say
all this crap so I just put that out
there but let but let's just let's just
get through the story and then we can
then we can do the rest long story short
this was categorized as a hate crime the
FBI was involved I was out of school for
about six weeks and just imagine like I
didn't even want to report it and then
having like what felt like your entire
life it was front page of Connecticut
newspapers for two months of people and
a lot of the stuff that you had to read
because remember the FBI was involved so
they wouldn't make any arrests they
wouldn't do anything as they wanted to
dot the i's and cross T's they're done
with a politician a democratic
politician right and he's not being
honest he could have easily just been
like my kid did something really stupid
he's trying to be a politician
essentially and when these arrests were
finally made a while the investigation
was going on people were just on the
internet just speculating just like and
not being aware that they were talking
about children you know they know I'm
saying I was probably the eldest I was
17 years old there's a youngest person
in that car I didn't know any of them by
the way this is like a drunk phone call
I knew one count of the four kids the
young is can that cause 14 years old so
these kids are getting called racist so
yes and I personally like I hate labels
like racism
I hate boom you call somebody a racist
sexist it really stings me because I
think it's wrong I think it's wrong that
a fourteen-year-old got labeled a racist
that I've got instead of being
reprimanded or told why it was wrong so
I'm very against Lee well another thing
that you know from my history have
always been very conservative on
following this event and I barely made
it to college because of this I mean it
was like something that was really
taxing that happened in my senior year
and following this event I developed
severe anorexia like it's a part of my
story or something that need to be sorry
about people have anorexia are just
looking for a way to control to control
mechanism so if I felt like my life was
completely out of control and people
were basically able to freely say
whatever they want about me and it was
permanently on the internet like this
situation that happened and the N double
AC P final politicians and nobody gave a
about the kids that were involved in
this nobody cared about the kids are
involved in this
I developed anorexia the I think the
ringleader they kept calling him that
like had these kids call me hat went on
to have like DUIs he was like a closeted
gay at the time everybody's life got
ruined by this and it was something that
I never wanted and it ate me alive it
just was like this is it like the
Internet is forever and these things
happen you get to write about them and
you get to politicize something that's
not true right trumped when I got over
my anorexia I think I was in I was 22 at
the time was in 2012 like I had fully
honestly just I thought through it it
was one of those things that I had to
sit down a really question where did
Santa Rex come from what am i trying to
control and what have I learned from
this
I fought about children I thought to
myself like technology is something that
people don't talk about give a TED talk
on this which many people that have
staunch to defend they may have seen my
TED Talks they knew where my heart was
that when I did this I felt like kids we
are in like a different generation
you're also young as well so you have
you know we have Instagram Facebook they
never had this like you when you were in
school or not trying to like me you
didn't have this you didn't have and
there are 10 year olds that are killing
himself over snapchat and it's all like
just because the end of my dad when I
was growing up my dad had a beeper and
then all of a sudden we have Facebook
and Instagram all these things and I
thought to myself what a way if I can
come back and create something that
helps kids navigate technology right
without ruining their lives like this
kids need to be arrested for saying mean
things no I disagree with that
like I disagree even though they
characterize characterized me as the
victim and characterize these children
as the aggressors I felt that it was
wrong okay so you created social law
actually with the idea that it was sort
of gonna almost self police some of the
kids ability to ruin themselves right
exactly so what we thought was what if
there was a way when kids do these like
stupid things and we initially always
thought about kids we had to change it
because people said first try it on
adults try to send a little news service
people are sensitive when it comes to
children and we said what if there was a
way that we could archive what they say
with like a no no type of a punishment
like maybe it's held for for three
months and everybody like all of these
schools you were meeting with principals
of schools of high schools before we
even decided what we wanted to do to say
how can we
what would be helpful what our kids care
about well they care about being on the
football team right what if you've said
you're on you're on social type see all
these schools have this program you said
this to Carolina whatever it is now you
don't get trapped with 14 something
that's like petty you know but it's
better than getting arrested right it's
better than knowing that you you were a
part of someone's suicide because you
[Music]
joining me today is a stand-up comic who
apparently scares a whole bunch of
people with his choice of comedy words
which can be very dangerous
oh and Benjamin welcome to the Reuben
report thanks for having me man it's an
honor you're scary comedy words you're
freaking people out I see people angry
at you on Twitter all the time each week
I make a commitment to not mention
Twitter and then somehow it just rears
its ugly 140-character head into yeah
it's like the mob and Godfather yeah oh
yeah it's always for I'm not even a
troll or anything it's just for saying
things that I think everyone would agree
with I'm like yeah three-year-olds can't
be trans and everyone's like what and
I'm like okay so then I just start
fighting yeah so I want to get into like
some of the issues you talk about and
all that but first just I I don't talk
to I've talked to a whole bunch of
stand-ups on here but I don't talk to a
lot of people that are sort of in the
game sort of the level you are at right
now like really kind of like in the
thick of their career in it right now
what possessed you I asked you before
you started you're a couple years you
know gonna be 37 did you say what
possessed you to become a stand-up comic
well I I was a classical piano player
and I was in college and I my dad taught
public speech still teaches public
speech so I've always been comfortable
onstage and I would play piano at
weddings but I would just get hammered
and write songs for people and uh and so
my friends in college were like you
should open for this dude who's coming
I'm like who is it they're like I don't
know what he's been is is this dude
named Kevin Hart
so we were in a cafeteria and and I
opened for him and it was so fun then I
was like okay I'm gonna do that you know
but I have to go to law school and do
the normal thing and then there's an
economic downturn and my adviser was
like since its down anyway just take a
year and do what you want to do and I
was like yeah maybe I will do that and
then I just never stopped and who was
this advisor does his name was dr. Scott
because I was in World War two history a
history major focused on World War two
and so I got really close with him and
I'm because he taught a class called the
Holocaust and so that was such an
emotional class I think there was this
weird bonding of trauma so we've just
got really close and I'm so I trusted
and I just and then I met you know Nick
Swardson and Adam Sandler early on and
so I could make a living and it's so
funny how like when you're saying like
I'm pissing people off on Twitter it's
for things that I was almost called a
hack four or five years ago like men and
women being different yeah like back in
the day everyone's like all in so broad
he's such a hack and now it's like you
cannot say there's a difference in
gender and I'm like if you just don't
move the Overton Window just keep
sliding right over yeah well I didn't
say in the oh it's not do the Overton
Window had shifted it's that it has
shattered at this point nothing that
made sense five years ago in a Comedy
sense actually makes sense anymore
oh yeah like watch boys and saddles or
just I watch it like a month ago and
ever I mean first off date the way the
amount of times that they say the N word
of course is off the charts but just
everything of every stereotype literally
every service time you can think of in a
modern sense is in that movie they could
not make that movie right now
no and I think people don't understand
sarcasm it's almost like late onset
autism like I was doing a bit the other
day this is what got me in this heat
with this Shaun White character is uh I
was doing a bit about being a
progressive slave owner yeah progressive
slave owners like the problem of slavery
was uh it's only black people which is
unfair I want all the people if you
can't outrun the nets and the harpoons
your mind yeah and people thought I was
promoting slavery and I'm like I think
not not assuming that I know that's bad
is like almost scarier to me
yeah well I'm like I do another bit
about not having white pride or white
shame and I'm like I've never done
anything to anybody
my last slave was in oh wait you know
thanks a lot Obama you know and people
like what I'm like do you think
someone's knock knock who's there like
do you think there's a door here right
like how do you not see that mechanism
of comedy what do you think has happened
there because I noticed that for me when
I was in in the thick of stand up which
really from was about 98 to around 2010
and lesson in these last couple years
what I noticed a change when cell phones
started popping up enclosure and then
there was the you know obviously the
Michael Richards incident and and then
everyone who's video is hating
everything I noticed that comics were
distracted all the time even if I saw
one guy just on his phone in the back
look that would bother me even if I was
crushed
you know you may not get a million
people I'm killing it but the one guy
like that was something that shifted
comedy force it's the lowercase I it's
it's the bitten apple man it's this
isn't biblical right here you know
it's like the lowercase I represents
narcissism without even the strength of
it but you know it's like that uh
there's a book the Screwtape Letters by
I think CS Lewis where it's it's it's
two demons talking to each other about
how to get souls it's kind of comedic
but pretty profound and one of the point
one of the demons is like it's worse to
want to do something terrible and not
even have the balls to do it like that
lowercase I iPhone iMac III but it's a
lower case and then the bitten Apple is
like the fall of man and I have an
iPhone I'm on attack all the time I'm
not judging or being above it but that
creates this environment where stupid
people are now entitled where they're
like well as someone who knows nothing I
think and and people listen to you or
nothing that gives you extra privilege
yeah because you're yeah because my
smart privilege is really showing I
guess but it's like this weird like
people that don't know the definition of
words you know I think we're 20 20 years
away from people just being like no not
not not now I'm speaking Japanese like
they almost don't care it all about the
skill set how much you this you think is
actually just a phenomenon of the online
world cuz I'm a firm believer that out
there in the real world and when you do
what we're doing right now you really
can bring out the best in people and
that they're not all hysterical all's
well yeah I mean I live firmly in the
real world like my brothers in arborists
when I'm not on the road I'm literally
doing lumberjack work with a bunch of
vets so it's like I live in the
mountains in a small town like I know
the sanity of people and I also tour so
much that I know I'm not offending
communities you know like I'll finish a
show and a bunch of like inner-city
black dudes are like you're the only
white dude I find phony now man that was
great and then you go online and it's
just a bunch of white Yale chicks being
like how dare you and I'm like but it
almost doesn't matter because the online
world is so powerful like it gets me
fired it gets me my my it'll make my
income go down so that's when it becomes
real to me yeah where people can be like
it's cyber but is it I think it's
becoming its own organism yeah so we
literally can make your income go down
you are not making that up so just in
the last what two months because of a
comment I think that started on Twitter
yeah you got a gig canceled for a couple
grand I mean what it was about seventy
five yeah 7,500 7,500 bucks you had a
gig canceled at UConn so can you tell me
about that yeah so I was having an
argument online where I revealed a very
problematic view that I don't think
three-year-olds can be transgendered and
then especially once they started
talking about hormone blockers like you
know my instinct to protect was kicking
in and I was like this is wrong you know
and people started calling me
transphobic and I'm like that's not
years old three three three
yeah and now the kids like six and this
guy is fairly powerful in podcasting I
think it's been an NPR a lot and you
know so I get all these what used to be
trolls like these little were they eggs
yeah now or like blue checkmark people
yeah and I'm like you wait a minute
you're a writer at an Amazon show and
you're gonna call me human garbage
because of a child but I don't back down
I'm like okay so do you believe a
six-year-old side but they identify I'm
like dude I identified as a dog like I
thought was a spaceman I was an autobot
right yeah and it's like because it also
completely derails actual you know
adults making the decision to
transgender I'm like what you're doing
it's almost like the Spacey thing where
you almost equated being gay with like
liking kids and you're like okay that's
such stuff back it's good ten years you
know I'm like that's crazy and and so
then people just kept coming at me and I
wouldn't stop you know I'm like no I
know people that want to kill you guys
because it's child abuse I know I know
boys that are rape survivors it became
trained killers in Afghanistan that
literally like just please don't do this
there's people that hate you
and and because I used to do it when it
I might have missed where you go that
boys that were no I have friends
you know because I live near a rehab
facility for heroin and a lot of them
are vets and and they eating the trauma
that yeah they like when when a when a
grown man is saying that he's gonna pump
hormones into his little boys so they
never go through puberty there's people
that want that want to hurt that guy
because that I used to do a bit about
when it was the Catholic Church back in
the day it's weird how it swung because
I used to just rip on the right for some
of these corruptions stuff where I'm
like you know I was uh I was an altar
boy I knew something was up when they
said wear a dress light a candle and
drink some wine I'm like I was had a
date yeah and and I'm like now you guys
are encouraging this behavior and I'm
like and and it just kept going until I
got this this email that was like due to
you know recent Twitter stuff like we
have to disinvite you to UConn and I was
so I posted that because that's happened
to me before with stuff I've been asked
by agents to take down certain tweets
that looking back we're absolutely valid
and and so I posted that just because
people think we're lying but people like
me and you in this industry almost
Canaries in coal mines sometimes rhyme
like no they are trying to shut you up
yeah and so then my agent dropped me and
like so and you were with the pre you
don't up the name of you see yeah yeah
yeah yeah you this is one of the like 10
years yeah I've known with the same
manager in the same agent for 10 years
so I'm not one of these problematic
clients like I I've never left anybody
yeah and so and I just done this like a
pilot with truTV like a month before so
it's not like I was even on a downward
dang and and I guess I just crossed so
many lines that they're like and and
they're good guys you know I'm not mad
at the agents and I'm mad at the system
that makes it so comedians now have to
push an agenda right like this endless
cowardice that's sort of middle
management people then so they're just
like alright we're gonna cut Benjamin
we'll just let them go because we don't
want to deal with the heat regardless of
whether you're killing it in the clubs
they don't care because my twitter is
been going up my YouTube subscriptions
have quadrupled in a month yeah and it's
like that doesn't matter to them it's
this outrage ponzi-scheme it's an
accurate song it's almost like a bernie
made
thing without Rage where it's like you
have this Ponzi scheme that has to grow
and find new victims or else it all
collapses and then you have to read
Thomas soul and realize there's some
economic issues but uh well we're
getting sold on the show oh he's one my
heroes I'm black redneck white liberals
one of the best books I've ever read in
my life I've been working on this guy
literally for three years we're going up
to Stanford to do it oh that's genius
yeah
do you remember sort of a moment on
stage when you saw the Overton Window
crash like was it a specific bit like I
remember once being on stage and I used
to do a bit it was a trend I just
mentioned the Autobots but it was a
Transformers bit you say something about
how jazz was the autobot who was black
and he kind of talked in drive and I
used to do this an impression of jazz
and I would say the n-word at the end
yeah but I was doing an impression of a
fictitious cartoon character yeah that
was the whole purpose of it he used to
get huge laughs I remember doing it on
stage one I had a Gotham comedy club in
New York City yeah and the audience kind
of it was a different reaction than I
had ever gotten and I was like all right
I'm done with that one and and I just
let it go do you do you have a moment
where you saw something shift for me it
was a slow it was a death by a thousand
cuts but I remember one joke in
particular that because in LA a lot of
my friends are gay so I would write a
lot of jokes around like that I that
would make them laugh you know and then
my and and I remember I'd go to certain
areas and there'd be these like
housewife type suburban brain-dead
idiots and I would do a similar joke and
they would turn so hard I'm like bro I
wrote that like in a gay bar I think
other bits the bit was uh I was like
yeah it's affected a lot of communities
you know but no one got hit harder than
the vampires and I used to do it now
it's hilarious because it's not anti-gay
remotely it's like wait a minute how do
you get this from blood and sex that's
all I've done for a thousand years you
can't put a condom on a Fang
I don't know who I just killed you know
and I remember getting drones and being
like that's a brilliant joke I hate you
guys but but then I would I would keep
it inside though I wouldn't turn on the
crowd I try not to turn the crowd for
being stupid but I remember just being
like this is getting worse and worse and
worse I've seen Zach Galifianakis say
the n-word on stage
six without any hater malice obviously
and that and that didn't get the same
reaction and now you can't even say you
can't even be a certain type of person
on stage yeah what do you make of just
like the comics in general like the
state of comedy to me right now is
pretty off bunch of these guys
that I used to love and admire many of
whom I know dude they're cowards and I'm
looking at them now and they're
preaching all day long whining like
Jimmy Kimmel and all these guys I'm like
dude you guys are cowards and and and
history eats these people it's not like
it's the only a matter of time I'm like
you are a comedian it's like if I played
football so it's like if you play on the
offensive line you don't throw the ball
like we're comedians we're supposed to
push envelopes there's no line for us we
let the crowd figure out who they are by
hyperbole and you know there's that
quote I exaggerate to clarify you know
and and then you see these guys talking
about self-censorship like Trevor Noah
talking about self-centered censorship
and stuff and I'm like bro I had your
back when they came at you mm-hmm
and now in one night like two years nine
million later you're like talking this
 but that just give you a compliment
I'm so happy to the people like you
exist because you can get depressed with
this stuff you know like you and Shapiro
and Rogan and Crowder and there's people
that are they're really intelligent
people that aren't going down this hole
that just were a lifeline to me because
I felt like everyone was going insane
and I still think they are but at least
I know that you know I try to ask myself
am I crazy you know I'm like you know if
one is good every comic ever is walking
around thinking you know but if it's
like if one guy calls you an
he might be an but the third guy
you might be an you know so I'm
like I'm killing onstage but like the
community's starting to get weird but
then so I'm just glad that you guys
exist because I know a lot of professors
that love your show too that are like
they want they want that dialogue that
marketplace of ideas and lately it's
just been like what color is your skin
how much do you like hell yeah well
thanks I mean I appreciate that and
that's why I wanted to have you on and
that's I think why we sort of got in the
loop you know we're very much in that
same loop you know Twitter and there's a
lot of crossover
our audiences and all that you mentioned
the the college thing and professors you
come from two professors to professor
SUNY system State University of New York
I'm a product of Binghamton not SUNY
Plattsburgh ER here oh and you and your
parents from this we go yeah and the
professors right now are going through a
hard time because people that thought
they were liberal it's kind of like what
you went through and what I went through
where it's like you think that the
personal liberty aspect of liberalism
which was like Pro gay rights stuff like
that but then you're like I'm also pro
private guns you know I don't I think
that citizens should have guns and I'm
like no but not that one and I'm like
and then you see how saturated leftism
is on colleges where people are now just
judged based on their skin and sexuality
where it's like well as a black person
who's gay and you're like you never read
Martin Luther King jr. yeah like letter
from a Birmingham jail or any of that
stuff like the whole point was not to
think this way and it's it's intense so
yeah but the good news is is I was only
I was pretty sad for a few weeks but
then I just kind of started doing my own
thing and I had self-produced
an hour special in England I just put up
for sale myself at vimeo.com slash Owen
Benjamin if anyone wants to get feed the
bear excellent self-promotion thank you
a very subtle we normally do it at the
end not me math I break all those rules
you have no rules that's your thing my
only rules no rules I just what if I
just killed myself
that's my only rule man it's good for
clicks yeah well that's the web that's
what I was always against anarchy I
always make fun of like everybody's a
Michael malleus and one joke I said to
him I was like I said the problem of the
Enter key is a bad leadership you need
help it's like if there's no rules how
do you have an organization yeah what I
make of a guy like now so I had my did
you see our interview by any chance I
prob into all your interviews I never
watched any of them that's why I didn't
even know yeah I always listened this is
the place we do I am digging it man here
we go very college like the bat is the
six-foot-seven guy who's bad at
basketball that's a taunt
are you bad at basketball oh yeah girls
pick and then a disappointment oh I
[Music]
all right youtube we are live with a man
who i think at this point needs no
introduction jordan peterson welcome
back this is
number four if we count our live event
at clemson two weeks ago this is your
fourth appearance on the reuben report
amazing that we can think of anything to
talk about that much time you think
we're gonna figure out something well
you yeah we're both pretty noisy so i
imagine we'll probably figure out
something people say you know peterson
he's talking a lot could you think
perhaps in the course of this hour hour
and a half we could get you to the end
you know could you run out of words by
the end of this thing i don't know i had
a reputation when i was like four years
old for never not talking so i don't
think it's going to go away that's like
51 years ago so well it's funny because
i just did a behind the scenes video
that we put up for our patrons only
today is actually a very special day for
me because uh november 1st 2016 is the
day that i moved into this house and and
started building this studio which took
a couple weeks and you were actually my
first guest oh yeah right while we were
between studios i had to do it in the
other room we did it on google hangouts
there was crappy internet connection
construction noise there was
construction noise i could barely hear
you at points i couldn't see you and it
was really my intro to you i actually
didn't know that much about you at the
time you had just sort of come on the
map in in a newer way so we did that one
then we've done a live sit down here
then we did clemson and and here we are
again two weeks later and uh yeah well
it's a good deal we got a lot to get to
we do you're you're writing a new book
coming out in uh january
you bet end of january i think the 23rd
i think is when it comes out it's
already yeah so
yeah i'm pretty happy about that so you
sent me the the advanced copy pdf is
that the official advanced copy have it
ah there's a little bit of changes since
then but the actual galleys will be
ready within a week i think it goes to
print next week yeah waiting on a few
illustrations and then it's ready to go
yeah so as an interviewer you actually
made my job really easy today because
your chapters i told you before we
started your chapters are so perfect
that each one i think we can lay into a
question here but i want to start with
some other stuff first because we just
did clemson about two weeks ago it was a
great event it was totally sold out kids
sitting in the in the stairwell trying
you know because there was no more room
in the chairs and all that
did you walk out of there feeling as
positive about the college stuff as me
because we know about all the bad stuff
we all read it all the time and we see
all the all the terrible stuff on
college campuses but i really leave a
lot of the events that i do
feeling good well a lot of the bad a lot
of the stuff that's that's unsavory
let's say is the work of a very small
minority of students i mean this is true
particularly perhaps not particularly
but it's it's certainly true of the
university of toronto which is
um i would say
like a center
conservative institution as far as the
students are concerned most of them are
children of first generation immigrants
like they they've got their eye on the
prize you know they spend most of their
time working it's not a party school
it's not a radical school but there's a
small percentage of radical people
including people who come in from
outside the university to cause trouble
and a small number of radical
disciplines and it doesn't take that
many people who are really uh
focused on activism to produce an effect
that's far beyond their their numerical
significance and so it and you know you
don't want to give university kids a bad
name because the vast majority of them i
think are i don't think they're any less
hardworking for example than the baby
boomers yeah quite the contrary in my in
my estimation
so yeah i usually go to the universities
and come away with a positive feeling
you know so and clemson was certainly an
event like that yeah what do you make of
the ability for that small minority to
affect such a big amount of people you
had a tweet about a shepherd it only
takes yeah it doesn't take very many
dogs to to shepherd a lot of sheep yeah
how is it that they've been able to do
that because when we go out there i mean
look we did that q a for an hour after
we had to end we had to end it early
because they they literally need you
know they needed the room they were
kicking us out but there were still 50
people that wanted to ask us questions
we waited we stayed around for another
hour and still we had they had to drag
us out i mean we could have done it all
night long but what do you make of that
that little group that has somehow
they're really good at it they've been
like first of all you know the the
radical leftist
position that they put forward has been
an activist movement since let's say
before the russian revolution right i
mean it's not like
the ground hasn't been prepared for this
sort of thing and the disciplines that
are leading this like women's studies
for example they're activist disciplines
they train people to do this that that's
what they do it's pretty much all they
do except not educating them
propagandizing them feeding them you
know sets of lies um and and
oversimplifying the universe in a in a
radical way so and and so it doesn't
that's the thing it doesn't take that
many people who are committed to a cause
to have a an impact beyond
their numbers and i think that might
even be more true with the onset of of
social media
so do you think that's why what you're
doing is is sort of hitting it the way
it is because you're basically
i mean obviously you can explain
post-modernism and marxism and all of
that
stuff but really what you're telling
people is to own their own life i mean
from the even from the amount of your
book that i was able to read today that
to me seems to be the the thrust of what
you're doing you're saying sort of
get your together and then
deal with all this other stuff yeah well
i mean i don't really consider myself in
some sense a political person and i mean
that really in a very particular way
i've i've thought about a political
career many times during my life i
worked for a political party when i was
a kid you know at like 14
and quite intently but what party was it
was it was a socialist party in canada
the ndp that was back the new democratic
party which is part of the mainstream
and canadian politics um
that was back when i would say they were
a valid voice for the working class you
know and i knew the leadership of the of
the provincial party and the national
party to some degree i i had some access
because the person who was our
representative
was the leader of the alberta ndp and i
knew him and his wife quite well
um and they were
at the upper echelons of the party at
least at that time those people were
actually concerned with giving the
working class a voice like it was a
genuine it was a genuine they were
genuinely committed to that but i
noticed that the lower level punk party
functionaries you know i didn't like
them much and i couldn't put my finger
on it until i read george orwell and you
know orwell said
he was criticizing british socialists
even though he was a socialist himself
he said well
typical british middle class socialist
doesn't like the poor they just hate the
rich it's like and that was that was
exactly the feeling i got that this
this so-called
sympathy
empathy let's say for the oppressed had
a hell of a lot more to do with
vengefulness
and resentment with regards to the
to anyone who was seen as having
privilege and i certainly think that
that's just and i was thinking about
that the other day i just did a talk in
dc and i was thinking about you know the
marxist claims to sympathy with the
working class because you might say well
they actually have sympathy for the
working class are they really trying to
put their
um
their their their
positions forward their needs forward or
do they just hate the successful
depending on how that's divided up
i thought well how do you make a
judgment like that and i had the this
personal experience but then i thought
well that's easy with marxism it's like
you just look at all the murders
and then you know whether that was
a movement that was genuinely motivated
by empathy right and a lot of people die
in all of this leftist yeah a lot
yeah like an unbelievable number and
yeah and
not just
members of the oppressor class let's say
like everyone
and it happens over and over you know
and it's really worth thinking about
because well when
you might not think well is that somehow
embedded in the marxist doctrine is it
an inevitable consequence of the
unfolding of these ideas and someone
like ayn rand for example would say
definitely and solzhenitsyn made that
case too in the gulag archipelago but
it's not self-evident but i think
there's a level under which underneath
the ideas that you could go and say
what's motivating this is it actually
like saintly compassion for the
downtrodden or is it resentment about
the fact that life is unfair and tragic
which it definitely is it is well
you know by their fruits ye shall know
them that's the answer to that question
it's like well if if 30 40 million
people die in the aftermath of the
revolution and a tremendous number of
them are ordinary people
and that happens repeatedly it's like oh
well i guess it must be resentment and
hatred because like how else do you
account for all of that the proof is in
the pudding so to speak well if you know
and if you're not willing to accept that
sort of thing as proof you've got to
also ask like well okay what would you
allow to falsify your theory like how
many corpses have to stack up before you
think and the number the number is
pretty high already so it's it's
uncountable yeah you know like we don't
know we don't know how many people died
as a consequence of communist
totalitarianism it could be 50 million
it could be 150 million those are big
error bars yeah you know like that's
that's a big that's a big problem when
you can't count in the tens of millions
when you can't get the damn estimate
right and it happened in multiple
cultures right because you might say
well it was just specific to a time and
place it wasn't intrinsic to this
radical doctrine yeah well there's not
that much it's the same about the soviet
union and all of its
countries let's say broad range of
cultures
maoist china cambodia
you know
places in africa as well these aren't
the same places but nonetheless you drop
that poisonous seed in there and it's
like mayhem in no time flat and nothing
works like it's so
so i'm going for the
don't be thinking that you're so saintly
just because you claim to stand for the
oppressed it's like examine your
conscience and
well that thing that thing though is a
drug to people right i mean that you
know what we refer to as virtue
signaling and all that but that that
feeling that you're always looking out
for everyone else you'll always
sacrifice yourself for anyone else
you'll always attack the the privileged
and supposed people above you it really
there's something in that that that has
like an addictive quality well the
question is what's the drug you know the
question the drug might be oh i'm a good
person
maybe but like a more
psychoanalytically minded person might
say no that's not actually the drug the
drug is
the hatred
and the
rationalization for the use of power and
the and that and the wish for
totalitarian control
and tyrannical rule
that the
that the mask mask of virtue covers
so the virtue signaling actually that's
that's not what's really providing the
big kick
you know it's like i'm a good person
it's like no it's even better than this
it's like i've got a place to direct my
worst
my worst impulses i don't even have to
notice them myself because i've got this
mask of virtue and so i can let the
let's call them
you know the demonic forces that make up
part of the human psyche i can let them
have carte blanche and and then also say
that i'm virtuous you know i would say
that's a powerful combination yeah well
it looks like it's a powerful
combination i mean if you if you look at
the way people behave
historically speaking it it looks
i mean it's often that
that great horrors are perpetrated by
people who
mask them in a utopian covering right
right because nobody knows nobody comes
out and says hey well i'm satan himself
you know it's like i'm out here to do
harm right that isn't what people but
but somehow harm gets done yeah and so
you know one of the things i really like
about the american
[Music]
political system is that it's it's not
predicated on a utopian ideal you know
the the founders of the american system
of course they were basically english
but you know the founders of the
american system said okay well you know
you can't trust people to do the right
thing it doesn't mean they're all bad
but
you can't assume that they're going to
do the utopian thing that isn't what
people are like and they tend to take
care of themselves first and maybe
that's okay maybe it's not but it has to
be bounded but
given what we know about the um
imperfection of individuals and
societies let's try to build a system
that no idiot can screw up too badly
yeah and i think that's so mature man
it's so it's so psychologically informed
and so wise it's like no we're not
aiming for the utopia we'll aim for
for not too murderous how about that
right and that's the thing because
humans are the flaw in the utopian
system right i mean you can't create
utopia because we're part of it and
we're not perfect well so the idea of
the perfect system created by an
imperfect creature us
it actually doesn't even stand to reason
yeah well and you can't also blame our
imperfections on the imperfect social
structure which is of course what the
marxists tend to do because it doesn't
help it's like okay the social
structure's imperfect well who produced
that
it just pushes the question back one
step
you know and so so while i said at the
beginning of this that i'm not
specifically political and i haven't
been addressing everything that's been
going on except when i drift i would say
politically i think instead no no the
right thing to do
is this is why i'm a psychologist it's
like
the right level of focus is the
individual
and what individuals can do
first is like what a physician should do
first do no harm
right like assume that you know
you're probably a force for mayhem in
trouble unless you've got yourself
disciplined and aimed right you know
because you're complicated and
troublesome
and so unless you've got your act
together you're trouble and everyone
knows that and they know people like
that so the first thing you do is
constrain the amount of damage you're
likely to do and you do that by
disciplining yourself and by also
admitting to yourself that you don't
know what you're doing that there's lots
of things about you that need to be
improved which is actually that's a
beacon of hope right it's like well my
life is miserable
yeah but you're doing a bunch of things
wrong it's like oh good because if i'm
doing a bunch of things wrong then maybe
if i fix them my life won't be so
horrible
well that's good and everyone knows
about the fact that they're not doing
things right fundamentally you know they
don't have to examine their conscience
that much to figure that out and then
you can start
aiming for something something good
start not lying any more than you have
to or maybe not at all if you can train
yourself then you start to discern truth
from falsehood and then you can find out
empirically
does your life get better or worse well
you know i've got hundreds of letters
now maybe thousands of letters
um
from people who have been trying that
you know and they say well you know i'm
way better you have to do way better
than you know i went into than i thought
that i was before i went into a
restaurant the other day in toronto and
this kid came up and he shook my hand
and he said i just want to know that
since i've been listening to you i've
got three
promotions at this restaurant and i said
well you know
good work man like way to be and he said
yeah well i started coming in on time
and i'm working really hard and i'm
trying to figure out how i can do a good
job here instead of being above the job
you know i'll take this until i get
something better it's sort of beneath me
it's like
no probably not actually it's not that
easy to do most jobs it's actually hard
to do most jobs especially to do them
well and it turns out that the world is
constituted if society is set up well
that if you do a good job
invisible doors open in front of you
because people and i know this i've had
lots of contact with businesses and
academic institutions and
like the people who run things
competently
are
often but not always interested very
interested in finding young people that
they can
mentor and move forward it's actually
one of the pleasures of being competent
[Music]
Halloween is next week meaning it's time
for a slew of virtues signaling articles
and think pieces on why every costume
you want to wear is racist bigoted or
some evil form of cultural appropriation
allow me to spare you the mental
exhaustion and propose something truly
radical right now wear whatever the heck
it is you want to wear this Halloween
for me it's gonna be the same old
obi-wan Kenobi costume I born for about
the past ten years though this year I do
think it'll look particularly sharp with
my newfound beard forgetting the
specifics of who's offended by what
today the real issue here I'd like to
address is how the set of people who
find offence everywhere are actually
doing something much more offensive than
any costume could ever accomplish this
endlessly outraged crowd are trying to
suck the joy out of every facet of life
from comedy to Halloween it's just one
of the many techniques these control
freaks masked as the good guys used to
whittle down your own sense of what's
right and wrong until you bow to their
demand of total conformity once they can
get you to stop joking stop wearing
costumes you want to wear and most
importantly stop thinking for yourself
it's very easy to manipulate you
socially politically or otherwise it's
also one of the reasons we've seen so
many thoughtful decent people purged by
this hysterical shrieking movement over
the past few years such as some of my
former guests like Brett Weinstein and
Laura Kipnis when conformity of thought
is your number one goal then diversity
of thought is your number one enemy this
leaves little room for conversation
comedy or costumes it's precisely why
comedy seems largely dead right now who
turns on late-night TV to watch a
comedian lecture you about politics come
to think of it who turns on late-night
comedy at all anymore what I wouldn't
give for Johnny Carson to be resurrected
from the dead to actually show these
guys a thing or two you know come to
think of it zombie Johnny Carson
actually seems like a pretty great
Halloween costume
someone make that happen I'll retweet
you once conversation and honest debate
is taken away all that is left
yelling once comedy is taken away all
that's left is lecturing and once
costumes are taken away all that's left
is conformity none of this adds up to
how a healthy society should operate
does this mean that some conversations
are hard to have yes does it mean that
some jokes are offensive indeed and does
it mean that some costumes might trigger
someone absolutely
but we shouldn't trade in the distinctly
human trait of using our minds to talk
to joke or to express ourselves through
dressing how we please just because it
might offend somebody of course with all
that in mind it's up to you where that
line from edginess to offense is this is
what great satirist and comics and
writers have had to deal with for all
time if you get close to the line you
might just trip over it and rightly or
wrongly there probably will be
consequences for your misstep one year
in high school I dressed up as an Amish
guy one of my buddies dressed up as an
Orthodox Jew and another dressed up as a
Catholic priest we didn't do it to
offend anyone we did it because it was
different and in some ways that's what
Halloween is all about we also agged a
bunch of houses and stole candy but
fortunately that was before Twitter as
for me I have no desire to go out of my
way to offend anyone but I understand
why it's important to live in a society
that allows us to do just that so this
Halloween whether you're a nun a
sexy Pocahontas or a good old-fashioned
geisha remember it's better to be any of
those than a mindless conformist zombie
just looking for brains
[Music]
I'm a first amendment absolutist I
believe in only two things completely
the First Amendment and boobs joining me
today is the host of out kick the
coverage on Fox Sports Radio and a man
who has never never been let down by
boobs Clay Travis welcome to the rubric
I'm happy to hear that's the best
introduction I've had in a long time
that is well that is your introduction I
knew there was only one way I could do
it and it was gonna have to be about
boobs you like boobs I do in the First
Amendment both in fact when I showed up
today at your place I had on my boobs
and First Amendment shirt that we sold a
lot of at the eye appearance on CNN and
I'd like to say that it was some grand
viral attempt to create a stir and it's
not like I'm a beyond or above that but
no I I've been saying that for years
writing it saying it's ears and say two
men say it's a women and I certainly
didn't think it was going to turn into
the viral sensation that it did yeah but
it did turn into viral yeah I saw you
were trending on Twitter that's like
basically the highest compliment you
could get these days the outrage over it
so in a second we're gonna show some of
Brooke Baldwin's reaction when you said
it truly did you did you have no sense
that anything was gay because I saw a
lot of people aside you see what he did
there you see he said it on headline
news the day before yeah - a female
anchor I have said it on my radio show
probably a hundred times I've written it
in my columns yeah it was it's such like
it kind of a words that I'm used to
saying then I just went to it because
it's part of a natural argument there
and I once I saw like remember when I'm
doing that show and you'll know this but
I think a lot of people listening and
viewing will not when you are I was
doing that from my home studio so I can
stare like I'm staring at you right now
I can see how you react to everything
that I say but in my home studio I have
no monitor so I don't even know who the
other person is that I'm talking with I
can just hear their voices and I can't
see her facial reactions at all but as
soon as she reacted I knew what she was
doing I knew there was somebody in her
ear saying like oh this is Trump's
America you got to go after this guy
clay Travis he's a misogynist he's a
boar you know you've got it you've got
to put him in his place
and so what I do
for better or worse is when people want
me to like hit reverse and back up and
apologize
I put the pedal to the metal and go
forward full steam so I doubled down I
tripled down I may have even quadrupled
down so once that happened I knew what
she was trying to do yeah I was her
producer in her ear saying you got to
stand up on behalf of all women or
whatever you know some some clearly
artificial reaction on her part I think
yeah cuz it really kind of torpedoed the
entire segment I mean professional from
her yeah well the other guests then sort
of bought in on it too he attends and
then I think you or at least one of your
fans like unearth some of his old tweets
where he said so I mean the idea that
that liking boobs has become
misogynistic yes
shows you how bananas the whole debate
has gone well not only that I mean it's
not like women are surprised at men like
boobs right big business victorious yeah
exactly
cosmetic surgery the Victoria's Secret
has revolutionized the bra industry in
the last 30 years like golf clubs right
a new technology that comes out so women
understand that boobs are attractive to
men right so it's not like it was
somehow like this crazy thing to say and
then she was like I can't believe you
would say that to a woman I'm like I
would say it to a man I better her worse
here in large extreme and my wife would
say this too I talked the same to men
and women and so to me expecting that I
would change the way I'm gonna speak
because a woman is interviewing me I
would talk to her that if you were a
woman right now I'd be talking to you
the same way yeah that's sexism
yeah I tried to treat everybody the
exact same what may not be great okay
Travis an but he's equally an
 to everybody if you want to
criticize me for that right you're so
right that's what I used to say about
gay marriage it's like you gotta let
people be equal so that you can treat
them as shitty as everybody else if they
don't have to be as miserable as
miserable as my wife yeah I deserve that
right they absolutely do all right so
real quick we're gonna show just the 45
second or so reaction from Brooke and
we're not gonna do an hour we can't do
it out then but we're not gonna but
let's just watch that real quick and I
just want to make sure I'm hearing you
correctly
vo OBS because as a woman I'm I said
boobs
I believe completely in the First
Amendment and in boobs those the only
two things I believe 100% and in this
country and by the way jemelle has
notice that he went straight to that
yeah you're absolutely right I did
national television and with a female
host I say all the time because it's
true and that's what I do because I like
boobs and the First Amendment which is
exactly what I said
listen listen Brooke I think that speaks
for itself so the fake outrage that's
the interesting thing to me and you
already hit on this a little bit but she
most likely had somebody in her ear
saying you've got to stand up for women
and all that stuff
do you realize what was happening while
it was happening again the challenges I
don't see your reaction yeah I knew you
know when she comes back to me and says
it spells out boobs
yeah like again I had the opportunity to
back up but at that point in time I
meant what I said it's not like I'm
gonna say oh I apologize let me throw
myself into the fetal position and beg
for the forgiveness of the left and wing
America who's perpetually outraged yeah
and in fact I knew that I was in for a
battle and I I've said this before but I
kind of like being in the center of
media storms you know I feel like
there's a certain peace that comes over
you when you're in the middle of like a
and in the arena literally fighting in
the moment yeah I want my reminds me
when I was a kid
Brer Rabbit you know there were a story
like don't throw me in the briar patch
yeah I love being in the briar patch or
you hear pigs like don't get in the mud
with a pig like he likes being in the
mud
I like wallowing around in the mud so I
knew as soon as she cut the interview
short that it was gonna be a viral
sensation right and I've been in enough
of these situations where people choose
sides automatically and they like Oh
clay Travis is awesome Oh clay travis
sucks bravo for CNN CNN sucks I know how
you know sort of bipolar the reaction is
gonna be for lack of a better term and
so I immediately got on Twitter and
tweet it out ESPN just I mean sorry CNN
could've been just cut my interview
short because I said I love the First
Amendment and boobs I remember what the
exact tweet I said was but I sent that
and then I immediately got on the
benefit
having all these media apparatus ready I
immediately got on periscope and
Facebook Alive and told my side of the
story and took it to the next level and
said oh by the way we're gonna sell
first-amendment at boobs t-shirt yeah
and we're gonna donate the proceeds to
breast cancer awareness which just
throws everybody into an uproar right
because and and and then I think I was a
head of the media storm and I knew the
media storm was gonna come and at that
point in time you can't check your phone
you can't even check Twitter it's just
an onslaught but what I did love was I
got a call from CNN asking me to come on
Monday right and so then I tweeted like
CNN's not outraged you know they want me
to come on Monday as well they left me a
voicemail so I played that voicemail the
next day
CNN denies that they left me a voicemail
says that there's no truth to it and
then late that night I get a text
message saying hey this is not gonna
work but I will say this then I've told
this story maybe once or twice but my
wife is downstairs cuz I do everything
out of my out of my house and she and
right before then I've been saying okay
I've got to do this one more interview
it's been a busy week because that had
been a really busy week for us it was
Friday
and I was like we'll be done in the
afternoon we'll chill we'll go out we'll
take the boys out for pizza just have a
chill night yeah and and it's 2:30 in
the afternoon my time whatever it is I
do that hit and my wife just texts me
from downstairs never good when you get
texted by your wife even bother walking
upstairs
do I need to put the house on the market
because my wife's fear my wife's fear
and I think there's probably a lot of
spouses who have lived through this is
that when you're in this middle of this
perpetual outrage machine at some point
the mob wins Yeah right and my argument
is I'm gonna fight the mob for the rest
of my wife I like it I enjoy it I think
they're wrong and I'm right mm-hmm
but I think her fear is at some point
they're gonna come for you and they're
gonna scalp you and they're gonna win a
fight yeah and she when she saw that she
was like this is gonna be bad for you
they're gonna type catch to you as a
sexist they're gonna say you hate women
and my argument was I know that's not
true and accusations are insults and
levied against me that I know aren't
true if you want to say I'm racist
sexist misogynistic whatever else and
call me whatever you want to me I've
called myself worse you know and I
probably get called worse by the people
that did I live with how did that
conversation go with your wife
because that's serious I mean that's
early stuff I get it I understand look
she is prepared we watched and I had a
read to go back and read cuz Howard
Stern's an idol mine so you need to read
what his wife went through imagine what
what life was like for him in the early
90s to me when you're trying to be as
honest as you possibly can people say
they want honesty but a lot of times
they don't really wins do they want the
fluff they want the o.r a sysm is bad Oh
sexism is bad they don't want you to
actually dive into the nitty-gritty of
details and figure out what the facts
are of a situation and I've always said
that maybe this came to me in law school
I remember a criminal law professor I
had who said there are three things that
matter about every case the facts the
facts and the facts and for what we do I
always find that there's so few people
that would actually look at the facts
the original documents of a story look
at the basis for what they're basing
their opinion on and in this world that
we live in now everybody's decided what
they believe and a story happens and
everybody just uses it as an excuse to
justify whatever they already believe
facts be damned and I feel like I'm in
the rarity you're in the rarity you sit
back and say okay let's like actually
look at the details here and figure out
what the story is before we decide
whether it fits our worldview or not
yeah and what's interesting I think for
guys like us and I think that we are
that these ideas at least are becoming
the silent majority is that in our cases
we both are two-time Obama voters I was
a progressive Wars presidential campaign
right so we've done that like it's not
you know because after this what it what
interested me so much wasn't just wasn't
just okay the boobs comment yeah it is
what it is you know what I mean but it's
it's the reaction after the
manufacturing of the of CNN the the PR
team inviting you on then Brooke saying
no he's banned forever but just this
machine versus the guy who was invited
on says a line that he always says but
then you you took the power back because
you're like a periscope the truth I'll
play the voicemail but then you also
have to deal with all the family
and all that and it just it shows you it
there's a certain David versus Goliath
thing that I just love about it it's
totally true and look when I also went
back if you watch that clip the other
guy who was on there claims that he's
offended
what I said has sent all sorts of more
ridiculous tweets and my audience that's
the other good that's a beautiful thing
that is - yeah the people who support us
will love us yeah right and and that is
that is very gratifying because when
you're in the war all the time when
you're in the battle every day it's good
to know there's some people who have
your back
yeah and they may not be able to have
your back in the same public leg that
you or I can because this is what we do
for a living but there's so many people
out there working at companies that
serious jobs that were worried about
being out there in the arena fighting
because they got to protect their family
they got to make the mortgage payment
they got to do everything else but I
think it's it's gratifying to see them
saying hey we support you here but yeah
they went back I didn't do it they went
back and looked through all of his
tweets and started popping me with look
at what this guy said and then they go
back and I find the same thing with
Brooke Baldwin Don lemons on there
talking about how great Kathy Griffin's
Rack is on with her he's coming on to
show his nipples on you know New Year's
Eve she doesn't react at all to that
nipple net Kathy Griffin says nipple
like six or seven times okay that's the
point I nobody came to me from a
journalistic perspective and I'm far
from a journalist I know in a grand
scheme right I have an opinion in but
when you have it the discussion going on
to me where she made the biggest error
is and it was great for me because it
went viral millions of people saw it we
sold you know lots of shirts we were
asked a lot of money for breast cancer
awareness it was all positive for me but
to me where she failed is she had an
opportunity to have a serious discussion
about a substantive issue and when you
react to a word which in no way needed
to be reacted to I was on to the next
argument right it was just part and
parcel of my larger argument she allowed
that segment to be derailed in a way
that it didn't need to be but isn't that
so consistent with everything that this
set of people is doing these days like
if she would have just let it slide or
even just it could have been a
three-second maybe that was the wrong
word kind of thing and then moved on
then this wouldn't have all happened but
what happened after the truth is clay
Travis is bigger so as you said here
the fact remains this all worked to your
advantage because you like being in the
fight you know how to do it and all that
but what does that tell you about just
the general state of media but also sort
of what's happening with the left that
they they so go over the top that they
end
strengthening oh I mean this is what
they're doing with whatever the
alt-right is or the one-time assist
these days are all that is that you keep
building them yeah because you you need
[Music]
so I think all this is an interesting
Segway - jamele Hill which will kind of
get us into ESPN in general and again
again all these things are so related
from from the what the individual is
doing to the employer - now the
companies and everything else and we can
talk about Trump and all that but you're
Mel is an interesting one I would love
to have her yeah on the show she's
welcome to come on she said you know
this thing about Trump being a white
supremacist now I don't agree with the
premise but I do defend her right so she
what she wants of course but that comes
with the risk that you're talking about
your employer may not be that thrilled
then a couple weeks go by and then she
want speech she's actively telling
people to boycott ESPN's advertisers
that is at to me that is as fireable of
an offense as you could possibly have as
an employee of a company telling the
people who pay the bills they don't it's
AI think goes to an a lack of
comprehension about how you're paid
right because ultimately I understand
you guys figure out how the business
model is funded and she said boycott
AT&T AT&T provides 15 percent of the
revenue of ESPN through DirecTV plus all
their sundry other advertisements that
they that they pay to me the Jamel he'll
mess was set in place by a prior
decision which was a wrong one and I'm a
First Amendment absolutist we said
before I love first and Eminem boobs
yeah and I think what's a little bit
scary about the First Amendment and why
a lot of people follow us is in a modern
social media era you even if you're off
your job can be fired for something that
you put on Facebook or that you put on
Twitter or Instagram or snapchat it's
it's an instant from going being no name
at all to being virally famous and
that's a great book you probably have
read it so you've been publicly shamed I
think it was John I I know that I
haven't read it
oh it's so good but a lot of it is what
we live right and so it's fine for
people like you or me because we have a
little bit of public profile so if
somebody decides oh clay Travis said
something controversial and comes after
me well there's people who know me and
are gonna defend me if you're just a
regular person there's probably not very
many people who are gonna defend you it
turns into a mob really quickly and so I
think this is emblematic of larger
society as a whole I think it's a little
bit scary that people are constantly
being judged by what they say on so
Media as it pertains to their job I
don't know why everybody suddenly works
in HR in our immediate reaction when
somebody says something you don't like
whatever political side you're on is
that person should be fired really funny
like you do you wake up and you look at
Twitter and I'm like all right who today
that I've never heard of before is gonna
be a star is going to either a star
we're just gonna be like you know
publicly shamed or destroyed in hardened
feather
yes but it's her way what was the what
was the decision so the first decision
that was wrong was Curt Schilling Curt
Schilling went on his private Facebook
page when he was not on air and like I
make this distinction I think some
people follow it some people don't
if Jamel Hill goes on 6 p.m.
SportsCenter and she says the Rockets
won last night and oh by the way Donald
Trump's a white supremacist and all the
supporters are racist she should be
fired yeah because that's ESPN using
their method of distribution to reach
all of their audience and people go on
there expecting that they're not going
to hear about Donald Trump being a white
supremacist and and the same thing would
be true of Curt Schilling Curt Schilling
got fired because he had done several
things the conservative but he had said
he chaired a meme which basically
ridiculed the North Carolina transgender
bathroom right and it was like a popular
meme on the internet that lots of people
were sharing like something about like a
guy who was dressed up like a woman like
let him use the bathroom with your
daughter whatever and again I don't have
an issue with the try I think this is a
great example of how we manufacture
issues that shouldn't exist somehow in
the 60s the 70s will right movement the
rest of the 60s the 70s 80s 90s 2000s
2000 teens people who are dressed like
one sex to use that bathroom and we've
never had any people have been going to
the bathroom I have heard a lot of
problems about it never had any issue
the example I use is we don't have
somebody Crocodile Dundee gender Jenna
wins and outside right yeah so that's a
Sheila gives it a chance yeah yeah it
may be so and so I don't think his
opinion was irrational I don't think it
was outlandish I think it was certainly
permissible because in his private life
that's what he believes they fired him
for it and I think once they fired him
for that they established there are
private opinions that ESPN employees can
have which don't allow them to have
public opinions on
world of sports curt schilling wasn't
fired because he did a bad job analyzing
whether the Red Sox should change relief
pitchers right he wasn't fired because
he said something on the air that was
bad for ESPN's business he was fired
because people decided to follow his
private political opinions and deem them
to be unacceptable my issue with the
ESPN is not politics it's that they have
decided that only left-wing politics are
permissible
so when Jamel Hill says that the
president is a white supremacist that
his supporters are all racist and that
everybody that surrounds him is also
white supremacists including by the way
potentially his his daughter who is
Jewish and his grand I don't think there
that's wife who is in him yes yes I
don't think there that many people who
would marry an immigrant and also be
very comfortable with having
grandchildren who are Jewish that are
just fundamentally vile human beings who
judge based on race gender religion
whatever so when she gives that opinion
they have set the precedent of you could
be fired for a political opinion they
don't do anything for that opinion they
basically wrapper on her knuckles say
she shouldn't have done that and it
clearly establishes what I've been
writing and talking about for a long
time which is ESPN has one standard of
speech for left-wing political belief
and another standard for right-wing and
to me that's emblematic not just of ESPN
but of our culture as a whole when it
comes frequently to the world of sports
media which I'm in yeah I don't think
you're an awful human being if you
disagree with the with you know the fact
that Charlotte has a rule about
transgender bathroom right I think it's
stupid that we end up in this debate
because again it's a fundamentally
artificial debate designed to play to
the basis of the left and the right and
create conflict where we don't need it
but I don't think you having one opinion
or the other there is an awful one I
think it's an artificial construct and I
don't think that ESPN can make the
decision oh because of this we're
pulling our games our all-star game out
of the City of Charlotte and the same
thing of the ACC and all these other
sports media leviathans that did that
and then you're also by the way playing
games in Mexico which has much worse of
a human rights issues and and violations
when it comes to gays MVAs got games in
China which doesn't even allow people to
get on you know like the
Internet and use it freely we're
building or not we but Qatar is building
the World Cup Stadium for whatever it is
slave labor with slave labor literally
yes and also all these it's not just
athletics by the way it's all these
people who are musicians they come out
and say oh we're not gonna play in North
Carolina but then they're playing in
Latvia no no like literally like then
they are playing for Saudi Arabia which
just now allowed women to drive cars
yeah right like it's it's a artificial
outrage machine that isn't rooted in any
kind of reality and I think sports has
become one of the driving forces of it
so how do we take some of this back yeah
it's a great thing queer doing it I
think conversations like this are
actually doing it as we were saying
there's people taking the red pill yeah
yeah but where does this where does this
put you even politically actually I
don't because if we if we were to go
through a couple of things you you sir
everything up completely honestly no
answer me ask me any question I'll give
you the I had you know I never yes my my
guests a question beforehand but I had
no doubt because that's one of the
things that I get criticized about like
I turned down my own television show to
be able to say exactly what I think
right I think the most illegitimate you
can attack my beliefs and as much as you
want I'm wide open to that the most
illegitimate thing that people say about
me is clay Travis is just saying that
because he wants to get attention
because he's trying to sell to a Marc no
I have literally turned down millions of
dollars to be able to say exactly what I
believe my ability to tell you exactly
what I think is to me the most important
thing that I do and I'm to the extent
like everybody sells out on some level
like I don't know how many people who
are in my industry would turn down their
own television show so they can still
sell everybody what they think about
Game of Thrones which I was told I
couldn't talk about as well as every
political belief I've ever had
so yeah fire away I mean I think this is
a fascinating well just for the record
I've had at least three offers for
networks for more money than I'm making
and I've said no to because yes as you
said I'm the home studio I have a home
studio
nobody is controlling us there is
nothing in our ear yes it doesn't mean
we're gonna be right all the time
but what it means is we're gonna be real
or at least as real as humanly possible
 in America right now then I think
what matters more than anything else
regardless of what you believe is that
you are authentically in what you
believe and that you know people who are
watching this in a conversation between
the two of us
think they'll say wow like that sounds
like a real conversation that real
people are having as opposed to like you
said somebody in our ear talking for
three minutes and telling us what to say
they're creating artificial debate so I
sense that you're probably right where I
am in that I think you're probably a
classical liberal I don't know that
you've I know you voted for Garry
Johnson this past time as I did to both
said yeah a little checkoff of anything
I've ever done I've had him on the show
he's a perfectly nice guy but yeah
terrible candidate okay again we both
went over was that he was gonna be a lot
better than he was
yeah that there would have been a viable
option there as opposed to the two most
hated candidates that have ever been
nominated by major political parties in
our country's history I'm with you
brother okay so so he was a libertarian
yeah obviously
so I sense that you're somewhere between
probably a classical liberal and a
libertarian I don't even think defense
you know defining them so perfectly is
that important but you mentioned a
couple a little bit of your liberal cred
so you want to just knock off a couple
Roach oice okay I think that you should
have that right if you're a woman to
decide whether or not to have a baby
i amber grudgingly Pro I'll even go
further than that I really struggle with
it but at the moment I am pro-choice I
am when it comes to the death penalty
because I've I've worked in the criminal
justice system I think the death penalty
presumes a level of certitude that does
not exist I think it presumes that we
are flawless I think we're all flawed no
matter what we do for a living I think
there probably have been innocent people
put to death for crimes they did not
commit and I think if you or I were
accused of murder we wouldn't get the
death penalty because we're wealthy
enough to afford good attorneys so I
think if you are poor and likely to be
not represented by a quality attorney
you're more likely to get the death
penalty so I think that's an unfair
aspect of it as well okay so against the
death penalty pro-choice for gay
marriage we got that marriage I am I
would say from a I wish there was a lot
less tax you know like I am pro markets
I think one thing you learn early on at
least for me when I went to law school
and I went to work at a firm and started
representing big companies I was blown
away by the false and like just crap
lawsuits that are filed all day long
every day mm-hmm there are good lawsuits
that need to be filed against big
companies the vast majority don't and so
I am I don't believe that companies are
evil you know I believe in markets
I'm a First Amendment absolutist I
believe in the marketplace of ideas it's
funny
I got a D in First Amendment law when I
was a back
Vanderbilt Law School you're making up
for it I can afford now it's I never
would have believed that I would end up
you know as fascinated by the law and
studying it now you know when I was 22
it was a third year 25 I guess in the
third year my final semester I didn't
buy books and I didn't go to class like
I was I was ready to just take the bar
exam and be out and so I got a D on that
first amendment exam but I wish now I
could go back in time and more seriously
study it because I've ended up doing it
as an adult but I wish I had gotten that
found date I wish I paid more attention
when I was 25 so kids out there pay more
attention in class even if you're
thinking like I'm never gonna use this
because who makes a living talking about
the First Amendment somehow probably of
anybody at Vanderbilt Law School I bet I
spend more time talking about it than
anybody well it's funny right before we
started I said to you that I went to
SUNY Binghamton yeah we didn't have a
great athletic program right right which
I would have been very into so I really
just smoke pot and play video games for
four years I was a Poli Sci major so I
guess I parlayed that into something but
yeah I I go to these schools now and I
was at Clemson last Mia's at Harvard two
weeks ago and I go to all these schools
and I need all these kids who are so in
the thick of it figuring out what they
think and we're talking about all this
stuff and I'm like man you have such a
leg up on the world it's so great it's
inspiring well I'm impressed by the
number of college kids that are like
there's a lot of going on right
now yeah you know and and they're like
really kind of steeped in it because
they are on a college campus right now
and they see this like what I what I
call is like it's not like a modern-day
royalty because you'll hear like back in
the day you you would hear if you were
in England somebody would say I'm the
3rd Earl Dorchester you know like they
run all the different titles right as a
way to legitimize whatever their opinion
is yeah nowadays on college campus
somebody's like I'm a you know black
lesbian transgender before they even say
their opinion they gotta have a limp -
yeah a limp as a black lesbian
transgender male female like whatever
you want to say like before they get to
their opinion I'm like why do I care
about the prelude like is your argument
good or is it bad and we were talking
about this affair - when you get
attacked by an accusation of something
that you know you're not to me I just
kind of smile because it means I won the
argument
so when you saw that piece it was
political right yeah so when you saw
that piece as I said I saw the headline
I knew I didn't even have to read it and
I could already see a little bit
action picking up and and again as you
said earlier it's great when you have
people defending you yes because it
allows you to breathe it allows you to
move on we could spend all day long it
was a five tap so there's been it's
funny there's that like daily beast did
like a 5,000 word piece on me mm-hmm and
I talked to them and then Politico did a
5,000 word piece and I talked to them
what was the title or what did they
exactly say that you're the all rights
hero or something like that now again we
just laid out some of your liberal or
libertarian cred I have yet to hear you
I assume at some point you're gonna
burst that with some sort of racist yeah
it's like but I mean again it's
important to frame it that way yeah
because I see this I mean I've seen it
happen to me I've had several articles
written in the same I'm further um
further to the extreme right than
Breitbart I mean yeah just abject
dribble and that's why we lay out what
we say and then it's like they don't
people here don't care people don't
listen they don't care they already have
their preconceived notions and so I mean
my writers I'm talking about the writers
my editors yeah they came and they spent
you know like the guy came and he spent
the day with me I start every morning
people don't know at 4:00 a.m. I get up
really early cuz I've got an early
morning sports talk show that I do from
6 to 9 a.m. Eastern and then I do a show
also on periscope and Facebook live at 3
o'clock Eastern everyday and then I
write in between that time I do all this
I'm fortunate you know like I own 100
percent of my company like like you the
business side of things allows me to be
as outspoken as I am in a way frankly
that I wouldn't be if I was reliant upon
being an employee of a major media
company yeah do you find that you're
able to put these principles that you
talked about into practice for your
business too yeah cuz that's one of the
things that's very cool for me the
things that I believe in yes when I talk
about low taxes and yeah and treating
people right and all of those things
those are the ways that I operate my
business so it makes the views that I
talked about stronger action yes I don't
think there's anybody that I've ever
worked with who would come out and say a
negative word about me you know that's
like my wife says that I'm unique in
that people attacking me doesn't bother
me and it's almost like if you watch
football defensive backs get burned yeah
give up a touchdown pass the next drive
they're right back up on the line of
scrimmage talk line of scrimmage talking
trash and you have to have no memory to
play that position I don't like hole
grudge
is I do I just kind of let things go I'm
very like kind of karmic in that way and
I don't think you could do my job if you
set around and worry like my wife says
you can get ten things negative said
about you and you remember the positive
right I mean and and I do think there's
a little bit of truth to that but yeah
it's like I and I always said if people
who know me well I think I said that
backwards or we do this very differently
yes does she say that you can say ten
things negative and you remember the
positive or the other way around me it's
[Music]
I'm a first amendment absolutist I
believe in only two things completely
the First Amendment and boobs joining me
today is the host of out kick the
coverage on Fox Sports Radio and a man
who has never never been let down by
boobs Clay Travis welcome to the rubric
Laurie I'm happy yeah that's the best
introduction I've had in a long time
that is well that is your introduction I
knew there was only one way I could do
it and it was gonna have to be about
boobs you like boobs I do in the First
Amendment both in fact when I showed up
today at your place I had on my boobs
and First Amendment shirt that we sold a
lot of at the eye appearance on CNN and
I'd like to say that it was some grand
viral attempt to create a stir and it's
not like I'm a beyond or above that but
no I I've been saying that for years
writing it saying it's not years and st.
the men say it the women and I certainly
didn't think it was going to turn into
the viral sensation that it did yeah but
it did turn into viral yeah I saw you
were trending on Twitter that's like
basically the highest compliment you can
get these days the outrage over it so in
a second we're gonna show some of Brooke
Baldwin's reaction when you said it
truly did you did you have no sense that
anything was gay because I saw a lot of
you see what he did there you see he no
I said it on headline news the day
before
yeah to a female anchor I have said it
on my radio show probably a hundred
times I've written it in my columns yeah
it was it's such like it kind of a words
that I'm used to saying that I just went
to it because it's part of a natural
argument there and I once I saw like
remember when I'm doing that show and
you'll know this but I think a lot of
people listening and viewing will not
when you are I was doing that from my
home studio so I can stare like I'm
staring at you right now I can see how
you react to everything that I say but
in my home studio I have no monitor so I
don't even know who the other person is
that I'm talking with I can just hear
their voices and I can't see her facial
reactions at all but as soon as she
reacted I knew what she was doing I knew
there was somebody in her ear saying
like oh this is Trump's America you got
to go after this guy clay Travis he's a
misogynist he's a boar you know you've
got him you've got to put him in his
place
and so what I do for better or worse is
when people want me to like hit reverse
and back up and apologize
I put the you know pedal to the metal
and go forward full steam so I doubled
down I tripled down I may have even
quadrupled down so once that happened I
knew what she was trying to do yeah I
was her producer in her ear saying you
got to stand up on behalf of all women
or whatever you know some some clearly
artificial reaction on her part I think
yeah because it really kind of torpedoed
the entire segment
I mean professional from her yeah I will
the other guests then sort of bought in
on it too he attends and then I think
you or at least one of your fans
why on earth some of his old tweets
where he said so I mean the idea that
that liking boobs has become
misogynistic yes
shows you how bananas the whole debate
has gone well not only that I mean it's
not like women are surprised at men like
boobs right big business victorious
women Ellie exactly cosmetic surgery the
Victoria's Secret has revolutionized the
bra industry in the last 30 years like
golf clubs right new technology that
comes out so women understand that boobs
are attractive to men right so it's not
like it was somehow like this crazy
thing to say and then she was like I
can't believe you would say that to a
woman I'm like I would say it to a man I
for better or worse here in large
extreme and my wife would say this too I
talked the same to men and women and so
to me expecting that I would change the
way I'm gonna speak because a woman is
interviewing me I would talk to her that
if you were a woman right now I'd be
talking to you the same way that sexism
yo I try to treat everybody the exact
same what may not be great play drive is
an but he's equally an
to everybody if you want to criticize me
for that right you're so right that's
what I used to say about gay marriage
it's like you gotta let people be equal
so that you can treat them as shitty as
everybody else if they don't have to be
as miserable as miserable as my wife
yeah yeah they deserved that right they
absolutely do alright so real quick
we're gonna show just the 45 second or
so reaction from Brooke and we're not
gonna do an hour we can't do it out but
we're not gonna but let's just watch
that real quick and I just want to make
sure I'm hearing you correctly oo
because as a woman I'm I said boobs
I believe completely in the First
Amendment and in boobs those are the
only two things I believe 100% in in
this country and by the way Jamel has
did you notice that he went straight to
that yeah you're absolutely right I live
on national television and with a female
host I say all the time because it's
true and that's what I do because I like
boobs and the First Amendment which is
exactly what I said listen listen Brooke
I think that speaks for itself so the
fake outrage that's the interesting
thing to me and you already hit on this
a little bit but she most likely had
somebody in her ear saying you've got to
stand up for women and all that stuff
do you realize what was happening while
it was happening
again the challenges I don't see the
reaction yeah I knew you know when she
comes back to me and says it spells out
boobs
yeah like again I had the opportunity to
back up but at that point in time I
meant what I said it's not like I'm
gonna say oh I apologize let me throw
myself into the fetal position and beg
for the forgiveness of left and wing
America who's perpetually outraged yeah
and in fact I knew that I was in for a
battle and I I've said this before but I
kind of like being in the center of
media storms you know I feel like
there's a certain peace that comes over
you when you're in the middle of like
and in the arena literally fighting in
the moment yeah I want I reminds me when
I was a kid
Brer Rabbit you know there were a story
like don't throw me in the briar patch
yeah I love being in the briar patch or
you hear pigs like don't get in the mud
with the pig like he likes being in the
mud
I like wallowing around in the mud so I
knew as soon as she cut the interview
short that it was gonna be a viral
sensation right and I've been in enough
in these situations where people choose
sides automatically and they like Oh
clay Travis is awesome Oh Clay Travis
sucks Bravo for CNN CNN sucks I know how
you know sort of bipolar the reaction is
gonna be for lack of a better term and
so I immediately got on Twitter and
tweet it out ESPN just I mean sorry CNN
couldn't just cut my interview short
because I said I love the First
Amendment and boobs I don't remember
what the exact tweet I said was but I
sent that and then I immediately got on
the benefits of having all these media
apparatus ready I immediately got on
periscope and Facebook Alive and told my
side of the story and took it to the
next level and said oh by the way we're
gonna sell First Amendment in boobs
t-shirt
and we're gonna donate the proceeds to
breast cancer awareness which just
throws everybody into an uproar right
because and and and then I think I was a
head of the media storm and I knew the
media storm was gonna come and at that
point in time you can't check your phone
you can't even check Twitter it's just
an onslaught but what I did love was I
got a call from CNN asking me to come on
Monday right and so then I tweeted like
CNN's not outraged you know they want me
to come on Monday as well they left me a
voicemail so I played that voicemail the
next day CNN denies that they left me a
voicemail says that there's no truth to
it and then late that night I get a text
message saying hey this is not gonna
work but I will say this then I've told
this story maybe once or twice but my
wife is downstairs cuz I do everything
out of my out of my house and she and
right before then I've been saying okay
I've got to do this one more interview
it's been a busy week because that had
been a really busy week for us it was
Friday
and I was like we'll be done in the
afternoon we'll chill we'll go out we'll
take the boys out for pizza just have a
chill night yeah and and it's 2:30 in
the afternoon my time whatever it is I
do that hit and my wife just texts me
from downstairs never good when you get
texted by your wife even bother walking
upstairs do I need to put the house on
the market because my wife here my
wife's fear and I think there's probably
a lot of spouses who have lived through
this is that when you're in this middle
of this perpetual outrage machine at
some point the mob wins yeah right and
my argument is I'm gonna fight the mob
for the rest of my wife I like it I
enjoy it I think they're wrong and I'm
right
mm-hmm but I think her fear is at some
point they're gonna come for you and
they're gonna scalp you and they're
gonna win a fight yeah and she when she
saw that she was like this is gonna be
bad for you they're gonna tight cash to
you as a sexist they're gonna say you
hate women and my argument was I know
that's not true
and accusations are insults a levied
against me that I know aren't true if
you want to say I'm racist sexist
misogynistic whatever else and call me
whatever you want
to me I've called myself worse you know
and I probably get called worse by the
people that did I live with how did that
conversation go with your wife because
that's serious I mean that's very stuff
I get it I understand what that means
look she is prepared we watched and I
had a read to go back and read because
Howard Stern's an idol mine so you need
to read what his wife went through
imagine what what life was like for him
and
early 90s to me when you're trying to be
as honest as you possibly can people say
they want honesty but a lot of times
they don't really want they want the
fluff they want the aurait sysm is bad
Oh sexism is bad they don't want you to
actually dive into the nitty-gritty of
details and figure out what the facts
are of a situation and I've always said
that maybe this came to me in law school
I remember a criminal law professor I
had who said there are three things that
matter about every case the facts the
facts and the facts and for what we do I
always find that there's so few people
they don't actually look at the facts
the original documents of a story look
at the basis for what they're basing
their opinion on and in this world that
we live in now everybody's decided what
they believe and a story happens and
everybody just uses it as an excuse to
justify whatever they already believe
facts be damned and I feel like I'm in
the rarity you're in the rarity you sit
back and say okay let's actually look at
the details here and figure out what the
story is before we decide whether it
fits our worldview or not yeah and
what's interesting I think for guys like
us and I think that we are that these
ideas at least are becoming the silent
majority is that in our cases we both
are two-time Obama voters I was a
progressive Gore's presidential campaign
right so we've done that like it's not
you know because after this what it
would interested me so much wasn't just
wasn't just okay the boobs comment yeah
it is what it is you know what I mean
but it's it's the reaction after the
manufacturing of the of CNN the the PR
team inviting you on then Brooke saying
no he's banned forever but just this
machine versus the guy who was invited
on says a line that he always says but
then you you took the power back because
you're like I'll periscope the truth
I'll play the voicemail but then you
also have to deal with all the family
 and all that and it just it shows
you there's a certain David versus
Goliath thing that I just love about it
it's totally true and look when I also
went back if you watch that clip the
other guy who was on there claims that
he's offended by what I said has sent
all sorts of more ridiculous tweets and
my audience that's the other good that's
a beautiful thing that is - yeah the
people who support us love us yeah right
and and that is that is
very gratifying because when you're in
the war all the time when you're in the
battle every day it's good to know
there's some people who have your back
yeah and they may not be able to have
your back in the same public leg that
you or I can because this is what we do
for a living but there's so many people
out there working at companies that
serious jobs that were worried about
being out there in the arena fighting
because they got to protect their family
they got to make the mortgage payment
they got to do everything else but I
think it's it's gratifying to see them
saying hey we support you here but yeah
they went back I didn't do it they went
back and looked through all of his
tweets and started popping me with look
at what this guy said and then they go
back and find the same thing with Brooke
Baldwin Don lemons on there talking
about how great Kathy Griffin's Rack is
on with her he's coming on to show his
nipples on you know New Year's Eve she
doesn't react at all to that nipple net
Kathy Griffin says nipple like six or
seven times no hair like that's the
point I nobody came to me from a
journalistic perspective and I'm far
from a journalist in a grand scheme
right I have an opinion in but when you
have it the discussion going on to me
where she made the biggest error is and
it was great for me because it went
viral millions of people saw it we sold
you know lots of shirts we were asked a
lot of money for breast cancer awareness
it was all positive for me but to me
where she failed is she had an
opportunity to have a serious discussion
about a substantive issue and when you
react to a word which in no way needed
to be reacted to I was on to the next
argument right it was just part and
parcel of my larger argument she allowed
that segment to be derailed in a way
that it didn't need to be
but isn't that so consistent with
everything that this set of people is
doing these days like if she would have
just let it slide or even just it could
have been a three-second maybe that was
the wrong word kind of thing and then
moved on then if this wouldn't have all
happened but what happened after the
truth is clay Travis is bigger so as you
said here the fact remains this all
worked to your advantage because you
like being in the fight you know how to
do it and all that but what does that
tell you about just the general state of
media but also sort of what's happening
with the left that they they so go over
the top that they end up strengthening
all I mean this is what they're doing
with whatever the alt-right is or the
white promises these days are all that
it's like you keep building them yeah
because you you need them in a bizarre
way yeah
they need it and they also are devouring
it's like a snake eating its own tail
right the left devours itself it seems
to me is what is going on here but you
create all of these mountains of oh
there look there have always been racist
people like it I go back in time and say
it's amazing to me that in 2017 while
we're talking the stock market is at an
all-time high unemployment is at an
all-time low
the per-capita income of the average
household has never been higher on an
inflation-adjusted basis in the history
of our nation those are three really
magnificently big facts that should mean
that people in the country are pretty
happy this should be like the late
nineties right like the Bill Clinton was
in charge getting from interns
before like you know I wish he hadn't
gotten a from an intern but
stock markets rolling like it's kind of
good he hasn't taken us to war I didn't
mind the it was I was in GW at the time
at George Washington in an undergrad and
one of the guys that I knew this is a
it's really funny it was even funnier in
social media era but he had been hooking
up with Monica Lewinsky
so it's funny like he's think about the
president's election and who he's having
an affair with she's also sleeping
around that same time maybe not the
exact time but with a random college guy
right
at least JFK was having an affair with
Marilyn Monroe right probably
we're probably gonna find out a lot more
and then there's cuz they're gonna drop
the maybe it maybe that was the reason
he got assassinated but but like at
least he was like with the most famous
woman in the world at the time that's
kind of what you would want to resident
to have an affair with right Bill
Clinton's having an affair with a random
girl who's living in her mom's apartment
in in Watergate which maybe speaks to
Bill Clinton's ability to connect with
everybody who speaks to Hillary Clinton
all sorts of things that could hit yeah
but but to me this is actually a really
good time in the country and so I just
don't buy into this the world of fear
and I think there's so many people out
there that are wrapped up and
encapsulated by their fears every single
day right they're afraid that they're
gonna be that there is violence lurking
everywhere and I know murder is up in
the last couple of years and everything
else but I just think it's a pretty good
time to be in America today and of all
the times that I've been in the
tree-like this is the least racist this
is the least sexist right I mean things
are moving in the right direction and I
feel like the left wing is making it
such that people who might be natural
allies like you were I war no no on like
out there fighting for things
progressive ideals they're making me
take a step back and be like I don't
want to be on this person's side yeah
you know if you're not if you're banning
To Kill a Mockingbird because the n-word
is in it I don't want to be on your side
like that's not a battle that I want to
fight on your behalf and I feel like
they're alienating a lot of
middle-of-the-road people not just
conservatives but lots of
middle-of-the-road people I consider
myself to be a very middle-of-the-road
guy yeah and the left wing is totally
turned me off so I completely agree
obviously and I consider myself to be
pretty Center and right now I have every
week I have someone in here that I agree
with on some stuff and disagree with on
some other stuff I've literally never
sat across from someone that I agree
with whatever really right yeah we must
be the Aristotle and Plato of our time
yeah I guess so you you mentioned right
before we started your your wake up
because as we said you worked on the
gore campaign you voted for Obama twice
and all that so donate money to John

ladies and gentlemen
please join me in giving a rousing and i
mean a rousing
clemson welcome to our panelists
all right we will accept that as rousing
are you sure are you guys all right with
that for rousing i was a little worried
at first because when he said free
speech and we got like one clap over
there
you guys are kind of looking before free
speech we are this is a we're for it
right we're four
feet
i'm very excited to be here i was
wandering around campus all day long i
don't know if you guys are following me
on twitter uh i saw a squirrel
outside the library garbage can eating
an oreo
and
i walked around for another hour and
then he was eating another oreo when i
came back and i thought there's
something special happening here at
clemson
so i'm very excited there's squirrels
eating oreos we got these guys they know
their stuff where's morgan by the way
who i was tweeting with earlier where's
morgan morgan over there she normally
only wears sorority shirts and nike
shorts but she dressed up in regular
people clothes to be here that's pretty
good give her a round of applause
i also was gonna wear a sorority shirt
and shorts but
then they made me put this on uh i'm
very excited to talk to you guys we've
got about an hour and a half which i
know is gonna fly by uh the university
the administration was great too because
we're doing a free speech thing here and
they gave me a list of topics we're
allowed to talk about so
let's see what we can find oh by the way
i also i saw that outside there were a
couple nazis out there so thank you for
those you that punch them because you
got to be
punching nazis
just just a joke people there were no
nazis outside
i know twitter is a blaze right now oh
god you heard ruben the nazis showed up
all right
okay we're going to talk about free
speech and uh and we want this to be a
conversation so we're gonna do about 45
and then you guys will jump in with a q
a at the end of that so i think first
off to kick this thing off the fact that
we even have to do
talks about free speech these days seems
sort of tragically ironic or hilarious
or depressing depending on which way you
want to look at it that anything that
we're going to say up here
i'm pretty sure you're not going to hear
anything racist and you're not going to
hear anything homophobic or
i mean i'm gay married
i'm not even gay i just did it to prove
a point
and
what you are going to hear is people
expressing their views and that is
simply the most important thing that you
can do as a college student that you
guys get to not only learn uh from great
people one of them sitting right there
and i've had them on my show but you
you get to express what you think and
learn how to think and these two
gentlemen are quite good at uh
explaining how they think so first uh
jordan i'll start with you um the fact
that we even have to do this that that
we can't do a talk perhaps on uh on maps
of meaning although that's going to be
sort of part of uh what you talk about
that we have to talk about free speech
in and of itself does that sort of show
you what a precarious position it's in
well i think what it shows me is
just exactly
how powerful ideas are you know
and people have the misbegotten notion
that
the strange things that are happening in
our societies in canada and north
america and in the western world in
general are somehow
academic issues that only affect people
in colleges and universities and nothing
could be farther from the truth than
that
you know it's just that the wars between
different sets of ideas manifest
themselves first in the colleges and the
universities before they
went their way out into the general
public and this is a war of ideas at an
extraordinarily deep level it's it's not
political
it's not philosophical even i think it's
really at the level of religious
thought which is one level below one say
one it's the substructure of
philosophical thought in some sense and
it has to do with the
place
that is deemed appropriate for the
individual versus the group in
in the world in being itself
and
the post-modern claim post-modern
neo-marxist claim let's say because
there's an unholy alliance between those
two branches of
pathological thought in my estimation
their conclusion is is that the
individual is first of all nothing but a
concatenation of
cultural and biological forces with with
heavy emphasis on the cultural no real
capacity for free will no separate
identity from the group identity and uh
and therefore really of little value or
merit or significance and to me that's
anathema i think i've pronounced that
right i've probably only read it but um
because the west is founded on the
principle that the individual is
sovereign and that is not a trivial idea
it means that
we've recognized and and much death went
into this realization that's the thing
that's important to understand
we've realized that
states that are not in the final
analysis subordinate to the
to the
spiritual and intellectual supremacy of
the free individual are doomed to
dissolution or tyranny
and i think that
it is it's very difficult to make a
stronger
moral and philosophical claim than that
one now it's a frightening claim because
it means that each individual
is of value and also
that what the individual does matters
and that's actually quite a terrifying
proposition because it means that your
moral errors actually have some
ontological weight i would say they
actually affect the structure of reality
itself in a profound manner and to
contemplate that deeply especially
in the light of the horrors say that
individual actions allowed or
contributed to in the 20th century is a
very terrifying proposition so this is
no
lightweight
this is no realm of lightweight
consideration but make no mistake about
it we're in one vicious
war about the structure of reality and i
hope that
the classic virtues and values
are are able to organize themselves and
articulate themselves so that young
people can understand what they are and
so that this thing can turn out properly
so
yeah well i think talking about this in
the frame of a war is sort of an
interesting way because
it seems to me we chatted with about 30
students earlier today and what
everything seemed to be coming back to
is about learning how to think so that
you don't have to silence your opponents
and it seems that this is the place
right this is the place where you guys
are right now this is the place where
you're supposed to learn how to think so
that if someone says something that is
counter to what you believe that you now
can think your way out of it show them
what the truth is
what has happened to that the ability to
to know what you think and and own your
own mind
yeah i mean i think that goes to the the
initial question you were asking of
isn't aren't we in a weird circumstance
now that no one is really on the side or
very few people on the side of free
speech
but if you go jordan brought up which i
think is really important ideas are
powerful so if you look historically
authorities have tried to control ideas
because they're so powerful most
societies have never had freedom of
speech and even when you look in the
west i mean the first
the comprehensive philosopher plato has
a system in which you don't have freedom
of speech and it's because he doesn't
think most people can reason they're not
autonomous in that kind of way so he has
a philosopher kings who were at the top
they can think they can reason so they
have full freedom but the people
underneath don't and it was a radical
idea that came as a result of the
enlightenment i think of that no the
individual each individual has within
them the power to control their own mind
to direct their own thinking um and to
reach knowledge so just as it was a
radical idea in the way the american
founders framed it of the pursuit of
happiness there's also the issue of the
pursuit of truth
and that each individual is capable of
doing that he might default he might not
really be pursuing but he's capable of
doing that but the only way that he can
do that is if he's free and that means
no authorities hemming him in and
telling him you can't look at that you
can't hear this person you can't
investigate this in the way they try to
hem in galileo and say no you cannot do
this you're under house arrest no more
investigation you have to be free to do
that but you have to have to really
value free speech you have to have this
view of yourself that i'm capable of
doing this i'm worthy of doing this and
i demand my freedom
and i'm not going to submit to any
authority telling me what to do and even
like if you put an albert einstein like
plato's idea of a philosopher king at
the top of government i would not submit
to him telling me well don't look at
holocaust deniers because it's all
irrational i think it is all irrational
but i need to make up that opinion or
belief for myself if i want to look and
read some holocaust deniers i want i
have to be free to do that to look at
and say oh no this is all garbage it's
all rational i won't look so it comes
from a real the value of free speech
comes from a conception of yourself as a
pursuer of truth and i think the
post-modernist who i call the
anti-enlightenment crowd are driving
into people that you're not capable of
that and you won't value free speech if
you really think you're not capable of
yeah so really knowing what you think
and why you think it is is really the
key to this whole operation uh it's
interesting you brought up holocaust
deniers we we did an event a couple
months back at university of arizona and
i looked in the crowd and i saw a
diverse the diversity that the left
loves i saw diversity of color
and sexuality and all that stuff and i
said that's not really the diversity
that i care about i care about diversity
of thought i said well for example how
many nazis are here and actually someone
in the back raised their hand and uh
said that they were a nazi
and and then they started going on about
holocaust and i said you know what hang
tight we'll honor some free speech when
we get to the q a we'll give you the
first question so then i we got to the q
a and i threw it to her and she uh was
going on and on about auschwitz whatever
i had michael shermer was there who i'm
sure many of you guys know from skeptic
magazine and he debunks a lot of this
stuff and he clearly explained to her
why she was wrong now of course
she doesn't come around no one's going
to come around but i thought it was a
great example of what free speech is
that we let her share her ideas everyone
in the audience kind of looked at her
like this is nutty and
we we honored free speech an interesting
little caveat to this as i mentioned to
you guys earlier she was trans which is
kind of how often do you meet a trans
holocaust denier that was
that was pretty good you know that was
something hitler loved those trans
people didn't he
um
so we yeah i wanted to pick up on
something
on that ankar said um
you know
there's this idea that
the reason that
we need the right to free speech is
because let's say of the nobility of the
human spirit and there's an element
that about that that's true but there's
a more important and more
practical reason that has more to do
with the stupidity and the ignorance of
the human spirit and
and so i'm going to kind of come at this
from two places i mean carl jung the
psycho analyst said that uh the fool was
the precursor to the savior from a
mythological perspective and
you can see an echo of that in the idea
that comedians tell the truth right and
that the the jester in the king's court
is the only one because he's beneath
contempt he's the only one that can
actually say what's true and so that's
the sort of thing that jung meant
but
it's also the case that
the reason the fool is the precursor to
the savior is because when you first
start to think
you
have to express yourself badly and as if
you're ignorant because you don't know
how to talk or think and you are
ignorant and so what that means is that
if you're not allowed to do
to think badly
and and then you can't think at all you
can never learn to think at all
and so that's part of why the
restrictions on free speech are so
indefensible because everyone starts out
foolish and ignorant
and so
and
the
part of the enlightenment idea and and i
would say even more deeply rooted ideas
before that that had been developing for
centuries is that
people are at least capable of in moving
towards enlightenment even though
they're not there and they never will be
there it's possible to stumble forward
towards enlightenment and and you can't
also do that just by thinking by
yourself because you're just not smart
enough to think by yourself and so free
speech isn't merely the right to
criticize those in power and it's often
it's often viewed that way and it's not
also only the right to say what you
think it is actually the right to think
because even what we're doing right now
[Music]
obviously we've spent a pretty good
amount of time around here talking about
the assault on free speech on college
campuses as I've said before I believe
that this assault on free speech is one
of the biggest problems we face today as
we are breeding a generation of young
people who won't be equipped to use
logic and reason in their own arguments
when they graduate to the real world the
university's misguided use of safe
spaces and trigger warnings coupled with
violent protests and D platforming or
shouting down speakers is actually
robbing many of these students of
literally the most important thing that
they can learn in college the ability to
think for themselves instead of
graduating as fully equipped adults
ready to fight for what they believe in
because they know what they believe in
they are being coddled like children who
might crumble at the mere hearing of an
idea that challenges them this inability
to debate ideas is leaking out of the
universities and into society at large
celebrities spent all day on Twitter
ranting and raving about topics that
they don't understand at all
comedians some of whom I know personally
and really liked have become the
screeching lunatics that they're
supposed to be making fun of politicians
talk a lot but don't actually do a lot
and the rest of us are left here trying
to make some sense of what's going on a
great example of this is the title 9
Fiasco which took root on college
campuses over the past few years title 9
is part of the Education Act of 1972
which states that no person in the
United States shall on the basis of sex
be excluded from participation in be
denied the benefits of or be subjected
to discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance well that sounds
pretty good right what we should be
going for here is an even playing field
of equal opportunity title 9 doesn't
guarantee equal outcome which is where
hard work perseverance and sometimes
luck come into play but it does
guarantee that whether you are a man or
a woman you won't be discriminated on
because of your sex this straightforward
law of equal opportunity changed under
the Obama administration which in 2011
and 2014
issued new guidelines on how schools
should deal with cases of sexual assault
on campus while I believe that Obama's
intentions were good the law in effect
circumvented our system of due process
the Obama administration's policy used
the preponderance of evidence standard
in cases of sexual assault
not the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
standard which reduces the burden of
proof on anyone accused of sexual
assault this was a subtle but powerful
change in how we litigate these cases of
sexual assault on campus and some would
argue an outright violation of the
accused constitutional rights that seem
to boss
Trump's education secretary recently
rescinded these obama mandates and
judging by the celebrity and comedian
critics out there Trump and DeVos were
not only anti-woman
but suddenly pro rape as well my friend
and former guest christina hoff sommers
wrote an excellent piece in the journal
of higher education explaining why
removing the obama guidelines was
actually a win for due process and the
constitution an article i shared with
some of the famous people I saw ranting
about Trump's pro rape policy of course
nobody responded will link to
Christina's article below so that you
can read that for yourself to unpack
title 9 I'll be talking to author and
professor Laura Kipnis today as we
discuss her own story of how title 9 has
affected her both personally and
professionally laura has been right in
the middle of the title 9 firestorm and
our friends at learn Liberty have sent
her our way this week knowing what
you're talking about is a lot harder
than just screaming about how you feel
about something but a good education
taught me that it's usually worth the
effort
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty this week and joining me
is author of unwanted advances sexual
paranoia comes to campus as well as a
professor in the Department of radio
television and film at Northwestern
University
Laura Kipnis welcome to the Rubin report
thank you hi hi I have had a roughly if
I had to add it all up a gajillion
requests to have you on okay so I feel
like we're gonna clean up a lot of stuff
here related let's try yeah related to
title 9 I did my little direct message
my preamble sort of giving a vague
explanation of title 9 mm-hm you sort of
got in the mix on this thing when you
wrote a piece in The Chronicles of
Higher Education in 2015 which I want to
get to that and your whole story related
to all of that but first I thought could
you just give me a basic explanation of
what title 9 is and then how it changed
during the Obama administration okay I
should start out and say that it was
never my goal in life to become an
expert on title 9 but as you might have
said in the intro I was brought up on
title 9 complaints and at the time I had
no idea what this was you know I thought
it had something to do with women's
sports so the brief backstory is that in
2011 the Department of Education under
Obama expanded title 9 which had covered
gender equity in higher education
meaning like equal funding for sports
teams and that sort of thing and they
expanded it to include sexual misconduct
because the idea was that you can't have
gender equity if students particularly
women's students are you know fearful
for their safety or are being assaulted
you know or harassed or that kind of
thing so you know it's a it's it's a
good goal but they issued these things
called Dear Colleague letters that were
guidance to institutions of higher
learning that got federal funding and
threatened that if the schools didn't
comply with these very vague guidelines
that their federal funding could be
withdrawn and you know most schools get
you know tons of their funding from the
government in research grants and that
kind of thing so all campuses were
required
offices and officers and implement these
this guidance and it had to do creating
processes for sexual misconduct
complaints but also dictated things like
the standard of proof that would have to
be used in these adjudications and the
standard was what's called preponderance
of evidence and that's a hugely
controversial thing because it basically
means is 50/50 plus a feather and the
process also has been I mean as I
learned having gone through it behind
closed doors so none of this is out in
the open or transparent and so you have
more and more people getting caught up
in in these sort of kangaroo court
situations both undergrads mostly male
students who get accused of having
non-consensual sex usually in drunken
you know sexual encounters that somebody
later decides was not consensual but
also professors increasingly so what
happened was after I got brought up on
these complaints I wrote a second
article and I got brought up for writing
an essay about you know the kind of
increasing vulnerability of students and
it was called sexual paranoid comes to a
khadeem yeah I think I think maybe we
should pause there because you get me
all out there so let's just whittle away
some of that right so first of all I
think a certain amount of people would
would be listening to this and thinking
wait a minute how can a university lower
the expectation of what evidences to
prove someone guilty of something if
it's supposed to be you're innocent
until proven guilty how can how can an
university have a expectation that's
lower than that how does that even how
does that even make sense I mean what's
the actual rationale there
well the rationale is that they're
following this federal guidance but you
know what happened what the federal
guidance seems to be in conflict with
the Constitution well so one of the
things I learned is you don't actually
have constitutional rights at a private
university so there's how this stuff is
handled differs between public
institutions and private schools and
private schools can do what they want so
they're in a more contractual relation
with students and you know a lot of the
information on this is
only coming out because these cases are
going to civil court
so like students who've been accused and
think they've been railroaded are suing
the schools and that's how we learn
what's going on otherwise nobody would
know
so in effect these these edicts come
through from the administration it's on
you know now the the burden of evidence
is suddenly on the accused in a bizarre
way and it really never bubbled up until
some of the men in this case started
taking civil action because they were
either falsely accused or they felt that
they were falsely accused her wanted to
fight yeah or there are no standards of
evidence and so that was the kind of
thing I learned from going through the
process so I was accused of say creating
a hostile environment and I said to the
title 9 investigators what how do you
know I mean it's a or I was creating a
chilling effect on the student body and
I should we should explain that those so
your your 2015 article let's just
explain what that was and how it got you
a diet water before every ok jumping for
it I wrote an article called sexual
paranoia strikes a khadeem for the
Chronicle of Higher Education because
they asked me to write something about
campus sexual politics because I was
known I guess have been known as
something of maybe a contrarian feminist
and I'm written about social politics a
lot so I said ok and I kind of thought
nobody read the Chronicle of Higher
Education you know and so I've wrote in
a kind of ironic maybe um you know I had
some fun with it
and I do lean toward irony and so first
there was a protest march on campus by
students carrying mattresses and pillows
you know like a reference to the
Columbia student accusing me of
fostering or supporting rape culture I
guess and then I was found out I was
brought up on these title 9 components
but so I never found out precisely what
I was charged with because there isn't
such a thing as due process in these
situations right so to be clear you
write this piece and as you're saying it
was kind of tongue-in-cheek but with the
expertise that you have be serious but
with an ironic tone I would say yeah
yeah so you write this piece and then
your bra
on these charges but what does you
writing this piece have to do with
anything how does that yeah become
within the jurisdiction of title 9 well
it should not have been and so it is a
question mark why the university allowed
the case to go forward because there is
some sort of provision in the New York
Holly letter that says nothing here
should be construed to impinge on
freedom of speech or academic freedom
but nevertheless I mean what does happen
what's happened is what you would call
mission creep in these situations where
the code has been stretched to include
such things as writing an essay and as I
later found out I mean all sorts of kind
of micro behaviors that somebody might
take offense at so in my case I had
written a couple of paragraphs about a
another professor on the campus so I
didn't know but it was public
information that he'd been accused of
sexual misconduct so I made reference to
that case so I was accused of
retaliating which is a big thing in
title 9 you cannot mostly people cannot
speak about the charges against them
because if they speak about them they
might be brought up on more complaints
for retaliating so I was charged with
retaliation even though I wasn't the
person who'd been involved in the sexual
misconduct do it right and to be clear
so the person that was accused of this
who was a colleague of yours although
you didn't know did not know him he was
accused of of having relations with a
student but consensual if I'm not
mistaken there were two there were two
sets of complaints and one was that he'd
gone out drinking with a student one
night and they ended up sleeping in this
same bed but they didn't have sex there
was no indication that they had sex but
he was accused of possibly having come
onto her he bought her drinks and then
there was a second situation which I
actually did not write about where he'd
had a relationship with a student so I
wrote about seven or eight words about
that second relationship and that was I
think the basis of the complaints that
I'd made reference to this situation
that that in effect they felt you were
defending him
correct I suppose so you know I can't
say what anybody
thought or felt really right I guess I
guess I can but I think I think we can
surmise that that's what they thought
yeah that you really but your feelings
on on that specific matter outside of
title nine really is that these are if
they're consenting adults whether he's a
professor and she's a student that
you're okay with that basically right um
I in the first essay I was somewhat
mocking these new regulations that
govern professor student dating the
prohibited at particularly in the case
of undergrads it was sort of okay if
you're a grad student
but frowned on and when I was one of the
things I was saying was that you know
you can look around any campus on the
country who can barely throw a stone
without hitting a couple a married
couple often with children that started
out as a professor student situation and
it's widely known in academia that you
know some percentage of your colleagues
are married to former students so it
seemed a bit hypocritical to suddenly
enact these codes that would regard
those situations as like close to some
sort of credit predators I you know I
felt that the professorial was almost
being regarded as as predators and
wigging and that you know dating was was
was ruled out and you know I don't want
to sound like some old geezer and but
when I went to school back in the good
old days
you know I we did all sorts of stuff we
partied and drank with professors it was
no big deal
people were sleeping with professor's
all over the place so the this new
climate of regulation was something I
wanted to write about from a somewhat
skeptical vantage point so so when your
mind it really was about the regulation
that they were putting on not you
weren't specifically defending or not
defending the actions of this guy which
i think is sort of where it got turned a
little bit yes yeah so I think that's
interesting I mean I the version of
feminism that I would subscribe to would
see these this climate of regulation is
not in the spirit of feminism and I
think I've used the term feminist
paternalism but I will say what happened
was that or maybe we'll get to this I
mean I ended up learning more about the
situation with this professor and right
more about it in this book so there's a
couple of chapters about these two cases
against the professor where I'd do a
close reading of the title nine reports
which I ended up having access to and so
that was very informative all right so
we will get to that for sure I think
that'll that'll sort of bring this all
together okay
but okay so now you're brought up on
these charges mm-hmm what was that like
for you I mean literally you you're
you're a professor and an author and
wrote an article yeah yeah you're using
words and now you're brought up on
charges from the government yeah well
for my institution and but you know it's
right from yours yeah I mean I was very
much in the dark you know I knew nothing
about title nine and they send you like
a letter with all these links to various
and you know informational websites and
every website has more links and more
links and you know it's like a rabbit
hole of hyperlinks that you learn
nothing from like I did not learn how I
could be charged with retaliation for
writing about someone else's situation
so it's very mystifying the the
procedures and what I've learned in
these cases when you're accused of
something for the most part you don't
find out what you're accused of you
don't know what the evidence is you
often don't know who the accusers are in
my case so I the the University hired a
team of outside investigators lawyers
from another city who flew in to conduct
an investigation they would not give me
the charges in writing we I did finally
learn who the accusers were we had a
Skype session prior to me meeting with
them but so some of the procedures are
very baffling like why won't they give
you the complaints in writing how could
that possibly be legal I mean I get the
sort of kangaroo court portion of this
and how this is all done outside of our
legal system makes to me it makes no
sense whatsoever yeah but when you're
talking to these people and then there's
lawyers coming in from out of state most
what are they talking to you about if
they are not telling you what you're
charged they ask a lot of fishing
expeditions sort of questions and as I
later talk to more people who've been
through these procedures that's the mo
is the fishing expedition question and
then things that you say particularly if
you're a male professor charged with
kind of potential misconduct anything
you say can lead to another avenue of
Investigation and so people enter these
situations they don't know what their
rights are you know so like when the
investigators said to me that I could
not record the session you don't know
where these edicts are coming from you
just know somebody who seems to be an
authority is is telling you what you can
and can't do as I say you don't know
what your rights are and you don't know
what the consequences will be if you
don't go along with it and it is the
when this is happening is the entire
administration just falling into line I
mean is there anyone at the
administration that was like you know
Laura something seems wrong here or you
need a lawyer or we should have someone
defending you or sitting with you or
you're not selling you or anything yeah
no you're not alone I think every school
makes their own procedures up in my case
you are not allowed to have a lawyer in
the session with you when I met with the
investigators I could not have a lawyer
there I did consult with a lawyer on the
phone before this but I didn't want to
spend a lot of money on this you know
how it's a bit of a cheapskate but you
know I'm if you had all the money in the
world it would still be absurd
professors are spending tens of
thousands of dollars when you know
accused of something like having
improper eye contact I mean some of the
charges are so out there but I've talked
to people who have I mean just spent
vast amounts of money consulting with
lawyers but because of course now
there's a huge industry legal industry
[Music]
so I suspect that you've found some
strange allies in this space because
here I am I don't know if I qualify the
strange ally may may be possible but but
basically you're you're a lefty right
you're you can consider yourself
progressive or if you had to describe
your your political views I called
myself throughout the book of leftist
feminists I mean I wanted to make it
clear that you know I wanted to make
that clear yeah yeah I have not shifted
right okay so well first off what is a
leftist feminist mean to you I guess
let's define that middle yeah I mean I
one point I suppose in in my career
would have called myself a Marxist
feminist so I mean it means for me you
know I believe in redistribution and I
believe in a sort of feminism I mean I
guess I was steeped on what would have
been called Marxist feminism or
materialist feminism that took and also
but that had a kind of emancipatory
direction I mean and I'm also somebody
very interested in psychoanalysis so I
use the psychoanalysis a lot so I mean
it's a bit of a motley collection of
influences but I left I mean I mean that
I think the economic level is um
something that I want to factor in
issues about class I got I wrote a book
about pornography a long time ago that I
got interested in the subjects had
written about hustler magazine and that
my point was that the feminist
anti-pornography movement had not taken
class into consideration at all and that
hustler was not just about gender it was
also about class and a sort of attack on
elites so I'm kind of trying to factor
those levels into the sort of you know
thinking that I do yeah so I'm curious
so as a leftist feminist then
potentially or a formerly Marxist
feminist I haven't heard that one before
but all right there we go
do you find that your allies right now
are coming from quarters that don't
quite make sense to you yes the the
situation I mean I should just say the
situation on campus makes no sense in
terms of who what groups think of
themselves as on the left and I'm sort
of
yes about whether a lot of the activism
is what I would call left-wing even
though you know the right loves to
hammer the the left-leaning students but
I mean the student student activists are
more and more acting like authoritarians
and you weirdly have the conservatives
and libertarians acting like liberals
and you know promoting free speech and
and that sort of thing so this is this
is now you're telling me my life story
yeah yeah well that's because it's my
life story too in trying to myself makes
sense of this political moment and yes
finding myself getting a lot of invites
from places like you know various
libertarian and conservative leaning
foundations that I do you know would not
really have had much to say to
previously
yeah how does that feel for you you know
like when you're getting invited to
these things that previously you either
would have had major political
disagreements I mean I'm guessing
especially if they're libertarian groups
they're never telling you what you can
say or anything like that not yet you
probably wouldn't go to a place yeah
that would anyway but that you have
these new allies must be kind of weird
for you I mean I know what this feeling
is that's why I'm curious yeah it is and
I mean so there's an area that we
overlap we're in agreement about but you
know I think it is more the economic
issues I mean like I did an interview
with Reason magazine they go ups go SB
who you know it's really smart
interesting guy knows a lot of social
theory but you know I suppose if we
started talking about more economic
issues you know I'm not somebody who
wants to let the poor people starve you
know so we're I think that's probably
where I depart you know yes we agree on
free speech we're probably less in
agreement about you know regulation that
sort of thing I don't know that they
want to let the poor people start but
they just don't want us or the
government involved that but that's a
that's a whole other topic but I just
think it's interesting because as
someone with those beliefs which I fully
respect I think you're finding the
allies that I've found lately is anyone
on the Left defending you I mean is
there has been that has there been any
outreach of leftist professors or
anything on the
I think there's some well that should be
your intellectual allies right the
people that agree with you on everything
that you write about yeah I'm at a teach
about are they offering you any shelter
yeah that's I guess well I get a lot of
supportive email from people saying I
would be afraid to say what you're
saying in public so I know that there's
like an underground layer of support and
I mean I think that it's generational
some of the sort of older generation of
leftists somebody like Todd Gitlin who
was you know an SDS person he teaches at
Columbia is written also about the free
speech issues on on campus so there's
certain people out there but it's no
it's been a little I'm not gonna say
lonely but I I feel someone on my own in
trying to make sense of this situation
and you know doing a better job of it do
you think it's possible that you're what
should be your allies especially in the
public space I was mentioning to you
before in the green room that I see all
these celebrities and comedians that
when DeVos did this stuff and rescinded
these Obama era editions that basically
they were all tweeting about how divorce
and Trump or Pro rape and they hate
women and all these these are these are
leftists who you probably agree with on
all on all the economic stuff all the
social stuff all of that stuff but
they're doing you actually an incredible
disservice is what I would say and I
looped you in on one tweet when Chelsea
Handler tweeted something about this and
I said I'd love to have you on come on
with Lauren that's no I would shoot
myself right but think about that I mean
that's that's actually kind of
fascinating I would guess that if you
and Chelsea sat down about most
political issues you would agree on most
things but then should they tweet these
kind of crazy over-the-top things and
then they're actually undercutting what
their academic allies should be doing I
think it's a really fascinating little
piece of this I have a sort of allergy
to self-righteousness and you know I
mentioned having written about hustler
magazine and I suppose it's what drew me
to somebody like Larry Flynt is an
interesting figure you know I was kind
of interested to sort of weave through
the over-the-top outrageous stuff he
said and to try to make sense of some of
the politics behind
what he was saying and this sort of
instant position taking that people like
that are engaged in I mean you're
talking about Chelsea Handler you know I
I'm not somebody who ever really wanted
to be a pundit I wanted to sit and think
about some of these issues and think
about the contradictions and the
complications and that's what I've tried
to do in in my writing and I think
there's well this may be sound sound the
self congratulatory I think there's too
little of that and it may have something
to do with Twitter and you know the you
know sort of instantaneous opinion
forming that is required of people who
are in Twitter but I don't think it's
interesting and so I guess I'm kind of
veered toward the people who are saying
things that complicate the situation as
opposed to simplify it yeah well that's
why we're here doing this so that we can
get some of that across yeah all right
let's talk a little bit about your book
what's the exact quote that you have on
the front of the book I have it here
somewhere but it's pretty perfect about
feminism if this feminism hijacked by
melodrama yeah this is feminism is
feminism hijacked by men that did not
yeah yeah that's good that you know that
that was that was a very on the spot
question but you are correct so what
what is happening to feminism there
there I see from my audience and just
from so many people that I respect in
the public space right now just an
abject rejection of modern feminism
these are not people who dislike women
these are people who want equality of
opportunity these are people who date
and sometimes are women in the first
place so I don't think it's about hating
women in any way but that modern
feminism has just been morphed into
something sort of crazy how's that for
an opening it's a broad question okay
that's what that wasn't a fun it's a bit
hard to answer that you know here's
where my Freudian side kicks in I mean I
I feel that in the current situation or
in relation to these questions about
sexual assault or what's going on in
campus in terms of sexual politics I do
feel that there's been too little self
scrutiny on the part of women who regard
themselves as feminists as opposed to
the scrutiny of like male sexuality male
aggressivity and it was one of the
things and this is probably one of the
more controversial sections so the book
where I tried to write about how much
drunken sex binge drinking you know
could condition sex there is on campus
and how much you know women are
reluctant to analyze their own
participation in these situations or our
own conflicts about sexuality so you
know that's something where again I was
kind of trying to complicate the
situation as opposed to just say men are
predators you know male sexuality is
aggressive and bad and women are these
sort of violated innocence so I feel
like there's just too little I may be
not saying this incredibly well but you
know I think like too little
introspection about our own sexual sort
of participation right so even though to
write about that or talk about that I
know that there's gonna be a certain
amount of people will say well you're
victim-blaming yeah that they're already
going to put the onus on you even though
you're just you're really talking about
personal accountability to some degree
yeah I mean you know somebody's using
force against you that's not a situation
where one needs to talk about personal
accountability but in terms of drinking
and the kind of complicities that arise
in in those situations and the ways that
I think you know I'm a teacher and I
think universities should be in the
business of educating students and
helping them figure out how to be more
autonomous how to be more self examining
as opposed to this layer of regulation
that you know it has taken the place of
education so that's what I'd like to see
more of you know and I think
self-examination honest discussions
about what happens in these sexual
situations and alcohol-fueled situations
so you know I'm kind of pragmatic about
it yeah I mean speaking of pragmatics
how much do you think just social media
in general
has affected this whole conversation
because I would imagine that a lot of
times some of these cases are brought up
because the next day when when they wake
up hungover and everything they suddenly
realize there's five pictures of them
doing crazy things you know I mean
drinking and a funnel in their mouth and
taking bonnets or whatever they're doing
and I think back to my college days I
mean I did pretty much everything you
could think of the idea that now
everyone's walking around with cameras
doing all these things it just it's
almost like they're creating like a
hostage situation but they're the guards
and the hostages at the same time yeah I
think that's really true and it's
something I spent a long time and about
a year trying to have conversations with
my own students about this issue of
sexual assault and what was really
happening and I found out a lot of
distressing things I mean particularly
distressing if you've been a feminist
for quite some time and think by this
point in the evolution of human history
women should not have such a hard time
saying no or knowing what they want in
these in these situations and you know I
found out I think that a lot of the
drinking has to do with particularly on
the part of women not really knowing
what they want and so drinking
themselves a lot also is not to actually
have to decide in situations you know
yes or no do you think that's more
uniquely a female trading I it may be
you know I had an interesting
conversation with Susie bright the sex
activist who said that she works with
college students a lot who many most of
whom have never had sex sober and are
appalled at the thought that she would
even try to do that but well it's a
ridiculous thing to do sober I think it
would actually seem but what I was going
to say about the social media part so I
I in talking with students and I had a
conversation with a class one of my
classes once were and I repeat this in
the book where somebody said something
like I would they were they were
moralizing about a movie that I'd shown
and about the sexual choices one of the
characters had made and they're
moralizing you know just seemed I wanted
to sort of puncture it a bit so I said
something like you know when I was in
school we all thought about
we talked about liberation and you know
sex is pleasurable you guys seem to
think about sex is just simply a harm
and a potentially destructive thing and
I feel kind of sorry for you and one of
the students said well yeah sex can kill
you so I started thinking that well this
was this generation that was the first
post AIDS post HIV generation they've
all had this you know god-awful forms of
sex education where the destructive
harmful sides of sex have been
emphasized to them but I talked to the
student who said this he'd graduated we
had an email conversation and what he
said was what I meant was social death
that social media like everybody knows
what you did the night before and you
can be sort of killed publicly because
of these these choices that you've made
so I do think there's something about
them feeling like they're in a kind of
fish ball that that does change the the
tenor or the sense of the experience of
it and and I think this you know the
after the regrets in of the aftermath or
the feeling that you know many months
later will wait I didn't actually
consent to that I think social media
does have something to do with the the
way these the ways these situations are
construed later as harmful we're in the
you know president in a moment that they
happened you know it was just a sense of
confusion yeah so that's really
interesting so basically it's a
compounding of really poor sex education
in general or or just attaching a
certain amount of fear which may at one
time have been justified and then you
add the social media now you really got
like this this toxic mess there yeah and
the other thing is that I think there
are just a lot of messages on campus
aimed at women I mean everywhere you go
the conversation is about assault so I
think there's an I mean almost a kind of
encouragement to frame experiences as
having been assaulted or non-consensual
after the fact yeah so that all seems
very consistent with something that I
see on the left lately that we've talked
a lot about here that
left at least right now seems to really
value victimhood they think that
victimhood is virtue so it sort of makes
sense you you can't talk about sexuality
in a way that's empowering you have to
talk about it in a way that creates a
victim situation for you because then
you have sort of authority to talk about
it do you think that that's a fair I
would step back from that a little bit
and say that you know I I think the
attention to social justice on campus is
a valuable thing so I you know I do want
to say there have been people I mean
there's you know who are more
marginalized who are victimized whose
identities have been I have subjected
them to various forms of violence so the
UM I dislike the language of
victimization you know getting as broad
as that at the same time there is a way
that those positions them you know and
it comes under the rubric of identity
politics let's say you know that the
identities that have been have been
marginalized I mean do you attract a lot
of attention but you know both in the
curriculum and not in the curriculum to
some degree to rectify you know those
sort of you know errors of history in
the past but you know so that does play
into all of these things sort of I think
converge around this notion of sexual
victimization at the moment including
you know then this this layer that comes
down from the did come down from the
federal government in the form of title
nine yeah so how do you unfurl all that
I mean how do you as a feminist take the
power back now do you see a movement
growing on there I haven't really seen
it I I hope it's there well I do hope
that you know if this doesn't sound
grandiose at the book that I wrote it
will have some effect and you know what
I was able to do was um I got access to
two title nine reports about this
professor and I mean I was in receipt of
a lot of other actual title nine reports
from people who sent me both professors
and students who sent me the the
documents from their cases so I went
through
using all the critical skills that I've
developed in my many years as a leftist
feminist and you know you know kind of
close analysis of the sort of decisions
that the title nine officers were making
in this case and I talked about how
capricious the the judgments were how
gender biased
you know how steeped in stereotypes
about male and female sexuality they
were so you know that's something that
there hasn't been an opportunity to do
to look at how these judgments are being
made and and and to contest them because
as you know I've said all of this has
happened in in behind closed doors
there's been no oversight no daylight no
transparency so I think more
transparency on the this process and I
also think transparency or discussion
about sex on campus and particularly
heterosexual relations generally that
needs to happen yeah but basically
you're saying if you were a young
professor these days you probably
wouldn't want to teach in the California
system knowing that they're gonna keep a
lot of this stuff in place yeah you'd
rather go somewhere else where you're
not gonna have to just deal with it
pretty in effect you know I don't think
people have all the opportunities in the
world it's not like you can vote with
your feet you know when you're in a bad
job market which you know at academia
now is quite a bad job market I don't
think it's something people generally do
I tend to do like when you're offered a
job somewhere to look at the title nine
policies you know I'm not sure that's
happening yeah let's talk about some of
your other academic interests what's
exciting you these days we can move on
from title nine for a moment yeah I
think I'm still kind of figuring out
this you know we haven't gotten caught
up in this in this situation and you
know here we are talking about policy
issues I'm not at somebody who ever saw

paranoia comes to campus as well as a

television and film at Northwestern
University
Laura Kipnis welcome to the Rubin report
thank you hi hi I have had a roughly if
I had to add it all up a gajillion
requests to have you on okay so I feel
like we're gonna clean up a lot of stuff
here related let's try yeah
related to title 9 I did my little
direct message my preamble sort of
giving a vague explanation of title 9
mm-hmm you sort of got in the mix on
this thing when you wrote a piece in The
Chronicles of Higher Education in 2015
which I want to get to that and your
whole story related to all of that but
first I thought could you just give me a
basic explanation of what title nine is
and then how it changed during the Obama
administration okay I should start out
and say that it was never my goal in
life to become an expert on title nine
but as you might've said in the intro I
was brought up on title nine complaints
and at the time I had no idea what this
was you know I thought it had something
to do with women's sports so the brief
backstory is that in 2011 the Department
of Education under Obama expanded title
nine which had a covered gender equity
in higher education meaning like equal
funding for sports teams and that sort
of thing and they expanded it to include
sexual misconduct because the idea was
that you can't have gender equity if
students particularly women's students
are you know fearful for their safety or
are being assaulted you know or harassed
or that kind of thing so you know it's a
it's it's a good goal but they issued
these things called Dear Colleague
letters that were guidance to
institutions of higher learning that got
federal funding and threatened that if
the schools didn't comply with these
very big guidelines that their federal
funding could be withdrawn and you know
most schools get you know tons of their
funding from the government in research
grants and that kind of thing so all
campuses were required
title nine offices and officers and
implement these this guidance and it had
to do creating processes for sexual
misconduct complaints but also dictated
things like the standard of proof that
would have to be used in these
adjudications and the standard was
what's called preponderance of evidence
and that's a hugely controversial thing
because it basically means is 50/50 plus
a feather and the process also has been
I mean as I learned having gone through
it behind closed doors so none of this
is out in the open or transparent and
it's you have more and more people
getting caught up in in these sort of
kangaroo court situations both
undergrads mostly male students who get
accused of having non-consensual sex
usually in drunken you know sexual
encounters that somebody later decides
was not consensual but also professors
increasingly so what happened was after
I got brought up on these complaints I
wrote a second article and I got brought
up for writing an essay about you know
the kind of increasing vulnerability of
students and it was called sexual
paranoid Const a khadeem yeah I think I
think maybe we should pause there
because you gave me a lot there so let's
just whittle away some of that right so
first off I think a certain amount of
people would would be listening to this
and thinking wait a minute how can a
university lower the expectation of what
evidence is to prove someone guilty of
something if it's supposed to be you're
innocent until proven guilty how can how
can a university have a expectation
that's lower than that how does that
even how does that even make sense I
mean what's the actual rationale there
well the rationale is that they're
following this federal guidance but you
know what happened what the federal
guidance seems to be in conflict with
the Constitution well so one of the
things I learned is you don't actually
have constitutional rights at a private
university so there's how this stuff is
handled differs between public
institutions and private schools and
private schools can do what they want so
they're in a more contractual relation
with students and you know a lot of the
information on this
only coming out because these cases are
going to civil court
so like students who've been accused and
think they've been railroaded are suing
the schools and that's how we learn
what's going on otherwise nobody would
know
so in effect these these edicts come
through from the administration it's on
you know now the the burden of evidence
is suddenly on the accused in a bizarre
way and it really never bubbled up until
some of the men in this case started
taking civil action because they were
either falsely accused or they felt that
they were false the accuser wanted to
fight yeah
or there are no standards of evidence
and so that was the kind of thing I
learned from going through the process
so I was accused of say creating a
hostile environment and I said to the
title 9 investigators what how do you
know I mean it's a or I was creating a
chilling effect on the student body and
I should we should explain that those so
your your 2015 article let's just
explain what that was and how it got you
a doubt water before every okay I'm
jumping for it I wrote an article called
sexual paranoia strikes a khadeem for
the Chronicle of Higher Education
because they asked me to write something
about campus sexual politics because I
was known I guess have been known as
something of maybe a contrarian feminist
and I'm written about sexual politics a
lot so I said okay and I kind of thought
nobody read the Chronicle of Higher
Education you know and so I've wrote in
a kind of ironic maybe you know I had
some fun with it
and I do lean toward irony and so first
there was a protest march on campus by
students carrying mattresses and pillows
you know like a reference to the
Columbia student accusing me of
fostering or supporting rape culture I
guess and then I was found out I was
brought up on these title non complaints
but so I never found out precisely what
I was charged with because there isn't
such a thing as due process in these
situations right so to be clear you
write this piece and as you're saying it
was kind of tongue-in-cheek but with the
expertise that you have he's serious but
with an ironic tone I would say yeah
yeah so you write this piece
and then you're brought up on these
charges but what does you writing this
piece have to do with anything how does
that yeah become within the jurisdiction
of title 9 well it should not have been
and so it is a question mark why the
university allowed the case to go
forward because there is some sort of
provision in the New York Holly Blair
order that says nothing here should be
construed to impinge on freedom of
speech or academic freedom but
nevertheless I mean what does happen
what's happened is what you would call
mission creep in these situations where
the code has been stretched to include
such things as writing an essay and as I
later found out I mean all sorts of kind
of micro behaviors that somebody might
take offence at so in my case I had
written a couple of paragraphs about a
another professor on the campus so I
didn't know but it was public
information that he'd been accused of
sexual misconduct so I made reference to
that case so I was accused of
retaliating which is a big thing in
title 9 you cannot mostly people cannot
speak about the charges against them
because if they speak about them they
might be brought up on more complaints
for retaliating so I was charged with
retaliation even though I wasn't the
person who'd been involved in the sexual
misconduct do it right and to be clear
so the person that was accused of this
who was a colleague of yours although
you did not know him he was accused of
of having relations with a student but
consensual if I'm not mistaken there
were two um there were two sets of
complaints and one was that he'd gone
out drinking with a student one night
and they ended up sleeping in this same
bed but they didn't have sex there's no
indication that they've had sex but he
was accused of possibly having come onto
her he bought her drinks and then there
was a second situation which I actually
did not write about where he'd had a
relationship with a student
so I wrote about seven or eight words
about that second relationship and that
was I think the basis of the complaints
that I'd made reference to this
situation that that in effect they felt
you were defending him correct
I suppose so you know I can't
say what anybody thought or felt really
right I guess I guess you can but I
think I think we can surmise that that's
what they thought yeah that you know
your feelings on on that specific matter
outside of title nine really is that
these are if they're consenting adults
whether he's a professor and she's a
student that you're okay with that
basically right um I in the first essay
I was somewhat mocking these new
regulations that govern professor
student dating the prohibited at
particularly in the case of undergrads
it was sort of okay if you're a grad
student
but frowned on and when I was one of the
things I was saying was that you know
you can look around any campus on the
country who can barely throw a stone
without hitting a couple a married
couple often with children that started
out as a professor students situation
and it's widely known in academia that
you know some percentage of your
colleagues are married to former
students so it seemed a bit hypocritical
to suddenly enact these codes that would
regard those situations as like close to
some sort of credit predators so I you
know I felt that the professorial was
almost being regarded as as predators in
waiting and that you know dating was was
was ruled out and you know I don't want
to sound like some old geezer and but
when I went to school back in the good
old days you know I think we did all
sorts of stuff we partied and drank with
professors it was no big deal people
were sleeping with professors all over
the place so the this new climate of
regulation was something I wanted to
write about from a somewhat skeptical
vantage point right so so in your mind
it really was about the regulation that
they were putting on not you weren't
specifically defending or not defending
the actions of this guy which i think is
sort of where it got turned a little bit
yeah yeah so I think that's interesting
I mean I the version of feminism that I
would subscribe to would see this
climate of regulation is not in the
spirit of feminism and I think I've used
the term feminist paternalism but I will
say what happened was that or maybe
we'll get to this I mean I ended up
learning more about the situation with
this professor and writing more about it
in this book so there's a couple of
chapters about these two cases against
the professor who I do a close reading
of the title 9 reports which I ended up
having access to and so that was very
informative all right so we will get to
that for sure
I think that'll that'll sort of bring
this all together ok but okay so now
you're brought up on these charges
mm-hmm what was that like for you I mean
literally you you're you're a professor
and an author yeah wrote an article yeah
yeah you're using words and now you're
brought up on charges from the
government yeah well for my institution
and but you know it's right from yours
yeah I mean I was very much in the dark
you know I knew nothing about title 9
and they send you like a letter with all
these links to various and you know
informational websites and every website
has more links and more links and you
know it's like a rabbit hole of
hyperlinks that you learn nothing from
like I do not learn how I could be
charged with retaliation for writing
about someone else's situation so it's
very mystifying the the procedures and
what I've learned in these cases when
you're accused of something for the most
part you don't find out what you're
accused of you don't know what the
evidence is you often don't know who the
accusers are in my case so I the the
University hired a team of outside
investigators lawyers from another city
who flew in to conduct an investigation
they would not give me the charges in
writing we I did finally learn who the
accusers were we had a Skype session
prior to me meeting with them but so
some of the procedures are very baffling
like why won't they give you the
complaints in writing how could that
possibly be legal I mean I get the sort
of kangaroo court portion of this and
how this is all done outside of our
legal system makes to me it makes no
sense whatsoever yeah but when you're
talking to these people and then there's
lawyers coming in from a de stainless
what are they talking to you about if
they are not telling you what you're
charged they ask a lot of fishing
expeditions sort of questions and as I
later talk to more people who've been
through these procedures that's the mo
is the fishing expedition question and
then
things that you say particularly if
you're a male professor charged with
some kind of potential misconduct
anything you say can lead to another
avenue of Investigation and so people
enter these situations they don't know
what their rights are you know so like
when the the investigators said to me
that I could not record the session you
don't know where these edicts are coming
from you just know somebody who seems to
be an authority is is telling you what
you can and can't do as I say you don't
know what your rights are and you don't
know what the consequences will be if
you don't go along with it and it is the
when this is happening is the entire
administration just falling into line I
mean is there anyone at the
administration that was like you know
Laura something seems wrong here or you
need a lawyer or we should have someone
defending you or sitting with you or
you're not something you or anything
yeah no you're not alone I think every
school makes their own procedures up in
my case you are not allowed to have a
lawyer in the session with you when I
met with the investigators I could not
have a lawyer there I did consult with a
lawyer on the phone before this but I
didn't want to spend a lot of money on
this you know how it's a bit of a
cheapskate but you know I will even if
you had all the money in the world it
would still be absurd professors are
spending tens of thousands of dollars
when you know accused of something like
having improper eye contact I mean some
of the charges are so out there but I've
talked to people who have I mean just
spent vast amounts of money consulting
with lawyers but it because of course
now there's a huge industry legal
industry and defending people caught in
these situations you know it's a huge
growth industry right okay so how did
your case get to pollution how did it
how did it wrap itself up
well it went on for 72 days I met with
these people who'd flown in the
investigators for three hours or so I
was allowed to have a support person in
the room with me and I asked the guy who
is the head of the Faculty Senate at the
time to be my support person
was not good because for him because he
later got brought up until 9:00
complaints himself for speaking out at
the Faculty Senate because he thought
that you know what it happened was a
violation of academic freedom and then
through that so he sits there with you
then defends you in another form and
then he gets brought up on yes did I get
ya fully badly that is right
but what you asked before about the
administration I mean I didn't know who
didn't know or who didn't know I was
told to keep this stuff confidential so
um it would it was just very unclear to
me what position I was in when I got
this letter about the charges yeah and
then not only that but then you have a
colleague offering counsel and then he
so the the chill effect around this
thing it's like why would anyone put
their butt on the line to defend you of
an free speech or defended a professor's
ability to teach the way they want if
they know that they're gonna be the next
one because the preponderance of
evidence is so low that they're gonna be
the next one cause see in my situation I
did not feel like my job was at risk I
didn't have enough paranoia about the
situation to think that my university
would actually fire me for writing an
essay I thought that that would be look
very bad for them so I felt somewhat I
didn't know what the outcome was going
to be but I didn't think it was going to
be that I would lose my job whereas if I
was a guy a male professor you know or a
student for sure but a male professor
accused of something that veered more
toward sexual misconduct I would be far
more I would have been far more worried
in this situation and I should just say
that like male professors in teaching
situations that involve more personal
contact with students like said dance
instructor or drama people or even music
where you might touch a student those
people are hugely at risk and I've heard
about so many cases like that where
something that once would have seemed
innocuous is now being charged as sexual
misconduct or creating a hostile
environment per student putting the
legal part of this aside for a second
what do you think this is doing to the
professor's so I get it if you're
talking about a dance
or an art teacher that may touch
somebody as they lean over or whatever
it is but from those people all the way
to just the regular professor that might
fear that if there's a student that
comes into their office and they say
something or only or as you said looks
at them really what do you think this is
actually doing to academia in general
right now I think the word is starting
to get out that professors are really at
risk of losing their jobs if there's any
kind of controversy with a student and
people may not know that something like
half the province all right now is not
tenured meaning you know or tenure
Stream meaning there's no job security
about half of professors now are kind of
contract employees this is it's the
casualisation of academic labor no I
didn't know that so you mean not even on
the track yeah yeah no they're hired
astad junks or instructors on renewable
contracts sometimes one-year contracts
and those people if they get caught in a
situation where student says that
professors said something in a class
that makes them uncomfortable those
people are out even if they're found not
guilty they are likely not going to be
renewed or if I there was a case just
recently there's a school of the Chicago
Art Institute with a guy was an art
history professor whose students accused
him of some students accused him of like
a textbook that he used they thought was

welcome to the Rubin report thank you
that was the longest intro I've ever
read yeah well I never could hold a job
yeah we actually cut a little bit out of
that just so that for brevity's sake I
could have done an hour just reading
your resume that is that is quite a
resume how does someone build a resume
like that how did you even get into this
world that would lead to all of those
jobs that we're gonna spend the next
hour talking about well I mean partly
joining the American Foreign Service
gets you a pretty broad spectrum I mean
you're supposed to change jobs every two
or three years change countries change
languages I think my job my pattern is
perhaps been a little more eclectic than
others it's partly luck just being in
the right place at the right time I my
first assignment was to Paris and LBJ
launched the Vietnam peace talks and I
was attached to it just because I was
there and spent a year with Averill
Harriman and Cyrus Stan's trying to
negotiate peace in Vietnam that was just
your serendipity yeah when you look back
at all the years that you've been
involved in this does it seem like
things have changed a lot or in a weird
way have things not changed so much um I
think I think things have changed a lot
in the last year the last years
specifically yeah
after a you know I think 50 years of of
continuity I mean I think the Cold War
was all of a piece things alternated a
fairly narrow band there was a debate
between doves and hawks but it wasn't a
polarized it wasn't a politically
polarized debate the Hawks weren't all
Republicans and the does were all
Democrats quite the contrary you had
many Hawks in the Democratic Party and
doves and the Republicans and so the
debate was of a different character so I
and although the world seems more
complex there are 170 countries there
when I started there were only 40 or so
if you look back at the kinds of
problems that Harry Truman faced at the
end of the Second World War
kind of say you know things are not
really worse today I mean that there was
you know there was famine there was a
huge population transfers there were
countries developing nuclear weapons
that were dedicated enemies of the
United States and so in that sense we
should we should be a little modest in
expecting that our world is so much more
complicated and so much more demanding
than then than that of those who came
before us yeah I like the way you frame
that too because it seems to me that and
partly because of social media and the
way we get information and watching
things on YouTube and podcasts the way
people get this that it seems like all
the time people think things are worse
than ever before but when you frame it
within well look what happened after
World War two countries being carved up
weapons population transfers all of
these things it does give a little
context and I think can help calm people
down do people seem from from where you
sit do people seem a little the average
person seemed a little crazier about
this I think that I mean I think that it
is an information overload
it's it's you know you're you're
drinking from a firehose and and there's
there's no mediation you know
traditionally
the broadcast media that newspapers
decided what was important they ranked
it you know front page middle page top
of the fold bottom of the fold first
stop is the anchor going out to this
crisis or is it just a correspondent so
you could put everything in a context of
a hierarchy now that's no longer the
case now your attention is constantly
being demanded and assaulted by
assertions that this is important that's
important and and it's left to the
individual to sort these things out yeah
do you miss the old days of that as
someone that's seeing the change now
yeah I think I think it puts a pressure
I don't think that actual events actual
pressures on the United States are
greater than they have been in the past
but I think the need to respond in real
time immediately to every single event I
mean somebody dies here you got to do it
it perpetuates um you know there's a
shooting here you've got to come out
with a statement means that a lot of
time is is wasted may not be quite the
right word but a lot of time is spent
dealing with ephemera mm-hmm so as
someone that is has spent their whole
life basically in the thick of foreign
policy does it depress you to think
about how little most Americans know
about foreign policy it's one of those
things for example we're going to talk
about a whole bunch of countries of
course the next hour and it's like when
I see people talking about Iran or I see
people talking about North Korea and I
think man most of these people really
have have no concept of what the real
discussions are what the real Iran deal
says or the mechanisms by which we can
verify it or what really is happening
behind the scenes in North Korea or any
of that stuff but everyone's talking
about all these things all the time do
you think people are informed should
they be more informed as a certain
amount of being uninformed help a
populous what do you think I think the
difference is that people in the old
days people were uninformed and they
knew they were under okay today they're
uninformed and they're not this is an
incredible distinction you're making out
there and so and so they have strong
opinions based on on on on
on data which may or may not be of any
you know reliability and and and they're
not and they're no there's no longer a
deference to expertise this is true not
just this is true not just diplomacy I
mean they're people who won't get
vaccinated despite the fact that all the
doctors tell them they should vaccinate
their children sure so it's a there's
there's a there's there's there's simply
less deference to to expertise is less
deference to science there's less
deference to to government and that's
overtime that's quite dangerous yeah so
what are some of the just broad things
that people should know about foreign
policy I know I'm giving you a sort of
wide one there but just the general like
I just feel like people just don't
understand anything for example right
now I want to talk a little bit about
North Korea but as an example you know
Trump is is using a lot of over-the-top
language related to North Korea and then
the North Koreans are using a lot of
over-the-top language related to us not
to me that has a lot to do with
deterrence and and with Trump especially
it's an element of what's this guy
actually thinking which actually could
be potentially good to stop enemies that
sort of thing but what are just some of
the basic things people should know
about foreign policy in general well I
mean foreign policy is mostly about on
the one hand it's mostly about relations
between states now there are non states
like the Islam you know like terrorist
movements in others but mostly you're
dealing with States governments
bureaucracies institutions and so
diplomacy is about knowing how states
and institutions work and how they can
be influenced what whereas the levers
that you can push that'll get a
government to do what you want to do or
not do what you don't want them to do
but secondarily you know institutions
are made up of people and in the end
it's all about how to influence
individual people which you know
normally involves building a degree of
trust at least operational trust within
a narrow spectrum of if I do this when
you do that and can
I count on you to actually follow
through so in the end it comes down to
after you get through the understanding
the mecca of international relations of
how institutions work and how to
influence them it comes down to the
interpersonal relations and how to
actually talk to individuals directly or
indirectly and how to get people to
change their mind to enter into into
into meaningful bargains and to keep
their promises how much does that change
from administration to administration as
someone that worked under several
presidents Clinton George W Bush and and
Obama how much does that does that all
come from the top and and you know they
sort of lay out what their vision is and
then the individuals at all the
departments sort of just take that and
run with it or are there things from
administration to administration that
sort of just remain basic policy well I
think again I think minuite particularly
during the Cold War from from one
ministration uh there were there are
differences of emphasis the rhetoric
changed politicians tended to to give
the impression that they there were more
changes than in fact took place right so
I guess that in a narrow spectrum of
what was possible in principle and so
that's one thing that that has eroded
there now are wider variations I think
but again I would say I mean the current
situation really is abnormal it's
there's there's no real comparison you
can compare you can compare Carter to
Reagan or Clinton the bush you know but
but those were still within a fairly
narrow spectrum of difference mm-hmm so
we're in a we're in an unparalleled era
of discontinuity in that regard now in
terms of administration's new new
administration's with inexperienced
presidents presidents who've not dealt
with national security before and that's
true of a lot of presidents sure
I mean Reagan Carter George W Bush
Clinton Kennedy these people had no
national security experience when they
entered office it was a rarity George HW
Bush you know had a lot but he was
unusual
they make early in big mistakes and then
get better over time if they have a
second term they're usually more
successful in this second term than the
first term the if you look at you know
Kennedy's Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba
that went bad the first few weeks in
office LBJ's decision to reinforce and
greatly expand the u.s. commitment in
Vietnam early on in his his tenure
Clinton's debacle in Somalia which again
occurred in the first few weeks in his
office and of course the worst of all
george w bush's decision to invade Iraq
in the first year and a half in office
so costly mistakes improved performance
later on you can see the second terms of
presidents tend to be the ones that
leave the most meaningful legacies
behind and and again I think we're in a
we're in a unusual period I mean so far
Trump hasn't made the kind of costly
mistake that I've suggested others have
made others who were better prepared for
the job than he was so so far we've been
lucky in that regard will the luck hold
will he continue on balance to take the
advice of people like Madison and
Tillerson and McMasters who do have
experience and who and and who do be who
are playing a restraining role to some
degree I just don't know yeah but so
basically you like the the team that
he's assembled I sense from the way you
said that that you think that basically
this is a trustworthy group even if you
have your reservations about
his decision-making or his outlook I
think the national security team are
mostly mainstream representatives of the
national security establishment I think
many of them you know could have easily
been is easily appointed by Hillary
Clinton
I'm sure Hillary Clinton would have been
perfectly satisfied with mattis as a you
know or or McMaster as as senior people
in her administration
I think Tillerson is is a bit of an
enigma because his his policy instinct
seemed to be sound he seems to have
formed a team with mattis and McMaster
to kind of create you know channels to
keep the president from going off the
rails but his handling of the State
Department is almost inexplicable I mean
he's right that it that it was top-heavy
uh that it needed to be streamlined that
the number of bureaus and special envoys
that senior people needed to be cut back
first time I went to John Kerry staff
meeting I was surprised 100 people
showed up that morning staff me right it
was ludicrous right and half of them
were probably just assistants well
you're not most of them thought they
worked for the Secretary of State you
know directly yeah it had just gotten
out of control but the idea that you can
have you you can launch a study and not
to and not appoint anybody for a year
while you while you think about this
that's that's that's the world's just
moving too quickly yeah so do you think
that that Tillerson might actually be
good at getting rid of some of that
waste
I think he's already started yeah I have
to agree but but but I mean he's also
he's stopped hiring so you don't you
know I mean the Foreign Service is like
the military it's a Career Service you
come in at the bottom you gradually rise
to the top so you've got to keep
replenishing your seed corn mm-hmm you
need those guys who just came out of out
of grad school and who are who are going
to rise over 30 or 40 years to positions
of seniority and if you have a four-year
hiatus and hiring
you're gonna have serious problems later
on yeah so it's interesting what you
mentioned where you laid out a few of
the the mistakes or the probably
well-intentioned wrong events that
presidents got themselves into at the
beginning of their administrations and
yet you're acknowledging I mean we're
basically a year into Trump or almost a
year at this point and he hasn't gotten
into one of those so when he when he's
doing all of this the high level
rhetoric and saying you know we're gonna
wipe North Korea offer it's gonna be the
hell fire of whatever whatever it is he
says now I'm from what I understand you
don't really trust him in and of himself
but what do you make of just the the
deterrence factor of that because I'll
see a lot of people responding and
saying you see he's trying to start
World War three and again while I have
no idea what's going on in his mind I
hear some of those statements and I
think maybe he's really playing some
high-level game of we have no idea what
this is guy what this guy is going to do
and that actually is what deterrence is
all about am i giving him too much
credit there do you think well first of
all I don't think deterrence is about
not knowing what your adversary is going
to do it's quite the contrary it's
knowing where the red lines are and
letter step across them the consequences
are gonna be horrific right but is there
some level of deterrence if you just
don't know what that person is going to
do so if Trump says all of these things
we're gonna create Hellfire on earth or
whatever it is that is a level of
deterrence right it may be not in the
traditional sense I understand what
you're saying I think I mean it it
creates it creates a large zone in which
the other party doesn't know where where
the real red lines are how far they can
actually go so it it can have it can
have exactly the opposite consequences
of what you mm-hmm of what you intend it
can lead them to believe that steps that
they take are not going to lead to an
escalation that do I
so I mean deterrence is about create it
you know deterrence as a as a as a
strategy for dealing with the mutual
assured destruction
but the fact that if you get into an
actual conflict with a nuclear power
it's over you know
now North Korea isn't yet a nuclear
power of the of the type that can
destroy the United States but it's you
know certainly China Russia are
countries where if you escalate to a
nuclear war it will be the end of the
United States as a society and the end
of Russia and possibly the end of
mankind depending on on how you know how
how far this goes so so that's a
powerful deterrent and you need you need
to establish some sense of you know
what's what are the rules of the game
yes you can do this and then we'll do
that and we'll play tit for tat and if
you support them will support their
enemies and we'll get into a proxy
conflict but you know if you on the
other hand if you cross this line you
know that then you're going to be in a
direct confrontation which leads to do
catastrophe
and so this this kind of loose talk and
and the uncertainties it creates I think
is the opposite of a strategy of
deterrence now it may be a bargaining
tactic mm-hmm but but you know the
problem with that is that Trump is and
has said that it you know that he's used
to deals that you can walk away from
that that that you know you make an
offer if it's if you don't get the right
you you you you Bluff you push and then
if you don't get the right response you
just walk away
mm-hmm you know he's not in games you
can walk away from right these are games
that are going to continue into the
future indefinitely you're gonna be
dealing with rogue regimes and and
dangerous enemies in perpetuity and so
these are not these are not games where
you can play for a while and decide okay
the bluff didn't work and I'll go on to
the next deal with somebody else yeah I
think the distinction about rational
actors is important so perhaps we're
dealing with an irrational actor as our
president and certainly the North
Koreans have what seems to be an
irrational actor as opposed to the
Soviet Union and the United States and
during the Cold War we had basically
rational actors that that weren't gonna
have their own countries blown apart
just because something moved along in a
way that they didn't like yeah I mean I
I think that's I I think that's right I
think by and large both sides avoided
the kind of rhetoric which could lead to
misunderstanding miscalculation now
there were a few points particularly
during the first term of Ronald Reagan
where they asked elect or whether the
rhetoric had become quite heated evil
empire sort of rhetoric where the Soviet
Union we now know from Soviet records
was on a hair-trigger there was one
incident in which a Soviet Colonel saw
missile trails heading toward Moscow and
decided that it was an electronic ghost
and didn't and didn't launch the Rockets
which which his instructions had him
doing there was another point at which
after a lot of rhetoric we conducted a
nuclear exercise in which we exercised
the conducting a nuclear strike and the
Soviet Union thought that was a real
preparation for a nuclear strike and
again came quite close to perceiving
this as a as a pre-emptive American
strike and again we now know this from
[Music]
all right we obviously have to talk
about gun control this week over the
course of my many Rubin report
interviews I've sat across from an array
of people who are pro-gun rights
anti-gun altogether or somewhere in
between
while the events surrounding the gun
conversation are always horrific with
this week's tragic events in Vegas being
perhaps the worst of all of them I
believe that the conversation around
guns when done right can offer powerful
insight into how people think about
society at large gun ownership and the
right to bear arms brings up issues
about the American Constitution states
rights personal responsibility mental
health radicalization both religious and
otherwise and much more unfortunately as
is so often the case these days were
seemingly caught between two groups of
people the people who want to ban guns
completely and the people who don't want
to have any sort of conversation about
sensible gun laws well I absolutely
support the Second Amendment I at the
same time understand and acknowledge
that the United States has what seems to
be a unique problem related to mass gun
violence lost in the midst of all the
awful events of Las Vegas this week are
other senseless shootings across the
country like the five people killed and
30 others wounded by gunfire in Chicago
this past weekend the weekend before
that three were killed and 36 were
wounded in Chicago and the weekend
before that it was 11 dead and 29
wounded in the very same city we've
included a link down below which tracks
the gun related violence across Chicago
occurring every single weekend and it's
disturbing to say the least I bring up
Chicago not to deflect from the events
in Las Vegas but to show how this
murderous violence is happening in one
of our biggest cities literally every
single day and happening so often at
this point that the mainstream media has
all but given up on reporting on it the
reasons behind how and why people murder
others also makes it hard to find one
law around guns that works in every
situation there no doubt is a difference
between a murder that occurs during a
robbery versus gang violence versus
terrorism versus suicides versus a
random shooter with no known political
or religious motive
and at the same time there are times
when someone with the gun saves innocent
lives during a shootout or when someone
defends their property and their family
by having a gun in the home so again
while I support the Second Amendment I
also recognize that we undoubtably
have a gun related violence problem on
our hands just look at the numbers I can
also acknowledge that guns in and of
themselves aren't the only problem here
without question much of the carnage
caused by guns is due to people with
mental health issues gaining access to
guns the truth is that if I or most of
the gun owners in America had access to
the most deadly weapons on earth we
wouldn't be randomly using those weapons
against innocent people not only are
mental health issues an aspect to the
people who are committing mass shootings
but also there's a problem with any any
ideology which drives people to commit
these heinous acts be it a religious
ideology a political ideology or any
other system of principles or beliefs
which could drive someone to kill a
weapon in and of itself can't kill
anyone it takes a human being and a
corrupt thought process to pull the
trigger and kill innocent people also as
I'm recording this it's still unclear
exactly what weapons were used in Vegas
but authorities report to finding about
20 other firearms in the shooters hotel
room and it's possible that this man was
using a military-style fully automatic
rifle to commit this heinous act for all
the defense I've offered up the Second
Amendment I cannot see I can't possibly
see how access to such weapons which
have the ability to mow down civilians
at an incredible rate and which are
designed for the battlefield should be
in the hands of regular citizens as we
post this video the story about the
Vegas gunman is largely incomplete at
the moment we don't seem to know his
motives so it's hard to say if this was
an act of terrorism under the most
specific definition of the term which
includes having a political motivation
to kill Nevada States definition is a
little more broad not including the need
for a political motivation which in this
case would in fact classify this killer
as a terrorist regardless of how we
wanted to find this specific act of
horrific violence or how the gun
discussion relates to terror
tourism or the legitimate right of every
citizen to have the ability to defend
themselves
we must get better about talking about
gun control between the shootings in
order to prevent more shootings and not
just talk about it when these acts occur
passing more laws in the heat of emotion
is rarely the right thing to do even if
they are well intentioned while doing
nothing and hoping that these events
will simply end is just as misguided as
hoping the Terrorism will completely
stop if we just ignore it while we wait
to find out more about the Vegas shooter
himself and at the same time mourn the
victims of this evil act
we should also continue to talk to
people on both sides of the gun debate
to try to come to some sensible place of
agreement I'm gonna do my best to do
just that and if you guys know of some
interesting voices in this debate that
you'd like to hear on the Reuben report
let us know in the comments section
right down below
[Music]
we're continuing our partnership with
learn Liberty this week and joining me
is a columnist a media personality and
the author of dear reader the
unauthorized autobiography of Kim Jong
Il Michael now let's welcome to the
Reuben report hello Kim Jung ill and yet
when you see that online sometimes it
looks like Kim Jung too
that's true al that must be very
confusing to people only if they're like
you know IQ of 100 hilarious I said to
you right before we started I was doing
a little research and then people see
Kim jong-un yeah Carla and then you got
one you got ill people think it's a 2
you could see why there would be some
language confusion there I think well
it's also funny when people think Kim is
his first name because that's the family
name and in Asia they have the last name
first and some people refer to him as
like little Kim it's like that's not it
yeah it's not good Google a little
kaminer a whole other thing comes up
very entertaining all right there's a
ton I want to talk you about I'm looking
forward to talking about North Korea
because I think it's actually one of the
one of the countries and and from a part
of the world that we haven't spent a lot
of time we talked
about you know obviously domestic stuff
and some middle-east stuff but we
haven't spent that much time in that
part of the world but first I just want
to find out a little more about you
you've been interesting biography you
just told me a couple pieces of trivia
about yourself that I think are quite
interesting so for people who have no
idea who Michael malice is who are you
well that's that's a broad kind of oh
who am I to start I'm the boy you love
to hate I like you said I'm an author
I'm on TV you know running my big fat
mouth frequently I host a show on
compound Mediacom and the in the Fox
family I see you on a lot of the Fox the
business yeah you know when I started
this North Korea work it was driving me
crazy that there's so many people on TV
and in other forms of media who are
running their mouths about this country
which is extremely complicated and they
have no idea what they're talking about
and you know quoting Atlas Shrugged I
said I'm gonna put a stop to this once
and for all and I kind of did the
conversation I started shifting from you
know we just need to bomb them into
oblivion to this is a nation of what is
it 25 million slaves and our hearts
should go out to them because there are
absolute victims of this horrible regime
you know I was on an NPR affiliate it's
very funny and she was referred to Kim
jong-il as it can't be figure and I said
well that's a very unfortunate choice of
words and she was rendered pretty much
suicidal because again they have
concentration camps you can see them on
Google Earth so whenever you see the
press making North Korea out to be a
carnival this is exactly what I'm
against yeah and I that's actually one
of the things that I really want to dive
into a little bit because I find it to
be one of those things where anything
happens you know there's a missile test
that now seems to be happening every
week or whatever else the amount of
people and again you can't pay too much
attention to what's happening on Twitter
but just the amount of misinformation
Fuzion joking about extremely serious
things when people have no idea what the
consequences are all that there's just
like it's just a whole series yeah I was
on a radio show this week and the hosts
were just cracking jokes about North
Korea and I wasn't having and he's like
oh you gotta let me have my jokes ago
it's like North Korean missiles you got
to make sure that they land so the book
is humorous because I'm like if you can
make people laugh about this situation
you can get them to understand the
darkness because otherwise it's too
intense you know there's this amazing
we're called nothing to envy and you
read it and you want to jump out of
window because we're so powerless to
help these people but the
same time it's I think it's important to
understand both North Korea specifically
and generally how you know totalitarian
governments work and what that means in
practice you know is more than the
Soviet Union so this is something that
hits very close to home for me yeah so
all right before we dive fully into that
you mentioned right before we started
you just referenced Iran you mentioned
that you have her did you say it's her
first print first copy I have
Iran's copy of the first edition of The
Fountainhead yes that seems like you
can't it doesn't even exist well I also
have it I also have the dress she was
buried in don't get it I do have that
book I mean I'm a book collector I've
got every book she's ever written and
and I stopped after a while because now
with self-publishing people can read
books about her they're not worth
reading but to a point I had every book
written by and about her yeah I mean she
was a huge influence on me but at the
same time I don't often like talking
about it because for a certain
percentage of the population higher than
10% less than 50% saying you like Iran
takes the mental space of saying you're
Scientologists most people just check
out they think it's a cult and there's
something to that so I mean I'm very
kind of wary of getting into the whole
Iran stuff yeah it's so interesting to
me because I've been doing some work
with the Iran people and mostly we're
just promoting free speech on college
campuses and I found them to be some of
the most open decent protecting the
things that I care about with free
speech and all of those things and yet I
know for sure and I there were people
I've had on this show that'll say Oh
Iran this or that just completely in a
dismissive way and maybe they've got
some branding work to do one of the
things that drives me crazy and this is
that maybe my Soviet upbringing is do
not eat your own so the kinds of people
who go after Rand or rothbard or any of
these other great titans of Liberty who
had many many flaws and who did many
messed-up things if your agenda is to
take down the people who broke down
those doors for you you are in my view
garbage as a human being and it's it's
really reprehensible for me to see I
mean the villain is the state the
villain are the people who want to
dominate and control free people's lives
and you should always keep that in mind
as opposed to some kind of social
posturing you know I really like the way
you phrase that because we see so much
bickering inner bickering we have people
these days and all the personal attacks
and all the labels and all that stuff
and it's like you guys all don't have
your eyes on the prize right we should
be fighting for his freedom what we
should be fighting for is to expand
Liberty all the things that you just
mentioned and instead we're just like at
each other's throats all day with people
that have virtually no control over
anybody and we should be at the throats
of people who are sending those to war
for no reason who are sending people to
prison for no reason who are trying to
censor free speech for no reason they're
the villains so if you don't like how
someone talks or things you judge people
by their actions not by their thoughts
yeah all right well let's talk about
some ideas then so okay North Korea yeah
the juichi idea what in the world
possessed you to go to North Korea you
even say I went to North Korea to people
they think this guy's something's not
right well there's a few reasons one is
when I got established enough as a
writer I had some money in my pocket and
I thought I'm going to travel more right
this is something I never allowed myself
to do when I was kind of struggling and
North Korea was first on my list first
of all you have party cred because you
can always tell people you've never been
yeah yeah that's very impressed
I saw grimness said it's the most real
yeah but also you know you get older
people want to see what their family
went through and for me the only time
capsule of Soviet Russia is you know
North Korea it's the closest so and I
also wanted to see what it's like it's
the only country we don't have internet
access you don't access the outside
world my friend had gone and it's it was
it was until recently illegal to go so
and I wanted to do a book about it
because it's it's such a fascinating
country and I thought to myself look we
have a pretty good here if I move the
needle in America it's not going to
matter but if I move the needle in North
Korea even a little bit this could be
saving you know millions of lives and
yeah it's a pompous thing to do but I'd
rather shoot for the moon and miss then
you know kind of like have some kind of
marginal tax cut here yeah although I
would like to believe that you can move
the needle here and it would still have
some movement sure otherwise why why
would any of us do what we do right yeah
that's fair yeah let's just pause for a
second so tell me a little bit more
about Soviet Russia cuz I don't I don't
want to gloss over that so you were born
there yeah when did you you and your
family we came here when I was two but
you know you grew up we're in a Soviet
household it's it's funny and as you get
older talking to Americans and realizing
oh this is not how everyone is raised
right and how you how so how much
programming
in my head as a result of how I grew up
and it's it's just fascinating that this
you we all think of our families as the
norm yeah and then you go to college and
you grow up and you're like oh no this
is just my family that's messed up and
that's like for me it's like it's not
just my family it's this whole culture
yeah well everyone's family is messed up
to different degrees and absolutely ruin
things what's it like growing up so okay
came here too so you obviously don't
remember what it was like to be in the
Soviet Union but with parents that lived
through that and then come here as
immigrants what was that experience like
I mean English is my second language and
the first thing they did was send me to
private school because they knew that
public schools would be the death of me
which I'm very very grateful for but
there's just so many little
idiosyncrasies like you know Russia is a
no trust Society so you're you're you
kind of have this paranoia built into
your head which frankly when you're
dealing in entertainment or media it's
useful to have no it's not you're
prepared for that person to kind of
screw you over but also the fact that
most people in life are generally
incompetent so if you have these backup
plans or when someone messes up
intentionally or not
it kind of moves you well in business at
the same time it's hard for making
personal relationships because you're
paranoid and assuming everyone's that to
get you a no trust Society yeah an
interesting phrase and I sense we're
sort of viewing to that oh yes how in
America that there is just a basic sense
that first off yeah you barely trust the
people that you're getting information
from but it's not even that we're also
having trouble agreeing on facts which i
think is a much more dangerous thing
these facts I think that's a very
healthy thing because I think what we
need to do is self segregate we already
starts to self segregate by ideology
even having these same arguments since
the flesh revolution I don't want to
argue anymore
I want you to go your way we'll go our
way and everyone will be the better for
it interesting so you don't think if if
we disagree politically on certain
things you kind of want to let each
faction just go its own way as opposed
to try to get something together oh yeah
the best thing about Trump for me is
that he's increasingly making political
discourse impossible because when you
have political discourse that can only
mean oppression because that can only
mean when both parties get together it's
all it's going to be at the expense of
freedom so when you see for example it's
unfolding as we're taping this all right
now so when we air this
we'll see which way it has gone when you
see Trump working with the Democrats
that on something like daca you view
that as sort of a this can't be good and
then right correct they can't be good
but I don't know that it is it's gonna
play out exactly like it seems because
Trump has been very good at pulling the
rug out from people and humiliating him
and he's been a great wrecking ball in
terms of bringing disapproval and
distaste or the political process yeah
so as someone that grew up with parents
from the former Soviet Union and went
through all this stuff and understands
this this trust issue yeah I sense
you're you're basically a Trump guy
right no I'm an anarchist I mean I think
these people shall be in jail but I
think it's great that he is they're
giving me a lot here I'm gonna have to
have a chart here's an example of how
the Soviet upbringing really helped me
yeah this thing with that guy from
Google James yeah when people were
shocked how it played out I'm like it
was mind-boggling to me that people were
naive enough to be surprised there be
any other consequence when you have that
mindset you know the the essential Sofia
thought is if someone has power of you
arbitrary power you should assume that
they're going to exploit it completely
unfairly arbitrarily and always be aware
of who had for example I have a landlord
and there's a problem with my sink and
my friends like why didn't you tell him
you know and and say you know make a
[Music]
joining me today is a guy who doesn't
like Nazis or anti feh and is also the
host of the dogma debate podcast David
Smalley finally welcome to the room
thanks for having me I appreciate it
yeah we've been trying to make this
happen for a couple months yeah you were
writing here on your motorcycle yeah you
burned your finger remember my first
guest I think to be in physical pain I
put some people through mental pain but
I think you're my first injured getting
yeah it's uh it's interesting it was a
little warmer today than I thought it
was gonna be and I pulled over to take
my jacket off and roll it up and I'll
try to stuff it into the saddlebag and
burned my finger on my own exhaust so
right there your your viewers will know
my level of intelligence there's some
sort of metaphor there you burned your
fingers on your own exhaust there's
something there there's something deep
yeah and and it kind of reminds me of on
my way to interview Richard Dawkins for
my podcast yeah I had a motorcycle
accident like someone pulled out in
front of me and I slammed into him on
the way I was still I'm still made it
and did the interview but yeah there's
something going on any time I'm gonna go
do something that I really enjoy doing
something's trying to stop yeah what's
going on there nice someone upstairs
looking at you judging you no not that
no chance I think we'll get into that
we'll get into that a little bit how
long you been doing the motorcycle thing
Oh almost two years now yeah I mean I
rode their bikes for seven eight years
as a kid I actually wrote a dirt bike
before I could ride a bicycle my dad
taught me to ride a to balance on two
wheels on a on a motorcycle so I made
you an atheist right there
no reading the Bible is what made me an
atheist yeah all right so let's start
there so for people who don't know you
at all so you host a show called Dogma
debate I've been a guest on the show we
do very sort of similar thing you
actually are one of the people that I
think is trying to get some answers
you're not trying to be a judgmental
prick that's how's that for a compliment
yeah thank you that's pretty much the
greatest compliment I can nowadays it is
right
no that's that's what I've done yeah
you're trying to explore some things and
you're willing to talk to people you
agree with and disagree with and all
that stuff but your backstory is pretty
interesting because because you are an
atheist now but you grew up as an
evangelical Christian it was in the
music men talk about it yeah I was in
the music ministry I was a drummer
usually for all-black gospel churches
now if you've never listened to that
music you've you're missing out I still
love it I still enjoy it the the the
all-black choirs oh man there's
something about it I mean it's uplifting
it's awesome that the message is
positive there's a lot of fun there
the music's more like a blues and funky
jazz oriented sort of style what I did
play a few times for the white churches
it was so boring they didn't want me to
use regular sticks they wanted me to use
the little nylon brushes no the the
black churches let me go all out they
had a you know bass guitarist and
keyboard and those are some of the the
greatest times of my life I was a part
of the ministry and then my pastor had
me go door knocking you know and to tell
people about Jesus Christ and I'm on my
mission doing this I say mission I
wasn't Mormon but I was on my mission of
winning souls and I knocked on this
lady's door and I said I'd like to talk
to you but our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ and she said honey you need Jesus
and slam the door in my face and
standing there staring at her door I
thought what if she's right what if she
has the right version of Jesus and I'm
walking around this neighborhood telling
people something that's not true yeah
how old were you at this point I was
about 17 16 somewhere around there and
so maybe 15 maybe a little younger and I
remember thinking what if I'm leading
people away from Christ and so you know
it's actually started when I was
baptized I thought I'm not good enough
to be a Christian I'd better figure this
stuff out like they've given me the
uniform and sent me out on the field and
I don't know any of the plays I don't
know what we're doing I don't know if I
have the truth and so I started thinking
how do I know my little small town in
Texas that church
we're the ones going to heaven and
everyone else has it wrong yeah how do I
know right and what if that lady's right
what if what if what if I need Jesus and
she has the right version so I thought
you know what there's a lot of confusion
around this
I want to get so close to God that I can
solve these problems I want to make sure
I can I can lead people the right way
and so I started literally reading the
Bible cover-to-cover I talked with
theology professors I talked with
pastors I talked with friends who were
Christians and I got so close I saw that
there wasn't one and that this book is
very much left up to interpretation and
then I started sort of going all these
people who claim to believe have they
asked these questions how do they know
they have the right version of Jesus and
it was a 14-year journey for me this was
not you know oh I had a traumatic event
in my life so I threw at my aunts and
said God why do you I didn't have a
lieutenant day in moment no no I was
like screw you right it was much more of
an intentional process of I want to know
God I want to be close to God I didn't
feel good enough to be a Christian why
you on a boat in Louisiana during the
storm we could get you to have a
lieutenant Dan Roman maybe so maybe
maybe so I'll probably cursing it I
don't know Thor in that moment right so
it's interesting though because your
evolution out of religion was through
reading religious texts where I think a
lot of people have a sort of leap of
faith moment but rarely does that have
to do with reading text you know to me
the people that are even becoming more
religious they have that leap of faith
whatever that personal experience is for
them but I wonder how many people
actually read the full text and go one
way or the other
yeah I think I think meaning that you
were informed about what you were doing
and I think a lot of people just kind of
check out either way they make a
decision without necessarily reading
everything I think most atheists that
I've talked to and I've had my show for
almost six years I've talked with tons
of atheists although I try to make my
show mostly about talking with believers
and people who I would fundamentally
disagree with but I would say most
people who get into the faith do it
because of a mentor in their lives
there's some pastor or a preacher or
some charismatic leader who will use a
Bible verse and say here's a teachable
moment and they use that Bible verse and
then they talk about it or do a sermon
on it in some way that you leave there
feeling oh wow that
that was speaking directly to me well
the reason you feel that it's not
because the Bible itself was speaking
directly to you it's because the the
charismatic trained preacher used that
Bible verse as a motivational speech
ignition and so that's what it really
turns into so whenever you leave Church
feeling good it's it's on purpose but if
you go back and read all of the verses
especially the ones the preachers skip
over right that's where you start to go
await a minute that doesn't sound like
this loving God I thought I was
worshiping so that's where it started to
break down I think people will convert
into religion for mostly emotional
reasons but I would say for the most
part people who leave the faith do so
informed as I did I think they start
looking into it and going this doesn't
add up to this is there a scientific
answer for what I used to think was
metaphysical and then they get informed
in science and then go wait a minute
it's not that I don't like God it's that
God is irrelevant we don't need God in
order to answer a lot of these questions
and I don't know it's still okay I
normally don't offer my guests a guest
in the middle of the show but have you
had Andrew clay been on by anything I
have not so I'm gonna connect you with
Andrew Clavin he's a really interesting
guy born Jewish then was an atheist most
of his life and then became Christian
and talk so I think you'd have a senior
in lacs here in LA he's multiple-time
guest on the Rubin report and I'm gonna
kick him over to you I usually do more
politics with him so I think and I've
done some of that but I think you know I
think you'll dig it so when you when you
had this awakening so to speak can
people describe it as an awakening if
it's opening - I'm solid a yeah yeah I'm
fine so when you had that awakening had
the family take it like what was it like
for you first like were you like oh man
but was I following a lie you know you
know at first I was reading online and I
found my first atheist online and it was
Frank Ziegler for people who don't know
who he is look him up he said he speaks
a million languages the guy's brilliant
he's he's awesome and he he was doing a
radio debate this was a transcript from
a radio debate in 1989 and it was with a
Christian geologist and he's an atheist
geologist and they were debating Noah's
Flood this idea that there was actually
a real flood and he said something is so
funny there's something so small
he asked the guy I was reading the
transcript because this was in early
2000 or late 90s that I was reading this
was at least 10 years old he asked the
guy he said why did God only save the
land animals in the flood and the
Christian geologists had no answer for
it and then Frank said well you do
realize that that amount of fresh water
falling into the oceans would have
diluted the pH levels to the point that
marine life would have died too
so why didn't God tell us to save the
marine life as well and he said unless
of course the entire story is fabricated
and those people didn't know the
difference between ocean water and rain
water and that I just thought how come
no one's ever thought of this and so
that was like an aha moment for me and I
just went it was kind of like a boy
raised by wolves seeing his first human
going oh that's what I am that's why
none of this stuff makes sense to me
that's why I can't lick my own privates
I don't mind my body doesn't work that
way you know and so you try you could
try and then some talented people I'm
sure can accomplish it but the average
person can't yeah and so that you know
that's what I'm like that was my mom I
felt relieved I wasn't scared I wasn't
angry I finally just felt I'm not alone
there are other people out there that
question this stuff and so when I first
told my mom I never said I'm an atheist
I said I'm not a Christian anymore I
just casually told her over the phone
and she was like well why not and I said
I've just been reading a lot of the
Bible have you read this verse have you
read that she's like no I never read
that I never read that no okay and I
just left it at that and she didn't
offer a lot of pushback and I'm one of
the lucky ones
some people get thrown out of their
homes their college education cutoff
there they're not allowed to talk to
their families anymore you know Leah
Remini is doing this thing on
Scientology where people are literally
cut off from their families Jehovah's
Witnesses are very similar they won't
let you talk to people outside of the
cult it's it's really you know divisive
and so when my mom started to complain
about how churches were doing this I
knew the Bible very well and I just said
mom listen in the Bible in Matthew 10:34
Jesus says do not think that I came to
bring peace on earth I did not come to
bring peace I came to bring division to
set a man against his father a daughter
against her mother a man's enemies will
be those in his own household I said so
regardless of what denomination one
Jesus is successful at dividing families
and we have this commandment you shall
honor your father and mother Luke 14:26
says if you don't hate your mom and dad
you can't be my disciple so he was a
cult leader leading people away from
their families just like Jehovah's
Witnesses just like David Miscavige with
with Scientology they're leading people
away from their families and trying to
divide and I'm more about bringing
people together with humanism than
dividing based on religion yeah it's so
interesting too because although I
haven't read all three of them cover to
cover the New Testament is actually I'm
pretty sure it's by far the most
peaceful of the big three right of the
Old Testament the Quran and the New
Testament the New Testaments probably
the most peaceful but yet they're still
reading out yeah well there's still
quite a bit of horrible things in there
Romans 1:26 through 32 still says gays
are worthy of death and anyone who
supports gays are worthy of death this
is New Testament it mentions Ephesians
says slaves obey your earthly masters so
we still have an approval of slavery in
the New Testament and the New Testament
is also where Jesus is saying if you
don't hate people you can't follow me if
you don't have a sword sell your cloak
and buy one it's he's very much a
violent cult leader you know what I mean
so the New Testament does have some you
know the greatest commandment of all
love your neighbor as yourself
love your enemy feed your enemy but
that's ones contradictory to a lot of
the other verses in there so when you
talk about this stuff now you know that
my audience is pretty much all over the
spiritual matter the the secular map the
political map all of that really I
thought you were a conservative show
yeah in furn all right maniac all right
Nazi sympathizing conservative shield
that's what I read well I'm pretty sure
we're in some of the same knot are you
these days are you telling me that
there's stuff on the internet that's not
true can you believe that I don't
believe it it's not I can really nuts so
my audience though is all over the place
in every way and that and I love it
you know because sometimes people say
y'all have Reubens selling out for these
people are that people I'm like I
literally completely the truth I would
not even know which way to sell out
trying to which I'm not trying to
obviously but I mention this because
what I think is interesting is that I
have a lot of people that are
and conservatives that email me and
they'll say I they'll just be like you
know I never heard a liberal that was
sort of tolerant of us because I do try
to be tolerant of you know I've had
Christian conservatives on the show and
I I try to be as tolerant of anyone as
they will be of me it's it's a two-way
street as sure so when when my audience
that's a Christian conservative out
there is listening to this they're gonna
be on their back heels obviously here in
some of that stuff so how do you go
about bridging that divide I bridge that
with questions I don't necessarily want
to come at you and say here's everything
wrong with your religion let me just
talk directly to them for a moment I'll
tell them everything that you love about
your religion I love that too the the
peace the helping the less fortunate
the loving your neighbor the accepting
everybody a lot of people think that
when I say I'm an atheist or if I'm
arguing against Christianity that that's
what I'm trying to take from you I'm not
trying to take that I want you to
embrace that I love that too more than
likely the things that I dislike about
your religion are things that you're not
aware of that that live within your
religion things that are buried within
your holy book that you would make you
uncomfortable I just bring it to the
surface and say how do you reconcile a
loving God with this with the story of
Jobe with we just did a whole podcast on
the story of Java what am i what am i I
have have this quite a few now Christian
followers on patreon who or follow me on
Twitter who support me on patreon and
they they want to come on the show and
have discussions and so I ask questions
and bring things to light to say how do
you how do you worship a God that said
slavery was okay and they'll go out that
was indentured servitude okay except
that's not so great dude but well yeah
that that's in there but there's another
part in there in Leviticus I think it's
25 44 through 46 that specifically says
you can buy Hebrew slaves from among you
you can pass them down to your children
you can own them forever as property
that's not indentured servitude that's
slavery it talks about how often you can
beat your slaves so what I do is how I
bridge the gap is I ask the question how
do you walk around day to day being a
good person and then justify horrific
actions to me that's the embodiment of
evil
you said what is evil you're an atheist
now you have no basis for morality yeah
well hold on we do have human harm we do
have human for flourishing these are
facts of reality the mechanism by which
to judge that I would say is John Rawls
veil of ignorance put yourself behind
the veil to remove your own bias and
decide it should rape be okay
are you the victim are you the rapist
should poverty be okay are you the one
in poverty or are you the billionaire
you know you can you can look at it and
go if I'm behind the veil of ignorance
and don't know what I'm gonna be on the
other side then you can make an unbiased
objective call on it and so whenever I
try to remove that piece of it try to
remove the the bias from it it really
comes down to me going there was a god
at one point that said slavery was okay
that in 1st Samuel 15-3 told Saul to go
kill infants he said go kill the babies
the nursing infants go kill them how do
you as a good person say I can't wait to
get to heaven and worship that dude how
do you reconcile that how do you so in
some ways do you think it almost doesn't
matter what's in the text specifically
it's only what people act on so for in
other words there's good you know for
however many Jews that are out there
there's not that many that believe in a
literal interpretation of the Bible
there are probably less Christians right
now that believe in a literal
interpretation than maybe twenty years
ago right I think it's a little bit
different right now with Islam and
Muslims just from just from those gross
and racist pupils that there are people
there is a disproportionate amount of
people but obviously not all and
obviously not most right and all that
some better believing in a literal
interpretation so in some ways they can
all have bad things but it's really
about how the people act not it right
like because we all have those things
where we take sort of because they also
vote they also teach their children that
you know demons are watching them at
night and there's this huge chess game
of struggle between good and evil and
that if you do something bad the devil
made me do it and if you do something
good God gets the credit I think there
are things that are mental child abuse
