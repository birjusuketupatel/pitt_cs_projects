Just thought I'd share a nice quote with you all today.http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-17075-001

A lot of people, including Dave, seem dumbfounded by the idea that people who constantly rally for free speech are labeled racists or bigots. But might such clumsy labeling actually have a basis in fact? Is such a pro free speech position nothing more than pretext? 

This study suggests that people who vehemently support free speech may be motivated by prejudice rather than principle. This might help explain why free speech warriors often have nothing to say when a guy like Trump threatens to strengthen libel laws. Should we tell him? It drives me bonkers.After Dave left TYT, they were on good terms despite having disagreements, i remember around that time Dave had Jimmy Dore on the show and he said that even though they disagree they are still good friends and have dinner together. He said that he still hangs out with them and plays basketball with Cenk.

He was hesitant to say anything bad about them because they were still friends. I'm not sure what happened, but since then he has made it clear publicly that he doesn't like the young turks or any of the people working there and takes every opportunity to insult them. 

At one point after a terrorist attack, he tweeted to Cenk asking him if he was in favor of the terror attack. 

I think he's doing it to appease his fanbase who were begging him to go after them. The young turks on the other hand dont talk about him at all.

Tl:Dr Dave was on good terms with the young turks even after leaving but sold his friends out to look good in front of his right wing audienceSurely Dave Rubin defender of freedom will step in and point out this injustice!We all know that he can't keep doing this forever - or he might, but there are still better career prospects for him.

I see him as a host of Fox and Friends and / or as a contributor on some Fox News show (Hannity maybe?) representing token leftist who is fed up with the current state of the left.

I think he has some skills going for him: His spinelessness, his inane analysis (say what you want to say, Trump isn't Hitler, eat that regressives), his willingness to bend over backwards towards whatever right-wing media talking point that is circulating at the moment (and enjoying it!)... 

I see him being a contract employee with 500k+ dollars a year. That on the top of Learn Liberty (50k+ a year) and some extra dark money plus Rubin Report would net him at one to two million dollars a year!

For a failed comedian without any real skills or intelligence, that would be quite an achievement!Just so people see this; it seems Trudeau wasn't even serious about his "peoplekind" remark ...

It all seems to have been an inside joke anyway. Watch his clarifying remarks which coincides with the crowd's reaction when he made the "peoplekind" remark:

So glad Rubin held his feet to the fire, he's really got his priorities straight ... Geez.

https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Miami-Catholic-School-Teacher-Says-She-Was-Fired-for-Being-Gay-473634293.htmlI think he would get exposed hard and look like an idiot.Hi everyone, 

I just wanted to say how refreshing this sub is. I like a lot of Dave Rubin's interviews but sometimes the hypocrisy is just a bit much. The recent episode with the Weinstein Bros (who I think are awesome) was the point for me where something just didn't add up, Dave's praise of Trump during that is just baffling to me and didn't seem at all to be what the Weinsteins were saying. 

I was glad to come on here and see that at the very least, I'm not crazy. 

CheersI have been juggling with this idea, college students have been liberal for decades, extremely liberal, but generally people become less liberal over time, grow out of it or become less radical. What is different post 2012 however, is the capturing of all of the most egregious SJW moments and filters that amplify these incidents to an almost hysterical degree.

Then when you have these same incidents of SJWism replayed over and over people with preexisting narratives about the flaws of a generation use these few examples as an almost confirmation bias of their story. 

I mean you ask some random stranger on the street who doesn't crackfiend on the skeptic tube what an SJW is I think they have no clue. This whole machine has built and exploited a story that isn't factually representative of the entire truth and Dave is just sitting at the top of these smear merchants. 

I think what is actually happening is a tiny tiny tiny majority of younger people take it too far, people with preexisting bias against the youth use it to confirm their own narrative, and media even some mainstream focuses on these events to an unhealthy degree. This just seems like standard generational bashing + a weird alt right conservative spin all justified by this hysterical hate of a few wayward 18 year olds. 

What the story should be is that the young actually realize that there is a lot of hate in this country, diversity and human rights are a project that requires continual effort to sustain, and that the backlash to these efforts is just deflecting the attention to SJWs to take the spotlight off the injustice.https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/rights-favorite-new-intellectual-has-some-truly-pitiable-ideas-about-masculinityThe majority of this sub is critical of Dave Rubin and some of his guests. That much is clear by looking at the top posts from recent times. That’s good, we need dissenting opinions in order to have nuanced positions. However, for those so critical of a man who seems (or at the very least claims) to want to give voices to different people, this sub has some pretty low level commentary on why it is that they don’t like him. 

So in the spirit of intellectual discussion, tell me why you’ve become so critical of Dave Rubin. I’ll play devils advocate. Let’s have an actual discussion!Not sure if we want to use the term corrupt, unintelligent, dishonest, or all of the above, but is there a contingency of people that think this man is still genuine and reasonable? Not even trying to start shit, just curious.If you didn't know, Dave is doing "5 shows in 5 days with 5 scholars on 5 different US Presidents" next week. What can we expect?

*"Surely Woodward and Bernstein were activists (not journalists) and Richard Nixon was a victim of the outrage culture?"

*"Isn't the fact that Andrew Jackson - the first Democratic president - was a slave owner just show that the Regressive Left are the REAL racists of America?"

*"Hey, Barack Obama! How about you sit down and debate Blaire White on my show?!"

*"The fact YouTube demonetized my interview entitled 'Defending FDR's Japanese Internment' just shows how SJWs have taken over the internet!"

(I'm joking but this is Dave Rubin - anything is possible!)
Turns out that the professors supplied to Rubin for his Presidents week were supplied by Learn Liberty.

Learn Liberty is a digital content offshoot of the Institute for Humane Studies (IHS). They have received millions in funding from the Charles Koch foundation, the David Koch foundation and Donors Trust (a foundation that claims its purpose is "safeguarding the intent of libertarian and conservative donors")

So it's fair to say we won't get a glowing endorsement of FDR. Is the issue of Dave letting his content be directed by rich and powerful donors intent on keeping and expanding their wealth and power as obvious and as insidious as I think it is? I ask because I think Dave and Joe are actually quite similar. Although I occasionally find his show quite an entertaining listen, I think that Joe Rogan is possibly an even bigger idiot than Mr Rubin. 

I listen to JRE intermittently (only if I like/know of the guest - ain’t nobody got time to listening to some random drone on for three hours). Whereas Dave likes to retread the same ground every show, Rogan’s pet topics (completely unsubstantiated claims about science and wildlife, strange political perspectives, MMA, ‘transgender people are the devil’, hunting, questionable diets etc) are about 1000 times more boring. The fact it’s spread across three hours a go probably makes it worse. 

They also share the habit of agreeing with every single guest - bar a few exceptions in Rogan’s case. Just compare the way Rogan speaks about TYT to Crowder and Rubin compared to the way he actually addresses Uygur, Kasparian and Dore.

Rogan is probably the definition of someone who know a little about a lot and knows a lot about little. Not the sharpest guy and I’m surprised he’s as successful as he is.Learn Liberty is a think tank funded by the Koch brothers. I see a lot of people on this subreddit saying he is a shill for them. I am somewhat skeptical of this because I have never heard the specifics of the connection between The Rubin Report and Learn Liberty. All I've heard is they have a "partnership". What exactly does that mean? What does each side do to benefit one another? All I could observe is that Learn Liberty seems to promote Rubin quite often, and Rubin seems to interview certain people that Learn Liberty suggests, but I couldn't find any specifics about what exactly this "partnership" entails.During Rubin's interview with Bret and Eric Weinstein, one of the mentions TIM, which stand for (unknown), Intelligence, Media. Can someone tell me the unknown? I don't feel like watching the 3 hour interview.https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/968891135526625281In fact, outright anti-seminitism is something even Trump himself engaged in in the course of his public life over the last 30+ years!

https://www.timesofisrael.com/donald-trumps-anti-semitism-controversies-a-timeline/ 

https://www.timesofisrael.com/jon-stewart-blasts-trump-as-anti-semitic/

This is my main problem with them focusing so much on "identity politics" when its glaringly obvious they have an agenda to gaslight the legitimate concerns of people who have real and substantive problems with POTUS45.So what do you guys think of Trump's trade war with Canada, Mexico, and Europe???I've heard hilarious stories of Rubin going off social media for short periods in order to escape having to hold certain people accountable. The one specific occasion I've heard of is when Milo's Drunken Peasants pro-pedophilia audio was going viral. Can anyone tell me any other times Rubin might have done this?Leigh Sales is an Australian TV journalist who hosts the current affairs program 7:30. She's widely known for her combative interview style which she utilises on guests from all across the political spectrum.

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdCC1g2GfPQ) her interviewing former conservative treasurer Joe Hockey, and now [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1D02gct0iU) one she conducted with former centre-left Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Now from what I'm aware Sales is broadly left-leaning herself, and yet as you can tell her ability to challenge her guests is never limited by political allegiance. And while she's tough Sales is also polite and civil.

Here's something very crucial to remember, Sales is HIGHLY respected by both sides of politics for her interviewing style. No-one protests her, no-one accuses her of bias, they just accept that she's the very best at her job.

Why can't Rubin be more like this?

His Larry King style is outdated and inappropriately lax in the case of any of the controversial figures Dave interviews. If he really wanted to imitate the 'greatest interviewer' of all time, he should imitate Leigh Sales.I am actually quite curious. Like was it that AMA or some particular obscure event? (I'm was never a die hard fan as I did like a few videos he made back then but now I think he's boring and just right wing political puppet)Dave is sure to make the distinction, yet the only single disagreement I've seen him have with conservatives is on same-sex marriage.http://www.philly.com/philly/news/donald-trump-political-cartoons-pittsburgh-post-gazette-rob-rogers-20180604.html

The Pittsburgh Post Gazette has refused to publish a series of cartoons critical of President Trump put out by their longtime political cartoonist. You all can look at them above - to me most of these cartoons are fairly mild if anything and within the range of the typical criticism any President would receive.

Of course - as in so many of these cases - the Post Gazette is privately owned and its editors can choose to publish or not publish whatever content they want. However, given the President's threats towards media organizations and pressure on several private companies to silence protests or critical content (NFL, Samantha Bee), these cases are rightfully seen as worrying.

So - do you think Dave Rubin will speak out? Of course not, and if he did he'd (rightfully) point out that the Post Gazette and it's editors can publish or not publish whatever they want. 

The issue is that Rubin over at least the last year has made the core of his show/message about this "free speech crisis" on the left about cases exactly like this - university deplatforming, YouTube demonetization, the firing of James Damore, bans from Twitter, and more. All of these involve institutions who under law can make whatever speech codes or regulations they want. 

https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/1005827872710414337https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/1005975775558930437I think Weinstein is essentially sabotaging the left at this point by siding with right wing lunatics like Jordan Peterson and bigots like Ben Shapiro.

Now any chance of preventing left wing protestors and college administrators from making the mistakes they did at Evergreen, Middlebury or Laurier will likely come at the cost of left-wing intellectualism in general at colleges should the Intellectual Dark Web be influential.

After all if Jordan Peterson has his way we'll be getting rid of any left-leaning courses like this:

&gt;["Women's studies, and all the ethnic studies and racial studies groups, man, those things have to go and the faster they go the better," he said. "It would have been better if they had never been part of the university to begin with as far as I can tell. Sociology, that's corrupt. Anthropology, that's corrupt. English literature, that's corrupt. Maybe the worse offenders are the faculties of education."](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.4396970/u-of-t-profs-alarmed-by-jordan-peterson-s-plan-to-target-classes-he-calls-indoctrination-cults-1.4396974)

Over at /r/EnoughPetersonSpam we've had multiple teachers and lecturers tell them that because of Jordan Peterson they aren't going to engage with any postmodern or feminist literature.

Is this really what Weinstein wants?

If he really wanted to make the improvements he wanted here's what he should've done.

1. Not instantly alienating yourself from the mainstream left by allying with the Sam Harris/Dave Rubin crowd.

2. Making your points about the flaws with the left WITHIN the left by talking with figures and media on our side.

3. Be constructive and not hysterical. People like Jon Stewart get away with criticising their own side all the time, so I'm sure if Weinstein was polite about it he could've easily made people on the left see his points.

4. Don't embarrass the human race with /r/Im14andthisisdeep levels of pretentiousness by labelling anything 'The Intellectual Dark Web'.

It's a huge shame Weinstein has thrown this opportunity to constructively fix a flaw in the left like this, but I think I know why.

Think about the choice of the name 'Intellectual Dark Web', think of the fact he's made the main platform for his movement podcast appearances and interviews on web shows. Weinstein just loves the spotlight. He wants to seem like some counterculture hero just like Peterson has become. 

Unfortunately the price of him getting this attention he obviously wants is the potential underminding of critical thinking in universities and the replacement of it with Jordan Peterson/Dennis Prager style 'the west is great' propoganda.

I'm really getting fucking sick of this guy.

Edit: Apparently it was Eric Weinstein who coined the name 'Intellectual Dark Web', so disregard my blaming of Bret there specifically.https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/1006292218074804225Also he platforms the alt right and is a joke of an interviewer.

Also he says he's for single payer healthcare but also says he likes libertarian economicsso you know those shitty "JORDAN PETERSON FUCKING DESTROYS LIBRULLL" video channels? They are now putting Rubin in as one of their "destroying the left" members. The one that wont stop showing up in my fucking youtube feed is from some guy named Liberty Hound.

Does anyone else find that kind of telling?https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/koch-brothers-father-helped-build-major-nazi-oil-refinery-1.5389749
(For the record there is racism on the left but he acts as if it's only on the left)What a shit show of a sub.This was an astoundingly stupid comment to make &amp; I’m disturbed how Sam Harris is quick to call bad faith &amp; dishonesty on others but then makes insanely hyperbolic &amp; over the top equivalences. I am afraid that as time goes on, a lot of Rubin is rubbing off on him. I’ll post the link below.

https://mobile.twitter.com/aiizavva/status/1007622441487695873

And lest someone cries “out of context” or “misrepresentation” - I’ll also post a link to his entire interview with Dave Rubin.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gFio_8aUS4I

Is Sam Harris becoming a more intellectual version of Dave Rubin?Just anecdotally I see a lot of comments and top comments on other Rubin clips like his Oxford speech that seem to call out his incredibly shallow and repetitive narrative.Your token gay is literally an edgy 15 year old who read just read Ayn Rand for the first time. I get why conservicunts like him, but can his more liberal fans explain the appeal?Hey all, I listen to a lot of Youtube talk-shows about politics and things and I've been interested in new conservative thinkers lately. 

Jordan Peterson is good but tends to be arcane and require full attention. + He has this kind of cult leader vibe like he's gonna create a new religion or something.

Ben Shapiro I've explored less of but from what I gather he tends to get on "debates" with Liberals and counter the same arguments all the time which is God's honest work and all but it's honestly pretty boring to me at this point. Plus his voice is kind of grating sometimes (even though I sound exactly the same lmao).

Stephan Molyneux is good in that kind of "I don't agree with what you're saying but goddamn is it interesting" kind of way. I like how he talks about history and culture in his speeches but he probably over-relies on cultural and religious explanations for things. Plus he gives off the impression he would be ok with another crusade. Which is, again, interesting to listen to but undermines his credibility a bit.

Sargon of Akkad has kind of devolved into a spectacle show featuring the most absurd activities that SJWs are up to. They generally aren't very theory-rich.

I thought that Dave Rubin was finally the one that I could get into. He seems like a decent guy that's genuinely into the issues and open-minded. However, he doesn't really offer that much substance himself. He's a great platform for the other folks and it's nice to have an interviewer that actually lets other people talk...But I don't think I've really learned anything from him from what I've seen so far.

Are there any other genuinely good classically liberal, libertarian, or conservative youtube personalities/channels out there? Thanks y'all.I was trying to watch the [Oxford Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJyFDdBu6UE) talk and made it until this gem of insight from the "big ideas" guy.

Asked why the "regressive left" is his primary antagonist, Rubin pondered:

"What I realized was they weren’t progressive they were actually regressive because identity politics which really is the key to this whole thing and I think everything that’s sort of wrong with modern discourse and that we should judge people on their immutable characteristics and that your sexuality should matter more than your thoughts or that the color of your skin I mean I can look at you guys and there’s different people of different shades and I’m sure there’s different sexualities here and obviously genders think how patently absurd and actually truly prejudicial, because prejudice is to prejudge, it would be if I was to think that I know what you should think because of the way you look or the way you were born or some other immutable characteristic. It is the antithesis of every reason that you guys are at such an incredible school here. Look at these books around here! It’s about learning but it doesn’t say you’re supposed to learn this if you’re black and you’re supposed to learn this if you’re gay and this if you’re Muslim and this if you’re Christian. It’s absurd. And yet somehow this line of thinking has infected virtually all of the modern left.

Thought I should share this great analysis. Reminds me a bit of [this other iconic speaker of words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDQDDhLZO-4).I was listening to medved around 12:30 pacific time to check in and see what the conservative peanut gallery was saying, and heard Michael say he was going to bring Dave Rubin on who was in the same building (visiting Seattle for "comedy").

Dave said he was pulled in by Michael while digging in the trash (... is Dave turning into a Raccoon now?).  The general topic was the immigration blowups.  I could not stay to listen to the entire rest of the hour, just heard Dave say, upon being brought on air that he was happy to talk about anything but immigration (clearly we were right Dave wanted to dodge the topic).  They ended up talking about it anyway, the first thing Dave brought of was obvious.  He was dismayed at the rhetoric of comparing the prison camps to nazis.  I knew this is the shit that he'd go to from the start before he uttered a word, he would not express open animus towards the right wing policy his deplorable viewer are fine with (ripping children from their parents), that would cast a negative shadow on daddy Trump and he has to always supplicate himself before his audience.

After that, I have no idea what was discussed in the middle, I came back on the tail end where it sounded like they were talking about moderate mccain style compromises on immigration policy.  

Here is medveds site.

[http://www.michaelmedved.com/](http://www.michaelmedved.com/)

He live streams his show on that site.  Unless you want to pay for his back catalog, the only way to hear this interview for free is to listen life after the show ends today at 3pm pacific time.  It plays on a loop until the next day.

So since Rubin came on at around 12:30 pacific time, to catch him on the loop you will need to start the stream around 3:30 pm pacific, 6:30pm pacific, etc[House GOP Unveils $5.4 Trillion Attack on Nation’s Safety Net](https://truthout.org/articles/after-tax-cuts-for-richest-house-gop-unveils-5-4-trillion-attack-on-nations-safety-net/)

I know this isnt as big of a issue ruining this country like "free speech on college campuses" and Trump is kind of a moderate authoritarian and that's nothing to worry about but isnt this going a little far? /s

On a serious note after seeing him on Rogan, I was convinced that kind of crazy ideology would just be laughed out the door, i didnt know it was literally governing this country. this is sick and im wondering if we'll finally get Dave and others like him(Shapiro, Kirk...ect) to critique the right and stand against this administration.

if not we'll get local services stripped, deregulated, and we'll be depending on yelp reviews &amp; patreon to fund building roadshttps://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/06/15/trump-trophy-case/SkM738gWSd9ncwKo7cuo9M/story.html

The Boston Globe recently published a clear, concise and largely unbiased list of "Trump's trophy case" - a list of his policy achievements. The list is pretty long and very substantial - it includes the new tax law, cutting environmental protection, financial deregulation, eroding the Affordable Care Act, advancing social conservatism, cutting welfare programs, shaping the judiciary, cracking down on immigration, shaking up foreign policy, changing trade policy, and more. It's really worth reading the article above because it gives a pretty comprehensive list.

My question is - since it's become clear that Rubin is at the very least a mild supporter of Trump at this point - how much do you think he actually agrees with? Based on his recent statements, he probably would claim to agree with the general shrinking of govenment, but it's also worth noting that at least half of that agenda (social conservatism, building up the military, expanding prisons, cracking down on drug use) is explicitly against what Rubin often claims to stand for. Why do you think we only hear about half of it (I don't have to answer that question).

Also - to the extent to which the so-called "IDW" is an apologist for Trump's policies (some like Rubin are, to be fair others like Sam Harris not so much, although in general they rarely criticize Trump for his policies), I think it's important to note that the thrust of Trump and the GOP's agenda really is:

1. Extreme social conservatism,

2. White identity politics (which is actually by far the most powerful form of IDpol, yet is rarely criticized by the "IDW"), 

3. Massively cutting the public sphere through huge tax cuts that only benefit the wealthy, and 

4. Massive expansion of the military budget/war machine. 

For those of you who love to rail against "the left" and "SJWs", yet still like to call yourselves liberal or even "classical liberals", is the criticism of this group which may come from the Trump admin really worth these policies, many of which are in open conflict with your stated goals?
**The short version** 

There are a number of billionaires and multi-millionaires that fund extreme libertarian politicians and cultural figures with the sole goal of creating conversions at the voting booth that reflect their ambitions. They do this as a catalyst for two things and they are massive tax cuts for the rich and an extreme deregulation of the economy that will have disastrous effects for everyone except the rich.  
 
One example is David Koch.  He ran as vice president for the Libertarian ticket in 1980 and garnered only a fraction of a percent of a vote. He has been playing the long-game to promote his extreme positions ever since and has slowly amassed a very strong influence on the entire republican party. 
 
 
Some of his ideological funding is invested in charismatic figures with the intent of changing culture over the long term. Dave Rubin is a great example. These investments need to be upbeat, likable, create enough controversy to facilitate engagement and to ultimately normalize destructive policies through a form of simple likable asynchronous social skills and associations. "I like Dave Rubin and he is a good happy successful guy, I will vote for the republican candidate because they are like him - the good guys!". As Rubin continues to do interviews it is apparent he is shoe-horning these views into his interviews because he knows it is expected of him if he wants to continue to receive funding.   
 
This phenomena is exemplified by another paid ideologue - Milo Yiannopoulos.  Early videos of Milo are online and he is not nearly as animated prior to his funding by billionaire Robert Mercer (and the related business connections that followed). As time went by Milo became gradually more sensationalist and over-the-top. After Mercer stopped funding him he slowly faded from the public light. Now that his most recent billionaire sponsor died off he has fallen off the media sphere almost completely with his most recent appearance being as a guest on the Alex Jones show. 
 
This has become the pattern of the extreme libertarian and now normalized republican right - to fund likable personalities that promote extreme libertarian ideas with the long game of conversions at the polls. It's pure *sales*. The goal is to bind upbeat likable personalities with destructive political associations that on their own merit the public (generally) find reprehensible. 

The one confusing part of all of this is something the Milo/Mercer phenomena has made apparent - it can work!

There is no doubt in my mind (Maybe I am worng) that without Mercer/Milo/Bannon Trump would have lost the election.
He did not get the popular vote.

 
As it stands Rubin is just a transparently obvious incarnation of the same pattern and others expressing similar behavior include Candace Ownens, Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro etc. They are not all funded by the Koch brothers but it is the same pattern and in my opinion understanding this is more important that debating how smart or stupid these sales people are as individuals.
 I come to subreddits for people I hate and I think Rubin is a POS I hate him he's sooooo dumb i have no friends and i spend my saturdays discussing why this guys sucks god he's so stupid not me im smart tho amirite?I've mostly been a fan of Rubin up until now, mainly because I'm fairly right-leaning myself, so his shift toward libertarianism and Trumpism didn't bother me. (I even wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/daverubin/comments/7cyeo1/my_analysis_of_this_sub_as_a_fan_of_dave_rubin/) on this sub defending him). But my goodness, his latest appearance on Rogan's show was an absolute trainwreck. Between the obvious factual errors (not knowing when Obama was a senator) to laughably simplistic libertarian arguments (Snapchat will replace regulations) and just generally outlandish statements (Candace Owens is more influential than Kanye), I too was wondering if Rubin was high.

But more importantly, I am starting to see why this sub is so frustrated with him. The guy is obviously a full-blown right-winger at this point, but he continues to throw out meek jabs at Trump and "I smoke marijuana" to claim he's still a "classical liberal". Then there's his ignorance and backpedaling on just about any issue that he's pressed on (the construction regulations segment was particularly awful). And his parroting of the Ayn Rand talking points with only a superficial understanding of them. And citing Twitter trolls as the biggest obstacle to political discourse.

I've never been this quickly frustrated by someone who I probably agree with on 90&amp;#37; of issues. I do still believe the guy is genuine and I don't buy into any of the Koch conspiracies this sub likes to parrot. But the combination of intellectual dishonesty and factual ignorance that Rubin so blatantly demonstrated on this podcast is really turning me away from him. He really needs to get his shit together if he wants to maintain an audience not solely comprised of 14 year olds discovering libertarianism for the first time.

The article essentially asks the question to what extent should public universities be required to spend millions of dollars on security to defend people who are exploiting the liberal ideal of free speech. People like Milo do not genuinely care about contributing to free speech or reasoned debate can this form of the 1st amendment be edited to comply with the 21st century?My best guess: something along the lines of the "Left" wants to control how we all think. Decent chance he's goes low in some fashion.

Fuck you.Ana is very career minded, and it's clear to me that she is the most ambitious to get ahead and become more successful more than anybody at TYT. Thats admirable of her. she's an inspiration to me because of that.. so on a personal level, and putting aside politics, when Ana sees Dave Rubin, someone who was close friends with her, and someone who was at her level at one point.. when she sees him being way way way more successful than herself.. hosting a big channel with huge viewership.. hosting sold out shows with a very relevant intellectual.. it gets under her skin.. it's only human.. we've all been there.. it makes her hate him even more than she should. specially when Ana has been doing the same show for years now. still on the second hour and (not even the first)...  and it seems like there hasn't been any promotions.. and essentially doing the same thing when Dave left.. mostly reading news from other sites, and then commenting on it. shes not setting the tone of any conversation, and she is not as relevant as she wants to be at this point in her life.. That must be just painful on her part I bet. now I dont personally like Dave Rubin.. i think he is an opportunist, and not very well read on the issues, hardly an intellectual..  but i can't deny the level of success he's had ever since he quit TYT, and the level of impact hes had on the on-going conversation.. and i think that just creates a lot of animosity and jealousy against him from TYT people (specially ANA) regardless of his politics..

In case you didn't know, Dave is a big proponent of civility. Civility and forming cross-political alliances has become the cornerstone of the IDW. Dave of course, leads by example. Here are some of the best moments of the Last Liberal™ exemplifying civility and respect for political opponents.

Now i know what some of you are thinking. It's Twitter! He's a comedian! You're not meant to take all these things at face value! 

Here's an abridged list of people Rubin has either explicitly praised, defended or simply refused to call out a long the same lines as some of the above tweets.

- Donald Drumpf
- Mike Pence
- Glenn Beck 
- Charles Krauthammer 
- John Bolton
- Dinesh D'Souza 

So glad Dave Rubin is out there, heroically leading the way towards the Age of Civility™. I've always understood civility as meaning being a condescending arsehole to people who dare disagree with his Classical Liberal™ ways but blithely ignoring or outright praising ultra-conservative, white-nationalist partisan hacks so its good to see Rubin is upholding it. Did i mention he's married to a dude btw?Full disclosure I just subscribed, very new to this sub. I was a big fan of the Rubin report, and I still subscribe to the podcast, until I figured out other people do the interview format much better. 

I see Dave’s name get thrown around sometimes in the “intellectual dark web” stuff and I’m not sure why. His only role is giving a platform to smarter and more interesting people. It doesn’t seem like he has much to offer to a conversation.Dave Rubin's show exists only to provide platforms for nonsensical right-wing pundits to spew their nonsense with absolutely no challenge. Of course, this is done under the juvenille guise of "free and open discussion." This is entirely disingenuous. Robust debate under the first amendment is much different than sitting quietly as Milo Yiannopolous shoots off anti-semitic verbiage at the mouth. I don't think I've ever seen Dave truly challenge a guest in my life. More clearly evincing his lack of knowledge in terms of policy-specificity are his appearance on other shows, such as his most recent one on the Joe Rogan Experience. Joe absolutely takes to task and mops the floor with his anarcho-capitalistic anti-regulation rhetoric because he cites no evidence for his claims and just speaks in poofy idealisms. His funding from the Koch brothers and other right-wing orgs is clearly disconcerting but more importantly is that Dave is being hailed as an intellectual heavyweight when he really has no original or nuanced ideas. This is my opinion, I'd like to hear your thoughts."Free speech" is Dave Rubin's entire shtick. It's his #1 issue.

[Here is Dave's Tweet a few days ago about Maxine Waters.](https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1011269382981365760) But when right-wing figures explicitly advocate for violence against journalists, of course Dave says absolutely nothing. Vintage Dave Rubin.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li2J4GxZ6iM#t=37m50s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li2J4GxZ6iM#t=37m50s)

It was fun for me because as Eric made the point about the benefits of maintaining the tool of dunking on people who are acting in bad faith you could see on Dave Rubins face that he MUST have been thinking about Ana dunking on him for acting in bad faith.I just listened to Rubin's [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYf6dD4N86E&amp;t=128s) with Steven Pinker, liked it, and thought I would check out the discussion on reddit. Can anyone tell me how r/DaveRubin came to be mostly criticism of his work (judging by r/top of the past year) when the side-bar goes to lengths to be "both sides". I don't know much of his work and don't have a dog in the fight. Just thought it would be an interesting history of how public figures and their communities change.Or both?
I'm honestly curious, is he just not that bright or is he willfully being a moron just because it makes him money?I'm looking for a specific episode of the rupbin repor i saw before but forgot to save

it was dave speaking to a genetics expert (nobel prize winner?, i know the nobel prize was mentioned) and they spoke on the subject of genetics and race and how you can't study such things on college campusesI put off viewing this one yesterday because I had already reached my peak bullshit meter for the day for right wing messaging, and just hearing the guy was associated with "learn liberty" pushed me over the edge.


But today is a new day, my bullshit meter was reset and so I listened to the first part.

He's a devotee of Ayn Rand.  Strike one.  But later on there is a VERY interesting section that got a lot of the conservative Rubin audience extremely butt hurt in the comments section.  An angle of what I consider truth.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvINUQUpbRI#t=20m21s

skip to 20m21s if it does not track to the proper section.

Before that, the guy was generally batshit crazy insane, like most anarchists, but this section was both interesting and something I've been thinking about for awhile now.

The left and liberals in general are better at creating culture.  It's part of the reason why I reflexively recoil when steven crowder types or Shapiro types go into a bitch fest about all those lefty liberals in hollywood pushing their agenda, or even all those liberals in academia.  I always think to myself, why the F*CK do you think those areas are so full of LIBERAL people?  Maybe they are just better at that shit than you conservatives are in general!

I am reminded by this chart of professions by political party.

http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_professions/


The left and liberalism more broadly is more associated with new ideas, diversity of people and cultures and practices, being more open to new things, etc. etc.

And conservatism?  More associated with upholding tradition, family, being conscientious, respecting authority.

What mixture of attributes, accepting that liberals AND conservatives have mixes of all of those, but realizing that liberals and conservatives tend to have more or less of those traits, what mixture seems MOST likely to make one more successful in the creative field?   The liberal stack?  Or the conservative one?


Also of not, most of the really well to do conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro or Dave Rubin (yes, conservative since he's a libertarian), Dennis Prager, Larry Elder, Michael Medved, they ALL live in LIBERAL states in big LIBERAL cities or VERY close by.  They sure as hell are not living the rural life.  They don't live in Alabama or Mississippi.


They like to bitch and moan about how AWFUL liberals are and how terrible our policies are and what destructive societies we create, but when it comes time to choose a place to live, they LOVE coming to the house that LIBERALS built and maintain.

Rubin seemed taken aback at this critique of conservatism, even in such a small sphere like culture.  It was obvious he was not expecting it and even felt a need to defend his conservative brethren that support him so much.  He constantly goes on about being a classical liberal, and complains about how liberal doesn't mean what it used to. Has he reached the point where he's just admitted to being conservative yet? 
What it means to be liberal hasn't changed. The left may have moved further left, but liberalism hasn't changed in meaning. 
The people/ideas, with which Rubin has a problem - radical feminists, cultural feminists, race theorists, Marxists, etc - aren't claiming to be liberals, not unless they're confused. In fact academics in such fields would freely admit that their work is a critic on liberalism. 
Rubin goes on about how these so called liberals want to change liberalism, and well, yes. First of all they wouldn't call themselves liberals, but yes that's their motive they want a different system, they feel liberalism is flawed and are wanting to implement something else. I feel like Rubin is failing to grasp this, and in so doing falling more deeply in love with conservatism, it's not the answer. The answer to these radical ideologies, is not conservatism it's holding onto and defending liberalism, for it is liberalism which is being targeted. I'm gonna give it a try from Friday till Tuesday but I literally cannot remember what I did before the internet and my phone. Does he just lie in bed or what? Am I allowed to watch downloaded videos? I wish I was kidding but I'm honestly kind of clueless about what to do without these things. Hey everyone! I'm looking for a bit of help with a project I'm doing. Dave himself identifies as a classical liberal, and he's had guests on the show like Glenn Beck who identify as classical liberals as well. It seems to me like most classical liberals are just a few steps away from becoming libertarians. 
Can you guys help me figure out some other public figures who identify as Classical Liberals?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyOcuSjj-hIHas anyone thought of putting a list together of the issues relating to bias on the show? I know a lot of things have been pointed out, but a lot of things are being missed reliably. 

I think if we put a list of issues together it'd be useful in improving the show and getting people to appraise it properly. 


Here's an example of what's being missed:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=agb3dAIPZBw

It's a really big platform, so I think it's more useful to improve it than try to destroy it.  Maybe I'm in the minority...Here is his reaction to the Manafort et al indictment:

Need more evidence? Type just type "Dave Rubin Democrats" and "Dave Rubin Republicans" in succession and compare how many times Rubin has been negative about the Democrats to how many times he has been negative about the GOP. In 2014 Roy Moore came out against gay marriage stating "I guess we can marry two women. I guess we can marry a horse. Where does it go? In France or Germany a person married a bridge"

Dave is always saying how he picks on the "regressive left" because it's a greater threat to liberalism but what about Moore's comments? Moore's comments definitely transgress freedom of marriage extended to homosexual couples and he is definitely in a good position to win the Alabama Senate election. As attorney general Moore twice defied the law. Why hasn't Dave come out and condemned Moore while condemning Democrat gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam's campaign?Hello /r/DaveRubin,

I've recently started listening to the Rubin Report podcast on the regular, after finding the interview with Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek Finance Minister during the financial crisis.

I've noticed "This Week On The Rubin Report" hasn't been updated in 6 months and ChannelBot isn't working anymore.

I'm interested in moderating so these features could be fixed, allowing for organized discussion on each of the new episodes.

Let me know what you all think, and if you have any thoughts on how things should be done.

Thanks,
EKSUrubin says he interviews controversial people but he doesnt share their views, meanwhile he labels them the new center and defends them and their ideas.Piece here: https://medium.com/@adrian_nguyen/the-sad-change-of-dave-rubin-1190dbddd54a

TL;DR - I'm a conservative, who share many of Dave Rubin's evolved views on the Left, and I found him utterly underwhelming, in terms of his ability to hold a conversation, his selection of guests and the issues he choose to talk about (social justice everywhere, free speech, classical liberalism). But Rubin was the person who I was really interested in because from the show's beginnings, I was politically lost and had lost faith in the Left in standing up to the beliefs that I stand and a preppy, confident man, holding a lot of common ground, promised a show that had warranted an intellectually stimulating discussion.I'm more confused than anything else by this sub. Not that a large group of people would dedicate time to hate-watching something – that's to be expected for the Internet. I'm confused about why you all hate Dave Rubin so much.

I think most of the points I see can be paraphrased as one of the following three arguments. Here's my response to all of them.

&gt; Rubin is no longer a liberal. Most of the policies he supports and most of the guests he interviews lean heavily right-wing.

I totally agree. But why is this a bad thing? Because he continues to say he's a liberal? Okay, I guess it's kind of annoying that he refuses to acknowledge a shift in his own political views. But beyond that, I don't see what the complaint is here. If you used to like him back when he leaned left and now you don't like him, then fine. But why do you feel the need to personally attack the guy for changing his politics?

&gt; Rubin obsesses over free speech / crazy leftists but refuses to talk about Trump / crazy right-wingers.

Again, I agree, but this is the natural result of someone who leans more right-wing now.

&gt; Rubin doesn't do enough research before interviewing guests and doesn't push back enough against outlandish statements.

Once again I agree, but this is just who he is as an interviewer. He likes to talk about ideas rather than facts, and he's not confrontational enough to push back.

Curious to see whether I'll get a civil response to this or just downvoted and told I'm a right-wing shill.Pardon my French, but Dave Rubin is full of shit. Net Neutrality is supposedly right up his alley- it deals with freedom of speech in a manner, government intervention and oversight and it will directly affect his livelihood. But of course he won't utter a word: because he's a Trump shill who will never criticize him, and because he's a shallow, superficial dimwit that doesn't understand the first thing about actual policy issues. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=isZgwHe-3I0

This was the video that really woke me up to how vacuous Rubin Report is.  Before this one, I had noticed how little research Rubin did, how empty and repetitive his talking points were, and how little he actually contributed to the “battle of ideas,” but at least some of his guests were interesting.  The sheer dullness of this video ironically woke me up and made me realize the fast-food like nature of Rubin’s anti-SJW shtick.Title says it alland if so links to the interviews plzWe all know how Rubin takes good care to choose nuanced and fair-minded individuals.  Based on that, I think we'll see the profound intellects of:

-Ted Nugent

-Ben Garrison

-Michelle Malkin

-David Icke

-Kid Rock

-Tomi Lahren

-Michael Savage

And for the season finale:

-A Wyatt Mannhttps://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/lawsuit-goes-after-alleged-anti-conservative-bias-at-google/

Right wing Victim champion James Damore is suing google, or rather some conservative outfit is doing so on his behalf, and that of another fired conservative.

I distinctly remember conservatives like Prager and others saying that employers ought to be able to fire whoever they choose for just about any reason, some even include racial reasons and invoke the market as a social sanction against such occurrences.  Of course, not that that hits people with conservative views, the ire rises, not them, it's only ok when others get tossed, not us.

But now that Damore has chosen to file suit, he is once against taking the mantle of right wing victim whore, red meat for Dave Rubins show.  The only way he won't appear again, is if he wants to stay away from media while the lawsuit is going on.

And for the record, I do not think Damore should have been fired, but if the people working at google had that much of a problem with him, I think they should be able to fire him.Amazing how youtubers in the skeptic community who give intellectual cover fire for alt righters think they are centrists. For example, Dave, Roaming millennial, and Lauren Southern to name a few this just goes to show you how genuinely right wing youtube has become. 

If you had told me people who want ethnostates would be considered centrists 5 years ago I wouldn't have believed you but here we are......So Pakman had Rubin on his show a while back, and I recall Rubin saying something about returning the favor sometime. Would be unironically a big win for the marketplace of ideas to have a progressive on the show to balance all the right-wing guests we've seen as of late. Sargon is suddenly having to reckon with the fact that he has gotten in bed with racist alt right slime. His liberalist movement advcates all of the same BS alt right pseudo science regarding race, but he changes the wording of the normative claims and conclusions based on the same faulty pseudo scientific consensus. Sargon, " Sure black people are genetically born with lower IQs but nooooo we mustn be actual racists in favor of an ethnostate".

This movement has gone so far right that there literally is no more space for them to move right. It is pathetic.Their grandkids ask! "Grandad what did you during the Trump era where there was an unprecedented attack on the free press, racial minorities, and liberal democratic governance in America?"

Rubin and Sargon answer heroically, "I protected this country from the obvious threat .... fringe 18 year olds at Berklee in SJW pwnage videos and puff piece interviews... looking back I did my service to this country I fought the real communist threat and would never have done anything different."

......Their grandkids fawn and smile with child-like admiration as they salute the coronation of the third chancellor of a new more sinister America............ I am wondering if it would be a good idea to start a campaign to increase online criticism towards Rubin. Looking at TYT, they seem to now be somewhat of a laughing stock across the internet. They are constantly trolled and mocked (sometimes fairly, often not so). 

I think Rubin is far more deserving of such an outcome. I initially thought he was just kind of a dumb guy, but I now am convinced that we are dealing with a bad actor. Someone who is completely gutless and disingenuous. 

The campaign would basically consist of crowdfunding dislikes for Rubin's videos, organizing concerted trolling efforts in Rubin's comment sections, these types of things. It would really be a grassroots movement that I think would benefit the marketplace of ideas in the long run. 

Let me know what you guys think about this. Are they generally of the same mind as many of the posters here? Disillusioned with how Dave Rubin has developed?  Are they still supportive of Rubin generally and horrified about how much the sub has turned on him?

Have they mostly abandoned ship?  I've been blocked for six months. Anyone else?

TBF, Mr. Rubin hasn't discussed battling ideas or argued that he is on The Left™ anymore. He also has given up on any pretense for an honest discussion with anyone who isn't affiliated with the right. https://www.ticketfly.com/event/1616634

The Basic White Liberal Comedy Show

His glorious return to standup. This "comedy show" is going to be a trainwreck of epic proportions. I'm expecting a disaster on the level of his AMA. 

I'm honestly afraid that Mr. Rube has been punked. So I really love the [Bea Aruthur](https://youtu.be/nkcBnCwN1-8?t=3) that is behind Rubin's left shoulder, it has a purple background. I've used all of my known google-fu but still can't seem to find it. 

Thanks for any help!Guests just sit there chatting shit and he's just laughing along saying yes, doesn't bother challenging anything, like this is just insufferable who the fuck watches this?

Best example is Ben Shapiro going on about trans issues and he's just making up shit as he goes along and Rubin is just saying a vague yeah to everything.

I mean people give TYT shit but I don't even know what's worse at this point, milquetoast doesn't even cut it.A prime example of this is David Smalley, I assume David is just a left leaning atheist but he goes on his show and really feeds into Rubin's narrative almost as if he agrees with him on more than just SJWS. 

I guess my question is how do people like Larry King and Lawrence Krauss not see through this stuff if we peons do? OR do you think a certain portion of his audience that we assumed are on the left actually agree with him. 

I think this experience has shown me that SJWs actually have a point with some of these people. For example, Sargon is probably some sort of racist enabler, and Smalley defended his comments regarding rape. It is almost like the one area where people turn of their brains is in this intellectual area all in service of deleting the low hanging fruit that are "sjws" on college campuses, never mind actual campus injustice. I stopped watching TYT around early 2016 so have no idea.How he and his fans actually believe this is hilarious 
https://twitter.com/thebrandonmorse/status/954459806512934914Does anyone have any informative resources to recommend that cover the link between capitalism and the moral decay of a society? 

I think this is an interesting topic. It is inherently difficult to identify a relationship between a society's morals and its economic system, but I believe this link is not to be ignored in policy discourse. 

My knowledge of this topic is largely formed by anecdotes. Like I have heard the talking point that Cuba has more genuine people, but have nothing to substantiate that claim. 

To be clear, I am interested in how economic policy may impact the morals of individuals within a society, and by this means, the morals of the society as a whole. I am not interested in the question of what is generally more moral/ethical, capitalism or socialism. These are distinct matters. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9d6HcXbw6w

The downside, is that will almost certainly get only a tiny fraction of the views of the original, and conservatives will not want to hear it, but I always like seeing the lies and misrepresentations of the right and Prager especially taken to task.

This is the kind of person and outfit Dave Rubin associates with, an open font of misrepresentations.  But that's not surprising, Dave seems like he wants to learn from a master on the right how to be disingenuous. 

But again, I enjoyed the video, it won't be enough and we need more, but I still consider it a light in the darkness against the misrepresentations of the right.Okay, this is something I've been going back and forth on for awhile now. Is Dave just really corrupt/lack a backbone or is he just unaware?

We've named dozens of examples of Dave using wildly different standards for left/right. As examples, he always bashes CNN yet appears on InfoWars and talks fondly of their work. He talks about freedom of speech yet he praises to Mike Cernovich, who is obviously no champion of it. He laughs when Obama is called a communist but if you call Trump a racist he throws a hissy fit. Lastly, he gets mad when people generalize the right, yet he thinks leftism is a mental disorder.

So what do you think? Is Dave aware of how flawed his logic is and he continues because of his Koch money and patreon donors? Or is he just too unaware and in the rabbit hole to realize?

This isn't an "own" post or trying to be snarky. I'm just genuinely curious what people think.This is relevant given Dave has been promoting the hash tag 'release the memo'. I don't have any concern if Dave has switched politics but this act is becoming very disingenuous and cynical.She absolutely nails the issues with the skeptosphere and does it with an artistic flourish and sense of timing that other youtubers wholly lack the ability to produce. 

Her debating the Right video nails the issues with Rubin and skeptosphere. It really puts into perspective just how far right these "centrists" lke Rubin have actually gone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPa1wikTd5c&amp;t=610sRubin is currently live streaming to celebrate 600k subscribers. During the stream he said something unintentionally funny that arguably speaks to his lack of self-awareness.

He was talking about his decision to go back into comedy and a recent set he performed, and said something along the lines of:

"I mean, I absolutely crushed. The crowd loved it. I said, 'OK, I'm about done here', and the crowd suddenly started applauding to get me to stay!"

I'm aware that it may have been a crowd of Rubin's fans and they probably legitimately wanted him to stay. I just found it funny that he interpreted an audience applauding his exit as them pleading for him to stay.
Once  I get muh camera I am gonna make some videos maybe 2 a month. I am a law student so I want to tackle these issues from a legal perspective. 

First video will be about free speech and why the alt right and alt-light people are wrong highlighting the GOP attack on free speech and the case law behind free jurisprudence!

What do you guys think?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrqVRlaqXU4

I only recognize two of those people from Rubins show, Mike Cernovich and Stefan Molyneux, but what a team!

The new center has arrived.  Classical Liberals unite.Has Dave Rubin reached the point were people have figured out his Schick and have realized he's a bad actor. Does anyone talk well of him other than conservatives?Anytime someone criticizes one of his friends he's all "Be a man. Come on my show and say it to their face. You won't cuz you're a weak little snowflake. I knew it." 
https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/956979428235517952Let me know how you feel about the sub-genre as a whole. I think it has its place but is bound to fizzle pretty quickly. Still, some of the songs from the genre are just extraordinarily catchy. Would be interesting to hear some other perspectives. 

Dave Rubin fucking sucks. Rubin and all the other alt-lighters have done a fantastic job of using a single wedge issue to convert a whole generation of 15-25 year olds into flaming dick bags.

I almost fell for all this about 3 years ago, because there genuinely was a leftward focused need to fix certain progressives like Affleck, but I saw these same tricks being used over and over again to sell a narrative that was distorted. 

Back in 2015 at the beginning of the end of the New Atheist craze it was hard not to believe the narrative everyone was pushing, " MOst of the left is regressive on ISlam" we heard this so often when people like Rubin came along that people were just tricked into being right wingers at the cost of a single issue. I mean we are literally at the point where Rubin, Sargon, and Warski are carrying water for white supremacists and the normies like David Smalley and Shermer will continue to go on their shows and validate their narrative.

It almost makes me agree with those "regressives" who warned us against this new movement in the beginning that it would lead to bigotry. Well it certainly did, people lack the nuance to criticize and issue without hating it on the internet. They have really done a masterful job stealing thousands of minds.I am hoping Michael Schellenberger has not gone off the deep end against the left in general (I'm sure Rubin won't be able to help himself in steering him to shit on the left at least a little), but I've found older talks by him completely engaging to listen to.


He is one of the founders of the breakthrough institute which had alternative focuses in the environmental movement.  He is supportive of nuclear power as an example as a better alternative to baseload power via coal.  He was not opposed to solar and wind but did not think those could scale fast enough to the need before we would have too many problems related to climate change.

I know he's running for governor now, and I'm sure that will provide ample opportunity for Rubin to try to drive those wedges between him and some of his own arguments between others on the left. But he is still interesting to listen to.  

And I basically agree with him, I do not think we will be able to conserve our way out of the problem, we need to switch our energy sources to cleaner versions.  Nuclear, solar, wind, natural gas as a transition, and dropping coal plants as fast as we are able.  Focus more on technological breakthroughs, Battery progress will do more to clean up and accelerate the switch to electric cars than merely raising gas taxes alone to discourage consumption.  And at the end of the day, we WANT more of the world to consume more energy because we do not want billions of people to stay in some gutter level existence.  The trick is not to live like cavemen, it's to find a way to live like jetsons while still being cleaner than we were even with fewer people.  That is the gist of this guy, so I am hoping Dave will just let him speak and have more of the conversation steered towards that direction...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbWVfxRG8zA


EDIT:  BTW, Michael is NOT like that Alex Epstein guy who is like fossil fuels are GREAT and we should burn MORE COAL !!!!!!!!  He is far more reasonable than that, and not indifferent to pollution like Alex is.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZXUR4z2P9wI have my research done for this video about free speech behind the law thing mostly but have no idea how to make videos and I wanna take my time and make it pretty just as a point of pride.

Any tips?Tomi Lahren got shredded on their. Rubin will finally be exposed on national television.Dave has taken off a lot of time from the show to write a book.  Where is it?Taking bets now... How will Dave spin the firing as a huge win in the battle of ideas?Dave gushed over Trump's SOTU speech on twitter and he wasn't even trying to hide it. The most embarrassing tweet however, has to be Dave crediting Trump for the lowest black unemployment in years. 

Trump took undue credit for black unemployment when in reality the black unemployment has been declining in the past 7 years, and when Trump took office in January 2017, "the black unemployment rate was 7.8 percent, the lowest it had been in nearly 10 years" and "it dropped a full percentage point to 6.8 percent in December. That’s the lowest rate since the bureau began regularly breaking out unemployment rates by race in 1972."via [factcheck](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/trump-takes-undue-credit-black-unemployment/)

The fact that Dave was so quick to give Trump credit without understanding the context really displays how much of a right wing hack he's become. Just did a search on Dave's channel. Tonight's show is Shapiro appearance number FIVE and Peterson appearance number FIVE. And that doesn't include all the other podcasts and college talks he's done with them that get uploaded elsewhere.

Good grief. Surely they've run out of things to talk about? Who on earth would pay monthly contributions to a talk show with such a high turnover of repeat guests?What a strange bizarre world we're in Hopefully TJ would not be steered into talking about SJWs and he could push Dave into taking explicitly pro Trump positions. I can understand why he has haters, everyone has theirs. The question is why is his subreddit a circle jerk of people that hate him? My guess is that all you people subscribed when he was a leftist, and as he moved further to the right he pissed off all of his old fans. Clearly Dave has a lot of fans given his near 700k subscribers on youtube, I'm guessing a lot of them just don't know about his reddit page, and the people who do know about it  were his fans from circa 2015, who now hate him. It's just weird to see someone's subreddit dominated by people that hate them.   It's also weird that the people on here that hate him seem to like Sam Harris, given that their views are not that dissimilar. He was falsely accused of being alt right which will attract Rubin and then he can switch to attacking the right which will put Dave on the defensive.Like I personally am not a fan of the Kyle Kashuv kid but it'd be very, very offensive if anyone insulted him the way Owen Benjamin is going after Hogg
https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/981359404875505669(And if they do, can they record it so we can bask in the second-hand embarrassment?).... but my husband likes him and is dragging me to his show tonight. If there is any Q and A what should I ask? I can try to give a short summary here later of how it went for you guys. 

For clarification... my husband has watched him for a while, but I was never a fan. He says he hasn't watched a ton recently due to the most recent guests being conservative. I was never interested enough to watch Dave rubin and debate with my husband much, plus I hate fighting so I just let him know I am not a fan because of his catering to right wing guests etc. I should also mention I generally stay away from youtube/politics debates etc.So Dave Rubin posted this on twitter and I honestly think it's a pretty good microcosm of how poor and partisan he is as a thinker.

For those who don't know, The Simpsons has been getting some flack from people because of it's stereotypical depiction of Apu, whose effectively just a stereotype. Now instead of actually address this criticism, Rubin is glad that the show didn't give in to the progressive criticism. Of course the Simpsons response was essentially "well this is how we've been doing it for years". Now Rubin appears to agree with this statement, which is a fundamentally conservative one (but he's the last liberal guys).

But Rubin has always billed himself as an individualist, he constantly talks about being one on his show. But he is apparently to daft of a thinker to understand the critique of Apu is in fact individualist. Since it's against the pretty bad collective characterization of indians as a group of people, shouldn't he be against it? I think he should, but he isn't. Either because he's to daft to understand his own beliefs and principles, or because he's too partisan to actually agree with it, and needs to be against it. 

Probably both lol.I used to watch the show but now I have for the most part stopped.

Yet I always see his new videos on my feed, I am always subscribed to his channel, I always see his tweets on twitter and am always following him on twitter.

Yet I see him posting stuff about how some of his fans cannot see his videos, get unsubscribed, somehow got unfollowed on twitter or can’t see his tweets anymore.

Do YouTube and twitter have an agenda where they make it a goal for me to be connected to his accounts but make sure some of his fans can’t see him? It’s rather ridiculous that having in depth discussions about the episodes is being made impossible by people who only come here to bitch about Rubin.

I genuinely wonder how come y’all have enough free time to bitch about a small online talkshow.Dave, you were using the catchphrase, "The left is no longer liberal." I'm not sure if you still do. As soon I saw Trumpers sharing your work and what most of the bread and butter of your new audience looked like, I knew it would be a really, really dumb thing to think this slogan is effective beyond certain kinds of media outreach and maybe some of your international audience. Your American audience who will stick with you thinks "liberal" is a vile descriptor, so to them you may as well be saying Berkeley is no longer latte-friendly.

Dave, try this catchphrase instead: "The Alt-Left is no longer alternative." What this conveys is the left used to be sane. Before it had a name, the Alt-Left was on the fringes beginning in the '60s with the more radical protestors, environmentalists, etc. It's not so much the left changed, it's that it was weak. The Alt-Left had a strong dogmatic message and once the safe space Millenial zeitgeist began, it rapidly swallowed everything on the left it could with their hatred except for Dave.Last month I went to an event hosted by Dave Rubin at UC Berkeley with the intention of asking him about why his show has taken such a rightward turn in the last year or so. I was able to call him out on the Q&amp;A of that event, but the question I asked was edited out of the final video of the event. You can read more about that incident here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/8478te/i_called_out_dave_rubin_at_an_event_in_berkeley/

Tomorrow Dave Rubin is hosting ANOTHER right wing event at UC Berkeley, called Make Berkeley Great Again, featuring Charlie Kirk and Candace Ownes (yikes!). So my plan is to call Dave out again at this event tomorrow, and specifically ask him why he took down the Q&amp;A from the last video. 

I wanted to get the word out so that people can pay attention to the Q&amp;A and watch the Bloodsports live, and hopefully some people will record/download the video before it gets edited. I will have someone recording my question at the event so if it does get removed I'll post it myself.

Another thing I'd like to do is have people post their questions/critiques of Dave Rubin, especially from former fans, and I'll deliver them to Dave in person.I thought I heard Dave once mention a Discord channel in the works for fans of the show.  Anyone have an update on that?I've been toying with this for a while. It explains his constant reliance on Trump holding an LGBT flag/that gay speaker at the RNC.

He's a white, costal gay guy who describes himself as a "badass gaybro" and has made disparaging remarks about effeminate gay men (who bare the brunt of homophobia). Just read his tweets about Mario Cantone.

He doesn't care about trans people or cake discrimination in the South as he's got his marriage license in California/NY. Identity politics changed him but not in the way he professes. He's embarrassed to admit this, which is why he's been deflecting through his whole "I never left the Left, they left me!" shtick.I say "Jesus knew a lot of Muslims"There are serious flaws in his argumentation. He and Friedman are partisan hacks and every other ethical economist knows it. Just simply look up the videos or writings of Mark Blyth, Richard D. Wolff, Yanis Varoufakis. Oh and Noam Chomsky deconstructed the free market ideology of Friedman multiple times quite well regarding to his opinions on slavery.I know this sub loves to shit all over Dave,I don't see most of it as warranted, but whatever.  My biggest gripe is that he has been doing the same show over and over again regardless of the guest.  It's literally the same anti SJW talking points regurgitated again and again.  I feel like every show could be boiled down to " huh, the left sure is wacky"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/08/donald-trump-anti-protest-bills

This recent article from The Guardian shows pretty convincingly that since Trump's election the actual threat to free speech - that has actual power - comes from the Republican Party, not a bunch of college SJW's (not to excuse some of the extreme actions of SJW's)

What do you guys think "free speech absolutist/Mr. Free Speech Guy" Dave Rubin will say about any of this?https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/988440462137610245https://guardian.ng/issue/trump-is-endangering-africas-free-press/

I'm sharing this old article in response to a recent story I read in the Economist about the social media crackdown in Tanzania (link below). They are requiring a license to use social media and are cracking down on free expression across the board. A high profile rapper was recently arrested due to posting content considered indecent. 

That story and the article below should remind us just how misplaced Dave Rubin's emphasis on free speech threats from "the left" and "SJW's" really is. International governments like those of Tanzania, Kenya, and others are openly cracking down on free speech - and they're taking cues directly from Trump, not the SJW's. 

Under the leadership of past presidents (of whom there is definitely much to criticize, especially in foreign policy), the US set the tone by being a model for protecting free speech. But under Trump, that leadership is gone and governments across the world are getting a much more free reign to openly abuse their citizens' freedom of speech. This isn't theoretical- it's actually happening (read the articles).

Relevant to this sub because of Rubin's constant emphasis of the importance of free speech, yet his clear hypocrisy in actually caring about the value of free speech where it actually matters. And this gives us a global perspective on how there really is a major threat of authoritarianism and free speech crackdown, and it's definitely not coming from the supposed power of SJW culture. 

https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21740806-some-governments-are-muzzling-social-mediaexcept-when-it-supports-them-how-africanShe is getting a lot of flak including from the president himself. Wouldn’t it make sense if Rubin has her on his show he usually complains when people get kicked off a private platform and this comic is actually getting criticised by government officials. 
You’d think Rubin would know how she feels since his is extremely funny and edgy humour /s


But seriously muh freeze peach. Most people in this subreddit are very anti-rubin, so just wanted to know the possible end goal of this sub-reddit and what it wants to do to dave and his channel.Title says it all - just goes to show what being a duplicitous hack gets you.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdsHaO0zQHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdsHaO0zQHI)I only just got around to seeing Ana's video in which she mentions he said no to the debate, but I hadn't heard him respond in any form to her request until she said that.

This is the first time he would've acknowledged her in any form since Ana started going after him heavily earlier this year, so I'm just curious if there's anymore information on this.An oft-repeated talking point spewed by the rAtIoNaL sKePtIcS of Reddit/YouTube is that people fighting for social, racial, and economic justice are not oppressed if they live in a first world country and/or have some income, etc. 

This attitude stems from evaluating wellbeing strictly in an absolute sense. 

An easy way to call them out on their unwillingness to acknowledge that *relative* strife is a thing is to turn their talking point back on them.

“Conservatives in the first world can’t possibly be oppressed on college campuses”

or my favourite,

“You can’t claim that your free speech is being attacked. It diminishes *actual* free speech suppression in countries like North Korea!”

(Even though their free speech crises is totally fabricated, this rebuttal still grants that premise anyways while pointing out their hypocrisy.)Rubin's circlejerk buddies like the Weinstein bros, as well as his fans, like to defend Ben Shapiro's infamous and now-deleted tweet by claiming there was some kind of context to it that somehow made it less bigoted. However I've seen seen any of these supposedly redeeming tweets so would anyone with more knowledge of the situation like to explain to me what this defence is based on?I'm about to go into a semi-Reddit retirement but before I go I felt it might be useful to try and put together a list of the different left-wingers who've asked to engage Dave in the supermarket of ideas but whom he's turned down or ignored (i.e. all of them). I know the names but if you guys could help me track down some sources to place with them in a follow up post that'd be fantastic. Also chime in with any names I'm leaving out.

From memory there was Sam Seder and Ana Kasparian of course. Natalie Wynn, Nathan J. Robinson, David Pakman and *maybe* Kyle Kulinski. Anyone else?How do smart libertarians (not Dave), justify libertarianism in the case of disastrous effects for future generations of today’s corporate actions? what if the intellectual dark web came down to a massive brawl, with some obnoxious lefties tossed in for good fun? 

[https://thethinkersright.com/2018/10/14/the-idw-wwe-public-intellectuals-face-off-in-the-ring-intellectual-dark-web-idw-jordan-peterson-ben-shapiro-eric-weinstein-bret-weinstein-dave-rubin-steven-crowder/](https://thethinkersright.com/2018/10/14/the-idw-wwe-public-intellectuals-face-off-in-the-ring-intellectual-dark-web-idw-jordan-peterson-ben-shapiro-eric-weinstein-bret-weinstein-dave-rubin-steven-crowder/)

Me and my friend had to come to a conclusion scientifically.It astonishes me (not really) how little if not nothing the IDW members, free-speech-champions, have said about Khashoggi's disappearance in Istambul, which is the most outrageous violation of free speech of the last time. Shapiro is the only one who has posted more than one tweet (mostly retweets), although many of which are intended to tarnish the journalist's reputation (as if that were important). I guess that free speech issues are worth addressing intellectually only when it's about the IDW members being 'silenced' by teenagersI’m so sick of this fraud prancing his ass around like he’s some independent free-thinker when he’s willing to buddy up with some of the most partisan conservative hacks. 

And he’s snippy tweets at David Pakman aren’t helping either. I hope he knows that one more debate with someone like Pakman could expose his stupidity once and for all.American politics has become two giants snatching power for themselves and trying to hold on to it for as long as possible. The introduction of Donald Trump--who I find very entertaining--has definitely corrupted the swamp, not drained it. Donald Trump is a clown, and I, unlike many people, like clowns. He has brought back showmanship politics, and Democrats are all too eager to rise to the bait. 

Libertarians need to rally everybody in the middle of the political spectrum with a call to make things more fair: **instant-runoff voting**, also known as ranked-choice voting. We've all seen the [CGP Grey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE), and the party mascot is a flipping porcupine. It's time to start pricking at the two parties that are the cause of all this consternation, and I think the message is simple: unite under our banner, so that we can have more banners to vote for. Vote for your voice. 

[58% of the people](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/voter-turnout-2016-elections) turned out for 2016, and Clinton lost in a *lot* of states with razor thin margins that could've been swung by transferring third party votes. We don't need to win the presidency right off the bat, we just need to get enough independent voices to force cooperation and have a slightly more fair system. Instant-runoff won't fix everything, but it is an important step in the right direction. There's no such thing as a wasted vote. MEMEMEMEMEMEMEMEMEME

aaaaaaand Dave RUBEANThere are so many 1000-2000+ year old stories about the way people treat brave thinkers. 
As if anything worthwhile is going to fit in you’re small boxes.
Let a guy have mistakes, imperfections and insecurities for goodness sake. 
You guys think you would rather have nobody disagree but it would be boring as F and you would still fight over minute details"It was David against Goliath, I firmly believe David can take down Google, this David"

Deary me, this fool truly thinks his shit don't stink. Rubin, your videos average about 100,000 views. There's videos of cats that get 20 times moreI can't tell if it's Russian trolls or a secret DNC cabal (/s x2) or what, but this sub seems weirdly dedicated to being upset about Dave.
I get why people don't like him, to an extent. I don't get why people dislike him so strongly that they take time out of their day to post complaints and critiques on a dead sub for 7 upvotes. 
I'm actually curious to know how many visitors to this sub are here to "expose and discredit" vs how many are listeners like me who just kinda lurk in on all the hate. 
Either way, it's interesting. Keep doing you. Damn, I came here expecting to find fans of Rubin, and all I get is people talking shit about him. Everyone is acting like Dave is a con artist, am I the only one who thinks just he's a guy who changed his mind about politics? I'd love to see him incorporate a little more intellectual diversity into his show, but on the whole I find him to be an incredibly likeable and skilled interviewer.-proceeds to display carefully crafted response to a 5 second clip taken from a  1-1/2 hour recorded conversation between 2 people who are gettin to know each other because they’ve just met and are not in a debate.Will we here it in the news? Probably not because only republicans get sympathy from the media. Dave in April: 'How dare someone accuse me of liking blackface!' - https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/983464336818454528

Dave now: 'Wear whatever you want for Halloween!' - https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1055047789808361473

The most recent tweet was in the wake of the 'Megyn Kelly supports blackface' scandal a few days ago. It specifically quotes another tweet about dressing up as other races.

Is blackface something else that Dave has changed his mind about? Or is he talking out of both sides of his mouth (again)? Or have I misunderstood his great intellect?Wow a sub for Dave Rubin fans exists... Oh wait this whole sub clearly doesn't like Dave and this is pretty much a circle jerk of complaints of him and his show.

Very cool and interesting stuff here!By some right wing psycho with a hatred of Jews. After the bomb attempts and now this, will this piece of human excrement Dave Rubin still insist "the left is far more dangerous than the right"?

He really is vile. He's an utter disgrace. Prove me wronghttps://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-candace-owens-blexit-and-politics-749784/

What are the odds of Dave discussing this? 
This is a controversial thought, but hear me out. I don’t care about your stupid opinion. No, I’m not talking you or everyone/anyone in particular, I just don’t care about regressive right-wing ideas. 

I don’t want to listen to them, I don’t want to hear them, I don’t care about them. I’m a progressive and I believe in moving forward. However, people from the right argue that this is not the way they would like to be moving so we should enact policies that hurt people and they don’t want to create policies that would make people's lives easier. 

I don’t care why anyone would be against gay marriage. Marriage in itself is something old and stupid tradition that stuck around because of popular culture and for companies that make their profits organizing weddings, selling expensive rocks, flowers and cakes. It’s okay, I don’t mind that because of them, people want to get married. But what do you care or what right to you have to tell people whether they can or can’t get married? Nothing, you have no right. Why would anyone feel that their marriage are now less worthy, because some gay people can get married too? It’s stupid and I don’t care about it anymore. 

I don’t care whether you like muslims or not, they are here and they are people too. They are humans, and just because someone is born in somewhere else, they should be given the same opportunities as people who born in privileged situations. You are not more human because you were born in a suburb house with nice garden, two cars and four bedrooms. 

Same goes for poor people. Your parents most likely haven’t worked harder than the poor parents. Why should they be punished for being poor? It’s fucking stupid. Why give the rich more taxcuts, if everyone is saying that the rich people are getting richer, the poor is getting poorer, and the divine is growing non-stop. It doesn't make sense. People say that communism doesn't make sense because even economists says so. So where are all those economists opinions when you are talking about taxation? 

What right to you have to debate whether people should get tattoo, piercings or abortions? You have no freaking right, you do what you want with your body and people do what they want with their body. It's not that hard. 

Other things that I don't wouldn't want to debate: Russian communism is good (it's not), Russia has nothing to do with anything (it's false, see the evidence or go to Russia and see for yourself. Or just fucking take a hike in EU jesus), Fascism is not that bad (it is), Hitler was right in some things (no he wasn't), Alt-right is not full of nazis (it is), Trump isn't a nazi (I don't know, he either is or he is just fucking stupid, we can debate about that, I take it back), Asians/Mexicans/immigrants steal our jobs (they do because most likely you are a lazy ass who didn't wanted to do the dirty jobs or you just forgot that people keeps changing [okay I actually feel bad for those people]), etc. 

Okay, I’m not against every debate, because debating is good. I’ll always be up for debating some conservative values, or ideas, but hating any minority or race or ethnicity or anything is not up for debate. I'm just wondering, it's kinda useless to argue conservatives because they won't change my mind and I won't change theirs. The examples are just stuff that came from the top of my mind, there must be more I'm not thinking about now. 

So what do you guys think? Debate me while you can. How could my idea be refined? What could be a progressive guide to debating?  Could this be an example of why the battle of ideas is legit or stupid? 

I'm seriously interested in your inputs. 

(yes, it is connected to dave rubin, since he is the big champion of battle of ideas, and he says that every opinion should be present [as long as it's from the right]) 

I'd love to challenge Rubin to a debate on free speech. I'd take the side of someone in favor of limiting free speech rights. We could really delve into the prevailing theories behind free speech, why its good for society, what limits should be placed on it. 

Dave is a well known free speech warrior so I'm sure he's thinking about these things constantly and in a profound way. But you never really here him get past the surface level on this issue. Interesting seeing as free speech seems to be so important to him. Up vote so the married gay man himself can see!I know most people on this subreddit come here to criticise Rubin for what I consider to be his many flaws.  I am honestly curious as to what you find admirable about this guy, if anything.  What do you actually like about him?They would have a tough conversation that would a huge win for the battle of ideas.I am so sick of this narrative of blaming the left for every problem. Polls show generally that the left is far more likely to embrace dissenting speech than is the right and that the right is far more authoritarian but people like Rubin and the alt-light crowd have done a masterful job regurgitating content about the same 5 SJW incidents that the whole of Youtube now genuinely believes the right somehow stands for free speech. Never mind the fact that Trump has openly talked about removed press protection under the 1st amendment. 

Wish I could go on and challenge him on these contradictions. https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/943571523285192704The fact that people are so simple that they can't see through his blame the left for everything shtick..... the left isn't perfect but it seems like in 2017 so long as you hate SJWs people will hop on your dong and go for a spin.

I hope people wake up to this but doubt it.This is a difficult question, both of those latter two figures can come across as incredibly insufferable, Shkreli for his past business practices and his face, and Ted Cruz for his political grandstanding and his face.

But Dave Rubin seems like he is their match in other ways.  I think he is at least on their level of insufferable, but he may be beyond them.https://twitter.com/kfoleyfl/status/943979072715096066I posted it on a youtube comment section, but I figured I may as well mention it here since we all love Dave so much.

Rubin's show is like a trial against the left, with only a prosecutor and no defense.- Debate between Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson
- Sam Harris
- Jesse Waters
- Tucker Carlson
- Ethan &amp; Hila Klein 
- Camille Paglia
- Jonathan Haidt
- Jordan Peterson and Lindsey Shepard
a) Just an attention whore and willing to do anything to get more eyeballs on him

b) Just in it for the money and willing to say anything as long as those who pay him are happy

c) Just in it for a good circle jerk or to elevate his standing in society by associating with others smarter than him

d) Intellectually curious and willing to hear all sides

e) Intellectually curious but is undergoing some phase in life where he is only/more interested in conservative positions

f) Intellectually curious but too lazy to do background research and accepts everything someone says at face value

g) Hates some people on the left (Cenk Uygur) and therefore distancing himself from anything that reminds him of them

h) Has become a partisan conservative but is lying to himself about being liberal

&amp;nbsp;


These are the only options that occur to me, maybe you guys have a better classifications for him. I personally think he's a mix of (c), (f) and (g) but then again I never really liked the guy... him and his content are kind of my guilty pleasure hate watch. I do not expect a totally unbiased view but I am curious as to how you guys view him.

His (lack of) response to the recent shooting does seem to exclude (a) in my eyes.
I just stumbled across a tweet from an official YouTube account on Twitter and there are a bunch of grown men with a handful of followers bitching about demonetization in the replies.


Why do people care? Unless you are a large YouTuber yourself, I don't understand why anyone does.


Why have we become so accustomed to a society in which people should have the automatic right to be paid handsomely for what is fundamentally a low-skill hobby? Sitting in front of a webcam and whining on a free-to-use website shouldn't be a career path for thousands upon thousands of people, the bubble has burst and now there's a reality check for a lot of folks who've coasted by for the past few years. If you can't support your hobby from your income alone then it's time to get a (better) job.


I have no problem with people who produce a relatively limited amount of content each week having to get a '''proper''' job. Dave Rubin can serve coffee in Starbucks and make his YouTube clips about the regressive left when he gets off shift. In any case, it's not as if he's spending the rest of his time researching the hot political issues of the day...Philip DeFranco he epitomizes the fence sitting skeptic type who never challenges the right but attempts to look centrist. 

So annoying. I think it's just so stupid whenever Rubin says "The good thing about Trump is that we are all figuring out where our beliefs lie now".  NO, only you are doing this, everybody else has the same beliefs as before.  I want it to happen at some point.https://twitter.com/asteadwesley/status/970682166937030657The Justice Democrats have just won multiple primaries in Texas. I initially thought it would be a long shot for them to get anyone in office but it looks like there is real energy behind them. I wonder if these guys might actually get some people into congress and help rebuild the democratic party. 

I also think it would be cool if Rubin offered to interview a Justice Democrat. A lot of these guys have interesting things to say and a passion for improving the country. Actually I guess they would just scream bigot and racist the whole interview because that is what progressives do apparently. Rubin's smug face? That guy on all of his photos, especially on the newer ones, is trying to seem like he's an intelectual giant, someone with class that discusses politics during the day and reads classical literature during the night. 

He's an idea guy afterall, someone you count on to know all the ethnical and moral reasons behind individual freedom and knows how goverment was designed to operate to the latter.
Lately, he has even grown beard, in order to seem like some wise, old man.

That's how he portraits himself… 

…and it's all fraud. He's is a former failed comedian that couldn't entertain people if his live depended on it. He's a gaybro that was on a podcast that was about gay people, for gay people – talk about identity politics. God knows what he did 15 years before that (remember, he’s 42 years old!), if he was a male prostitute, I wouldn't be suprised in the least. Afterall, whoring is possibly the only thing he's good at.

That guy knows less about current state of affairs then most regular people who watch the news and read journals to be informed citizens. In some respects, he knows less than your average Joe who watches cable from time to time. All he knows is what he reads on /pol/ and all he can say are current talking points that fellow conservatives tweet at him. Vital part of being engaged in politics is (to quote Trump) to know what the hell is going!

Even in ideas department, which he claims to be his speciality, Rubin utterly fails. I am not saying he doesn’t know anything, he knows his talking points that are vital to the show and he somewhat knows what he is for and what he’s againts. 
But that’s about it. He has no knowledge behind these issues. 

Afterall, his whole reasoning behind why he thinks that racism is still problem in America was that that’s where his fellow liberal friends stand.

And that’s all there is to it, binary tribal identity. You are either part of this group and you are pro all these issues, or you are againts it. As he tweeted, you are either for big goverment, or againts it.

I also fail to understand why so many smart people like him personally. He’s possibly the most shallow person that I ever saw. Hey look at me, I like Star Wars, I like videogames and American football. If I took all stereotypical urban millennial characteristics, threw them into a mixer and mixed it really hard, I would get Rubin. There is nothing unique or genuine about him, except for his blandness.

I didn’t mean to write an essay about him, I just wanted to write about what a smug phony with a punchable face he’s. It’s just that he’s such a phony on so many different levels!Folks, it's official, we are entering the Age of Unlightenment.
 
My friend, a true feminist in the best sense of the word and a fearless defender of free speech, Christina Hoff Sommers, was invited to speak at Lewis and Clark Law School this week. Here’s what happened when she began to talk.
 
They chanted: “We choose (we choose). To protest (to protest). Male supremacy (male supremacy. And not give it (and not give it). A platform (a platform). Christina Sommers (Christina Sommers). Has repeatedly (has repeatedly). Delegitimized (delegitimized). The suffering of women (the suffering of women). Worldwide (worldwide). But we believe (but we believe). Our siblings (our siblings). And our comrades (and our comrades). Women are not (women are not). Liars with victim mentalities (liars with victim mentalities). Rape culture is not a myth (rape culture is not a myth). Microaggressions are real (microaggressions are real). The gender gage rap is real (the gender wage gap is real). Trans-people are real (trans-people are real). Trans lives matter (trans lives matter). Black lives matter (black lives matter). 
 
Putting aside the creepiness of the clone-like repetitive chanting from the protestors, their use of free speech actually isn't a use free speech at all. While of course they have a right to protest, your right to exercise your free speech doesn't come at the expense of someone else's right to exercise theirs. So what this means is, yes, you CAN peacefully protest outside of an event, you CAN silently protest inside of an event, you CAN hold all the signs you want and you CAN encourage others to join your cause.
 
You can NOT, however, use your freedoms to trample on the freedoms of others. This chanting, which again took place before Christina had even begun to speak, reminded me of when I was at UCLA with Milo Yiannopoulos two years ago. Protesters screamed, spit, threw garbage cans, pulled fire alarms and even called in bomb threats before we even took the stage. Perhaps most egregiously though, was the group of students who linked arms to create a human wall to stop us and other viewers from even going inside the venue itself. So apparently they aren't against walls, they just don't like Trump's wall.
 
Christina's talk continued through the chanting, and the protesters began to sing: “Which side are you on friends, which side are you on? No platform for fascists, no platform at all. We will fight for justice, [Unintelligible] Christina's gone. Which side are you on friends, which side are you on? Which side are you on friends, which side are you on?”
 
Quite a catchy tune, wouldn’t you say?
 
Of course, Christina Hoff Sommers isn't a fascist at all, she's just an old school liberal who dare challenge modern day Leftism. Ironically, these people, so keen on fighting fake fascism in their minds don't understand that they themselves are the ones who are actually using fascist tactics of silencing and drowning out their opponents until there is no opposition remaining at all.
 
But if you're still confused, here's a simple definition of fascism: “Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and control of industry and commerce, which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.”
 
Do you think Christina is for dictatorial power? Is she for forcible suppression of opposition?
 
To top it off she even works for the American Enterprise Institute, which is against control of industry and commerce. Now just think for a moment if the ideas that these students were espousing were the set of ideas in power? They actually would be for dictatorial control, as they believe their cause is the most just, and their opponents are simply evil.
 
How do you think it would be going for dissent and opposition in their system? Perhaps the most insidious piece of the cultural marxism that we see spreading on college campuses these days, is that it is using the freedoms that our democratic capitalist society has against itself. Of course it would never offer the same protection to minority voices in the dystopian future that it would bring. While this event thankfully wasn't nearly as violent as when Milo went to UC Berkeley and the school burned down, or when it took $600,000 in security to ensure that Ben Shapiro could speak there without threat, this display at Lewis and Clark is just another reminder of how the backwards thinking of cultural marxism is coming for all dissenters, cloaked in the mask of tolerance and diversity. These incidents are happening at colleges all over the country and turning places of
higher learning into places where people are just getting high...on intersectionality.
 
Sadly, this story really only broke on right leaning blogs and was only shared by the usual suspects who continually defend freedom of expression. As of recording this, I haven't see any Left-leaning websites that covered it. The reason for this of course is two-fold. On one hand when you can win arguments by silencing your opponents, your job is pretty easy, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the good actors on the Left who want to call out events like this rarely do because they know that the same tactics of smearing and silencing will be used against them as they are purged from their former home. Just ask former guests of mine like Bret Weinstein, Laura Kipnis, Lindsay Shepherd and others, who dare speak out against this tyrannical faux diversity movement.
 
The silver lining though, of course, is that the more that people like Bret, Laura and others speak out, the more room they give for people like you to do the same in your life.
 
Check out the original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXiZFxJu844
Create by: Dave Rubin, Transcribed by: Spacedude
I wish I downloaded that live streamed talk with Dave and Steven and that lady where the Q&amp;A was cut out because snowflake Dave did not want to see the scary liberal student criticize him.

I was a fool, I did not think Dave would be so shameless to remove the evidence, but it's my fault.  I should have known he'd shrivel up and want to remove that student.

It was everything Dave did not want to encounter.  He keeps choosing Berkeley because he wants chaos and conflict and idiots on the left to shout him down so he can play the victim.  He is not taking this show to the university of chicago, but then merely discussing ideas was never the point.

Worse still, that liberal guy who asked Dave a question, expressed his disappointment in him, was not shrill and unhinged.  He was on the left, and NOT the demonic figurine Dave has painted people on the left to be, he called Dave out on not inviting people on the left, called him out on having his show be little more than a right wing circle jerk.  Dave was clearly irritated and rattled, but I guess that incident cut deep.  This was not an example of the "left" Dave wanted to allow to be seen, but if the same guy had stood and started cursing at dave and yelling and trying to shout down the event, he'd probably make another several videos bitching about the incident.

But now it's gone.  Dave removed it.  And I could have gotten the video before the coward could remove the evidence.


So let this be a lesson to anyone out there who sees a Dave Rubin livestream with a Q&amp;A.  If the entire thing is uploaded right after the stream, download that thing via the proper plugins IMMEDIATELY !!!!!!!!!!

Especially if Rubin gets blasted.  I went through the FIRE list of disinvitations and when compared to campus population both sides proportionately deplatform others. Since the campus population is about 65-70% liberal to left of center we would expect those numbers in deplatforming stats. Lo and Behold it breaks to almost exactly that with 106 of 371 deplatformings been doing by right wingers to more left wing speakers. 


The rates of deplatforming do vary and in full disclosure the left has done more deplatforming recently, but the meta trends show pretty decisively that this isn't a left only problem.https://twitter.com/okwonga/status/972758502425972737https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eBmyABeAa4#t=1m13s


&gt;You give me the awful impression, I hate to have to say it, of someone who hasn't read any of the arguments against your position ever.Or perhaps someone who could represent the libertarian point of view?

 Who's with me?https://twitter.com/seanmcelwee/status/975042709424627713Okay, I might be wrong, because I haven't actually check all the numbers of violence and acceptance of minority rights between the United States and the European Union, but as a EU citizen, I don't constantly hear about people sexuality and stuff. I feel like in the EU, people don't really care who you fuck and what do you identify as. I mean, once you tell it to someone, more often than not, it'll be respected and acknowledged.  

Now here's Rubin with his "american exceptionalism" and Jordan Peterson, a canadian who american helpless teens see as life help mentor, and we constantly hear about how minorities should be threaten and etcetera, but I feel like in the European Union, most people really just don't give a fuck about who you are fucking with. I feel like it's just not that big of a deal.

But yeah, we do have far-right parties, all around Europe, but hardly ever do they have more than 10-15% of support during elections. I mean, that's bad too, but not having Donald Trump as president bad. 

Okay, there are a few exceptions: Hungary's Viktor Orban is a moscow-friendly, seemingly xenophobe, racist ass, but his racism is more like a political propaganda rather than actual belief. Also there's the PiS party in Poland, but they are much more into just being nationalist assholes rather than anything else. 

Also true that the United States have a much bigger protection on freedom of speech, but look where that got you guys.

So, where's the bigger liberty? In the United States where people always debate about it, or in the European Union where there's liberty but also people just don't really care what do you do with your life as long as you are not hurting anyone else.

EDIT: Thanks for the answers :) It was really an incredible story. You would think Rubin would make mention of it on Twitter or something. https://twitter.com/pattymo/status/977732524536422400Rubin's just said this word for word on the Colin Moriarty podcast. It was posted here earlier but I think this is a big enough deal to merit its own dedicated post.

[Timestamp: 52:20](https://soundcloud.com/colinslaststand/colins-last-stand-fireside-chats-episode-29-one-on-one-with-dave-rubin)

I think this is the culmination of the journey Rubin's been on for the past few years. After all the vagueness about his political positions and stance towards the Trump administration, the facade of being a "classical liberal" while endorsing a Libertarian, presenting himself as willing to criticize all sides while virtually just attacking the left every single day, we've got the confirmation. Presented with a choice between a left-liberal like Elizabeth Warren or a social democrat like Bernie Sanders, and Donald J. Trump, he would vote for Trump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7fXAYcMIhQ

This is something that goes on a lot. Especially with Crowder and other internet trolls. Fox News has done it too in the past. Both have dismissed the investigation and disparaged media for covering it. Rubin because he sold out and Greenwald because he;s Putin shill.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/979045211912450049First, sorry about my English, not my native tongue. I have a feeling this is going to turn into a bit of a rant, so if you're not in the mood for that I suggest you don't waste your time reading. 

I've been reading this sub for a couple of weeks, but haven't bothered to post anything until now. I'm glad so many people see Dave for what he is, or rather for what he has become(?).

Like many of you, I used to watch the Rubin Report quite frequently, but I just can't bring myself to do it any more. Here's my problem: I just can't figure this fucker out. Is he just dumb, intellectually dishonest, a shill, or a bit of all three? He seems to lack self awareness (example: thinks he's funny and keeps going on about being a """comedian"""), but he also seems smart enough to pander to his audience (not even true conservatives or Republicans, mostly just Trump cultists), for money I assume. Or is he just this dense? 

I am not even sure where he stands ideologically. I guess once could call him a Republican conservative, although he is not really that either? He is definitely, certainly not a classical liberal or a libertarian. As someone with libertarianish/liberal attitudes, I'm very annoyed by these neocon Republicans who keep hijacking the libertarian/classical liberal label, whenever they deem fit. They usually do it if they want to be perceived as "muh small government" people, but they're obviously big government authoritarians who don't want to piss off the younger, patreon bucks demographic, so instead of flat out saying "I am not for gay marriage and I h8 degenerate phaggots" they say "Leave it to the states, I'm a small government guy ;)".

I have much more respect for people who are what they claim to be, than for the likes of Dave. He is cancer. On top of that, he's a really shit host. Want to let your guests talk? That's great, but fucking challenge them sometimes. Don't just nod with that dumb smile on your face, while somehow spinning whatever it is that you're talking about into a problem of the left; "right, right *nods*, but that's what the regressive left does...". A good example of this is Dave's interview with Stefan Molyneux - an absolutely disgusting human being, a pretentious quasiphilosopher cult leader who masquerades as a fucking ancap, yet shills for an imbecile, and a big government authoritarian at that (Trump). 

For the record, the left clearly has many issues that need to be solved. The Democratic establishment in America is made up of center-right neocons, the degenerate SJW crowd is disgusting, sure, but for fucks sake the right is 10 times worse, and has about 10 times more issues. And I'm talking about real problems, not degenerate tumblr and reddit-posting college students with daddy issues. 

If Dave truly is what he claims to be, apart from never "holding Trump's feet to the fire", how come he never, ever mentions the absolute and utter erosion of civil liberties in America? How come he doesn't oppose tariffs (isn't he supposed to be pro-free trade?), corporate tax cuts, John Bolton, Gina Haspel and whatnot? 

And lastly, it will be really interesting to see what Dave does once Trump loses in 2020 (and I think he inevitably will, he fucked up way too much). What will his show turn into then? I just wish he would come out of the closet as a Right winger. I'm not much of a Dave Rubin fan mainly because I just have no idea what his opinions on things are, or whether he even has clear opinions, within his own head, on the issues he talks about talking about talking about (I suspect he doesn't).

That said, I actually didn't think the "bombshell" revelation in the recent TYT video about him was all that interesting.  Essentially it boiled down to, "You remember how Dave Rubin left?  Well, guess what, before he left, he had... (dramatic music)... A COMPENSATION DISPUTE."

Meh.  Employers and employees argue about compensation all the time.  And it feels a little sleazy and voyeuristic to hear stories about how such-and-such was a big diva because they wanted X, Y, and Z.

Mostly though, I didn't find the video all the compelling because, well, I mean, to his credit, didn't Dave Rubin go on to prove his own point?  I don't know how much you can say you "DESTRROYYYED" someone by pointing out that a former co-worker wanted more money, didn't get it, so he went off and made his own company, and now is making the money he wanted.

Wow... good one?

I don't know, what am I missing here?[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dave\_Rubin](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dave_Rubin)I am a law student fyi and I am doing a series covering the law behind contentious topics that is reduced into a fun and professional format with my take on the issue at the end. Does this sound interesting to anyone I see a gap in the YouTube commentary market on this type of video. I can't believe how he has abandoned his principles! Share your favorite story about why he sucks. I love spending my time talking about people I hate!...does anyone else find his mouth really unsettling?  In his videos he looks almost computer generated, and his mouth moves really strangely ("why so serious," anyone?)...his ideas are great though!For me it was hearing Lauren Southern insist that Richard Spencer wasn't a white supremacist and Dave not saying a word in response.[https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1018868443171287041](https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1018868443171287041)

Alexandria comes off as uninformed here, but seriously Dave. Nothing exposes a lack of political knowledge/awareness than such blatant lack of understanding of the Overton window. After the Democrats ran a center-right candidate in the presidential election, after having a centrist president in the white house for 8 years, not to mention the overwhelming majority of Democratic congressmen who are corrupt, corporate centrists, Dave declares the the party is dominated by leftists. Following this dude is exhausting, but I can't stop.Calling it now - Dave is going to find a tweet calling for Trump to be killed he'll highlight how uncivil the left is while ignoring the issue. I bring this up here because I was just banned at The_Donald for asking a polite question and having a civil conversation regarding Trump's performance at today's press conference with Putin.  When I politely questioned the ban since the rationale for their ban did not match their own rules, I was immediately restricted from making contact with the moderators.

The_Donald appears to be among the most heavily moderated subreddits, with any/all critics or questioners of Trump being insta-banned.  **Insert your own ironic comments about "snowflakes" and "safe spaces" here.**

Dave Rubin spends a gigantic proportion of his show commenting on authoritarian free-speech restricting behaviour by left-wing zealots and online SJW mobs.  Has Dave ever commented on this authoritarian SJW-like behavior from the right, such as that exercised at The_Donald?  Or about free-speech restricting behavior on right-wing campuses (e.g. Liberty University)?  Does he conveniently neglect to mention this behavior when the right-wing does it?

**Tl;dr**: to what extent do you think the Right is actually better (or worse) than the Left on free speech *in general*, not just on speech that they agree with?  Is it just a Rubin talking point or is there any truth to it?
I've been thinking this for a while - surely this is one of the areas [black sympathy towards or support of BLM] where Dave's show is most out of touch with public opinion?

I've done some searches and sorted a list of all of Dave's black guests over the last few years. Let me know if I missed anyone. I know Oppose/Support is a very harsh dividing line and there are obviously nuances to these positions, but it's a fairly direct way to categorise them for the purposes of this exercise.

**Debatable**:


*[Don Lemon](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coonery-or-context_us_57dc0021e4b04fa361d99872) - He's a journalist so has to hold people to account, but many people sympathetic to BLM claim that his interviewing style crosses a line into criticism.

*Johnny C Taylor Jr - Google doesn't bring much up but he [works for Trump](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/27/trump-appoints-chairman-advisory-board-hbcus/).As much as I've appreciated Ana Kasparian finally going after Rubin I feel she's making a mistake about his intentions.

While he's clearly sold out to the Koch Brothers and other right wing propagandists like Dennis Prager, I can't help but feel that this is due to a genuine change in Rubin's beliefs and not because he's just lying for cash.

If you want to see this as me saying "Rubin's not smart enough to lie about this", that's not inaccurate. I don't post this to compliment Dave in any way. The way he's shown to know so little about how the policies he claims to believe in actually work shows that his political change clearly reflects his lack of intelligence and ability to be swayed by what merely sounds convincing, rather than as a result of him having really logically thought through these principles.

But I just think no matter what the reason for his change is, there's no reason to believe that he has ever been dishonest about his opinion.

When Kasparian first went after him on The Young Turks, she showed footage of that incident in 2015 where Rubin disagreed with the other TYT hosts on the Israel-Palestine conflict. I think this is clear evidence that he was already starting to come to Republican style conclusions about issues even before he left the network.

Dave's desire to get a Larry King style talk show up and running was likely the series he wanted to receive a 6 figure salary for on The Young Turks, and his obsession with creating this show just happened to coincide with his change in political beliefs.

Now we're stuck with the worst of all these elements. Rubin hosts a boring, dated Larry King rip-off of an interview show which he makes part of a dangerous political agenda he doesn't even understand. However I don't think the journey to this current shitshow that is Dave's career requires him at any point to have been dishonest about his beliefs. He never mentioned TYT getting rid of him due to his absurd financial demands so that's one singular lie, though not an uncommon one in the media industry, but I don't think he ever lied when it came to his infantile political values.Dave Rubins Wikipedia page now includes a mention of Ana Kasparians claim that he is a dishonest actor. It is the small things that make life worth living.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave\_Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Rubin)“But it’s better than the alternative... of having my right-wing buddies perform character assassinations of people on the left after they speak out against Trump?”

Let’s get real, there is a huge disparity between how left leaning institutions and right leaning institutions hold their public figures and leaders  accountable.

Should make it clear: his tweets were deplorable, but it’s obvious he’s a different person now, and at least tried to give a thoughtful apology/explanation.

The same can’t be said for Trump, actual child sex offender Roy Moore, and dozens of other right-wing personalities who are never held accountable.I see some high quality posts on here, I'm sure some of you could sell out &amp; make bank by pandering to the right.

I imagine her recent anti-Trump crusade will make it a bit difficult for Dave so maybe she won’t be on for a while

Meghan McCain - This will probably happen if/when she leaves The View. She and Dave can whine about how awful all of those PROGRESSIVES panellists are and how they denied Meghan her freeze peach by having the audacity to politely disagree with her.

Jesse Ventura - What happened to him? I feel like he was everywhere between 2008-2012 but I haven’t seen him interviewed anywhere in a long time. Typical Rubin Report fodder.

Tomi Lahren - Maybe her time has passed? Dave likes to latch onto someone as they’re becoming relevant in the Right-Wing-Internet-Circle-Jerk sphere and she’s just another Fox News personality now.

Deneen Borelli/Charles Payne/Allen West/Stacey Dash - This lot were doing the Candace Owens routine before Candace Owens was a thing. Dave's audience would lap this up.

Joe Rogan - Genuinely surprised he hasn’t turned up to promote some questionable diet, air some dodgy conspiracy theories and talk about monkeys.

Omarosa/Scaramucci - Because after Seb Gorka, anything is possible...The Rubin Report is obviously my favorite channel. I'm also subbed to Paul Joseph Watson, Sargon of Akkad, Infowars, Computing Forever, That Guy T, Dr Jordan Peterson, 9/11 Truth Now, Chris Ray Run and Lauren Southern.

Can anyone recommend other informative channels that aren't paid for by the lame stream media? 
Thanks https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21741140-new-policies-would-hamstring-clean-air-and-pesticide-standards-scott-pruitt-embarks

The article above highlights how Trump's EPA has now blocked the use of some of the most useful scientific research because it uses "secret records" - which of course are almost essential to doing the sort of research to prove medical harm. Trump's EPA has also banned the use of scientific papers using certain words and expelled some of the most prestigious environmental scientists.

I bring this up here because I remember when I first watched Dave Rubin's show, and he claimed one of his top goals was going to be science advocacy (I was very supportive). Then he had Cara Santa Maria on as his second guest, who is a pretty strong science advocate. At that time Rubin was calling attention to hypocrisy in the use of science on both sides of the political spectrum (his interview with Santa Maria mentioned climate but also "the left"'s mischaracterization of GMO's, for example). Yet as the Trump admin pursues the most openly hostile policies towards science and scientific research in US history, today's iteration of Rubin is silent and claims to support Trump over many Democrats because of how "crazy" "the left" has become 

It really is just sad how far Rubin has fallen. When he started his show I actually could've seen Rubin making a video about the tragedy of the Trump admin's hostility towards science on multiple fronts. Now he's given all that up to be some kind of right wing culture warrior who revels in triggering people on college campuses and literally tries to stir up racial protests (listen to the multiple accounts of his recent event at UNH). And his downfall has happened in only about 2 and a half years. 

Has anyone fallen so hard and so fast as Dave Rubin? How can he look at himself in the mirror?https://amp.wfsb.com/story/38119534/iowa-governor-signs-nations-strictest-abortion-law

The Iowa GOP just passed the strictest abortion law in the nation - the law outlaws abortions if any trace of a "heartbeat" can be heard. 

Dave Rubin claims to be pro-choice and regularly uses this as his way to claim he's still a "liberal". Yet he also claims he has nothing to criticize "the right" for at the moment and that "defending liberal values is a conservative position"

So what do you think - will Dave be a fierce advocate for the injustice of this new law?  

It's getting a lot of media attention - will he say a word about it?I was wondering this simply because on YouTube, people seem to be very praiseworthy of Rubin. I've seen many video's critical of Rubin where the people giving the criticism are incredibly down voted. But on here I see far more people who are willing to criticize Rubin, why is this the case? Personally, I think it just show's that people on Reddit tend to be more left wing vs right wing. Hey Dave Rubin fans! I wanted to share what I consider to be an underrated podcast that I think many of you might enjoy: [“The Wright Show”](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-wright-show/id505824847?mt=2) with Robert Wright. 
 
Robert is a journalist who’s written for *The Intercept*, *Wired*, *The Atlantic*, as well as the author of many books on evolution and religion. His most recent book is *Why Buddhism is True*, which gives an evolutionary argument for many of Buddhism’s core ideas. 

Robert is extremely committed to having on as many politically diverse guests as possible. It's actually amazing. Just since January, Robert has already had on:

* Yousef Munayyer - Palestinian Writer and Political Analyst
* Max Blumenthal - Leftist Journalist, Critic of US Foreign Policy
* Greg Gutfeld - Fox News Host
* Katherine Mangu-Ward - Editor of Libertarian Mag "Reason"
* David Frum - Neocon, Bush speech writer, Anti Trumper
* Aaron Mate - Leftist Reporter, Russia Skeptic, Foreign Policy critic
* Andrew Sullivan - Conservative Writer
* Mickey Kaus - Liberal who is Anti-Immigration and Pro-Trump
* Matthew Cooper - Veteran DC journalist
* Elizabeth Spears - Editor of NY Observor (worked for Jared Kushner)
* Bret Weinstein - Biology Professor, Critic of Campus Intolerance
* Michael Brendan Dougherty - National Review Journalist
* Marcy Wheeler - Civil Liberties/National Security Journalist
* Aryeh Cohen-Wade - Left-wing Culture Writer, Host of the "Culturally Determined" podcast

And it’s FAR from just being a political show, in the same time span (since January), Robert has had on:

* John McPhee - famous creative non-fiction Author
* Michael Shermer - Science Writer/Historian, Skeptics Magazine
* Betsy Levy Paluck - Princeton psychologist
* Richard Vague - Economist
* Stephen Batchelor - Buddhist Scholar
* Timothy O'Connor - Philosopher covering metaphysics, religion, free will
* Galen Strawson - Analytic philosopher/literary critic
* Richard Prum -Evolutionary ornithologist
* Ann Hulbert - Literary Editor, Author
* Jeff Warren - Science Journalist/Meditation Teacher
* Massimo Pigliucci - Philosopher of Science/Biology/stoicism

Also, for anyone who is interested, Robert recently started a weekly [newsletter](https://www.mindfulresistance.net/) called "Mindful Resistance" which tries to bring the clarity and awareness of mindfulness to how we look at both Trump and the causes/implications of his Presidency w/o any of the hysterical, tribal and emotional overreactions that often come out of "the resistance" and only play into Trump's hands. 

Just wanted to share! Thank you!
It was pathetic.Dave Rubin recently claimed that if the Democrats nominate a 2020 presidential candidate like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, he would vote for Donald Trump. He explained it's because "the left doesn't care about free speech", and because "the left has lost its mind".

If Rubin has substantive disagreements with candidates like Warren and Sanders, and prefers Trump's policies  to theirs, that would be fine. But in criticizing "the left", of which he seems to see Warren and Sanders and emblematic, Rubin regularly brings out one pet issue - "the left"'s seeming hostility to free speech rights, as shown in thr disinvitation of speakers to college campuses. 

Given this, I think it's important to note that both Warren and Sanders have affirmed the right of conservative speakers to speak out on campus - multiple times each. In doing so they used similar rhetoric to that used by Rubin in defending free speech. Here's Warren:

https://articles.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/11/sen_elizabeth_warren_dangerous.amp

"I think it's dangerous to suppress speech, Instead of shutting up individuals with disgusting views, it becomes a launching pad to national attention. And second, suppression suggests weakness, It makes us sound afraid, that we're afraid we can't defeat evil ideas with good ideas." 

The quote above is from Warren in that article. Here's Warren again:

https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2017/04/26/enough-with-these-speechsuppressing-disruptions-from-campus-leftists-sayselizabeth-warren-n2318061

"You know, look, Ann Coulter has gotten a bigger platform because someone tried to deny her a chance to speak. My view is, let her speak and just don't show up. If you don't like it, don't show up." - Elizabeth WarrenSometimes, I think that he's looking for approval for his gay marriage from conservatives.  It always strikes me as odd and pathetic that he always have to bring up gay marriage or his marriage in almost every interview. 
Sometimes, I wonder what he would do if one of his guests said that they didn't approve of homosexuality or gay marriage.

*Prediction: There will be record numbers of black folks, Jews, Asians and gays voting Republican/Libertarian/Non-Democratic in next presidential election regardless of candidates. (Harder to gauge in mid-terms because so few people vote.)*

Breaking record numbers? Really? Polls aren't great evidence but are all we have. Lets take a look.

**THE FACTS:**

**Jews** - The Democrats haven't won less than 50% of the Jewish vote since 1980. For this to happen in 2020, the vote will have to have surge towards Donald "good people on both sides of this neo-nazi march" Trump by 26 points. That's not going to happen. http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-voting-record-in-u-s-presidential-elections

**Black people** - "92 percent of blacks disapprove of President Trump, compared with 7 percent who approve of him. A whopping 84 percent of blacks think Trump is a racist, compared with 10 percent who do not. [...] Only 1 percent of black respondents in the poll described themselves as Republicans, compared with 59 percent who said they are Democrats. But 59 percent is much less than the overwhelming share of black Americans who vote for Democrats." It would take a massive swing for any records to be broken and there is no evidence of this happening. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-diversity-of-black-political-views/

**Women** - 54% of women voted for Hillary Clinton. There has been no polling evidence suggesting that female voters are significantly swinging towards the Republicans or, more broadly, swinging away from Democrats in general. In fact, the evidence we have shows that the opposite is happening. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/03/22/trump_and_women_independents_worrisome_signs_136593.html

**LGBT+ people** - 14% of LGBT+ voters opted for Trump. This is significantly worse the numbers that voted for McCain and Romney. There is no evidence so far that LGBT+ people are abandoning the Democrats. https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/sexuality/agenda/article/2016/11/10/14-lgbt-americans-voted-trump-heres-why

**Asian Americans** - Figures are very difficult here because Asian American turnout is so low. However, the 2016 National Asian American Survey found that Asians are increasingly more attracted to the Democrats - just 16% are Republicans. Again, it would take a massive swing for any records to be broken and there is no evidence of this happening. http://naasurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NAAS2016-Oct5-report.pdf

**2018** - It's convenient that Dave is dismissing 2018 as the Democrats are consistently ahead. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2018_generic_congressional_vote-6185.html*With a Downton Abbey gif. This is how he responded in the immediate aftermath of both Brexit and the 2017 general election. (Yes, really - [link](https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/746342588932751361) and [link](https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/873192612621983744).)

*With some weird (faux-)intellectual contortion that links Meghan's race to the fact that "THA LEFT!1!!11!!1" are the 'real racists'. Probably with some reference to cultural appropriation for good measure.

*A corny joke about/reference to the events of 1776.

*A tweet that somehow manages to tag Douglas Murray, Maajid Nawaz or some other British 'free thinker' in a pathetic attempt at getting RTs.

*"Off the grid!!!"

*Something else?Take a drink anytime you hear one of the following things:

* "These days"
* "It's a long game" \(after getting confused following a guest's lengthy monologue\)
* "Something has shifted"
* "Kick that to the states" \(libertarianism doesn't apply if it's state instead of federal legislation?\)
* Any tortured discussion of how to define a particular political label \(what exactly is a libertarian to you?\)

Any more?https://twitter.com/kthopkins/status/997841195165454337
I occasionally bump into Rubin stuff, along with a few others such as Harris and
so on.

Are there any examples of discussions between Dave and someone who actually has significantly 
different views?

Because the whole thing feels like a bit of a circlejerk sometimes, especially
when coupled with the whole "*challenging ideas is important*" line, followed by
2 hours of vigorous nodding.

Sorry this isn't a particularly specific post.
Like many on this sub I’m a Rubin hater, but this is not meant as an an attack but as an inquiry: Rubin has attacked Cenk Uygur for his denial of the Armenian genocide, but has he ever criticized the U.S government for their official stance of denying the genocide?
Dave recently argued that he can't be judged for the actions of his guests after they've been on his show.

However, **before** Dave uploaded this interview, Tommy Robinson was convicted of assaulting an off-duty police officer, convicted of public order offences, breached an International Football Banning Order, jailed for using someone else's passport to travel to the US, convicted of mortgage fraud, joined the racist British National Party and set up a UK chapter of Pegida. Sources below.

Even a rational person wishing to hear from all sides on the issues of the day would not associate themselves with someone with such a poor moral standing.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/20/tommy-robinson/Hi,
I'm asking because unlike Rubin's community, Rogan's hardly has any of the criticisms that I constantly see here. So what makes them different? As well, if you disagree with both of them, what kind of discussion would you like to see instead?
Thanks,
-SpaceAnyone else notice a lot of posts have been disappearing recently on this sub?  For example, I commented on a post about Rubin’s cake tweet this morning and the post is already gone.  Is one of the mods doing this?https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/1001472323185033216https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/1001530359232827394For some reason, Rubin, has come out strongly for freedom of association even if it disrupts the "free market place of ideas" and free speech but with "consequences".
Supposedly deplatforming at college campuses was a big thing for the Rube to become a "classical liberal", which to me, is just pretty much the essence of freedom of association. 
Do you think Rubin will have to walk back his recent statements or become less of a free speech absolutist?
I personally think he'll keep the inconsistency.
 I'm sure most of us have been fans of dave, but have been put off by his dishonesty one way or another. I was just wondering when you all first started to realise how full of shit he isThis is what we have found from Kasparian:

He doesn't even write his shitty direct messages, interview questions or his PrageU videos: his husband does all of that for him. Not that the things he is given are any good, but they are nowhere near as bad as when Rubin is in a position to argue for himself.

What does Rubin even do then, except nodding and repeating the talking points that his guests supplied him with? Calling Rubin a talking head is an insult to talking heads, because talking heads generally share their own empty thoughts. When Rubin shares empty thoughts in the clip format, it's to mask that his non-scripted thoughts are somehow even more vacuous![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r\_9hGmemA4E&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_9hGmemA4E&amp;t=1s)

The first video I did is anti discrimination law! This one is just a dry history but the second one will cover essentially the arguments that Dave brings up against Civil Rights and debunk some of the misunderstandings of anti-discrimination law. I would love constructive critique. Posted it with the wrong timestamp edit\*I feel like this anecdote won't get enough attention buried within the interview with the boring sex doctor.

https://youtu.be/7zZY6DihWkg?t=908 - 15 mins to 17 mins into the video

Basically, Dave tells a hilarious story about his lesbian friend who started dating a man and was shunned by her lesbian friends. Dave claims that this experience also encouraged her to shun progressivism and become a libertarian!

Firstly - SCREAM at the notion that there's a link between her newfound passion for dick and her newfound passion for laissez-faire economics.

Secondly - Dave laid on the "so much for the tolerant left!" BS for this story but is he really telling us that no straight person has ever shunned their friend for coming out as gay? Why is he surprised that the same thing happens the other way around?Ben Shapiro is trying to challenge ALC because he knows even though she has a degree in economics she has been making her living outside the field, and isn't obsessive compulsive the way Ben is. Ben makes his living being an obsessive ideolog who is trying to win the "cultura war" therefore he wants to set her up with a bunch of bullshit "gotcha" questions. I would like to see Stephanie Kelton challenge Ben to a debate because she is a specialist and from what I've seen she can respond to every granular pile of bullshit he throws at her. It's a pipe dream but it would be great theater.  Do you think he knows that if he didn't grab the low hanging fruit he wouldn't have a career? I’m sure SBC came across Rubin when researching for the show. I’d have loved for him to have gone on The Rubin Report as a wheelchair-using, ex-gay, ex-Muslim, transgender, Sikh vegan with an eyepatch to scream about the sins of “THE LEFT!”, slowly cranking up the pressure to see how long it took for Dave to actually disagree. I can imagine SBC’s character claiming that progressives want to outlaw Big Macs and replace them with dog meat in buns whilst Dave sits nodding and saying “Yeah!”

Dave has invited nobodies on the show before and anyone can see that The Rubin Report doesn’t have a particularly vigorous vetting procedure when it comes to guests.


After the Lauren Southern interview and her weird comment about Jews going unchallenged, anything is possible.I can't be alone in this... Right?Rubin has always pledged to hold Trump's feet the the fire, and boy, are things getting toasty down there for POTUS. Can't wait for Rubin's next Tweet which will surely cut through the partisan bluster on the MSM networks...It was announced today that John McCain is discontinuing treatment for his brain cancer. The people are celebrating on The Donald subreddit. Comment after comment on The Donald subreddit about how Arizona will finally be represented by a senator that will vote with Trump. 

I’m confused. Dave Rubin was on Tucker Carlson a few months ago complaining about how horrible it is that the left is calling people that don’t agree with their ideology nazi’s. I’m seeing a subreddit full of people who support the current president cheering for somebody that’s about to die because he didn’t vote with his party to repeal Obamacare and he respectfully took a stand against the president when he did something the senator disagree with.

I wonder if this will change Dave Rubins mind that’s only the left that are engaging in naughty behavior.I stopped listening to Pod Save America shortly after posting this in their subreddit (May 2017).

https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendsofthePod/comments/6a4wfi/echochamber_why_are_these_guys_so_averse_to/

Every time one of their clips gets shared onto my social media timeline, I doesn't seem like much has changed. They're almost like the Dave Rubins of the centre-left (**bear with me**) in that they've established a programme with a very clear aim whilst never living up to that aim. Dave wants to reform the left but does so by... chatting and barely disagreeing with a load of right-wing crazies. PSA wants to rejuvenate the left but does so by... barely engaging in awkward political conversations but seeking comfort in eye-rolling at Republicans and media instead.

I don't think they're as intellectually dishonest or unintelligent as Dave, but I think their show serves the Hillary-wing of the Democrats in the way that The Rubin Report serves the faux-intellectual/libertarian-wing of the Trump base.

Maybe things have changed since I stopped listening and my impression is wrong but I'd be keen to hear what others think.Milo Yiannopoulos has posted this rant on Facebook - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DleMrU2VsAAKJbA.jpg

Dave had his tongue up Milo's backside for the longest time and would not stop talking about him. Milo was to 2016 Rubin Report what Shapiro/Peterson are to 2018 Rubin Report. Dave literally conducted interviews with people where Milo was the leading topic of conversation. But Dave stopped regularly tweeting about Milo on 18 February 2017. The controversy surrounding paedophilia broke a few days later.

https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/832799180871524352

Unless I'm mistaken, Dave has never directly addressed the controversy. He has only tweeted about Milo twice more and (I don't think) Milo's name has ever come up on the show since he became persona non grata. Neither of these tweets were really about Milo, he was just listing names of former guests:

https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/841321869907177472
https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1002000110270734337

This all leads me to believe that Dave Rubin dumped Milo like a sack of shit. I do wonder whether we'll have a Kasparian-esque exposé about Dave from Milo in the coming months/years.Aside from the obvious "I'm back" tweets, what issue or news story from the last month will Rubin tweet about first? My bet is John McCain. He'll mention about how he was an honest, caring, true American hero who believed in the individual over the collective. Something banal like thatI seem to recall him taking three months off once to finish a book.  He hasn’t said a word about that book since.  Where is it?In the live AMA, Dave mentioned that the guest next week will be the biggest guest the show has ever had. He said they were supposed to come on in May but they had some issues, so it's happening next week.

Any ideas who this person is?For the low price of $50.00 you can get a VIP pass to meet Jordan Peterson &amp; Dave Rubin - lol

Does a cut of this go to the Koch Bros?  

WTF would drop $50.00 to meet this bozo (Rubin).  At least Peterson has some credentials to maybe justify a VIP pass, but my oh my......I know a lot of people here think that Dave should be more aggressive or confrontational with his guests. I actually like that about him; I think it kinda draws his guests out, and it's not really necessary or desirable for an interviewer to be full of red faced outrage every time they sit down and talk with someone like Milo, Spencer, or the other folks who feed off that stuff. I do think, however, that people have a legit beef about his guests being part of the same club.

Two people I would like to see Dave interview are Linda Sarsour and Jimmy Dore. For one, it would be two subjects from the other side of the street, and also it would be in a format that these guys don't get to take part in very often. Sarsour is usually either on a panel where everyone is talking over each other, or she is holding forth with someone who is on the same side of an issue. Dave has differing views from her, but would be the same agreeable, polite, decent guy he is for everyone else.

 Jimmy would be a good person to talk to as both of them started out with TYT, though after that they moved in different directions. It'd be good to have Jimmy's views on TYT and also maybe confront Dave about some of the grievances that have been mentioned on this subreddit. 

So, there's my thought.I want to hear Elon Musk's ideas. Rubin should just be friendly and positive and let Musk talk without pushing back on anything he says.

I would click on that video so damn fast.

EDIT: Left out a word.In his recent episode with Shapiro, Dave said that McCain was the last decent man to run for president. I can not understand how this statement squares with his other principles. I would believe that all Centrists and many Republicans would agree that Obama was decent man. Even McCain said he was a decent man. This seems like an extreme right position to take and I don't understand why Dave would take it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also the statement clearly implies that Rand Paul and John Kasich are not decent. This clearly does not comport with what a right-leaning libertarian would say.    I haven't watched the AMA, so I was wondering if anyone knowsIs there anything this man won't do for money? Nice way to treat his fans https://youtu.be/S7Ft2E_ibxQ

Blair White’s new video seems to be calling out a lot of the people in the Right wing YouTube scene and it’s setting off alarm bells for me!!!

0:20 - says she’s wanted to talk about this for 9-10 months... I believe the last time she appeared on Rubin Report was with Candace Owens 9-10 months ago.

7:45 - went on someone’s show, and host pulled her aside to confess he doesn’t believe the shit he says... could it be old Davey boy

10:00 - talks about a commentator suggesting paying protestors to gin up controversy around her speaking gigs... seems right up Rubin’s wheelhouse.

10:46 - says a commentator doesn’t believe anything he says, says his ideology has completely flipped from a few years ago... wow!

Not to sound conspiratorial, but even if she’s not specifically referring to Dave Rubin, it’s at the least exposing the fakery of Right Wing media. Even though Blair White has done some terrible things, I’m glad she finally grew a spine and said what needed to be said.he was penalized every year lol[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1afqR5QkDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1afqR5QkDM) Also lots of illusions to IDW characters. Definitely a good watch.I'm trying to find the painting of the white planes set against a ringed planet. It's on Dave's set. Anyone know who the artist is or have a link to buy a copy?What’s even weirder about this is that the SCOTUS is the ultimate defender of the constitution that Dave claims to love. You’d think that this issue would be a big deal for him, but no...I'm making this post as a response to the post about left-wing people that Rubin could have on his show. It's true that Rubin's show is kind of boring and repetitive-his guests are pretty much all centre/centre-right "anti-SJW" types. However,  I don't really understand the obsession with getting Rubin to have more left-wingers on his show. After all, left-wing ideas are pretty dominant in the mainstream media, the universities, and so on-why do you need Rubin to give them a platform?

On the other hand, a political perspective that gets almost no mainstream recognition is that of the dissident right-i.e. people to the right of mainstream conservatives like Ben Shapiro. I've therefore compiled a list of dissident right YouTubers who Dave Rubin could have on his show. The list is by no means exhaustive.

According to the theory (and evidence) lower-paid couples are less likely to have one person leaving the workforce than in couples where both partners earn a higher wage.

Accordingly, higher-paid fields like tech and law are more likely to see married women leave the workforce, particularly when both partners are high earners.

On the other hand, when both partners are say, schoolteachers earnings $40k, both are more likely to keep working, because they really do benefit from the second income.

He may not have cited anything during a conversation, but it does not mean that evidence doesn't exist, if you'd care to look for it.

Similarly, I'm not going to go and dig up reading matter for you as part of a off-the-cuff Reddit comment, but that doesn't mean that the theory isn't sound and that supporting evidence doesn't exist.

This may not persuade you. But I'm ok with that.Why do you assume women in lower-paying fields (compared to tech) marry guys who make about the same salary? A female school teacher who makes 40K a year is bound to marry another teacher or public sector worker who makes 40K or slightly more? Can't they also marry investment bankers, lawyers, doctors, tech moguls, etc? 

In another word - how come STEM women tend to find rich guys to marry in much higher % (50% vs. 20% norm)?


It's rather simple if one wants to demonstrate whether the hypothesis works in tech fields. The most important variable is **spouse income**. If you follow the logic of the hypothesis (women marrying men with higher income than they make), all you have to do is show that STEM women who drop out of the field have higher percentage of "rich husbands" than the women in other fields. 

Without the data, it's just an unfounded claim.

I think I'll be skipping this question altogether. I was looking for questions asked in good faith, and yours clearly is not.I disagree but I understand and respect your decision. Just ask my initial question about Trump's both sides argument. Thomas went into attempting to debunk him.Thomas is the man, but this was a weak episode. It's almost impossible to debate when you're each coming to the table with separate sets of facts and different ideologies.

Edit: Be on the lookout for Thomas's debate with Sargon this weekend, I'm assuming somebody will post the full thing. Apparently it got ugly.Jordan Peterson's opinion doesn't take the place of facts and research. Everything you just said is an assertion. You have no solid argument or evidence, and neither does Damore, it's just rhetoric. Strawman. Nowhere was that assumption made. 

Yes: Lower income women who marry higher earning men are *also* more likely to drop out of the labor force. But there is a lower *proportion* of them. 

This is because:

1) They are a larger group and high earning men are a smaller group, and 

2) Lower-earning women are less likely (on average) to marry a high-earning man than high-earning women are.

The reality is that high earning women, like those in tech, are more *likely* to marry high earning men than are women in the general population.

And, as you concede, women who marry high earning men are more likely to drop out of the labor force--regardless of their own income level.

By the end of your reply, you finally get around to the main point: Yes the key variable for women dropping out of the labor force is spouse income. But it is not an *independent* variable:

Women who marry high earning men are more likely to stop working. AND, women in fields like tech are more likely to find a high earning spouse, due to simple proximity, which is a major factor in relationships and household formation.

So the sector the woman works in is a separate variable, but not an entirely *independent* variable. There is a clear causation and causal relationship at play.

And again, just because you are not familiar with the data does not mean it doesn't exist.Rubin claiming that liberals are not liberal is a misguided attempt to try to change the current definition of the word. You seem to echo his opinions without any solid argument for this. You conservatives have plenty of words to describe yourselves and you can keep those. But don't pretend to be liberal, you and the Koch brothers are not. Then where is this data? Let's see it.

You don't have a solid grasp on what it takes to make a claim about causation. The amount of evidence required for such a claim is really high.

You have no data, you have no evidence, you have no facts, and therefore you have no argument. Again, simply saying that evidence doesn't exist doesn't make it so. This is an offhand Reddit comment, not a scientific paper. You can look this up for yourself.

There are just two claims here that have to be empirically true for the argument to be correct:

1) Women who marry high earning husbands are more likely to leave the labor force, and 

2) Women who work in high earning fields are more likely to find high earning husbands.

Without even looking up the evidence for this, do you really believe that either of these claims are false?

I would doubt that you would reasonably challenge either of these common sense assertions unless you yourself have seen data to the contrary. 

(And, seeing that you (incorrectly) don't seem to believe that such data exists at all, I would imagine that you have not seen any such data. Otherwise, you'd likely have already conceded the point.)

Anyway, do you really believe that there is no evidence in the world to support or contradict either of these claims? Or do you really believe you have evidence to refute them?

I'm not here to do your homework for you, especially when Google exists, and especially if I'm not certain you're even arguing in good faith and worth doing that favor for. But if you'd like to look further into the empirical reality of these claims for yourself, I'd encourage you to do so. I'd wager that if you are being reasonable and impartial, you'd likely come to the same conclusion.It's sort of mind-blowing how "you're funded by the Koch brothers!" or "they're funded by George Soros!" has always been this sort of go-to for many partisan conspiracy theorists on either side, but Rubin is literally funded by the Kochs while pretending he's a liberal. Cue the "but but not that kind of liberal!!!". Riiiiiight. Because he's talking about classical liberalism when he says "I'm a gay married man who supports legalization of marijuana, minimum wage and socialized healthcare"...right? LOL

I don't know who the first person to call Dave Rubin "Dave Boob-in" was, but it is so apt.Damore definitely schooled this guy, brutal.Strawman? I thought you were the one invoking strawman with two extreme examples of "schoolteacher couple" and "lawyer/tech couple".

We DON'T have the data. You're not citing a relevant study on STEM women. We only have:

1) **general trend** - women tend to marry men making more than they do

2) **a few episodic observations a la Jordan Peterson** - in a household where the husband makes 200K+, the wife chooses to stay home (you note: *you're making $200k, is another $200k really going to make you happier?*)

Then you single handedly explain away the case of STEM women, which happens to be drastically different from the norm - it's James Damore school of lazy methodology: blank application of "in general" and "on average" to every single phenomenon

It's James Damore's assertion that STEM jobs require "masculine" personality and interest not prevalent among women by the sheer force of biology and nature. The whole industry is driven by prenatal testosterone. This means we're dealing with a group of women very unlike 'average women':

1) STEM women are temperamentally and motivationally different from average women 

2) They tend to have higher drive for success &amp; status than average women -- higher dedication to her career and higher standard for financial comfort

3) A lady in STEM already making a 6 figure doesn't need her husband making much more money than she does - as you say, 200K is a magic number that makes a family of any size live happily ever after.

These are all inferred from Damore &amp; Peterson arguments. If they have even a nominal level of diligence and intellectual curiosity &amp; honesty, they'd admit 50% dropout rates for STEM women need further research and even suggest a study design rather than lazily guessing - *tech women make a lot to begin with so their husbands must be making close to 200K at the least, so they quit*. 

In addition, it's an arbitrary claim that people tend to stop making more money once they hit 200K. 

Another thing they don't consider is the fact that the opportunity cost for a 40K earner is much less than for a 6-figure worker.Except, he didn't?2017, the year when people go to video game dude bros for "insight" on politics.I did write quite a long response to your questions, so some kind of reply would be appreciated :)So it's not entirely his fault after all. Who would have guessed.Also happened on the same email they were using two hours previously.Good thing Trump didn't even come close to even being considered to break that law.He tried to get Shapiro to call himself a classical liberal, it's a thing he does.  I've also noticed a but of a glint in the eye when he says it.he usually gets celebs that barely know what theyre talking about (i loved the richard lewis interview, bc i love richard lewis, but the guy isnt versed in politics)

The Koch brothers don't pay him for nothing. It must be part of his contract to mention how terrible regulations are a certain number of times per upload.Conservatives are the real liberals because that's how words work now What a stark contrast. This Dave Rubin would be branded a regressive leftist trying to shame a good classical liberal like bill oreily for having an opposing opinion.Funky archive permissions so here: https://twitter.com/RubinArchives/status/914891803018571777It's nobody's job other than your own to supply evidence and facts  that attempt to validate your own argument. 

Thinking that I am the one responsible for proving your assertions is categorically false. The burden of proof is on you my friend not me. I am not here to do YOUR homework. But out of good faith, I have spent the last ten minutes googling this in scholarly articles and haven't come across anything that resembles the data or research you are referring to. I implore you that we can have a civil discussion of the issue should you provide some evidence and data. Keep in mind that asserting something is common sense doesn't validate the argument or even show that is common sense. Many things thought to be common sense assumptions are false that's a reason why the scientific method exists. 

I have never claimed data doesn't exist I have merely asked you to share it. *#TheLastLiberal*I wasn't aware Rubin has actual political opinions. I just thought he had sort of the electron-cloud kind of political thought, in that his actual views have no defined position other than "progressives bad, free speech good, give me money."Confirmed that it takes literally zero sentience to know Dave's not "ackshully very left-leaning"It was funny when Smalley told Rubin he sees him as being center or center left because he's not like a Pat Robertson or Glenn Beck, and then Rubin started defending Glenn Beck, and Smalley agreed he's not that bad. CENTRISM.He needs to let Sam Seder on thereIf he's for universal healthcare, as he's stated multiple times, there is no way one could be classified as right leaning economically. No, being against universal health care is a far right position.

In the rest of the 1st world any sane right wing party supports it. They know their population wouldn't support the US's god awful way of doing things. I've posted this recently about Dave's main hypocrisy from my standpoint:

He's made a career out of that double-standard. With conservatives, his priority is to preserve their right to free speech. Talking about Milo, he said stuff like, "I disagree with him a lot, but I think it's important to have those discussions!"
With progressives, he takes the same approach that he objects to when it's used against conservatives - you have every right to say what you want, but I have every right to speak against it.
The only logical way you could reconcile this is to say 'I look out for conservatives more because in today's political climate, they're the group that's under more persecution,' which sounds a lot like something ELSE Dave argues against - victimhood and the "Oppression Olympics".I'm shocked. Shocked I tell you!
I think he is fabricating the Sam Harris stuff. Gotta make those Qatari dollars.Is Sam going on the Joe Rogan Experience?Source of the article: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-media-poll/the-press-branded-the-enemy-by-trump-increasingly-trusted-by-the-public-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1C813LI'm shocked the guy didn't score further right.  He can stop now with his bluster and deception.  It's fine to be a libertarian.  Totally permissible.  Now stop with the claims that you are here to save the liberals from themselves.Dave Rubins gut feeling is more accurate than any professional opinion poll could ever hope to be.When is he gonna change his name to “Dave Rubin Reacts”Uh? I don't see any response from you anywhere.Summation of 1st 13 minutes: I disliked how the media covered a story about me, so when Trump said 'Fake News!', I thought 'everything they say about him must be a lie!'Seder has been smacking the shit outta Rubin lately and it's been so much fun to watch.Which is why Dave will never do it.You can't seriously think Rubin would ever call out that kind of right wing trope. His show would fall apart without them. His audience loves it and his funders - like Prager - do too.I'm hoping it's a short-lived alliance. The fact that he is so cozy with Prager actually bugs me a lot. The man is famous for starting a goddamn propaganda site, ffs. And Shapiro, "Prager jr.", has adapted a lefty phrase, "facts don't care about your feelings", and has given himself free reign to misinform people while claiming his opinions are facts. God I hate those people. Sorry about the rant.Love the comment "I don't like the media, so therefore this is wrong." One can dislike elements of the media structure or coverage, but that doesn't mean that media is inherently wrong/immoral.
But he did work for Prager's propaganda outlet, he's not just cozy.

Honestly, if he sees the market on YouTube shift in a few years, I could see him pretending to have another come to Jesus moment and again transforming into whichever ideology pays at the moment. But the Right is just a fantastic culture in which to make buckets of money for relatively shoddy work.I feel like people are giving Rubin too much of a pass for just sitting there agreeing with this completely insane lady. Everything she said about her project was completely batshit insane and Rubin is quickly turning into an Alex Jones lite.I think corporate 24 hour news is shit, but you can't just throw facts out the window for your feelersNot unless you want to win the battle of big ideas and piss off liberal snowflakes!Rubin let's people talk and let's you decide. If you don't like his style of interview, don't watch him. Once I see a communist on and Rubin nods along, I'll agree with you. But we both know that will never happen. Rubin is obviously partisan and you fail to see so because you agree with him.Who isn't partisan? 

Wait so because he is partisan you come here to troll his subreddit??it's the free marketplace of ideas, big boy. we're free to criticize whatever we'd like.You are just trolling.not at all. This sub let's people talk and let's you decide. If you don't like the sub's style, don't subscribe.This sub is nothing but trolls who hate Dave.What? This line of logic and reasoning isn't good enough anymore? You just used it yourself. This sub has jokes and shit of course, but there's plenty of articulated criticism of Rubin.It's not about his style of interview. He explicitly agreed with her statements and made several statements in support of her insane conspiracy theory. Explicitly agreeing with an insane conspiracy theory and believing it's true, which he did, is not the same as merely sitting back and letting someone explain themselves. Don't know why this is so hard for some to understand.Jesus Christ, dude! Is your whole account purely just to constantly shit on Rubin?
If you hate his format so much and dislike everyone he has on is show, you’re more than welcome to start your own interview show. I’ll even subscribe and watch for support. The more the merrier.Can you clarify? I’m all open for a better understanding of her “insane conspiracy theory”. Just trying to understand specifically what you’re referring to. this is just as relevant to the sub as all the contrapoints videos that get spammed hereI haven't criticized his format a single timewow, this is a well thought out interview between two reasonable peop-

&gt;...you actually had a strategic sort of perspective of somewhat like a communist part , I think it's part of my agenda too. I..I..I want basically I want socialism to win...

When I heard this I knew this guy is your typical ivory tower idiot with a meme ideology and disregarded everything he had to say before it.

Candace Owens is an insane woman who tried to start a doxing database. Predictably she got a lot of insults etc from various people online for doing this. She then spun these insults into an insane conspiracy theory where all these comments directed at her were from Zoe Quinn, who was working with Hillary Clinton and the media to prevent her from unmasking that the racist trolls online are undercover Hillary supporters. Rubin fully bought this insane conspiracy theory, showing that Rubin is too stupid to do a show covering news or politics.Another win for the battle of ~~feels~~ ideasSeder/Brooks are honestly some of the worst political commentators in existence. Boring and they pander to Antifa and regressives endlessly. But this interview was from a different angle, I'll give it that...Who wins? ~~Me and the Koch brothers~~The battle of ideas. That's who.My money is on money. I think he sometimes looks a bit uncomfortable while doing his mental gymnastics to defend stupid shit.Trae CrowderTo be fair this test biases people a few notches down and a few notches left. So Rubin's basically a Neocon after accounting for this bias.He's not for it. He's literally for Obamacare, except he also doesn't like Obamacare.This RedPillBlack thing is literally just her next startup, how can people not see this. All of these people are just grifters.If you want easy-going interview formats with the same types of people without the slimy political agenda, just watch Rogan. He's at least a good conversationalist and funny. 

If you want big discussions about big ideas, there are a million people who do it better than Rubin.I agree, but then you have times like when he seemed genuinely baffled that Dawkins would criticise Trump voters over SJW's. I'm leaning towards him just being having a very simple understanding of reality, but also not being able to give up all that sweet money.I have only watched the videos Sam Sader made on "New Atheists" and their anti Islam rhetoric and I got to know all I need to know about Sader. Sader is no more intelligent than the folks at TYT. All of them are progressive who thrive on identity politics to make any argument. 

Having said that, Dave is guilty of pandering too much to the right wing, and continuing to call himself liberal or "classical liberal". 

Can I just dislike both of them ?I expected a GIF with the red dot constantly moving, but I guess Dave has saved that for the future !His defense for not bringing in progressives is "I have invited them. They are always open for my show, but these regressive SJWs never come to my show". He gives similar argument with only conservatives inviting him to colleges and TV shows. At this point, I know the next 5 sentences that are going to come out of Dave's mouth. He is nothing but a shill for Koch brothers. Has Krauss really said that ? Citation please.He is tye worst representative of the left. Go watch his videos bashing Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins for their anti Islam rhetoric. Honestly Shapiro although very conservative is reasonable and knows what he is talking about, unlike Dave who just repeats his talking points and slogans and Prager who gets orgasm by putting out 5 min propaganda videos !  Ben does have his weakness with religion, Israel and abortion, but hey who doesnt ?https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/thinking-rationally-about-terrorStupid.  He never had a handle on the issues, and still doesn't.  At one point when he was still a center-left liberal he realized it's fun/logical to criticize the worst parts of the postmodern left.  He then shifted to right wing libertarianism, and after that public shift and newfound "relevance" he also found a way to make money off of it.  To me he seems dumb and attention seeking, and stumbled upon the money as a result of that.

It's also really easy to tell that Rubin gets off to thinking of himself as a heavyweight intellectual locked in a fight about muh big ideas.  He has the self important nature of Sam Harris without any of the skill, eloquence and wit.  Dave is like a poor man's Bret Weinstein.  His self-absorbed nonsense about going off the grid and consulting with his intellectual mentors about what he should write.  It's obvious that he also gets off to this shit.Yeah I used to think that tooKinda both. I know it's really hard for us rational people with feelings, but there are actually people (libertarians) who actually believe that the poor is poor because of their actions, that the government shouldn't regulate businesses (even though there's tons of examples of corrupt companies doing lawless things for profit), that they shouldn't pay taxes, that people should pay for their healthcare, education and well-being. Libertarian logic does not exist, it's just a stage when you have so much money that you don't have to worry anyone else, but your money, and the biggest fear is that the government takes away a cut to help those in need. 

Weirdly, I haven't heard anything about libertarians being upset of the police militarisation (from tax money) and the ever growing money-sink called the US Army. Of course they don't say anything about it, because once those who were exploited realise the world they live in, the Army and the police will need to protect those who led or propagated this exploitation. 

On the other hand, there's big money in keeping the illusion of a working society up, so rich guys like the Koch brothers have personal benefits of supporting this libertarian and far-right voices, as they promote the current system. Smart rich people on the other hand, realise that if they give some up from their wealth, they can control the people for much longer (Soros).

And for the rest, there's ideologists who really believe they found the truth, and the only truth, and they want to feel educated, so they watch Rubin report and donate large amount from their salary. it's important not to be annoyed by them, because they just don't know any better. I'm not 100% certain that he's reasonable, though. He has an alarming blindspot for trans issues, which means he hasn't looked into the issue at all. He says that biologically if you're a man (meaning two chromosomes are the only factor), you cannot 'feel' like a woman and v-v. I have no problems conceding that he is intelligent, but that makes it that much more disconcerting to me.Sedar and Brooks are Qatari shills. Contrapoints strikes me as a Russian shill.Never have anyone said less in 5 minutesBoth.  The question is to what degree of either flaw he's filled with.  Have you been on r/libertarian? They may be many of the things you said, but they also hate military spending and militarization of police. They also aren't a monolith. Care to share any substance to back up your accusations? He is an "ivory tower idiot" because he likes socialism? There was not a single appeal to memes in that whole episode. I think you were to quick to judge friend. &gt;There was not a single appeal to memes in that whole episode

socialism is a memeMichael  brooks writes for Al Jazeera which is funded by Qatar. Sedars coverage of MENA events echoes Qatar’s geopolitical agenda. Contrapoints is your standard left anti imperialist who echoes the RT line.You seem reasonable.So not being hawkish on foreign affairs makes you a shill for RT? Incredible logic. Also Contra doesn't really speak about those issues, she is more concerned about American culture. 

As for Al Jazeera America, there is a substantial difference between the American corp and the middle eastern one, although owned by the same parent company, and not everyone who writes two stories for them between 2013 and 2014 automatically becomes a shill. People who write for them always pursue a line related to Qatar’s agenda. No more like echoing RT talking points.Qatar's agenda is promoting egalitarianism in America, and other left wing ideologies? Interesting. More like don’t criticize  Islam and promoting those they believe will work with hem.Right here if you missed it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/daverubin/comments/7317og/a_rubin_patron_is_allowing_me_to_suggest_one/dnnp7rz/I stand corrected and apologise for making that assumption.

However, I noticed you conveniently avoided my other question regarding your whole account purely made for shitting on Rubin.I agree, Rubin should have questioned it more and challenged her story.You've touched on one of the aspects of Dave Rubin that make him so insufferable and irritating.

He makes this arguments from pure idiocy that a 5 year old could come up with credible counters to, and then he and his audience pretend he's just spoken the gospel truth and just made total sense.

How many times has the guest stopped him and given him some counter?  The sad part is because he's had so few liberals on that talked about some of these libertarianish articles of faith, it's usually some of the more reasonable and self aware CONSERVATIVES that have given some of their own push-back.


One time was when he had Guy Benson on his show, and they were talking about how the left controls the culture (as opposed to political power).  Then Guy said something intelligent (it sure as fuck did not come from Rubin), he said that if the right was controlling the culture they would likely be engaging in the same kinds of overreach as the liberals.

ding ding ding !!!!!!!  That, is a self aware human being, that does not have his head so far stuck up his own ass he can't see reality with any kind of more objective frame aside from the left, the left, the left (i.e. Dennis Prager / David Horrowitz).Pray for us poor folk who have been blocked from viewing his twitter :/He's a sellout.

If he was stupid he would be incapable of having a set of beliefs that so carefully treads the line between outright supporting libertarian ideas, avoiding anything displeasing to the right wing while advancing their narratives on the left at the same time.

He might also be a dull knife, but this sort of thing is something that takes legitimate effort to continually do. Otherwise you'd at some point present as something other than a shill even just by accident. 

A principled moron would at some point just slip up and be displeasing to his audience.I do strongly disagree with him on Trans issues. I think that is his religious bias creeping in. Its the same bias that made him go on an hour long rant on Hugh Hefner after his death. Religion does blind people and make people dumber, and Shapiro is the classic example of that. This is Rubin's trademark.What Dave doesn’t talk about: the impossibility of conversation due to NRA giving republican politicians tons of money (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-nra-funding-senators.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;_r=0) and them running propaganda and fake Information to raise the emotions, making conversation impossible. 

Fuck the second amendment, it does not freaking work. I have literally never heard of anyone stopping a serious murder or massacre as a private gun owner. Hunting does not require assault rifles, pistols or submachine guns. Using it as self-defense is only making you a far more dangerous person who is most likely to be killed. 
 I'm sure he could get on if he wanted to. He's good friends with Maron and Rogan is friendly(ish) with Maron as well. If I'm not mistaken all those guys came up in the 80s/90s Boston comedy scene together too.Rubin makes his Right Wing Watch debut(0:39).Is Rubin a useful idiot for the alt-right? Absolutely. An extremist? I don't know about that.Looks like we got some ass hurt TYT fans over here. At least Dave isn't a gigantic fucking turd like Chunk.Huge win in the battle of ideashow could dave rubin fans downvote a post looking for a dave rubin video.....this defense is hilarious&gt; I think it's largely in response to the accusations of the left regarding the Koch brothers. Far more overblown and exaggerated.

So bogus accusations are a-okay in your mind because "They started it" and "It's perfectly fine when my political allies do it"? Double-standards and baseless paranoia are at least part of the reason the contemporary left has been floundering as of late. Believe it or not, but classical liberals (i.e. libertarians) aren't a bunch of baby eating monsters.Liberals being higher in the big five trait openness adds evidence to your observation. There is quite a bit of work in this area. People like Jon Haidt and Jordan Peterson (but you probably hate Peterson like most Rubin haters) might be of interest. See no evil.I don't hate Peterson, just think his following is a bit cultish and his general political alignments are a bit ogrish.  

I saw something with him on Crowder that touched on this point, it was related to Petersons assertion that entrepreneurs were VASTLY more likely to be liberal, not conservative.  Crowder, looking butt hurt at ANY positive attribute or consequence linked to a liberal mindset objected and talked about all the conservative business people he knows, and Peterson corrected him, business people were not the same as entrepreneurs.

He's not all bad, when he talks about more psychology he's much easier to listen to.Don't bother Sam, he's about to go on another one of his internet free "random" vacations until this blows over, like he did the last time Milo's name came up.Okay, taking bets for how Rubin will respond

- Not at all (-240)
- Never endorsed Milo, important to hear all sides (-110)
- Criticize the source[Buzzfeed] (+130)
- White supremacy is natural reaction to regressive left (+180)
- Levels actual criticism against Milo/Bannon/altright (+450)Okay, taking bets for how Rubin will respond

- Criticize the source[Buzzfeed] (+130)
- White supremacy is natural reaction to regressive left (+180)

Milo is actually a good example of the right being an example of the exact opposite of your points because the the right was the ones that ultimately shut him down. You're the only person that thinks this guy is cool, we all see him as being a fake and a shill. Your attempt misses wide right. 

I'm not sure you understand what logical fallacies are, because changing my words with yours isn't a logical fallacy... it's playing with words like you're a child playing with alphabet blocks. 

~~Just because you're triggered that we're taking bets on how Rubin will duck, dip, dive, and dodge criticism... that doesn't mean you should get triggered and respond with unintelligible nonsense.~~:DDDDDD:D:DD:D:D:DD:D:D:D:D:DD:D:D:DD:D:D:DD:D:D:D:DD:DD:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:DD:D:D:DD:DDDD:D:DD:D:DD:D 

it was nervous singing (drunk as fuck) with his eyes closed :D:DDD okay, that makes it totally fine, thanks for clarification. You are amazing dude. 
You actin like someone like Dave can't be a bully speaks more about your intellect than it does internet strangers. Yes, it's his constant hammering on lines like this that make him so effective as a tool. Then naive people will say "but...he fucks black people!"

Because some people don't get how pragmatic some of these alt-right/manosphere guys can be.But then, I've actually  seen them outright call him a degenerate but say that he's useful *because* he's gay.  Given who evangelicals just elected as President you'd think people would get it.

But then, maybe some do and are playing dumb.
i'm going with #3. he'll call it a hitpiece from an activist journalistSorry, I don't understand. Why would be a Omar in my identity group? Just because I don't hate muslims irrationally? That's a drag. I judge everyone by their actions, not by their religion or the color of their skin. What identity group does that put me in? I know it must be opposite of yours, but what, which group? 

Also your argument would kinda almost but not really make any sense if I'd be sitting at a pub with Omar Mateen, while he's talking about killing gay people. Did I do that? 

No, you are amazing dude :)The article accompanying this video doesn't list him as one of the extremists. He's in there because he's a useful idiot.Amazing post OP, I couldn’t have said better. Dave really has no clue about it, and that’s a fact. But I feel like his attacks on liberalism is now slowly fading and turning into a hate on progressive ideas as a whole. It’s what his audience and supporters hate and want to hear criticism on. They couldn’t keep beating the dead horse by saying liberalism is awful because liberalism is hardly in control and I feel like (without evidence [except that social media and current events polarize and sometimes radicalize people]) less people define themselves as liberals. 

But in the end it’s important to remember that Rubin Isn’t starting a conversation about anything. He’s creating confusion and provides a false/alternative narrative on which the alt-right (alt-light/new-center/libertarians) can build their message upon. His distrust in media isn’t a problem in itself, but he doesn’t ask questions but provides justification for the audience to continue consuming false media. 

Yeah anyway great post OP!No, what I meant was that right-wing media and activism has been correctly accused of being bankrolled and astroturfed by billionaires such as the Kochs, Mercers, and Murdoch. Because these accusations expose how hollow and directed much of right wing discourse is, they needed to find a figure to serve a parallel role on the left. Soros seemed to fit that role well, and his heritage made it easy to synthesize the evil billionaire narrative with already present anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.I was saying the accusations against Soros were overblown and exaggerated.Rubin is intellectually incapable of discussing ideas. So he is limited to discussing labels and tribalist categories of people.

Watch what debacle happens when he's trying to talk about an idea like health care. He displays comical levels ignorance. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/daverubin/comments/6hv1u5/dave_rubin_doesnt_understand_what_single_payer/TYT is way too contrived and reactionary for me.  And no, that's not what this sub is.  It's mostly center-left liberals that saw promise in Dave and are annoyed that he keeps associating us (sane liberals ) with his libertarian circle jerk. Hahahahah you actually think the Clinton-Liberals are sane? Oh man they are coming up with more conspiracy theories every single day about Russia than Alex Jones does about 9/11!Some of the Russia hysteria is unhinged, yeah, but it's clear from the emails that Trump associates were overjoyed by the prospect of help from Russians.  You're defending a guy who didn't interrupt a guest when he called Obama a "communist" as being more sane than actual centrists and center-left liberals.Oh and do you enjoy Sally Kohn aka David Pakman's whining?I want to see how Rubin backpedals from this without losing all that sweet wingnut welfare money he's been getting. There's now at least two Holocaust revisionists that have been on the Rubin Report and received nothing but praise from Rubin.That was a terrifically reasoned and thorough explanation of the criticisms of Rubin. Thanks for sharing. To begin with, political labels have always been poor approximations for individual positions. Finding an individual who subscribes to all tenants of an ideology and none other is remarkably hard. 

I can't say that I know what Rubin is thinking, but it seems to me that he calls himself a classical liberal to combat those who use the liberal label while holding, as you've pointed out, illiberal positions. In a sense, this probably has more to do with the politics of the Left (capital "L") than with Rubin's actual positions. 

Gay people were sent to concentration camps and killed. To deny this fact is Holocaust revisionism. Okay. Deleting comment.Watch him "go off the grid" now to avoid discussing this. D'Souza is either impossibly stupid or impossibly cynical. I honestly can't tell whichBreitbarts staff is more diverse than the Huffington Post. Why would anyone believe they were white nationalists??Have you read this? https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.brgw7zz1Q#.taLOpxx7vAn opinion piece by Buzzfeed?Lol, an opinion piece? Did you read it? What do you think about Breitbart soliciting input from neo-Nazis and white supremacists? That is a claim of fact, not opinion.The article claims a gay Jew is the leader of this white supremacist movement. 

I get Reddit and this sub is extremely far left, but you have to at least base some of your ideas in reality. 
I don't really care what paranoid insecurities you are projecting on the article. I care about what you feel about the actual factual claims made in the article. So, do you deny that Milo solicited input from neo-Nazis and white supremacists? Yes or no.&gt; base some of your ideas in reality.

They are based off emails and actual interactions between Milo and white supremacists, you idiot.Even without the recent article about Milo and Breitbart's coordination with white nationalists, Steve Bannon himself has already said Breitbart was the platform of the alt right. The "left" in America has gone completely insane. I went to Trump rallies with my friends and we are all different races, religions and two are gay.

We had privileged white middle class men and women wearing masks calling us Nazis. Yup just us gay, Hispanic, black, Asian Trump supporting Nazis.

Just because you disagree with someone. Doesn't mean they are racist or a white nationalist. That opinion piece was devoid of any facts. what are you talking about

you said this:

&gt;Why would anyone believe they were white nationalists??

And we link to an article detailing all the alt-right, white nationalist coordination and I point to Steve Bannon literally calling Breitbart a platform for the alt-right. Instead of addressing this reality you go off about people getting erroneously labeled nazis. Well that's not what happened here. Carrying water for the alt-right because you think they're "on your side" is a bad look, dude.You linked to an opinion article that claims a gay Jew married to a black man is the leader of the alt right. That level of cognitive dissonance is impressive.You can't really be that fucking stupid, can you? They provided the actual e-mail traffic between Milo, Weev, and others. As far as I know Milo hasn't denied they are legit. You haven't read the piece, have you?I can't be racist, some of my best friends are black.Dude. Read Milo's response to the article. He acknowledged these were his emails. Even Milo didn't deflect and pretend it's all bunk as you have with no evidence beyond "he's a gay jew that married a black guy". There are literally emails from Bannon talking about how great Milo's identity is and how useful it is to push their narrative, so people just like you can pretend everything's a-okay. Sorry, but your boy knowingly collaborated to mainstream racist, anti-semitic alt-right douchebags.My son is black. Kinda different than a friend.I read the opinion piece.I don't really give a fuck. If you give cover and make excuses for white supremacists, then you do nothing but hurt your son.So you think it's opinion that Milo amd Breitbart collaborated with White Supremacists?I would never hurt my son, or any child for that matter. You need to step out if your world of hate and anger. Try to think rationally. &gt;As far as I know Milo hasn't denied they are legit.

You are right he hasn't denied them. In fact, he immediately acknowledges that the emails are indeed his.

&gt;Recently I learned that Buzzfeed had acquired a large volume of my private emails. Within them are conversations with friends, colleagues and loved ones going back some years.

https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/1025276980943530&gt;Try to think rationally.

This is rich, man. Milo acknowledged the emails are his and the emails clearly state his and Bannon's intention to mainstream racist, anti-semitic alt-right horseshit and you want to put your head in the sand.And maybe you need to consider how your actions can hurt those you care about, intentional or not. Empathy is a virtue.What actions have I take that have hurt anyone?Provide cover for truly awful people and try to wave away facts because they're inconvenient for you.☝️ This, right here.That was an incredibly vague answer with no actually substance. Want to try again?

Lol now I'm restricted from posting on a Dave Rubin subreddit where I am probably the only Dave Rubin fan here.How many times do we have to explain this to you? My response was not vague at all.What happens if I think that the Nazis were socialist? So because you don't like the President, I've hurt people I love? Do you think before you type these ridiculous statements?Do you deny that Bannon, Milo, and Breitbart collaborated with neo-Nazi's and White Supremacists? Yes or no.Everyone is a white supremacist. It's such a childish argument.who the fuck is talking about Trump? answer /u/rymurphy12's recent questionQuit evading and answer the question. Do you deny that Bannon, Milo, and Breitbart collaborated with neo-Nazi's and White Supremacists? Yes or no.I would recommend you read some history because you would be very wrong.Ditto https://vimeo.com/96662008
What history books do you read? Kitty Werthmann was there she say otherwise. The Nazis were socialist. They came to power through socialist policies. Because this sub is people who are paid to be upset over someone who is paid to host libertarians on his showIt didn't claim that, but forget about any "claims" or "opinions" in the article, and just look at the facts and documents in it. Specifically, the section about Milo's correspondence with Devin Saucier, an open white nationalist. Milo called Saucier his best friend, wanted to give him a gift of a novel signed by a famous author, and made plans to see a Wagner opera together (fitting). Saucier gave Milo an article idea, which Milo made a top priority, publishing it the next day. These are documented facts: Milo had a personal friendship and professional collaboration with an avowed white supremacist. I'm not evading anything. You accuse anyone who disagress with you of being a white supremacist. The reality is there is less than 5,000 white supremacists left in America. 

However there is an amazing rise in anti white racism. You're wasting your time linking crackpots to me. I've seen all this before. Oh Jesus, quit being a coward. If you think I am being too eager with calling people Nazis, simply say you don't think people like Weev are neo-Nazis. If I am wrong, have the courage to explicitly say they are not NazisYou are incapable of learning? Or maybe you wanted to let me know what history books you read. #alternativefactsi don't get it but I'll just choc it up to more upset SJW sissy like usualthe term white nationalist doesn't mean anything, what are what people not allowed to be proud of their country?This should be pinned to the top of this page as a go to for people who want to know why people don't like Rubinliberals dont know what liberalism means.....that's why they keep trying to silence other people's opinions and attack everyone who disagrees, and don't go "oh those just aren't liberals" they make up the majority of your political base at this point....they define YOU.....not the other way around

kinda like this sub actually, downvote me piggies =)actually this tweet is 100% accurate. one of hitler's best friends and leeader of the SA was ernst Romm and he was gay. Up until that point the nazi had a very prominent group of gay men in it but it wasn't until the rise of Himmler that hitler was forced to make a choice between appeasing the ultra conservative german army and himmler or siding with his old friend romm.....he chose power over friendship and purged the SA in what became known as the night of long knivesthe nazi were socialist, they had socialist programs, its right in the fucking name

just own it you socialist nazi youSo your logic is that it's right to say Hitler wasn't anti-gay because he had gay friends. Gay friends says more about his stance on gay people than the fact he sent gays to concentration camps in your mind.the tweet does not deny the concentration camps, it only applies the foundation for more complex nuiance. Hitler was not anti gay until after himmler rose to prominence in the party and wanted to see the gay members of the SA (which were very publicly prominent) ousted from the nazi party

indeed this conversation has nothing to do with the holocaust at all....neither does the tweethe persecuted the gays for political power, not personal reasons

its not an important distinction but I find your revisionist and simplistic history disturbingWhat difference does it make why he did it? He was clearly anti-gay no matter what the motivation was. you don't hear about it because the media has an agenda to push and every time it happens they don't talk about it

it literally happened 7 days ago as a muslim refugee (who would have been blocked by the travel ban if it had gone into effect when it should have) tried to shoot up a church, and this man stopped him 

http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/25/meet-the-good-guy-with-a-gun-who-stopped-a-mass-shooting-at-nashville-area-church/the motive matters alot, he didn't have a personal problem

now if he had said "hitler is a friend to the gays" THAT is where we stop him and go "no"

more importantly it isn't just that the distinction doesn't matter....its that YOU got MAD at it....even though its true

you didn't want to hear it, you tried to silence it, the people in this sub tried to silence itNow you're arguing it's right to say that someone that tried to exterminate gay people wasn't anti-gay. Do you not see how absurd your attempt at a semantics argument is? Since when is being proud of your country white nationalism?[This guy](https://imgur.com/vuVfulz)/u/pfabs, I am having a hard time understanding why you can't answer my question. Why are you afraid of saying whether or not  people like Weev are white supremacists? Take a stand. It isn't that hard. All you are doing is exposing how craven you are.I answered your question. Just because you disagree with someone, doesn't make them racist. 

Edit: just reading about this weev guy. Seems like he is an intentionally offensive guy. The logical response to the excessive PC culture push.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeevSo, just to be clear, you don't think any of the people in the article are white supremacists, correct?Also, in regards to Weev, since you believe he's only a troll and a logical response to PC culture, I take you feel the same about about the Daily Stormer, the outlet he writes for Some might be genuine white supremacists. There are those people in the world. I don't think we dismiss them entirely because they are racist.

Would you dismiss Al Sharpton completely? He is a very mainstream racist who has or had a show on MSNBC, despite his very racist and hateful views. Google it. You have no idea what white nationalism is. Idk much about weev, I just quickly read about him. He might be a racist, ye might just be a troll. 

Daily stormer is a straight up racist site. So is the Grio but nobody seems to mind that sight because it is racism from black people. See, was that too hard? To be fair, I think all racists should be dismissed. Some ideas are not worth our time to take seriously. And yeah, I think that way about Sharpton, too.So how do you feel about the black man who has made friends with previous kkk members? 

Imagine if he had just dismissed them because they were in the kkk. Instead he treated them as people and he showed them respect and they learned not to hate him for his skin color. 


I think black lives matter is an evil racist group. But I don't dimiss the members because of their hatred. I still respect them as people even if they hate me because of my skin color. Its great that he did it, but I really don't care if he did or did not. He has no responsibility to be reasonable towards them. I look at what the groups beliefs are and I judge them based on that standard. Sure, BLM has some assholes, but BLM has a lot more legitimate grievances then say the KKK. What legitimate grievances does blm have? The media makes a bigger deal out of black people shot by cops than white people. &gt;He might be a racist, ye might just be a troll.

How can you say Weev might just be a troll and immediately follow it with this?

&gt;Daily stormer is a straight up racist site.

Weev is the system administrator of the Daily Stormer. He has a swastika tattoo. This guy is taking trolling to the next level I guess.

I realize that you think white supremacist gets used too broadly. I agree, it does. But don't let that cloud your judgement and excuse actual white supremacists. I use to work for a very "Jewish" company. Privately owned, everyone was Jewish, I'm not. It was a job.

Weev being a system administrator for the daily stormer doesn't mean he agrees with everything they say. The economy never truly recorverd from the 2009 downturn despite the previous administrations claims. People need jobs.He wrote for the Daily Stormer. He's said he's a white nationalist. [He has a fucking swastika tattoo.](http://images.gawker.com/nj67o1k89tg62jyycwhf/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636.jpg) What more do you need exactly? What does it take for you to agree that someone is a white nationalist? Because apparently a swastika tattoo and literally saying "i'm a white nationalist" is not enough. You've really gone off the deep end defending heinous fucking bigots despite the blinding evidence.Idk if a tattoo is enough to claim someone is a white nationalist. Lots of people get tattoos they regret This guy's thesis is kinda valid, but there's a reason he doesn't have many lefty progressives on the show, they all conspire to not appear on shows like his, shows that don't toe the party line, they'll get shamed by their lefty friends, get told that they have cooties or something. It's a problem with the left that they cut off human connection. (I guess the right can do that too but the left does it with gusto nowadays)Who? Sam Seder has tried to appear. Other than that, the lefties Dave invites are so far out of his scope it's laughable. lol you're not even trying anymorethat's what nationalism is,.....literally that's it.

"white" nationalism is just the latest thought suspending buzzwords of the far leftits not semantic at all, his personal beliefs was not anti gay, its not a big deal....just accept it&gt;i'm an anarchist

&gt;says conservatives can't make culture because they're boring and say "i never saw this before so I don't like it"

yep another right winger alright, another episode of Rubin's echo chamberTrying to reason with you is very hardI imagine it would be difficult when you have no evidence or counter-argument beyond "nuh-uh"I don't see your point, the whole idea is that identity politics is bad.....but it works

so it makes sense that they would begrudgingly consider it. the difference is they aren't all like YEE HAW LETS JUDGE PEOPLE the way the democrats do

I think that's an important distinctionRubin is lying to you. There are people on the left that have asked to come on and he declined. He generally doesn't try to get left wing people on.maybe the libertarians are the only ones who can save the leftFine, I could even buy that.  That Dave/other libertarians think what the left needs is some constitutionalism.  I disagree, but valid view.  He has to stop claiming he's still a liberal I'd my point.  It hasn't been true for a very long time. well the people who think they are liberal are either communists or fascists now, and the people who call themselves libertarians are actually liberal

such are the timesThat is worrying if true. I hope Dave is aware enough to read this stuff and address it on the show.Or he's obfuscating. They do that tooDo you have evidence of this? So far I only have your word, and I have no fucking clue who you are. Spineless. That's the perfect word. I'm not expecting him to interrupt, scream, insult or be an ass. But I do expect bullshit to be called out. One **must** identify falsehoods. Or you are just a puppet with a hand up your ass. It's not just the ones that have been asking to be on the RR. With funding from Learn liberty do you really think he's going to invite someone like Naomi Oreskes on to talk about the history of libertarian  and right wing thinktanks going above and beyond to discredit the science of Climate Change? 
Of course not, the Rubin Report doesn't want to broadcast that type of stuff. He sold out to push a narrative and create an intellectual safe space because that's what's paying more money at this stage.https://twitter.com/SamSeder/status/916288475032379392
https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/848594728446722048

And interestingly the writer of the recent Milo exposé asked to come on after Rubin attacked him https://twitter.com/Bernstein/status/882651339360219137It's true https://www.reddit.com/r/daverubin/comments/74xynt/another_takedown_of_rubins_dishonest/do2jpm3/

Rubin won't address it because he's dishonest and he lies to youDammit. Just when I thought I had the top rated comment in that thread!

Holy shit this dude personifies the problem with the Rubin Report. Spineless fucking cowards. So now writing for the Daily Stormer, calling yourself a white supremacist and having a swastika tattoo isn't enough to warrant being called a nazi. Those pesky SJWs better behave though or I'm sure you'll hold them accountable.I said he might be racist. I don't know if he is or isn't. Black lives matter has main stream support and nobody seems to care.

I can't control what is in someones and I will never try to.You're  missing the point. Yes, these radical ideologies are on the left, you can even say they're taking over the left, but they do not fall under Liberalism. In fact they're  criticisms of liberalism. Look at the academia behind them, and you'll see that they freely admit this. For instance Marx wasn't a liberal, in fact his whole schtick was to offer a critique on liberalism. 
Liberalism has a clear definition. So I can say "those aren't liberals", because often, if those are really educated about their position, they would actually admit so, maybe even proudly. They can't make up liberalism if they are opposing it. So go ahead and say they now define the left if you really want to, but they don't define liberalism, they are against it.
This is what neither you nor Rubin seem to understand i have not heard any of the people accused of being a "white nationalist" say that. I don't think they exist in any real capacity

just like the democrats overuse the words racist, sexist, homophobic, islamaphobic, transphobic....I could go on....but I won't.....but I could

just another buzzword for the easily manipulatedwikipedia is not a source and as already discussed you need to seperate hitler from the actions of his party

I admit its not a practical difference but its just an interesting discussion worth havingYou know what that means... it's time to have James Woods on the show to talk about being harassed by people like Amber Tamblyn.your post has nothing to do with what we are talking about

nobody made the claim that he VALUES gays....see? wording is important...read more carefully

in any event this headline is a lie, he didn't engage in "holocaust denial"you changed your wording there......hitler picked the many over the few, not overtly anti gay

if you had 9 people tied to a track and one person tied to a track and the one person was black and the other 9 were white you would logically choose to save the 9 people over the one right? if the other one was black would that be anti black? nope just a totally unrelated facti understand that you have failed to equate any of this with "holocaust denial" which is what the headline is

and you have failed to make any of this about him being anti gayyou have no idea what fascism is, don't use words you don't understandyou have no idea what fascism is, don't use words you don't understand

also strawman fallacyyou used a word incorrectly, that's my position. it requires no support

and you used ad hominem, not methose are not buzzwords those are shining beacons of academic integrity, we do not make fallacious arguments. you used the ad hominem fallacy, you insulted someone instead of responding to their argument
you used the strawman fallacy, you claimed that saying you don't know what fascism is is somehow supporting trumpOh please, pedantic douchebag. In colloquial terms, we all know fascism has come to denote an authoritarian government/demagogue; especially one that tiptoes around white nationalism and ponders stripping the free press of credentials over unfavourable stories.never heard of that site before....some of us actually payed attention in ethics class

no arguments needed, he used the word incorrectly like all SJW nowadays, just throwing it around without causeLol, that's the takeaway? So if you want no government at all, but you don't like how conservatives handle social issues, what would you call that? 

I'd say something like a.... libertarian! Haven't seen one of those on the show in YEARS!Its almost like he's paid to not understand. 🤔you are starting to come around to things but your admission does not go far enough, its neither fascist in policy nor in rhetoric, the media takes many things he says out of contextI don't know, but he seems to have some some supernatural ability to predict the worst periods of Trump or right wing snowstorms and take off during those times.  Very convenient.Fascism is when governments assert control over factories without taking their profit margin. it is a combination between capitalism and communism. As mussolini put it "fascism is everything inside the state and nothing outside it"

Everything else you know as fascism is just vague cultural stereotypes of fascism and is better described as authoritarian or totalitarian. There are MANY people who look at what china did there and nod at it approvingly, it is a sign of pragmatism.

empirical evidence is satisfactorylook around at current events you fo intellectual, don't ask for evidence on things that are common knowledgeReminds me of the time Dave said that Milo et al. weren't flirting with white nationalism. We know, Dave. Time to shut your show down. These are the important conversations we need to have. Good job everyonehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUWvKT612M

Watch from 3:20Chris Ray Gun looks like  an ugly version of the kid from the first Jurassic Park.

/thatisallSo what's your point? That the subjects in this article represent everyone who defend free speech because they believe it is a necessary part of American life? Are you saying they are a result of free speech, and that you hate free speech? Are you saying that you think Dave Rubin and others don't know that there are morons saying some of the same things they are saying? Does the existence of said morons mean that arguments they parrot are invalid. Are yours invalid because a some professor out there hit a kid with a bike lock, and because another said he was happy to be teaching "future dead cops?" 

Or are you just an idiot?Centrists aren't protecting fascists, they're protecting freedom of speech. At no point has Dave Rubin agreed that fascists should be able to do fascist things to others, only that they should be able to say fascist things. 

Oh and just so you know... If you don't believe in defending free speech as a necessity, that is something you and the fascists have in common.You either don't have the attention span to watch that entire video, or you just plain can't understand it. He literally outlines all of the counter arguments *against* anything in that video that can be considered propaganda.
gang violence is not ideological, it's raw criminality

right wing violence, much like left wing violence, is political in nature, and more people have been murdered by right wingers in recent times.  Why are you jumping to Europe with the g20?  So now the left in the US is responsible for people in Europe now too?

There is nothing mainstream about nazi punching, a lot of people think it should be done, but there are a LOT of people on the left, and right, that thing some pretty awful things should be done, that is a shit standard to measure things by.Chris Ray Gun has been poisoned by his association with compromised people like Dave Rubin and Sargon.  Their hatreds are laser focused on the left, their political and cultural enemies.  Their supporters are heavily weighted by right wing reactionaries who love to play the victim that is filled with nothing but good and noble people standing athwart those asshole thug leftists.  Never mind that the bulk of us on the left want nothing to do with Antifa, and we never even HEARD of antifa before the last couple of years.

But now Antifa is the mascott of the left?  Fucking please.  Chris is friends with Rubin, so he won't call him on his shit.  It's such a toxic mix of people and antagonism, and it does nothing but assault the political left, that has nothing to do with Antifa or college campus overreach.  So now, not only to so called centrists not get what they might prefer politically, they don't get the changes on the cultural realm either.  Win win for the right, useful tools and idiots.&gt; Great quote, do you have some original ideas or are you just repeating what centrists feed to you?

That's cute. I like the standards you have now set for yourself. Although, to be honest you probably don't know that you've set them, because if you think there is much of anything original in Western political rhetoric, you're probably not very educated...as you repeat lines I've heard a million times before, by the way.

You just contradicted yourself. You're not for free speech, because regulating hate speech is pandora's box. You're for regulating hate speech while your side of the aisle greatly expands what constitutes hate speech, but that's what feels good to you in the shortsighted future. And for some reason you actually think you're the only ones who will be playing that game. Regulate "hate speech" and soon enough the religious fundamentalists on the right will start considering widely popular beliefs on the left hate speech, and they will legislate it, and they will use legislation you support as an excuse to pass their own. "Religion causes death and destruction." "Religious people tend to be less educated." All arguments widely fomented by the left, and yet as soon as the other side has power they'll turn your new hate-speech weapon against you and your own side will start taking hits for "hate speech." 

What you're for is a descent into polarized totalitarianism. Meanwhile, Richard Spencer drew a crowd of like....5 people with his latest shenanigans, because the more Americans hear him talk the less they like him.&gt;It makes a lot of sense that male feminists are more likely to be creepy bastards while raging against the patriarchy and FUCKING WHITE MALES in public. Pretending to be a feminist is appealing because you can get close to potential victims and they already have their guard down because you're an "ally".

&gt;You should be very suspicious of male feminists, they are at the very least low-test fuckboys and at worst serial sexual assaulters.


That's a lot of anger you're nursing there, buddy.It's okay. You can downvote and run away. In terms of rhetoric, you've used nothing but pathos. You have no logos, you are not rational, you are not educated, you are not enlightened, these are just the things you're pretending to be because the people you blindly follow are doing the exact same thing. Go read Aristotle. Go read Plato. Beef up on logic and reason, and then you still can't have the arrogance to seek out people who are already well read and approach them as if you are their betters, because you still have a lot more to learn. Until then you have nothing but the false authority of your holy church behind your inquisition. Preach on oh holy one, you knoweth the way.I'm not even sure how much change is possible. The audience's bent, the partnership, and aversion to talk from other parties, is a pretty rough situation. 

Building an alternative might be a possibility, but I don't see certain key issues changing even with another show. 

Oh, and thanksI think he's disinterested in sniffing it out. 

If he had an interest, and did, we'd still have the issue of certain groups refusing to talk to anyone who won't unerringly support them. 

It'd be an improvement with a better host, though. A college professor is left wing. Imagine my shock. Same old stuff. Not surprising in any way.Can I get a source on that? I'm not trying to disprove your claim, but it would be a good thing to bring up in addition to the "learn liberty" thing. Do you just mean that Dave made a video that's on PragerU?A fuckin' ZeroHedge again?! You really can't find a better source than this conspiracy-peddling, a big assumption making, no evidence providing, falsehoods-ridden, shitty blog post disguising as a journal with a fight club character as an author?!Yeah, I read it. Sorry for the sentiment, just an hour or so ago i had to defunk some cospiratorial shit written on that website provided by (suprise, suprise) some neo-nazi. You could have just listed the original source and not to give this "journal" undeserved attention.

Also I didn't check the Cheong article factually, but now I might, since he is such a fraud and uses 4chan as a reputable source for his articles (remember when he claimed that communist was responsible for charlottesville killing, because he founded it on 4chan and didn't varify it? He's not a proper journalist and he has shown in the past that he takes things out of context quite regularly).If true, this is insanely fucking dumb buuuuuut it's infuriating rubin will probably give this story some air time but not talk about Roy Moore who will be a senator. A senator who hated gays and Muslims. Oh but I forgot, the right doesn't care about homosexuality and islamophobia is a made up.
the show cant be biased, it never claimed to be perfectly neutral. (the word bias does not mean you don't have an opinion it means you have an outside influence acting on you).

Dave is a person, a person with views, don't like his views? stop watching himWhen Dave describes his show as being "the battle of ideas" and then hosts one side of the debate (usually far/alt-rightish people) it's fair to say he's biased .you literally used the word biased wrong, it is not a synonym for unfairNo I didn't. The point of my post is that Dave premises his show on being a battleground of ideas pertinent to a Western (predominantly US) audience.  This should imply having discussions from a wide range of political backgrounds. However, it's no secret that Dave's guests are biased toward an alt-right/classical liberal mindset.

My post says nothing about it being "unfair".

You need to stay away from those Molyneaux philosophy lectures.I've never seen a funny conservative comedian. People love Dana Carvey and Jerry Lewis but they were before my time and when I saw some of their work, not a fanIs it about how the alt right are nazis? And how nazis were socialist because it was in their name?This is basically the Rubin equivalent of when Bill Maher invited Ken Bone onto his show. These are both people who made a video that made people chuckle to themselves for a few days. They don't contribute anything to discourse. They aren't any more deserving to come onto a show for an interview than any private citizen or uneducated celebrity.So basically what I said. It's a common trope amongst the right that the Nazis were awful because they were secular. And the whole individualism vs collectivism trope is also used to smear progressives.
Also the alt right is literally filled with Nazis while the left wants UHC. Fuck this dude's shitI don't think anyone cares. It's that he's a piece of shitEventually all these right wing assholes including Dave will realize that they'll need government to enforce free speech.
He's got a shitty show but it has an audience, so he should be paid so he can eatYou have to remember one thing about conservative ideologies, of which Dave Rubin has aligned himself and adopted many of their WORST tactics.  Everything that is not aligned with their ideology is classified as part of the left, and essentially a HOLY EVIL.

People on the right are just and noble, people on the left are wicked and anti american and hate freedom.  But Prager is quick to point out that he does not view "liberals" as being the same as the left.  What kind of liberals is he more tolerant of?  Classical liberals.  Basically libertarians.  

Dave bought into this crap too.  He wants nothing to do with any part of the left, takes his social liberalism as a sign he is still part of the tribe when that is no longer a differentiator for almost anyone under 35.

You could swap a couple words from Moby Dick and maintain the same sentiment in the mind of Prager and his ilk.

All the most maddens and torments, all that stirs of the lees of things, all truth with malice in it, all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain, all EVIL to crazy Prager is visibly personified and made practical assailable in "THE LEFT"Right, over the past 40 years the power of the consumer has decreased exponentially....and it wasn't all because of government Right. As much as I dislike Dave, YouTube is being insanely abusive of their power. Guys like him bring in views and ad revenue. Not to mention actually good creators with good causes are being screwed Have we now?  What is the political left?  To listen to Dave Rubin and Sargon and every other right wing demagogue you'd think the sum total of "the left" just wants to shut peoples speech down, deplatform speakers, put on masks and engage in violence like Antifa, tramble on religious liberties, etc etc


"The Left" to such people is a near monolith, a sort of HOLY evil that must be cut out from society and set to flame.

Is that really the sum total of the left though?  Or a useful caricature from self interested parties?  I say it's the latter of course.  I am of the left, I was pushing back against people trying to shut peoples speech down when people like Rubin were still cuddling up to Cenk on tyt.  I deliberately go out of my way to listen to conservatives talk, as a liberal, to hear what they have to say.  And you would not BELIEVE the shit they say and believe about us.  The lies and exaggerations are out of control.  But that is by design, this is part of a cultural reactionary movement to push back against the left.  The right has less effective tools against many left leaning policy goals like universal healthcare, so they have to rely on other wedges to draw peoples attentions away from policy and onto culture schisms.  

Rubin has aligned himself with this reactionary movement, and he should be damned for it.&gt; Jesus fuck the kids on this subreddit are idiots.

says the guy who actually thought i was seriousSorry, thought it was outrageous enough for people to realise it was a joke. Guess i was wrongIt is. The government can protect workers for being gay, having political opinions, saying negative things about their jobAnd now he shills for Learn Liberty. I wouldn't let one's political allegiances preclude one from media platform, especially because left-wing outlets like to have the token low-hanging fruit (no homophobic pun intended) like Dave (and vice versa with the right).Oh please, what is incorrect in my statement?He is a shill for Learn Liberty; like following that Koch brother money in attacking Ralph Northam in the Virginia gubernatorial campaign and making half-baked comments against environmental regulations.

You wanna see talking points? Go over to Dave's AMA at the Classical Liberal subreddit and see first-hand evidence of vacuousness and trite talking points of a pseudo-intellectual trying (and failing) to regurgitate libertarian talking points. The guy can't even answer simple questions. 

Also, I'm not sure the purpose of you citing Marc Lamont Hill or why this conversation kept going as I was merely pointing out that one can be on left-leaning shows like TYT and still be a shill for the other side. 

BTW, genius, it's spelled "sponsor" not "sponser". I have no fucking clue what you're talking about.Who are we shilling for? The SJWs? The regressive left? Oh yes. It must be the regressive left. Every knows the regressive left pays its operatives so well.I'm not a socialist. Also, if you thought I was a socialist (which I am not), why would you suggest that I'm a shill? Those two things ("working for free like a good socialist" and "shilling") do not follow. 

You haven't really thought this through, have you? Lol. I'll let you go figure this out. &gt;Wow you got me. A socialist could never be a shill 

I didn't get you. You got yourself.


&gt; Enlighten me as to why you follow a sub for a guy that seems to twist your panties so bad.

Tell something, did you visualise that -me in panties? You did, didn't you. Lol. Well, at least we know why you're here. Oh right. Sorry. I was using my regressive leftist tactics in asking.This is worse imo. He always defends people like ben Shapiro who calls people who defend planned parenthood baby murderers but is very tepid when people commit actual murder
https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/927334084581277697Politics is inherently nasty. Bet you'll never see Dave defend Democrats when someone like Ted Cruz of Trump say that the blood is on the hands of democrats after an undocumented person hurts a citizen
https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/927334084581277697If this guy was a Muslim Dave would've lost his shit and started talking about how Trump's ban is really part of the "New Center" LMAOAlso, is Rubin going to criticize his friend Ali A. Rizvi for saying something very similar on Twitter? Is Ali A. Rizvi also a vile human being in his eyes? 

https://twitter.com/aliamjadrizvi/status/927960579863711746Fuck this. RS basically called him worthless. You treat Nazis like the piece of shit they areDon't lie: Dave would call him regressive left for not letting the Nazi finish why is dave doing a random drama show?dave  being a centrist, cant even control the show lolhttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/336161378496937985/377607832184422401/tgrffrfr.png?width=451&amp;height=442https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/336161378496937985/377610574135296000/o8iyugtrrf.png?width=784&amp;height=441I'm really enjoying this.

Like, he's in every quadrant.  I'm in a quadrant.  So much in commonShe's a conservative.  She says so.&gt;internet culture I didn't understand!

This is exactly the same as the OSU girl who did a PR tour with noelplum/Sargon etc.  Do you really expect someone to believe she doesn't know what the Internet is?

Additionally: muh deep web.  This is exactly how a fake expert business person would act....She knew it was spooky. I guess that's what it means. It's the spooky sites!I'm with you, but your description of Rubin reminds me of letting a dire wolf guard a pen of lambs.The Rubin Report FINALLY delivers !!!!!!!!!

I LOVE it when conservatives fight!&gt; 98% alt-left

just cause you can invent words doesn't mean they exist
BLM hasn't killed any cops.Lmao. They jailed socialists and communists, explicitly saying their agenda wasn't Marxist and cooperated with business interests but alright. Richard spencer looked like the fucking dumbass he is in this video. No time to be calm around Nazis.Even the random thumbnail shows Molyneux with those crazy eyesWould you rather be Harvey Weinsteins great grandson and be rich as fuck knowing he raped your great grandma? Probably but still, fuck that guy How do you figure?This is a symptom Dave's shitty interview style he never pushes back and never truly wants to disagree with someone, to the point where he will put words into their mouth, for example he said candace feels bad about the whole thing when she really didn't. He is a weak interviewer and anyone with half a spine that pushes back on people wouldn't have let this continue for an hour and a half , I listened out of cringe....

This sums up the Social Injustice Warrior movement, they are more triggered than their SJW counterparts and give the right a pass for just about everything...No fault of his own? No not buying it, Rubin just has this permissive interview style where he lets his guests steamroll all over him without once pushing back ... He was so ineffective cause hes a genuinely bad interviewer and general all around alt-lite mouthpiece .... He is just a weak man who lacks a spine, watch him dance around his atheism for patreon dollars on youtube.hes kidding around you must be triggered haha. This is his own fault his crappy interview style came back to bite him in the ass. He just sits their and accepts whatever his guests do, this simply wouldn't happen on most other shows, I would have ended it and never posted this. He is just spineless.He does deserve it after years of sitting back and permissively giving a pass to vile people like Katie Hopkins, it finally came back to bite him. Notice how he is always trying to just agree with everyone and never actually takes a principled stand, he says whatever he needs to keep the patreon gravy train going. Watch the Pakman interview if you havent already and you will see how intellectually vapid and spineless Rubin truly is.Dave "You aren't really a white supremacist you jsut like Western Culture and want to see it remain the way it is right? And your nazi salutes you are just waving to your mom !"

Dave is a vapid alt right apologist.You all are being a bit too simplistic about this one, ethnicity is so muddled given the history of civilization in the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Levant.... You see Rome like pretty much every other empire was multi-ethnic and race had no bearing on being considered a citizen of rome, The UK much the same , multiple cultures were co-opted into the tapestry of being a UK subject. The UK which in turn was heavily influenced from the Roman incursions is so varied with substrates of different ethnic groups that it is absurd to generalize that their is some uncorrupted english ethnicity. There were periods of more static non-interruption of what would popularly be conceptualized as English ethnicity but seeing as they were subjects of rome for quite a while there was actually quite a bit of ethnic diversity. The only difference between black subjects of the UK and white ones is that they stick out more but black immigration into the UK goes back to the 1500s and the seafaring ways of the british and their adventurism produced a lot of ethnic diversity in the same way every dominant empire has had. Think of the great North African kingdoms like Egypt, and the mali kingdoms; the persians who were incredibly progressive and permissive and allowed other religions and cultures to be interwoven into the tapestry of persian identity; the period of arabic dominance during the dark ages included large parts of iberia and at points had subjects in france; the Romans were a multi racial society that survived in part in the west due to the fact that they had hundreds of groups of people and far reach across ethnic barriers; America is the same way there was always a substantial population of freed and enslaved blacks enough for american culture to be inseparable from black culture. The UK is much the same your post implies some static notion of ethnicity that is based on "racial" sub groups. 

Ethnicity does exist mainly in the cultural sense but the changing of hands of world power and ideas for the past 2000 years has produced way too much movement and integration for you to say British ethnicity is tied exclusively to the angles and the Saxons whilst ignoring the other Germanic tribes and the Mediterranean and hell even arabic influence on the whole of Europe. Ethnicity is the melding of all these varied factors under the banner of a country or place and in most instances with large empires it simply cannot be entirely tied to one group.

Also your post forgets the sheer magnitude of Norse influence in dark age Europe and how the kings of Europe were essentially vikings including William of Orange in 1066, he was a viking and there were norse settlements in england and massive incursions into the country prior to that period reaching back hundreds of years.In 866, Norse armies captured York, one of the two major cities in Anglo-Saxon England.[21] In 871, King Æthelred of Wessex, who had been leading the conflict against the Vikings, died and was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Alfred the Great.[21] Meanwhile, many Anglo-Saxon kings began to capitulate to the Viking demands, and handed over land to the invading Norse settlers. In 876, the Northumbrian monarch Healfdene gave up his lands to them, and in the next four years they gained further land in the kingdoms of Mercia and East Anglia as well.[21] King Alfred continued his conflict with the invading forces, but was driven back into Somerset in the south-west of his kingdom in 878, where he was forced to take refuge in the marshes of Athelney.[21]


So just in this massive Norse culminating in the final invasion in 1066 influence you have the french coming in who were influenced by Rome to a severe degree, and you have various groups of Scandinavians who eventually became the rulers of Europe and intermixed with most of West Europe.

In fact if you look up Cnut the Great he had an empire that engulfed the majority of mainland England (from lower wessex at the bottom of the isle all the way up to scottland) and stretched into norway lower sweden and denmark, plus the settlements on the british isles by other groups.

So just between the fall of England and 1066 you have dozens of competing "ethnic" groups influencing what really shouldn't be called "anglo-saxon" britian .... 

These things are incredibly complicated and ethnicity is useful because it cuts through all of the massive integration and conquest and gets to a common core of experience that melds hundreds of subgroups together under what we now refer to as English identity.....


So no English identity isn't statically Anglo-Saxon it is french, it is danish, it is swedish, it is danish, it is in part roman, it is indian, it is african, it is anglo saxon, it is irish, it is scottish, it is literally a lot of things.Last thing look up who the normans were, they were norwegian, swedish, danish, french and gallo-roman (which means a whole lot cause romans were a whole lot of different peoples) and a whole lot of other shit.Yea don't get too emotional when someone implies you are some lower life form! Better keep the kid gloves on and battle him as if your ideas are on the same intellectual playing field! That is absurd the interview has power because he didn't respect his ideas cause they dont deserve it they deserve a rebuttal from a place of common humanity and thats what he gave him. In fact the interviewer came to him looking for such an interviewer and spencer started spewing vile garbage.This is an incredibly simplistic answer it is a loaded question first off, the question has such drastic implications it shouldn't be answered yes or no. Of course I have a higher standard of living than someone  in Africa but would I make the choice to have that higher standard of living knowing that my flesh and blood would be tortured for hundreds of years? That is the real question and the obvious answer is no. You see when the question is asked the way spencer does it it removes the realities of now away from the consequences of an affirmative answer. 

This question requires quite a bit of retrospection and the logical conclusion any moral person would choose is that , no , you wouldn't choose america to see your entire family tortured for hundreds no matter what the potential end may be.Wasnt my intention to make it appear as if you were a rubin fan, thought you genuinely didn't think he had it coming. Then moot point, English culture in the broad spectrum simply cannot be said to be Anglo-Saxon, there certainly is an English ethnicity rooted in certain fictitious ideals of english racial identity but they really aren't they are incorrectly perceived. And yes I am aware of the Migration Wave hence why I brought up because it actually pretty readily undercuts your assertion that English ethnicity is tied to mostly static anglo-saxon tribal identity when that is simply flatly false... 

There were dozens of sub groups that formed the modern English state and then empire from all over the place. Then when you add in the massive incorporation of world cultures during the height of the crown you have an ethnic situation that is 100% not tied to pure anglo saxon culture.
So your fall back argument is massive demographic shifts? Alluding to lebanon? First off lebanon isn't a great example because it was a fictitious sykes picot nation designed by the west to be artifically christian and there was the inherent instability in those borders that were bound to cause a reversion to the mean. 

But massive demographic shifts are what crafted modern day Europe, the norse replacement of angles in eastern territory was a massive shift, the norman invasion reshaped our language and created the beginning of an actual English state, and built the tower of London and transformed simple timber construction to roman style brick construction. You see it is readily apparent that massive demographic shifts cause culture to change, the question is is the shift in the demographic in a direction that is consistent with liberal values. A purely anglo-saxon england without the massive demographic shifts that came with roman invasion and the subsequent other invasions isn't a modern liberal democracy whatsoever it remains an incredibly primitive place. The same can be said of most of present day germanic Europe. 

Also you are overblowing the present degree of current European migration, I agree there is way too much unchecked migration but it simply isn't at the level to completely change English society or most other Western European societies. Asians in total are only 8% of the population and blacks only 3% despite all of the displacement in the middle east. 

Also again your claim that English cultural ethnicity remained static following the Norman invasion is flatly false and ignorant of basic history, England like Rome incorporated half the world's culture in different forms, it had such a far and profound reach that it was fundamentally changed forever. You seem to think Empires are these static rarely changing things, quite the opposite they change drastically and that is what gave is liberal democracy, you should be lucky you are wrong about English ethnicity being purely anglo-saxon or we likely wouldnt be having this conversation in a liberal democracy influenced by rome, the norse, the normans, the danes, other germanic groups, and half the planet.

Migration does need to be vetted but cut the scaremongering, you seem to have holes in your historical memory and forget that it was mass demographic and culture shifts that took the Germanic states from behind the rest of North Africa, the Levant, and Rome to the height of power for the past 500 years. 

I never made the claim that they were ethnically british merely that there have been black subjects of the crown for 500 years.

Also england in 500 looks a whole lot different from england in 1000 from england in 1500. They are massively changing places with the influences, of the Danes, the Norse, the Normans, and prior to that the romans. Think Beowulf.I've seen him say that. He usually adds to that that he doesn't think they're inferior as people. He also seems to care about the parenting practices so things improve in their communities. 

I think he makes sense as a person if he's racist or not. They weren't economically socialist but keep telling yourself thatDave has had this coming, he is s spineless that he can't even control his own show.According to Candace it would only be an error for one of themYup he pisses me offEngland did though there were portions of the empire now the commonwealth overseas that were entirely non english english the empire upset a lot of the "traditional" nature of englishness. See what you are arguing now is different from your original argument, yes there is obviously a difference and whether or not those differences become integrated partly into english society depends on historical factors usually, do they actually invade and forcefully take england, or do they enter in a substantial enough amount to change england the way it was changed between 0-1500 AD, this simply isn't happening, while migration is high it isn't high enough to change england in the way you want. 

So in no way is English identity flatly anglo-saxon or one group, arguably modern post 1066 england is more norman in its political and architectural structure also he gave us the precursor to modern english the form of hybrid norman english that we speak today.... I mean William brought us the tower of london and truly organized the English state and brought the English beyond more primitive timber only structures the English were previously building. And roman denotes a whole range of things literally all over the levant into Europe etc that then came into Europe.

Also your fall back argument is that they are closely related but Normans were fairly different from Scandinavians as normans were prototypical European muts, plus the fact that the original European inhabitants before the second Germanic migration post Rome were roman-britons and were again like the normans muts from all over.......and britons were fairly distinct from the rest of the late wave germanic migrators, who were somewhat different from post Caesar Britons.

So again it is really hard to link the identities of a lot of European countries specifically to one or two racial groups, it is simply too complicated and too much movement has happened. But this should be accepted for the better Europe got lucky in that it stood to inherit Roman knowledge even if it took them 1000 years or so to truly come into their fortune and it was for the better.  Except he has been hilariously pathetic at his use of the word "abuse"

He thinks not following libertarianism means you want the police to shoot you, and if your parents reject your political ideology, they want you to get shot.ohh thats whyGreat. Pseudoscience. Not only did he NOT push back, they **both** **admitted** neither of them are experts, nor do they claim to really understand the things they claim to believe.  Basically the entire backing of the bell curve and the movement itself is a bastardization of the original goal of IQ tests and exploits massive scientific and statistical flaws. Its a field rife with pseudoscience and bias. 

Oh, and the funding for Charles Murray is linked with a **LITERAL** organization that funds racist propaganda via "academia" going back several decades. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/6gidnl/why_arent_we_discussing_charles_murrays_backing/

When you read this link, read the sources themselves. I put a lot of effort into this. There is no argument that holds up that disproves a general thesis of the bell curve, that there are group differences in average iq between races.  I prefer to use the more neutral term "population" because that word is broad enough to take into account subsections of the same race, and mixed races, and just different group characteristics in general.


Look out for this one argument you will never hear those arguing against the conclusions of the bell curve (as opposed to some specific methodology) to make. 

This study proves almost all the differences in average iq between groups X and Y are environmental.

Until they have that "proof" genetic group differences are still on the table, do not be distracted by the oceans of hand waving arguments that try to downplay the lack affirmative proof of genetic differences relating to iq.

Either intelligence is based in large part on genetics, or it is not.  If it is, unless ALL populations of humans on the planet have virtually ZERO variance in allele frequencies, then one ought to EXPECT, a priori, some variation in the distribution in genes that contribute to ones intelligence between both individuals, and populations.  We observe this will essentially EVERY other variable trait, why would it not be true for a metric like human intelligence?

Because equality?  Because that would not be fair?  Correct, it's not equal, it's not fair, did you think nature ever gave a flying fuck about what we humans consider just or fair?  Newsflash, it doesn't.

WE care, and if we don't like the LIKELY reality of group differences in iq, WE have to be the ones to solve the issue.


My vote is for human enhancement, keep having computers sift through the growing number of human genomes we are sequencing to tease out what genes and gene combinations tend to contribute to greater intelligence, and like prometheus that stole fire from the gods, redistribute those natural boosts across the entire human population so that fewer people are stuck in the intellectual gutter.  

Or we could pretend that equality of intelligence and aptitude is built into nature, and there are virtually zero differences in average aptitude between groups.

The gaps that have to do with genetics, and nothing to do with environment will persist and never be closed, and harm will be done to people.

To the liberals worried this will embolden the alt right and race realists, newsflash, they ALREADY talk about this kind of shit nonstop.  We have the internet now kids, this discussion is already out.

And frankly, genetic differences in aptitude UNDERCUTS a conservative/libertarian economic free for all.

It actually boosts the case for the kinds of liberal redistribution many of us on the left call for.  People on the right LOVE to argue against things like universal healthcare paid for by their tax dollars sayings it's not the governments job to provide that service, or that they don't want THEIR money going to some other citizen.  If they do not earn enough to afford healthcare treatments they need?  Not THEIR problem.  Should have worked harder.  Notice how quickly they rely on the internal human AGENCY of the individual to rise or fall, even with BASIC shit like healthcare access.  Well guess what, if genetic differences in iq are real and known, that UDNERCUTS the argument of pure agency, no one chooses their aptitude, and having less intelligence acts like a drag on the earnings of most people in life, regardless of how much work and effort they put into something.  MORE of those people will find themselves not able to pay for basic services like healthcare, through no fault of their own.  In that world, it is INCREDIBLY unjust and wicked to have a conservative/libertarian ethos and attitude that it's not THEIR problem to look out for their fellow man and just allow some of them to wither and die.
I like when they bring up jews.

But they ignore the Beta Jews. 

Remember when Donald Sterling, the racist former owner of the Clippers, of condoned racism in Israel, amongst the black jews? 

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/29/opinion/washington-sterling-black-jews/index.html 

https://deadspin.com/exclusive-the-extended-donald-sterling-tape-1568291249Universal healthcare systems are far less bloated and inefficient than private systems we have in the US.  Medicare has much lower overhead costs compared to private insurance.    You were careful to use the word most, but so few conservatives/libertarians ever want to consider the reality that some of the liberals projects would be a better fit than a market free for all.  This is a very empirical question, where we have multiple models around the world and within the US to look at and compare.  

You say I am straw manning conservatives, but the very order of concern you laid out highlights the very difference in attitude I'm talking about.

Liberals care more about their own family and friends over strangers as well.  But even with all that, their circles of concern tend to be more broad than the typical conservative.  Less Tribal, less about ME and MINE.  For an example of this, look at the differential reaction to housing assistance between liberals and conservatives, with special emphasis on how Trump supporters differ (which I consider a good bellwether for the more nativist and racially tribal wing of the conservative coalition)

https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/8/16270040/trump-clinton-supporters-racist

Now, if these republican voters are JUST against government housing assistance, why would it MATTER the race of the recipient?  It's a FAR smaller differential for liberals, but conservatives?  ESPECIALLY the Trump supporting wing?  The support tanks when they see a BLACK face.

I see government intervention as intrinsically more universal, and based on the above biases, I think that is a large part of the reason more conservatives are opposed to it.  

#NOTALL

MY family, MY tribe, MY racial group, MY church members.  White guy needs housing assistance?  Looks like part of my tribe?  More likely to support some social assistance.  See a BLACK?!?  Oh god, more welfare leeches, just like those welfare queens pulling a cart filled with lobster paid for by food stamps into her cadillac escalade.  I've HEARD this shit directly from conservative mouths.  I've been listening to conservatives for over 15 years now on talk radio and other sources as a liberal.  I hear their arguments, their rationales, and often what lies beneath what they say.  

If conservatives were less tribal people, they would be less hostile to immigration, and less hostile to social assistance.  And I think many of them like to use the imperfections of government and the potential of people to rise higher WITHOUT government intervention as a shield of absolution to not be compelled to use the tools of government to help others.  

I see it as an excuse.  I do not expect government to solve all problems, they always assume that is what liberals want.  I just don't want to take the tool of government and lock it away because I'm afraid it turns most things it touches into ashes.

If group differences are in fact heavily genetic in nature, no government intervention will solve that problem and the differences in outcomes.  But government can raise the floor of outcomes so that the consequences of being on the bottom are less severe.  And companies and researchers can figure out over time how to solve the differential aptitude issue, that last solution need not come from government at all.  Like I said, liberals are not looking to government to solve all problems, but one thing it knows how to do well is cut checks to people.

And my preferred intervention is being tested now.  Universal basic income.   I want universal healthcare plus UBI to replace this.

Which is why nazis backed Bernie and not far right trumpHowever tribal immigrants may or may not be, conservatives would be the more hostile group towards them.  It's a mixture of temperament and logistics, white conservatives are more likely to live near a bunch of other white people and that lack of proximity of non whites living near them contributes to them being more fearful of the "other"

Look at this map.

https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/

No wonder so many isolated rural white conservatives are so frightened by the shadow of the tanned skin colossus.  It's so rare they come across any in their personal lives it must be like running into the Chupacabra.  

It's not all proximity, they are still more wary of immigrants if they live in cities as well, but if you polled city conservatives vs rural conservatives, I suspect you'd find more hostility to immigrants away from the metro areas.To the last question, yes, keeping race out of the discussion is preferred.  In fact, if we talk about the problem more generally and work to fix it that way, I think the racial differences will begin to melt away in terms of differential outcomes.  It won't get rid of them all, asians doing well academically is not helping their reply rates on okcupid, but no one said it was a panacea.

This is not specific to race at all.  When you get a chance listen to this talk by Gregory Clark who wrote a book called the son also rises.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyIMwzHuiCU


He goes into a detailed analysis of surnames in the UK going back hundreds of years and testing relative status.  It's not a pretty picture, because social mobility is linked fairly strongly to Lineage.  This is within the same race, but even there you often find a kind of sorting, just like today college grads tend to marry and mate with other college grads.

That guy is not a race realist, he's not an alt right person at all, he's basically a liberal.  He does not even mention genetics there explicitly, but the spectre of something passed on through lineage is strong, and his solution is a more robust redistribution system, like my own.  

A lot of liberals are afraid, they are afraid that if you open the door to even a discussion of these issues, you will unleash the horrors of alt right ideas onto the world, but those ideas are still trash and many of them do not follow.  Thinking there are likely group differences does not inevitably lead to their kind of world view, there is a lot more to it than that.&gt; Can someone point me to the refutation of his argument? 

&gt;I usually respond to this with "Yes, but everyone is an individual and you do not know their IQ, even if you know the average IQ of their race. So therefore you should treat them as an individual.". 

The "Very Bad Wizards" had a podcast episode devoted to this issue that I found highly insightful: [Very Bad Wizards: What Chilling Effect? (Intelligence Pt. 2)](https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/123) (starts at 40:30 min). The conclusion of Psychologist David Pizarro is that most likely the differences are entirely environmental ...
... What. They are all three trash humans to be honest. Candace and Blaire are mean and nasty and hateful...... Rubin is vapid and an alt right apologist. SmhBUT SJWS they are the real problem they are stealing babies and shooting dissenters. Dave is an alt-lite libertarian apologist. So intellectually dishonest.He has thousands of people fooled into thinking he is some liberal intellectual in some fictitious new center. Such a load of shit. I agree people would prefer to live near others like themselves.  You link that to race more than I do though.

I may be atypical since I'm a mixed black guy, but this racial affinity and identity has always felt more muted in myself.  Perhaps it's because I'm mixed I feel less identified with a particular racial group.  I prefer socializing with people that share my interests, and that has little to do with their race.  The alt right clings to race because they are shallow people. And white identitarian conservatives do the same.

I'm into sci fi and fantasy, japanese animation, not so much into sports, what culture and people should I feel closer to?  White?  Black?  Asian?  Those categories of association are fucking retarded, and held by small minded people.  Vulgar attitude?  So be it.  We all have our standards of what ticks us off.  I find the obsessive worry over the ethnicity of the people coming into the nation vulgar.  Sauce for the goose.she ironically pulls identity politics and the right loves the whole black self hating conservative shtick lol this the level of discourse on the right all the while ignoring trump trying to ban dissentThe Anti-SJW blueprint for discussing IQ, Present 18th century race realism as if it is the current scientific consensus, claim everyone who doesn't believe Kantian racism is a PC SJW.........

Race and IQ simply do not have the amount of evidence pointing to a link, and the Flynn effect demonstrates how highly influential environment truly is cause IQ changes way quicker than evolution tends to work.... Anyone who pedals this stuff is just a racist to be honest, they are worse than regular racist actually because they give intellectual underpinning to 20th century racial supremacism....I do not like hearing certain segments of the liberal population talking about white privilege, I actually find it cringe worthy.  As should be clear from other posts, I do not think the source of differential outcomes between groups today, is based on racial discrimination, it's based in large part on differences in average aptitude between groups.  But because that explanation is not tolerable or believed by many liberals, they scapegoat other external factors for the differential outcomes they see in the world.  

As for white people feeling like they will be judged only on their skin color and not wanting to lose the dominant position in terms of population numbers... is it not those same types of people that keep saying minorities in the US are not being oppressed?  But they want to PRE claim victim status over their potential minority status in the future?  Talk about a group of fear pustules pretending to be men.  They sound like they are projecting their own supremacist attitudes on others.  But perhaps that is one of the differences, their view of the "darkies" is truly so dim, they think that once the population shifts, barbarian hordes will turn this into a wasteland for the "native" whites.  The second coming of the social problems of South Africa.

I find such projections implausible, and would fight against them myself.  For one, there won't be a dominant single minority group, there will be many.  White, latino, black, asian, other.  That is not a reciple of one tribe gaining supremacy over another.  And two, these concerns by the ethno nationalists or nativists are such small ball.  

A bigger dividing line is going to have nothing to do with ethnicity and more to do with the population changes coming from the enhanced vs the non enhanced.  That difference will eventually DWARF all others and be a bigger social problem to deal with.Which is why they love the Uber-capitalist trump right?Hitler literally killed Marxists, unionists and other left wingers. He specifically said he was for private control. You don't think the slavery of workers was explicitly anti socialist? Bernie Sanders is explicitly against slavery lol. Even wants a $15 minimum wage. But ok, very similar to BernieYo TYT is ass but Dave is much worseIt's better to mock and laugh at them for being stupid. But if you punch one I won't think any less of you at allI don't get how you conflate big government with leftism either but alright manEvery leader, ostensibly, wants high paying jobs for their people lmaoEveryone wants big government for shit that they want and not for things that their opponents want, guyLanguage has its perceived meaning to its intended audience Rubin is speaking to Americans who equate Liberalism with leftist ideas....he then goes on to espouse a list of supposed leftist policies he supports like single payer, and gay marriage to further substantiate his claim that he is indeed a Liberal. 

What he is doing is equating lockean liberalism which is more right wing libertarian than left with American modern Liberalism which is leftward....quite frankly it is a dishonest shtick Rubin is doing cause he gets the popularity of saying he is some "last Liberal" while pushing right wing talking points.I'm more kinda upset at his definition of liberal. Maybe classical liberalism is all those things he says they are but it's well known that modern liberalism is about freedom on social issues, welfare to support those in need and regulations to keep businesses from going wild and polluting or putting their workers in harms way. Dave and many on the right don't know what the fuck a leftist is. They just assume it's every sensitive college kids who gets angry when someone calls a transgender woman "he"TYT is dumb and annoying. Dave actively brings on vile people and doesn't say anything when they said something crazy like Obama is a socialist or that Islam is a disease Never heard of this guy. I'm sure there are conservative comedians but way more liberal ones. Kinda blows a hole in the "liberals hate comedy" shtickI agree that sometimes people take jokes too seriously but conservative comedians just aren't very funny. Steve Crowder and Dave Rubin are not funny. There's still good liberal comedy today such as Larry David, Sacha Baron Cohen, Nathan Fielder, Parks and Rec. Just cuz you say offensive shit, in the case of Crowder, does not make you funny at allClassic RubinSure Russia definitely tried to interfere but we dont know if it affected voters which it likely didn't... Sadly it looks there is a bipartisan effort to ruin the internet and social media on account of the fear mongering.This wasn't funny.
https://youtu.be/Lq4WBOkFNtE
Not to mention he dresses as a woman to trigger the libsSure. Nick Mullen can be funny Obama was no where near a socialist and Muslims are for the most part cool, so you're wrong Well if you are a more government friendly pro property rights and due process guy who is liberal on social issues you can use the term classical liberal, just don't pretend you are left wing like Rubin and thats perfectly fine.Yea not saying you did, and yea haha we all have our price and rubins is about 27k patreon dollars every monthI'm assuming you've never met one I'm currently in LA and have been to Michigan and NY. Nice try.Ah, and I'm sure you totally do. Bet you're one of those imperialists who was for the Iraq war, Afghan invasion, trying to regime change in Iran, etcYes, Cenk and his gang are kinda SJW, but they're doing extremely important work getting money out of politics while Dave Rubin uses his time bashing immature college kids all week. Rubin is not even close in what value he brings to the world contra Cenk.Don't Cenk and the TYT get money from Republican donors? I agree with him more but he sucks. Dave sucks moreThey got a business investment if i remember correctly. Dont know if you're old enough to remember, but Cenk turned down a lot of money in order to not surrender his integrity while at MSNBC, so i dont think he'd do it now either.This is true. Remember when Dave said that sexual predators used progressivism as a cover? Good timesHe did leave the left, but at the same time he will say, "I am a liberal I support single payer healthcare and gay marriage" but then go on to espouse libertarian rhetoric. 

He holds on to being the "last liberal" to get views.You should have moderated that catfight But the issue my friend is that Rubin says " I am a liberal I support single payer healthcare, then espouse standard libertarian talking point" then he produces last liberal t-Shirts like he is still a large L Liberal. 

He doesn't make sufficient of a distinction for the average non-politically savvy internet user and his whole intention is to reap the rewards of being a liberal criticizing the left. 

Perfect example of this is the interview with David Pakman, where he says I am a liberal I support single payer healthcare and gay marriage, then he makes arguments for classic Republican economics and hates taxes.

He needs to stop the charades and just say I am an outright libertarian, but he wont do that cause he benefits from hiding behind these word games.&gt;Not to mention he dresses as a woman to trigger the libs

I disagree. I think he dresses as a woman because he likes dressing as a woman and the "trigger libs" is just an excuse. Not unlike those virulently homophobic preachers who got outed as having homosexual proclivities.I Rubin was a leftist, as many dummies here like to claim? Surely his presence would not make the show any less of a "Leftyprogressivegroupthinkpalooza".

Don't get me wrong, I know Rubin is full of shit when he claims to be on the left, but this has to count as evidence in favour of those of us who assert that he is not on the left, especially when naive fools come out with the "he's only hard on the left because the left is his own side" talking point.Nope. Still calls himself a "classical liberal". Even has a shirt with "Classical Liberal" written across it.If that truly is his thing then I'm sorry but to me it really seems like he does it to bug liberals &gt;If that truly is his thing then I'm sorry but to me it really seems like he does it to bug liberals

He does it so often that I think he is just looking for an excuse to dress like a woman, because secretly, he likes dressing like a woman. Think about it. Why would it bug liberals? Liberals don't really watch his show. They aren't his audience. So, why would it bug them? Further, liberals tend to be okay with cross-dressing, so why it bug them? He is too worried about the battle of ideas though.But remember its only group think when its 18 year old campus leftists, and its only identity politics when its black people asking for basic civil rights.

Rubin is too engaged in the battle of ideas to recognize this though. What a turd...YouGetIt.gifWhy are rightwingers obsessed with mental disorders? I smell a little thing called projection on their part.&gt;Rubin is no longer a liberal. Most of the policies he supports and most of the guests he interviews lean heavily right-wing.
I totally agree. But why is this a bad thing? Because he continues to say he's a liberal? Okay, I guess it's kind of annoying that he refuses to acknowledge a shift in his own political views.


At least on a superficial level I think we disagree on the magnitude of this being a problem. It appears you seem to be okay with Dave's dishonesty while it frustrates me quite a bit. Dave's dishonesty is what I hate most about his show. I don't mind conservative/right-wing talk shows, but when the host is consistently trying to convince his viewers that he represents the centre of the issues it becomes laughable. It seems as if he's trying to recalibrate what constitutes the centre of a discussion and when he includes a cohort of quite reprehensible people I'm obviously going to have an issue. Short answer: no

Long answer: leftists are all mentally ill for categorizing individuals into groupsI like him mainly because I think he's completely genuine. What surprises me most about this sub is that people think he's a fraud who's peddling right-wing views he doesn't believe for money. I don't see any evidence of that, and I find it to be a rather nasty accusation to make without any evidence.

And to clarify, I don't think he's being dishonest about his political views. I think he genuinely believes in this whole "classical liberalism" thing and that he's still the guy on the left trying to save them from following their crazies into the deep end. So he's a bit deluded, but I wouldn't say dishonest.

And yeah, he's pretty poor at interviewing in terms of asking good questions, but I like his personality and he gets a decent amount of interesting guests, so overall I'm still a fan.He's had several left-wing guests on and he hasn't lambasted anyone. If anything, he's too soft on them just like he is with his right-wing guests. I agree that he's not doing a great job putting his "battle of ideas" thing into practice, but what you're saying is simply false."Facts don't care about your feelings"And let's not forget Dave had Laci on his show after she got "red pilled" or some stupid shit like that.There's no way Greg Gutfeld doesn't do coke.&gt; Percentages matter.

and the percentage of non whites who do mass murder is still lower...so...So you want him to just dig up mud at guests and throw it at them? The very thing he stands completely against?

If that's what you want to see in an interview, that's fine, but why the hell would want Dave Rubin of all people to be the one doing that kind of thing? That's what baffles me about this sub – you all seem to want Rubin to be someone he just isn't and never will be.TYT doesnt pay me, but Soros does. Damn, you got me!

http://www.clickhole.com/article/be-vigilant-george-soros-has-second-ticket-screeni-6510This cuck for Koch is a spurious hack. 

Never mind the disenfranchising actions taken by the GOP with regard to voter suppression and African Americans, mass incarceration and the drug war. The truth of the matter is that there are issues that disproportionately affect certain identifiable segments of the population and we should work with those groups of people to address inequities in our society.  

This is what right-wingers like Dave want minorities like African Americans to shut up about.

Oh yah, Dave, your "leftists are mentally ill" schtick is the epitome of collectivization you fucking hack.

You are a fucking fraud.Shut up, loser.har har; you're the edgy douchebag who didn't respond to a single point of my post and made some gross generalization.

I bet you're a libertarian.  A Dave Rubin fan, ladies and gentleman. Why conservatives want an even bigger military right He wanted increased military and got it. Only Bernie and Rand voted against Lmao keep lying to yourself. A lot of liberal are def for war but Bernie wasn't for that. Trump wanted increased funding for the military and is backing Saudi Arabia. The guy is a hawkHe gives credence to race IQ type stuff but summarily dismisses identity politics, postmodernism. If you want to have a battle of ideas then you probably should actually engage in a meaningful discussion about things you don't agree with. Maybe ruben doesn't like postmodernism but its not good enough to shoot it down without offering any sort of meaningful critique.I find it interesting how none of the learn liberty crowd showed up in the promo, or the vast number of uber right wingers like Prager and David Horrowitz.  He had one clear cut right winger in Shapiro, Peterson who is most associated with the anti sjw movement and antagonist to gender pronoun supplication, and... that looked to be about it, the rest were liberally minded people for the most part, as if that was representative at fucking all.Trump Derangement Syndrome is real, and it's the true believing Trump supporters, the kind of people who supported him in the primary and are still cheerleading for him after they have seen what he wants to do.

People like this guy.

Deranged, or as Scott Adams might say, a great target of persuasion.  Just begging to be used and manipulated for... what exactly?  The good?  As who defines it?  A minority of the nation?  Good job there Scott and Dave.  Bravo, be proud if this devolution of mankind, reaching its apotheosis in the cosmic idiocy of that man I linked to.You think he's genuine?  Then you are as clueless as this Trump supporter.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qqESEsOOLsDid you see him threatening libel action because a media outlet dared call him right wing?He was also telling a Muslim woman to go back to her country...bet Dave would love that The author offered a retraction due to Dave's objections and since US speech law would never even open up the possibility of successful civil action based on such a claim, the suit never went ahead.You can call it libertarian in the American capitalist sense of the word, but calling the ending of net neutrality consistent with a free speech oriented set of values is ludicrous. 

Giving the biggest communications and media companies the option to tear down the platform of speech for competitors or dissenting voices could be described as pro-free-speech in only the most tenuous, corporate, neo-liberal conception of the term.

The problem with this line of thinking as I see it is that you and others assume that government is the only institution that has the ability to affect the freedom of speech in any meaningful way. This is nonsensical. Since the main outlets and platforms for speech are privately owned and controlled, amoral corporate tyrannies are actually more effective at suppressing and manipulating speech to their benefit. Much more so than governments are capable of for the most part.Laurier handled this badly but this girl's intentions aren't so innocent. Testimony from students in the class state that the Peterson video this girl put on had absolutely nothing to do with the class material and she appeared to put it on in order to state her position on the topic.

Sick of the martyr complex bestowed on these people.



Oh yah and fuck Dave.Dave just listens to whatever Shapiro says and then repeats it thinking he's some philosopher Shared here: https://www.hercampus.com/school/wilfrid-laurier/debate-free-speech-wilfrid-laurier-university?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork


“Lindsay Shepherd showed the video of Jordan Peterson during a grammar lesson in our class. This video had absolutely nothing to do with what we were learning that day and it felt as if she showed the video to purposely start a discussion about something she had opinions on. The video was showed and she asked the class for some of their thoughts. Some of the comments made for an interesting discussion, but mostly students used it as an excuse to make fun of trans identities.”Agree, but the video of Peterson she did share is irrelevant to the course syllabus so my impression of her is unfazed. He probably should've been convicted of involuntary manslaughter but the prosecution went for 1st degree murder. That's on themRoy Moore has done and will do more damage than all of the sensitive college sjws combined Lol, this perfectly exemplifies Dave's persecutory mindset. Ironically he calls out others for engaging in "Oppression Olympics."

"It's not possible that people are unsubscribing due to my glib bullshit! It must be the evil SJWs at YouTube." 

Arrogant schmuck. Yeah, the sourcing is not my best. Though from some different readings on the matter it appears she went outside her lane.

The administrative wing of Laurier was bad though.  I feel like it's him not wanting any leftists on bc they'd destroy him. Bring on the chapo boysYeah! He "reached out" to Bernie and like Warren as if they're really gonna talk to a guy who said we don't need regulation bc we have yelp Absolutely not. Dave doesn't actually care about free speech. He's more interested in advancing the issues of positions taken by right-wingers by tacking it on to the principle of free speech. Rubin interviewing an accused rapist and then saying he's part of a new centrism is amazing I want someone to do it explicitly so they can push back against him, but the ones who have asked to go on are rejected.  Dave is such a coward.Yes he has. And I am someone of note. And I won't watch that video because generally youtube people make the most facile arguments imaginable. If they were really coming to profound conclusions, then they probably wouldn't be making internet videos. It'd just be hilarious if someone could put him in a situation where he had to defend the one thing he thinks is such an easy, point blank issue. He'd probably just stumble around and say nothing. Could be a chance to destroy the core of what he pretends to be. Any of his videos is what I should have said. I won't be watching any of them. And of course, I can't provide you with a link, because I won't even be bothered to Google search for one of his videos. Writing this comment is a better use of my time than that. 

In general, youtube types are vacuous. Even the ones I agree with don't offer much profound insight into anything. That includes people whose content is posted on the site frequently. Its just not a space that is conducive to meaningful discourse. 

All I know of Jordan Petersen (I'm assuming that's who you mean) is that he published some influential research several years ago on psychology topics that I'm not really interested in. I doubt he has much of great value to say outside of that. 

Also, if we're talking about the issue of free speech in the United States, a specialized constitutional lawyer/legal commentator would be a better resource. Doesn't matter if you think its odd or not. I can post wherever I want and have whatever opinion of Youtube I want. This should be obvious to you.

Its fundamentally a legal/policy issue. When we talk about free speech, were talking about the government's regulation of speech. Nowadays people getting fired over comments and people protesting grotesque speakers has been sort of inappropriately lumped in with free speech discourse, so it can be confusing. 

That being said you are right that maybe a psychologist could offer an interesting perspective on the topic. So against my better judgment I looked up Jordan Peterson and found a video of him talking about the C-16 bill in Canada. My area of focus is US criminal/immigration law, so I'm no expert on this bill. However, it seems as though he didn't understand the legislation as he is disingenuously characterizing what it says. 

So that was pretty disappointing. I'll trust you though and assume that he has said some worthwhile and nuanced things about free speech as a general concept. But don't think I'll be watching any more of him after this. Ill say I'm an asian muslim trump supporter with a patreon account. That should do it..He said that? Feel like I don't want to watch I'll get too mad [A libertarian.](

You have all seen Ted Cruz and Martin Shkreli right?  They are often said to have some of the most punchable faces ever seen in the history of mankind.  Now I would never condone punching either of them, I am a peaceful man.  But the faces do seem to illicit that response.

Dave Rubin reminds me of those faces, that smarmy Ted Cruz face/voice/presentation - And Martin Shkrelis smarmy pharma bro motif he puts on display with that shit eating grin everywhere he goes.

Daves mind numbing soft libertarian pablum illicits the same feelings of disgust in me.  Just thought I'd share that thought.Consumers can go elsewhere, they can use dailymotion, vidm... ok not that anymore, facebook video.  If those are not good enough or too restrictive, they could post torrents of their content and distribute it that way.  

What you are talking about is actually a critique of outsized market power that MODERN LIBERALISM (as opposed to hands off classical liberalism that Dave Rubin and Prager tout and prop up) wants to reign in.  When market power of companies that do not share a conservative vision of the world and might be disproportionately be demonetizing and hiding their content, they BITCH up a fucking storm.   

RUNNING to the courts, RUNNING to Papa Government to DICTATE to a private company what it can and cannot do.  

Congratulations, conservatives/libertarians/classical liberals, you have just CONCEDED the liberals had a fucking point.  The modern liberals, not the fake kind Dave Rubin represents.


Where are the libertarians now?  I thought the unfettered free market solved all problems?  Where is that libertarianism neutral source with less restrictive rules, that does not bend to the dictates of advertisers?

Prager, as is typical of him, is a self serving shill who will take all sides of an argument depending on whether it works for or against his agenda.&gt;100% unregulated markets are still not good

Go tell that to right wingers on talk radio, go tell that to a large chunk of the "learn liberty" folks stinking up Dave Rubins show.

There are an awful lot of CONSERVATIVES And libertarians that you need to argue against before you even begin to convince liberals that LIBERAL leaning companies need to unilaturally surrender their outsized market powers sans regulation while scores of other companies conservatives are cozy towards have to do no such thing.

Like monopolistic last mile broadband providers that CONSERVATIVES are arguing need to have the constraints of net neutrality lifted from them.

This fucker just RTd Bibi lolCompletely serious. This dude is assTell that to conservatives.  I listen to them and read them every single week.  On talk radio via hosts and callers, on conservative news sites and comment sections.  The center of mass of what conservatives actually want is nowhere NEAR how caustic and radical their rhetoric sounds on their ridiculous media platforms that are FAR more tilted than the "mainstream media" they bitch about 24/7, but they those moderated views are rarely expressed with the same volume and scale as the radical views I just described above.

When I call them out on their duplicity, they act like I just slapped their mother, like I am some vulgar liberal for pointing out how they are not REALLY against regulations and big government in cases X, Y, Z, so why would they PRETEND in their rhetoric that big government is bad, and almost ALWAYS makes things worse when they clearly don't actually believe that shit in numerous cases?

And if they do not believe it, why say that crap?  Every liberal I know is for "limited government" in some places.  And "big government" in others.  

But it's the conservatives that will hear some policy idea of liberals, like universal healthcare, and apriori shit on the entire enterprise from a position of it being a government takeover or big government, as if there is something INTRINSICALLY destructive about such things.  Bankrupt logical minds, inconsistent in the extreme, and I am sick of putting up with their sloppy rationales.  I am calling their confusion out every time I get.  And if they really don't like big government anywhere, or regulations, or redistribution, then I intend to go on a tear and list off scores of things that involve ALL of those aspects that THEY support and show them what kind of charlatans they are as people.  Too long they have been allowed to run around with shitty mental frameworks without someone checking them.

IF they demand that, they can go on Rubins show.  I won't give them a safe space from a rebuke to ideas I see as utter trash.

1) Ok you can think that about my perspective. 

2) Then my opponents are simply mischaracterizing the issue. Free speech =/= freedom from consequences. This is an obvious point. 

3) It's just clearly disingenuous. And it appears as though most of the Canadian legal community agrees. The bill makes a slight change to the criminal code to add protections to transgender people and those types. Seems like petersin was trying to say it significantly infringed on free speech or that he'd go to jail for mis-gendering people. That's just the video I saw though. Either way the claims he was making bordered on being hysterical and patently wrong. So yeah, no more free speech commentary from that guy haha. You say he has some cool ideas on the topic, ill just take your word for it. Sure are a lot of ignorant alt-righters in agreement with Dave Rubin about everything. Not shocking if you really get it...Pop is also in agreement with Hamas then cuz he hates what Trump did. Koch money must be nice.Sorry I'm not going to be citing sources in legal form on a Reddit post. I'm also not trying to convince you to believe what I'm saying. You can look up the dozens of articles on the bill and you can look up the actual bill yourself if you really want to learn about it. This is not a debate on C-16. 

I also don't care if you think I can think critically or not. I've proven my ability to do so consistently in real life. I go to one of the top law schools in the world. This is a meaningless Reddit thread. Seems like you just are upset that I wasn't impressed by petersins uninformed take on some random Canadian legislation. It's just not that big of a deal. I watched his video. I did some research. I think he's delusional on this topic. Guess what? People are wrong sometimes.One final point, you don't understand what the concept of free speech is. Its always been the government's regulation of speech. If you want to talk about college kids not liking a speaker and call that a free speech issue then ok. But that's more of a vague social issue that only intersects with actual free speech discourse in a very tangential way. So these are the facts. You can disagree if you'd like but would be incorrect to do so. Right. Were not debating free speech so I don't feel obligated to go into much depth and prove to you that I have critical thinking skills. 

I made two basic claims you seem to have issue with. 1) free speech is at its core a legal issue; 2) petrasin seems to have misunderstood C16. These points I find blatantly obvious. If you disagree then I suggest you just look into them more. 

I'd suggest reading the wikipedia article on free speech in the US for a base-level understanding of the issue. Here's the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States

With regards to the second point, I don't know just do your own research. There are tons of legal experts who have offered commentary. I've read some. Plain text of the bill is also a good starting point. I don't need to persuade you one way and really don't care if I do or not. 

Overall, I'd suggest, if you really care about this matter, doing some leg work, reading some primary sources, and most importantly, not getting your fix of "robust conversation" from random people on the internet. you don't care about free speech muchSimilarly, it seemed like rogan was going out of his way to point out a disagreement with seder by bringing up the sam harris thing. Looking forward to watching it, but won't be able to see it right now. I hope Reece has included the clip where Dave equates those who say climate change leads to and exacerbates forest fires and those who say climate change is a result of God punishing people for gay marriage.

This example, to me, is what make Dave so spurious and such a shill and why I hate him so much. In his libertarianish mindset he seeks to discredit a position fairly widely held in the environmental sciences community and discredit it by equating it with some batshit crazy theory about God. Obviously Dave knows shit all about environmental sciences and is just shilling for his libertarian bosses, the Kochs, who have rabidly fought environmentalism.

I hate you Dave. 

Edit: realized the entire video is about the above scenario. Ha! Fuck Dave not what C-16 does. Please research the billThe right wasn't calmer about Obama there were secession petitions and everyone freaked out . Legislatively the Republicans met at the Caucus Room and vowed to block every piece of legislation he sought to try even the good stuff. This doesn't even factor in the rise in racial violence.

Also Trump is more of an unprecedented genuine authoritarian threat who literally proposed changes to the first amendment by getting rid of new York times v. sullivan so alarm is warranted about Trump but not as much about say an Obama and a bush.

And spare us the bullshit apology for rubins spinelessness, he is a moral coward who never takes a stand on anything that his audience might not like, he said he would hold trumps feet to the fire and never did. And by the way in skeptic Youtubers arent all holding Trumps feet to the fire so your point is a bit ridiculous, he could make a difference if he stepped out and pointed out trumps anti-liberal tendencies but he doesn't cause he is a spineless money grabber Typical 2017 Trump-Rubin apology. I already addressed your analogy in Rubin's circle of media people don't criticize Trump they just complain about / blame the left for everything. The ironic thing is that what Rubin is doing is the same thing the whole skeptic and alt-light community is doing..... They all regurgitate the same THE LEFT IS KILLING EVERYTHING while giving the right a pass, the actual contrarian thing for him to do would be to leave the 90 shovelers and go be an individual who upholds his promises.

Just admit he is as partisan a hack who only goes after the left and promotes his own agenda in a dishonest way.BUT ANTIFA, Trump and the alt right are just memeing they don't really mean it. Never mind that Trump has institutional power, the SJWs are the true threat to free speech even when it is Trump who has time and time again gone after free speech.Yes I do, challenging him aggressively is what democracy is all about Rubin fails to do this. 

In nearly every instance the left polls well above the right on the rights of the press, dissent, and protest so yes these are factually based on a lot of data. 

Of course you have that right, although the way Trump behaves he would argue if you disagree with him you ought to be fired, which is why it is ironic that Rubin never calls Trump out on this obvious illiberalism.Yes I know hence why I said I wish I could not that I actually think I will get the chance. 

He is too much of an intellectual coward to invite any liberal on who actually might challenge his narrative.By the way stop appealing to futility just because I am not writing an open letter to Rubin tryin to get in front of him doesn't mean my substantive points are any less valid.Right simply misusing a pronoun is not a fineable offense. The article talks about refusing to call someone by their preferred pronoun. So what I'd imagine is they want to target people who have some degree of mental culpability. i.e. people who do this maliciously, not just negligently. You should think about the things you read with some degree of nuance and depth. To be honest my beef with Rubin has nothing to do with my agreeing with him it has to do with disingenuous hypocritical narrative crafting that puts the blame all on one sides back while ignoring a whole largely more authoritarian side. 

He is doing this because the current meta is to always criticize the left, its where everyone on youtube is making their money.I don't agree with compelled action. We need to get rid of murder laws. The penalty for murder is not just a fine. Its 25-life imprisonment in the US. Maybe even the death penalty. That's way more serious than a fine. Its an egregious obstruction of my liberty. I'm no fan of TYT. But man just compare their guests to Rubin's. Its just so much more interesting to watch. Night and day. Once again it has nothing to do with political views that I dissent from Rubin on it has to do with his small l illiberalism in that he fails to touch trump and puts the kiddy gloves on and crafts a dishonest narrative. 

And I said in his YouTube circle, people always do the same anti-SJW thing, you and I both know its true. The common group think online in the skeptic community is to bash SJWs do you agree? And that if you are a skeptic anti-feminist it is rare for you to truly go after the right and 99% of your focus is the left's faults?  Did he actually say that shit?  Have a link?  Even for Dave this seems like a stretch.


Roy Moore was/is : 

-a theocrat that sought to elevate "gods law" above mans law, and was fired as a judge a couple times for his misbehavior.  And let's not forget the spokesperson that Roy Moore sent out to represent him on election day, which can best be described with no hyperbole as an actual slack jawed yokel implying religious tests for holding elected office.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFYRkzznsc0


For all the talk on the right about rule of fucking LAW regarding immigration, the idea that a JUDGE who STUDIED law would hold these kinds of BLATANTLY unconstitutional views and send a surrogate out to propagate them, all the while going APE SHIT on the LAW BREAKING over some illegal brought over by their parents when they were two years old who's going to school decades later and contributing to society

Those people give a shit about the rule of law?  Seems VERY selective what kinds of laws they are interested in enforcing, and this religious/nativist wing is attracted to mass deportation policy like flies to shit.  


-a conspiracy theorist (birther + other insane ramblings)

-a cartoonish caricature of what the left thinks of the religious right who massive hostility to gays

-all that is before we get to the history of dating underage girls and potentially worse

.... Actually, now that I wrote that out, I can easily imagine Dave not being too bothered by several of those points as he's ignored its existence in multiple people he is happy to bring on his show.I agree. So many of these people post garbage political content on youtube then complain when it gets demonetized and beg for patrein money. We should let the free market push them into some other field besides political commentary like maybe panhandling or welfare. 100% mate! Ppl on that sub aren’t afraid to call out Harris when he messes up. Also trust me, we mostly all hate Rubin with a passion on that sub too. He’s a cancer and a dishonest, lying, sleazy alt-lite hacky bastard!The strange thing is, objectivists and anarchists like Michael Malice are such over the top wild cards most of the time, that that is when some of the critiques of the conservative movement creep in.  Rucka was lobbing bombs and firing gattling guns into the right, even though Rubin tried to direct the fire back towards the left.Fair enough, but Rubin's circle is indeed dominated by anti-feminism and anti-SJW talking points. It is a fact , and its not like those ideas arent without merit SJWs do suck and feminism has gone too far in some ways, the issue is be honest and proportional about your analysis ....

Rubin finds a way to blame SJWs for everything, while Trump censoring the CDC gets a pass.But muh transgender people asking for some respect is destroying my free speech. 

Let’s see if Dave and the rest of the outrage mob come to the defence of the first amendment and transparent scientific inquiry of CDC employees.

Great.When you look at the international center CNN is right wing by quite a long way. When you look at historic american standards from the beginning of the 20th century to now they are also right wing. They have a strong pro corporate bias in their reporting, they are basically tories.

MSNBC is socially liberal but economically they are like the centrists.But Rubin doesn't do that Rubin invites guests on only to talk shit about the entire left (not just SJWs)

He isn't an honest actor. He of course will be the first one to hold the feet of the footholder!This guy is such a boob, typical centrist libertarian type who couches everything in philosophy for old debunked economic ideas that came from the failures of the Lochner era. He is also a know it all prick. We have already seen Laissez Faire capitalism it was called 1880-1930 and a lot of people were hurt. 

Also funny to see conservatives like Cernovich celebrate net neutrality while they complain about corporations censoring them. Its like they will support anything so long as liberals dislike it even when the policy will undoubtedly be the worst for them.It is amazing that people can take Rand seriously, libertarians are the same type of people as communists in their magical thinking that the free market always creates some utopia.Generally agree with Brooks on this one. Rubin is not bright and his show is detrimental. I would disagree that it's all stupidity and cowardliness. The man is getting funded by a right wing think tank. He knows where his money comes from. I'd have to think that plays a huge role in why he focuses on what he focuses on and won't criticize trump. He wont talk about net neutrality to be honest cause he is afraid of his right wing base. 

And my argument was never that the left was perfect merely that it is pretty out of control to ONLY blame the left for everything.  

Notice how Rubin fails to really bring it up and disagree with his right wing fans because he never pushes back against anyone in any substantive way.Also Dave does play identity politics just in a diferent way watch his shows with blaire white, candace, some guy t, he always does the youre a "blank" conservative shtick. Do you honestly think the majority of the left takes cultural appropriation that far? This is the problem with rubin and the anti-sjws they make it sem as though the wortst instances of the left's behavior are emblematic of the entire left. While they ignore the living shit out of the rights extremism which is more toxic.

And no one is punishing students of Asian descent. Asians and immigrants of all backgrounds including African immigrants fair far better than the average american and are more educated.

Once again it is the dishonest nature of the narrative that Rubin crafts through omission that is the issue.For the guy who says we should all just be nice old centrists who are so reasonable and thoughtful, its pretty abhorrent to make fun of an old guy trying to enjoy a meal out. Just leave him alone jeez..This is so childish. I bet it would also offend many on the "right." Try to cut the broad generalizations and judge people as individuals. this guy is horribly unfunnyWhen did I say you said that?Using broad terms like that really make conversations kind of useless. Even SJWs is a generalization. It's just a broad ambiguous term that people use to insult others. Maybe focus on what specific idea or line of thinking you reject that you're ascribing to "SJWs" that you think would cause the Carlin-SJW conflict. This is more useful than trying to label a comedian as "right" or "left."Nope not gonna let you get away with this shtick Asians are systemically not discriminated against. Asians are still vastly over-represented and race is one of the many holistic factors that can be considered for university admissions it cannot be based on a quota nor can it be the sole deciding factor at least in our country.


The conservative supreme court has upheld this time and time again because ensuring we have racially diverse universities is a compelling interesting of the state and allowing some minimal consideration of race in admissions to achieve that end is constitutional. Systemic racism is not allowing one race to get into school until pretty much 40 years ago. 

Sure there needs to be an AA pivot to poverty instead of race, but Asians are massively more advantaged than either group and the production of racially diverse classes benefits everyone in the long run. 

If we lived in a perfect meritocracy your point would be valid but we don't. Everyone in the alt-right and alt-light hides behind Asians to espouse ideas that have been rejected for the past 40 years for sound reasons.Moronic point. OP doesn’t state that insulting a supposed “far far far left” individual precludes him from being a centrist. What he does suggest is that the passive aggressive nature in which Dave posted this photo, which is quite obviously not Bernie, is not conducive to the avenues of discussion Dave (as a supposed centrist) purports to hold.

Not surprising, if you’re this far down the rabbit hole with Dave, that you can’t understand that.In my more cynical moments I think this is just Rubin tending to his patreon persona.  He is acting as a personal "fluffer" for right wing attitudes and ideas when he goes out on social media and puts out these little quips.  His constant felating of right wingers is seen by him as the means to keep the gravy train flowing.I'll ignore the fact that you misunderstood my comment and ask what valid point you think he's making with his tweet?I've never found carlin to be funny honestly. I think he's a completely overrated hack and I am rather happy he's dead. That 7 words you can't say bit is just terrible and lazy. 

That being said his material would always have been offensive to some and embraced by others, just as it is today. Just now the people who are offended can post on social media so you might be more aware of them. 

Also that Bill Burr joke sounds really lame, if that's really a joke he said. Oh haha he called her a man even though she identifies as a woman now. I don't get how anyone could seriously laugh at that its just dumb. 

Look at a guy like anthony jeselnik today. He's going farther into the realm of offensive than either burr or carlin not to mention way funnier. 

I don't know if it applies here but one problem with a lot of older comedians is their work stops being as relevant and they try and find people to blame, like college kids or something. This is what we've seen with Jerry Seinfeld who is a complete hack now. So they may seem more right wing as they age because they use "easily offended" people as sort of a scapegoat. This conversation never had a goalpost let's be honest. So I'm just going to bloviate.

Carlin is a bum that people like cause oh look its an old kooky guy and he's using young people words. I don't care what list he's on, dude has never made me laugh. Its just such un-nuanced garbage. Same with Richard Pryor and Patrice O'Neal. I know amateurs better than these clowns. 

Bill Burr is usually a pretty good comedian in my opinion. If he wasn't making a joke then I guess, 1) I agree probably she shouldn't have gotten athlete of the year, 2) pretty unnecessary and immature to call her a "he." Wouldn't say that's an inherently right wing thing to do, just kind of churlish and unproductive. 

I like comedians who show creativity and ingenuity. Political labels are largely irrelevant. I find Steve Greene on YouTube hilarious (I guess he's right leaning). John Stewart was amazing at political humor, but not cause he was left-wing, cause he was actually a comedic genius. Meanwhile Bill Maher is a hack. 

I think as a general rule though, when right-wing politics gets infused into comedy, like with Crowder or that Carrolla guy, it usually doesn't go well. I mean everyone can use the overly-offended college kid trope in their routine to some extent, but real hard right wing politics just doesn't go well with comedy these days. Then often times the lack of positive acclaim causes them to scapegoat "the left." Yeah - Dave's show/tweets have mostly ignored actual current events for at least a month now. Nothing on Moore, the tax bill, net neutrality, CDC censorship, or anything else that's been in the news. 

We're literally at the point where I almost think we could be at war with North Korea next week and Dave would be tweeting about cultural appropriation or some SJW protest at a liberal arts college with 500 students&gt;I hope Dave can grow out of that phase soon.

Don't hold your breath! lolThat may be a valid point about Carlin. I've seen a bunch of his stuff that I guess was considered controversial several years ago. I've never found it funny and have always been rather pissed off by how much it's adored by everyone. Haven't seen his less controversial material and probably should look into it since he's so revered. 

I guess now that we have comedy gold like Family Guy and Always Sunny (and countless comedians like jeselnik) that is just so unapologetically offensive and clever that Carlin's controversial bits just always seemed kind of lame and hacky to me. Like a darker hedberg yeahNo I don't think all Asians are advantaged you know I don't think that and it is obviously an absurd thing to think anyways. What I do think is that in the aggregate Asians and most non-refugee migrant groups do incredibly well.

I also think if we are going to have this conversation it is really disingenuous for you to claim somehow Asians are being subjected to anything that resembles actual racism, they are not being directly discriminated against on account of their race. Tertiary indirect non-invidious harm is not the same as systemic dislike based on skin color for equal protection purposes.

Again we have hollistic factors that we look at and uniqueness is one of the factors, schools geographically favor places where less students come from tht doesn't mean they hate all other places. Schools favor unique stories from students that doesn't mean those who take the standard NHS route to ivys are hated by the university.

You fundamentally do not understand affirmative action schemes at public universities, they don't sit their with a marker and cross off Asians it is wayyy more complex than that. Race is one of many factors that can be considered all else being equal.


"The Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas concluded that a college seeking to produce a diverse student body can only use race in admissions if all other strategies fail. And even then, it can only use race as one consideration in admissions decisions. In other words, that college is to assess a given applicant holistically, taking into account her academic performance, her geographic location, her proposed major, her life story, and her racial background, among other qualities. That in itself makes it really hard to suss out whether a given race-conscious admissions policy discriminates against an entire race of students.

As Peter Joy, a professor at Washington University Law, said in a statement Thursday: “The fact is, these admissions policies are not discriminating against white applicants any more than colleges and universities [are] favoring applicants who have been active in student government, or those with track records of doing service in their communities.” The same could, arguably, be said of Asian applicants.

The Supreme Court long ago established that student diversity is inherently valuable in education. How colleges go about pursuing that diversity is what’s so contentious. Last year, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Texas’s program, which automatically admits students from the top 10 percent of each public high school but considers race to admit those outside that threshold. (Texas schools are extremely segregated by race and class—nearly half of them serve student bodies that are at least 90 percent black and Latino—which some argue necessitates the “Top 10 Percent Rule” as a means of ensuring racial diversity on university campuses.) The court’s decision to uphold the practice of using race for those outside the threshold, according to experts, effectively settled the legal debate: Generally speaking, as long as colleges make a concerted effort to regularly assess the impact of their policies, and as long as they are unable to promote student diversity through other methods, they can use race as a consideration in admissions decisions."absolutely correctDamn where have I heard this before?Good point about Rubin not being smart enough to recognize that he should have at least pretended to care about Seder to get bipartisan points, but he is so vapid he couldn't figure out how convenient it might be for him to pretend to care across party lines. But he didn't and it shows us a lot about how much of a hack he actually is.Left in 2008. Youre right I actively seek out this forum to criticize rubin because he is dishonest. A lot of this is just standard hack-job stuff. Some of the alleged comments might be questionable but aren't quite as bad given the broader context. Much of it is Cenk just saying something dumb. He gets away with saying a lot of stupid things because it's his network. During a lot of segments he just goes in and shoots off at the mouth without thinking much.  He has a unique stage presence and I can see how it would be cool to listen to him, but i still don't find it all that lol funny. Maybe I just had to be more of his contemporary. It's intelligent stuff, but I grew up with the sociopathic humor of mcfarlan, apatow etc. Cassandra Fairbanks! Known for integrity and honesty just like the rest of ppl on that siteThank you for this comment people don't realize how much this narrative is being pushed in an inorganic way by big money to distract from the ugliness that is the modern conservative movement.

From a pure effectiveness standpoint it is genius to the highest degree. See but you are an insightful enough person to reexamine your beliefs and ask yourself, "does this narrative really make sense?" A lot of people are incapable of doing that and that is what is fueling the anti sjw movement. I spend a significant amount of time pointing out rubins inconsistencies and I am a full time law student. 

Put up evidence or shut up, have you ever thought maybe people are going after him because he is dishonest?Yea and when you watch the rubin report the funny thing is its all identity politics "you are a _______ conservative not many of those" and then he invites the lauren southerns of the world on who preach white grievance without recognizing just how ironic that is.YEA LETS ALL GO EASY ON DAVE CAUSE THE BATTLE OF IDEAS IS ABOUT THROWING SOFTBALLS TO PEOPLE WE DISAGREE WITH Rubin has been incredibly rude and downright dishonorable to his former employer who has said nothing bad about him and allowed him an opportunity to get exposure in alt media.

The funny thing is it was only over a mild disagreement about Islam and he goes on twitter and talks ill of them behind their back. I imagine the tyt folks hate him but they are better than rubin and have better things to do than bitch about former coworkers.I admit, I am an avowed Dave Rubin Hater.  This not all I am of course, but I am more prone to bouts of lashing out in posts like this since unlike so many on the right, I actively engage in listening to people from the right as a liberal, and have for basically a decade and a half or more now.

I find the way Rubin conducts himself and blanket smears the left particularly loathsome. Shouldn't have done this. Need to resist right wing hit jobs like this. Either way I still plan on voting for my local justice democrat. Love her platform. This doesn't affect that at all. Kyle Kulinski from secular talk resigned too.  Not a good look for that outfit.  People are already adding the obvious prefix social justice democrats.Ok so he's literally just saying that a bunch of women are hot and wants to fuck them. This is nothing. Complete hack job.  I dont think I am throwing hardballs I think I am just questioning dave's fundamentally dishonest narrative.
Stalk, I genuinely dont think Rubin is personally a bad guy  I do think he genuinely believes the things he says but is incredibly gullible and is riding the SJW bashing patreon wave. 

Then again I may be wrong a part of me does consider the fact that he is doing this intentionally and is secretly actually probably as alt right as cernovich. 

I can't tell, either way, it shows how little these anti-sjw hysteria peddlers can sit down and question their own beliefs. 

Sad thing is for the first 4 episodes of his show with Harris and Nawaz I thought he was on to something and I agreed with a lot of his points. The left isn't perfect .... Sjws are a problem the issue is when you make it seem like SJWs and the left are the only problem, while you let authoritarians off the hook and white supremacists.Ken Stern is falling for this "rural america is the real America" shtick sure rural Americans are nice but lets not forget about half of republican voters hold genuinely vile ideas about race and civil rights. 

Also this guy is insane his argument is that o well the solutions we have to climate change wouldn't work so shit better not try.... It is an absurd argument and is really honestly an argument for better government not less. 

Its like he thinks being in the center is a virtue just because even when it flies in the face of reality.

What I do like about this guy is how he shuts down Rubin's attempt to equivocate about the left and smear NPR. He is obviously a reasonable right winger and I can respect him more than most of the GOP who are genuinely detached from basic facts.Exactly, what rubin is doing is classless and shallow. They were more than gracious to him and still are in that they havent responded and incited a twitter fight. 

Sad thing is this is all over some of the Young Turks stances on islam which are reasonable but often times pretty light on the religion. That being said they havent acted in bad faith so why malign people who have been nothing but nice to you?Now now, he was clearly showcasing signs of being a male.  Not cool bro, not cool.i will be beyond pissed if they try and force him outThis is such a pathetic excuse for Dave. "Dave's got his so fuck any sense of principle or accountability."

pretty much the right-wing manifesto. What do you call it when you treat your former employer with utter loathing just because you disagree with him over one issue? That is the definition of disdain for people who think differently. 

He has also called progressivism a mental illness. He is only civil to the right and is an utter fraud. The people who can't see this are either his fan boys or just find his narrative convenientDo you think he actually believed what he said then or is now just being dishonest about the degree to which he has become right wing.Yes this is why everyone in the Tyt universe dislikes piker, but stupid locker room comments on twitter arent tantamount to assault or anything like that. Well no one is saying he had to remain the same, what were saying is be honeat and stop using the term liberal in this dishonest way. 

He uses liberal as if he means American New Deal Liberal but plays a word game to make it seem as though classic free market lockean liberalism is actual leftism. It is dishonest.This is absurd, this cannot be the standard that we apply to removing people from their jobs. Words 20 years ago simply arent good enough Cenk was an entirely different man. We are setting a dangerous precedent if we bow to these hit jobs. The left is so naive that they fail to realize right wingers will bring allegations of dubious cred just to ruin progressive career. Cenk complains about liberals not fighting but resigns immediately. This is why the metoo moment is beginning to turn into a sort of bloodsport where we act first without truly analyzing the issue... This is why people like Ruybin got popular in the first place "outrage" like this is totally ridiculous and it is obvious  we cant fire our progressive leaders everytime some right wing smear merchant takes a deep dive into one of our guys pasts. 

This smells liek the Sam Seder incident. Liberals are such pussies if someone brings one allegation we cower in fear and universally disarm while the republicans double and triple down. We need to fight for fairness for both victim and alleged. This is absurd JD he said the things when he was a shithead republican, he isnt a rapist, nor is he a rape apologist... give uis all a fucking break JD people make stupid comments when they are younger I have said horrible stuff that I regret we can't set the bar so low that any little comment in our past means liberals have to just destroy themselves.  someone will ask the question, " are you a liberal as in the american sense" rubin will answer yes, say he supports gay marriage and single payer then he proceeds to argue libertarian talking points. 

He needs to just say yes I am a classical liberal in the lockean sense and stop the obfuscation. But he wont do that because he needs the legitimacy of being the "last liberal" to get views.As to paragraph one I agree that is highly plausible.

As to paragraph two I disagree the ex-liberal anti sjw shtick dominates youtube and gets big views. Think AIU, Sargon, Armoured Skeptic, all of these guys are raking in subs running this shtick. There are hundreds of people making livings of this narrative alone.True good points all valid and plausible. I agree on the talent point what they are doing it isnt that complex.absolutely but the difference is that right wingers dont immediately resign just over an allegation, liberals do. There should be an analysis based on the weight of the evidence and the severity of the accusation. I mean I said shit 5 years ago that was quite literally horribly sexist and I consider myself in line with feminists on general goals of equality.Not just that, Rubin also seems to build into his persona a deep desire to shit on the left.Most here don't watch him anymore I would guess. I also think we should try and discourage people from viewing his content because he is quite detrimental to discourse. The false veneer of intellectualism may hold people back from engaging in what I often call the battle of ideas.I can't speak for everyone, maybe some of them do watch it regularly. 

I generally don't care if you take any criticisms seriously. But his show has been more or less the same for over a year and a half. I would say a lot of the people who don't watch it anymore had watched it for some time in the past, and were turned off because it was too hacky and one note. Unless the show has in fact changed drastically, then the criticisms would probably still be valid. Based on the guests, titles, and Rubin's twitter activity, seems like it hasn't changed. His dishonesty and pretense of being centrist and a true liberal.  What the fuck are the rest of us Dave?  Pretenders?  So because we did not inhale a bunch of slop puked up by ayn rand devotees we are not true liberals?

Eff him, and eff you for carrying water for that asshole.The amount of studies demonstrating this proposition are actually quite extensive. People don't self report being racist cause no one is a racist in their own mind. However, majorities of GOP voters believe black people are lazy, Obama is a muslim, and muslims should be banned from the country. Same thing for their attitudes towards mexican people or hispanics.

I made the comment cause the data backs it up/That's generally what happens when people who are famous on the internet encounter people who have serious jobs. I think the point of Rubin Report is found within a wider attempt by right-wing/conservative donors, like the Kochs, to recalibrate what constitutes the centre and thus shift the overton window to the right. For some time now we've been getting evidence that the Kochs have invested a large amount of money in an attempt to shift higher ed and I think that Rubin Report is one of many avenues attempting to do that.

Don't forget, Dave put Glenn Beck, Milo Yiannopolous, Mike Cernovich, etc.... in his "new centre." This is obviously bullshit as these people are solidly right-wing.I'd like to see ContraPoints or Sam Seder on his show. It would be great for Sam and Dave to talk about former Rubin Report guest Mike Cernovich's attempt to have Sam fired from MSNBC because of his free speech rights. 

Of the carefully crafted list you've proposed, I'd most like to see Jonathan Haidt. Haidt has been doing a lot of hit pieces of left-wing university students and I'd like to see what he has to say about things like this:

https://www.prwatch.org/news/2017/01/13210/charles-koch-ramps-higher-ed-funding-talent-pipeline

https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conservative-nonprofit-that-seeks-to-transform-college-campuses-faces-allegations-of-racial-bias-and-illegal-campaign-activityNone of the people you suggested would be acceptable. Sam Seder, Kyle Kulinski, Cenk Uygur, Chapo, David Pakman, Humanist Report, Michael Brooks, Bernie Sanders, Tenahisi Coates, Ro Khanna, Cornell West. There's a nice start for you, maybe i'd start watching again if he had one of those people on. Tired of hearing the same hacky shit over and over again. I think that's a guest that would promote the free exchange of ideas in the long run. Oh totally. He shills for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, but pretends like he's neutral. Did you see that hit piece he released called "The Age of Outrage"? It got torn to shreds by different commentators on social media for its false equivalence. Coincidentally, false equivalences are something Dave likes to do, so they have some common ground there. 

I just think it'd be great for Dave to bring up some of the more clandestine and nefarious actions and see what Haidt has to say. That's entirely different. He didn't deny them service because they were Christians, he denied them service because they've just been distributing extremely homophobic leaflets, as can be seen here:

http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/09/gay-coffee-shop-owner-throws-out-christian-zealots-whose-leaflets-feature-rainbow-hands-dripping-blood/

Do you think a jewish Coffee owner has to serve people who've just been distributing leaflets with antisemitic messages (be they Muslims, Christians, or whatever)?
&gt; But as I interpret this situation, they are denying service to a group of people, which is discriminatory. Can't have it both ways.

I'm not American, but as far as I understand it, it's only discriminatory if it is a protected group (Gays, Women, ethnic minorities, Religious groups etc.)

You are allowed not to serve Neo-nazis, because Neo-Nazis aren't a protected group.

And again, if he had discriminated them *because* they were Christian, it would be illegal, but he didn't ... I'm sure he serves Christians all the time, most Americans are Christians, I don't think he would have much business if he didn't.

No, he didn't serve them because they were homophobic and distributing such material in the city. And Homophobes aren't a protected group.

It was discrimination against individuals who happened to be christians because of their activity, not discrimination against gays because they are gay. 

Discriminatory intent =/= disparate impact

Really basic idea I would consider discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation discriminatory. But if you're talking about groups that are protected by the 14th Amendment of the constitution, gays are not one of them. Also this is private discrimination so the constitution wouldn't offer any help regardless. 

You could try and bring this to the supreme court but I doubt there would be much of a constitutional claim. What you are really looking for is an expansion of the civil rights act, which does protect against private discrimination based on race. This act could easily be broadened to include gays. I believe it should be.&gt; He kinda made it about Xtianity when offered his willingness to fuck jesus in the butt. Which I admit was hilarious. Hint: he was targeting their group with those words and not the fliers.

Nonsense …the whole situation clearly shows that the reason he denied them business wasn’t the fact that they were Christians (I’m sure he knowingly serves Christians all the time), but the fact that they distributed horrific anti-gay material.

So the woman said: *“Christ can save you from that lifestyle,”* which prompted him to say: *“Yeah, I like ass, I’m not going to be saved by anything, I’d fuck Christ in the ass, OK? He’s hot.”* In context there’s simply nothing wrong with that response, it doesn’t mean he hates Christians or Jesus, he’s making fun of their bigotry. If a woman said „I’d totally fuck Jesus, he’s hot!“ Would they find that offensive? Probably not. Would it mean she’s necessarily anti-Christian? No, she might be a Christian herself. The same here (he might be a Christian himself, entirely plausible in my eyes). They might find it offensive because a gay man is saying it and he’s just winding them up and relieving frustration.


&gt; A random commentor on the internet said the following:
&gt; &gt; Hmmmm, lets put in into this analogy. Black activist in the 1960's are giving out literature explaining what they feel is is oppression and really bad things happening to them and others. They then take a break and walk into a white mans coffee shop to enjoy a coffee. The owner realizes that Black people are in his coffee shop and finds out that they have been in his city, yes his city handing out "Offensive" flyers. He of course kicks them out, there is no place for Black people in his coffee shop. Oh and just replace "Jesus" with Martin Luther King's name ( a Christian ) every time the coffee shop owner uses the name Jesus. The man is a Bigot! at the very least.

Let's say black people hand out leaflets and are denied service. Well, if they hand out leaflets that say; „white people are a murderous people who kill their own children in service to themselves.” I absolutely think you should be able to kick them out. You don’t have to tolerate as a white (or any color) coffee owner that kind of hate.

Yet if they are simply asking for equal rights and talking about oppression in their flyers, that wouldn’t justify kicking them out. Will there be grey areas? Of course, and that’s for the courts to decide. But this example is completely inadequate. 

A jewish person, denying service to a group of Muslims who are handing out leaflets, citing Koran verses with additional rants about the evil jewish people, is not a bigot. He should absolutely have the right to deny service to these Muslim, Christians or any other group spewing hate against Jews.


&gt; Furthermore, the owner makes it clear that he sides with the Xtian baker who refused service to some gays:

So what? That doesn’t even make him a hypocrite either! So I don’t even understand how that is supposed to refute his stance in the homophobe-case? You could say he’s consistent, even though wrong in my eyes in regard to the wedding cake case, which likely won’t hold up in Supreme Court (where it’s debated right now) either. 
 
He’s completely correct in his right to deny service to homophobic customers. And it's not a contradiction, because as said before, as a homophobe you don't belong to a protected group. 

The wedding cake case happened in Colorado, where you are not allowed by law to discriminate on the base of sexual orientation in public accommodations. 


Yes, I was aware of that, I might have phrased it a bit misleadingly (confusingly) ...

Of course white people would also be considered to be a "protected group", the same as 'Christians' or 'straight people'. That's why in my post I said that if he had refused them service *because* they were Christians, it would be illegal. But certainly there could be confusion about this, so it makes sense to point this out ...There could be an argument there. However, I think it's a pretty weak one. If you make wedding cakes and would serve a straight couple without question, while refusing to serve a gay couple, that is getting close to discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Moreover, it is effectively indistinguishable from discriminating on the basis of sex. You're saying that man+women get service, while man+man gets no service. Imagine they refused to serve interracial couples. Is that discrimination based on their activity of engaging in interracial marriage? Or is it clear that this is a race-based discrimination? White+white=service, while white+black=no service. &gt; Or maybe they are discriminating against gays because of their gay activities. The situations are really the same thing.

Very weak argument and not the same thing at all. The difference is that 'gay behavior' is intrinsically tied to identity. It is what everyone does; marrying, having sex ... but because of their identity these benign activities suddenly become "objectionable behavior", even though they don't behave any differently than other people, it's just their identity that changes the perception of the exact same activity; their sex will be "gay sex", and their wedding will be a "gay wedding". To say this is simply 'behavior' is therefore totally misleading, as the behavior simply can't be divorced from their identity.

Completely different in this case; here the behavior of distributing these anti-gay leaflets is not simply benign behavior that becomes objectionable by the mere fact that these people are Christians, it's not their identity which makes trivial behavior objectionable – the behavior **itself** is objectionable. He would have kicked out Muslims, Buddhists or atheist just the same way, had they been distributing comparable material ...

You're also not automatically going to be a homophobe if you're Christian. More than half of all Christians in the US are accepting of homosexuality: [Poll – Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/a-new-poll-shows-american-muslims-are-less-homophobic-than-white-evangelical-christians/)

But even if it were the case that 99 percent of people belonging to a religious group were homophobic. That wouldn't protect them either. Because the same way your religious practices are confined by the law, you can't cry foul when you're kicked out of a restaurant for being homophobic, **even** if your religion makes you so. Your religion doesn't protect you from having to play by the same rules as anyone else. Your religion doesn't allow you to beat your wife, even if you find a Koran verse to say so and your religion doesn't give you protection from having to suffer the same consequences as any other person would, conducting themselves in the same manner, homophobic in this case, and is thrown out of a restaurant because of it.This is a good line of thinking to establish greater protection for homosexuals. Thinking of it from the sex discrimination angle is also effective for those who might not come around so quickly. 

Say one male spouse stays at home and the other goes to buy the cake. Whether or not the bakery sells to that spouse is entirely dependent on his/her sex. If it's a male, no sale, if it's a female, yes sale. This is flagrant sex discrimination and it's really not close.  But the bakery owners were sued under a state law, not under the civil rights act
That's why they lost. How would you argue this if it went to the supreme court? Especially with interracial marriages not many people today would buy the argument that people are "merely" against the behavior of interracial marriage, yet not intending to discriminate against black people. 

Obviously with interracial marriage, similarly to gay marriage, the 'behavior' is intrinsically tied to identity.I think Contra's videos are a great response to what Dave calls the "regressive left" and Contra can contextualize and provide nuance on issues that are important to the left in a way that Dave fails to do. 

Dave's always saying how his show is "the battle of ideas" and yet he fails to fairly showcase the two sides. I think this video does a great job of holding Dave up to his own ideal (and simultaneously illuminating Dave's hypocrisy) by providing that counterbalance. Wasn't his version of single payer some kooky shit that wasn't single payer and ended up sounding a lot like Obamacare?He's truly an infuriating personality. Like at least with Ben Shapiro indoctrinates himself with righty talking points, Rubin just loves to annoy the libs and sucked up to right wing assholes I don't know that he's actually conservative. Like in his day to day life I don't think he cares about politics. It seems clear he doesn't want to learn, just make that moneySo fucking true. What sucks is when one of them or one of the people they serve say there's no homophobia(or racism) on the right cuz they have a gay(black) friendI follow him, Elliott Hamilton, ben Shapiro, John podhoretz and Katie Pavlich on Twitter. They fucking suck but they're so fun to hate readSituation: America refuels Saudi jets that kill and torture millions of people in Yemen.
RW Twitter: "yo so sjw got heated someone called a trans person by the wrong pronoun. The end of free speech and the 1st amendment" I think when he said that progressivism was a mental disorder and that it made sense that Weinstein was a "progressive", that was incendiary and clearly wrong The IC has done a shit ton of evil shit before, skepticism is warranted but Rubin just shilling for his Pepe's https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4602422/darryl-w-perry-commits-felony-live-television

Every time I see clips from that libertarian convention, I am reminded how fucking nuts they are.  And he's not the only one!The first amendment argument seems like the strongest one, but I agree that would open up a rabbit hole unless the conservative justices did some crazy mental gymnastics, which they often do. 

Some scholars think that the commerce clause gives the fed exclusive power over interstate commerce. This state act probably affects interstate commerce. So the bakers could try to say the state act is unconstitutional because it infringes on the fed's exclusive power. 

Either way, glad that the bakers lost on appeal. I've seen multiple clips of that guy in particular, and he almost always comes across as unhinged.  Even in the original montage by the op, his face looked wild eyed.  There is a strain of libertarianism that really attracts the people that just seem a bit... off.  It's like those Molyneux eyes.surprisingHaha all you will get is vapid talking points, empty platitudes. I mean Rubin is one of the dumbest media talking heads I have ever seen. Its a scandal that this asshole even has a show; let alone a highly profitable one. But then again pandering to right wingers/alt-righters comes with monetary benefits. I think he does this cuz Bernie and to a smaller degree Warren are the new Dem boogeypeople. The Koch's know if it came down to a national election between a Bernie-Esque politician and a modern American conservative, they'd have a tough fight on their hands Idk if it's awkward. I think he's trying to be funny cuz his fans for some weird reason love his boring ass humor
"I saw Bernie at a classy restaurant"
His fans: "AHAHAHAHAHAH DAVE! But I thought socialists ate dirt"When Rubin said he was holding Trump's feet to the fire he meant he would act as a footstool to keep them warm.  He actually said that he agrees that YT has the right to censor him and he has the right to disagree. 
That just shows how fucking stupid classical liberalism is. He's bringing in large(very stupid) traffic to YT and they respond by demonetizing his work. It's totalitarian regulation not by govt but by a massive corporation. I hate him but YT is disgusting by doing thatYeah that was the wrong word, but he brings massive traffic to YT. He deserves to be paid even if he is a little shitI doubt we'll ever truly know the trail of money and influence behind the scenes, but I'd love to know who is paying whom, and what kinds of rents they were extracting explicitly from puppets like Dave.

Did Dave get a call from a Milo to be on again, but Dave had to say no to sate some of his other peers / paymasters?

Maybe that is what Dave meant by the former friend comment relating to Milo.

It's like when Anderson Cooper dropped Kathy Griffen over the severed Trump head incident.  She said he did not even call her to talk, and now she no longer considers him a friend.  Anderson Cooper was looking out for himself first and foremost.  And I don't doubt for a nanosecond that Dave Rubin would do the same or worse.  Especially with that libertarian ME and MINE ethos he's latched onto.  I think we need to get an active list with a youtube montage of people on the left visibly saying they will appear on Rubins show, everyone you listed and more.  I want it so out in the open that we can post it right back at his lying face every time he goes full Trump mode and lies through his teeth.He is a bit of a star@#$ker.  It's all a climb to him.  He has no problem with putting unknown youtubers on when they are aligned against "the left" but when a left wing person wants to be on, they better drive attention to him and not the other way around.  Or at least that seems to be the implicit standard.He only had Laci on because he thought he could get her to attack the 'left' for not being open to conversation/being mean/nazis etc. There was no way Dave was going to have Laci on before the whole 'awakening' or whatever you want to call it. It' a common pattern. See Harris, Weinstein etc. Dave was visibly uncomfortable when Dawkins clearly didn't want to attack left wing activists during his interview, because Dave planned for an hour of that and when that failed he fumbled through (obviously un-researched) questions about science.As someone pointed out in those replies, he's virtue signaling to the right.Sam does a good job of breaking apart vague right-wing talking points and debunking hacky narratives up-front. I feel left out, I'm a Rubin hater too.  That said, my interests are a bit broader than just hating on him.He does about as well as you can with that stance, but I still think some of the college students need to chill the eff out and let people speak.  I'd rather people come with arguments during the question phase rather than chants and shouts, especially the sort that are designed to insure that NO ONE ELSE that actually wants to hear the speaker speak is allowed to speak.  Just on a basic etiquette level, that kind of behavior is astonishingly rude, then the people doing the disruption have the gall to be put off that others that do not think like they do react negatively?

Case in point.  When someone like Ben Shapiro comes and gives a talk, then mouths off some libertarianish nonsense about the private sector and charity being an effective stand in for healthcare policy like universal healthcare, I'd rather people armed with ARGUMENTS came up and challenged his ass than a gaggle of shouting kids.  The latter makes the left look bad, and worse, makes it seem like we don't HAVE any counters.  This stuff goes on youtube and is easy propaganda for the right wing victim complex.  Imagine an alternative scenario, where dozens of people armed with facts and counter arguments, and pristine examples to illustrate not ONLY that they understand their political enemies argument clearly in the most charitable and strongest possible version  (steelmanned argument vs strawman version), but they have devastating counters that will leave the conservative response little more than a stammering mess.


Let me give you an example between Cruz and Bernie.  They had a healthcare debate awhile back and Cruz was mouthing off typical conservative talking points about wanting more choice.

Enter Bernie.  More choice does not matter if all the choices available are more than you can afford.  Boom.  Done.


You see that?  Would you rather have a choice between 2 affordable options, or 5 unaffordable options?  The latter = MORE CHOICE, but is that better?


You NEVER fucking get to those kinds of exchanges and clarifications if you just shout conservatives down.  It's a SHIT tactic by small minded midget minded people, and it's past time the fools had that trash behavior verbally slapped out of them.

Or just don't pay attention. In the free marketplace of ideas these people shouldn't have an audience. Like Sam says, they get subsidized. "The Problem with President Trump 2016" would have been a nice video to put out if you're really that concerned about cult of personality politics. Check your timeline.  Damore was not fired until after the memos went public.  More than that, the constant instigation and push back against Google's policies was causing disruption among other employees within the company.  That is why he was fired, for causing disruption.  

You can lament that fact, bitch and moan that such push back ought not cause disruption in the first place.  But it did and that alone was legitimate.groumds for firing.  I would not have done it and likely suffered other people who wanted him gone quitting and causing further disruptions and strife.  But they chose differently.  What I find amazing though is still the VASTLY different standards conservatives apply to themselves vs others.  It's always the liberal companies and groups that have to accommodate their sensibilitiesThat guy is going places, great addition to YouTube from the left, we need more of that.There were a lot of liberals offering criticisms of Obama. Maybe those criticisms didn't breach your echo chamber..Rubin really needs someone to respectfully (because he won't invite anyone even slightly critical) but forcefully (because he's to unbelievably, smugly terrible) call him out on all his bullshit, I think you'd be the perfect guest for that. I really do hope he'll have you on!I can link you dozens of videos of the young turks criticizing Obama. I really don't think you want to engage in the marketplace of ideas right now. You just seem upset and childish. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbIBENqZilk

there you go. Now you've officially been embarrassed. I fear ruben would try and steer the conversation towards left bashing type stuff. Probably talk about reza aslan and muslim statistics, and how the left loves muslims but also likes gay rights. So let me get this straight..Cenk criticizing Obama in that video was not actually Cenk criticizing Obama.

You also said every liberal in existence didn't criticize Obama. Everyone here knows that is not correct, so we all point it out and link you videos. But for some reason, you just keep going. Just take the L and move on. Use it as a learning experience. I enjoyed that entire talk a great deal, especially the Rubin part.He criticized Obama's decisions but was in no way critical of Obama. You must be joking. I honestly can't tell if you're serious.youtube inbreds just want to see femenist rekt videos. Hopefully people like shapiro start realizing the horrific form of discourse they are creating. There is always more to talk about when it comes to Dave and Ben shitting on the left.  Peterson does not do that explicitly, he focuses more on propping up the right.The sad part is, Rubins format is actually a good one.  He just chooses not to make the best of it.  But it is actually interesting to have hour long talks without commercials about a bunch of ideas in a more informal setting.  Pakman is much better at it, and does much less of it than Rubin.

Life truly is cruel in that regard, it's like we've got a midget as our champion to run a race where longer legs helps.Why was Shermer dumping on the efficacy of Aubrey de grey's project to extend human life by focusing on repair?  Maybe he was jumbling that project up with other things, but I don't see why systematically figuring out ways to repair/lengthen telomers and other interventions could not allow human live to be extended much further.Has anyone confirmed that all these right wingers are funded by the Koch Brothers?  It's starting to sound like the right when they charge that everything under the sun is funded by Soros (though that is happening less now).  

And to the extent they are funding organizations/people, do we know how much funding they are getting?

Saving that, has anyone made a tree of funding to see how widespread and deep their funding goes?  I think a visual would go a long way in exposing just how deep the tendrils of pay to think goes.Ahhh that was soooo good to hear mate. Just like you I hate Dave Rubin with a burning passion. And I’m so glad that people (some prominent people) are finally calling out this hack. Pakmans still being too nice to Rubin, Pakman needs to understand that Rubin is a vile &amp; poisonous snake that will sell his grandmother out for money. 

In any case, Ali Rizvi &amp; now Destiny obliterating that slimy prick makes my day. Just wish that Sam Harris had the balls to do this too. He had a discussion with David Pakman a little less than a year ago. He seemed to not understand how the ideology of Classical Liberalism and advocating for single payer are opposed to one another. Later, he doesn't seem to understand what exactly what single payer is, so it's probably a case of ignorance, or maybe he just said he supported single payer because he thought it would appeal to more people."the left's" ability to connect with the common person. Why not try and say something substantive instead of using these vague and useless generalizations?Countering anecdotal evidence with more anecdotal evidence. I think you'd agree that healthcare is a pretty complicated issue that you can't just solve using personal experience. One problem in the US for example is that people just don't go to the doctor because they can't afford it. As a result we have seen a decrease in life expectancy the past two years. Preventive care is a very effective form of treatment, but a lot of poor people can only afford catastrophic plans because insurance companies jack up pricing for plans that actually offer coverage. I'm aware that wait times are a huge issue in Canadian healthcare, but that is only one element of the healthcare conversation. Canada as a whole does better in terms of equality in and access to healthcare. And most general rankings I've seen put Canada ahead of the US in healthcare. Would you trade the Canadian system, for all its issues, for the US system or for some other universal healthcare system (spoiler alert, there are many others and a lot o them have comparable wait times to the US)Canada was still ahead of the US. What do you mean by a secure working person? That is tautological. Someone who is a secure working person must have decent access to healthcare, otherwise they would not be secure. 

You're still relying on anecdotes (the thing about your family doctor), which are considered pretty weak here in the marketplace of ideas. I know people who go to Ontario for medicine all the time. 

I'm sure we can just agree that both systems have deep-rooted issues. I can't really think of too many redeeming qualities of the US system. Doctors are shitty for the most part and it is very expensive. Physicians will tell you to go home and rest then charge you like $500. The focus tends to be on expensive surgeries rather than preventive care because there is more money in corrective procedures. Healthcare is just depressing here.-I'm sure I could give examples but they would probably be minimalized by you.

-What would that accomplish? Anecdotes about the left's inability to connect with the common person would be inherently subjective.

-Do you not find it ironic that Rubin and my generation's liberal heros (Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Pinker etc) were once considered flaming liberals?

-I don't know who the fuck these people are. Either way, who considered them flaming liberals? Why does this matter? They have certain views, people disagree with these views. Welcome to the marketplace of ideas. It makes no difference if people see them as neocons or any other label. These are just generalizations that don't lead anywhere. 

-It just baffles my mind that so many people on the left are pushing away such a large part of the center because we can not agree on a few things.

-Pushing away? What does that mean? So people disagree with you. This is what the marketplace of ideas is about. 

If you're worried about what other people are doing and letting that affect your ideology then you probably aren't seriously trying to engage in political discourse. You should form your views on evidence and reason. You can call yourself left, right whatever the fuck you want. Let other people call you whatever they want, it makes no difference. This is one of the biggest blinders of people on the left.  They seem to think that just because some of us do not believe every population of human beings on the earth with varied lineages have absolutely identical average aptitude levels, in the same we we do not assume all populations have identical average height after controlling for nutrition, that we are deep seated racists who secretly want what the alt right wants.

This cosmic failure of imagination is tiring.  I get it, most people who openly talk about such differences on the internet are alt right ethno state assholes, but that is not everyone.


As for Sargon, I despise him.  I broke with him once he went soft on Trump and started openly supporting anyone but Hillary.  She was no prize but his decision to advocate for anything but Hillary was the kind of focus that gave us this Trump mess, on top of Hillarys failures.  Sargon is more comfortable talking to the alt right than he is the left, and is definitely more antagonistic to the left than the right.  In fact, anyone that can go on Rubins show without arguing against Dave on numerous issues or throwing up is no kind of liberal in my view.This gay marriage line he constantly uses is BS of the highest order.

At the next Republican primary contest, a candidate pledging to ban gay marriage would be adored by the party's base. Nothing has changed.He's basically a dumber Andrew SullivanWe would also vet people to participate in insufferable 5-hour long live-streams. It would be a multi-faceted campaign. Yea probably notTYT actually is looking pretty decent these days IMO. I remember Sargon explicitly telling someone on a stream who could not bring themselves to vote for Trump to vote for anyone but Hillary or no one at all (and by extension, one less vote in favor of Hillary if not another for Trump).

That was the moment I completely turned on Sargon.  It became crystal clear to me he was a man driven and defined by his HATREDS of the left, much like a Prager but from different angles.  And his solutions were so wild and destructive he may as well be Heath Ledgers Joker in his willingness to burn civilization down to teach "the left" a lesson for going too far off the rails in his view.

People who formerly focused on anti sjw content almost exclusively, like Thunderfoot and Spino (not alternative facts) abandoned that myopic focus because they could not follow people like Sargon down that path of near total nihilism.

A path that saw the right as a less destructive path than the left, even in its imperfect state.You can hate socialism all you want, but MLK was definitely a socialist If Islam apologetics turned you off TYT to an extent then how can you bring up the Majority Report as a counter-point? I stopped watching Sam Seder's content over specifically this issue. 

What particularly tipped me over the edge was this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZhKtFemoxI

It' an interview with Omer Aziz discussing Aziz's appearance on Sam Harris' podcast (ironically titled "The Best Podcast Ever") and the Majority report guys appeared to uncritically defend Omer and attack Sam despite the aforementioned podcast warranting the opposite.

The word regressive gets thrown around a lot these days and has basically lost it's meaning. But there was a brief window where it actually had a pointed and relevant meaning. The Majority Report certainly fell into this definition when I stopped watching the show.We need left-leaning youtubers that can gain traction. I see a lot of really small leftist channels, but they have a hard time getting any sort of following in this internet climate. 

Personally I think we need people who are kind of jerks to step up. Like people who really don't give a shit what other people think and just tell it like it is. Sam Seder, kyle k, humanist report, these people have an edge to them that makes them more like-able. But at the same time people who make well thought out and well researched content. I think it would be good if we had someone that was just relentless about taking down these centrist hacks like rubin (and sometimes harris). They get away with too much BS and have such an unfortunate arrogance about them. I want someone who just decimates Rubin until he is just a bloody pulp on the pavement of the marketplace of ideas. Guys like Kyle and Pakman do mostly news and politics stuff. You know, the important stuff. But if we can get someone who just takes shot after shot at Rubin and gains some traction, that would be cool. We could nip this centrist problem in the bud. They have been producing some pretty good content recentlyhi, i made this sub. i used to defend rubin here but now i dont like himdeath of the skepticsid subscribeMLK was on par with Herbert Spencer politically. This is just a fact. If you disagree then you are trying to suppress my freedom of speech on college campuses. I think Sam Harris is a bit of a phony. His podcast is the most pretentious shit I've ever seen. He just kind of picks a topic then riffs on that topic aimlessly. He also just seems like an insufferable creep. He is like Jordan Schlansky from Conan except not a parody. It will forever be a hollow statement.  All political movements have diverse viewpoints.  Does this human sponge of a host think everyone on the left agrees?  But the range has fuzzy limits.

Conservatism can easily accommodate being liberal on gay issues because most millennial conservatives are liberal on those issues, no matter how many times that font of lies brings that useless point up.  On the non negotiables, Dave Rubin and the people at his rally that were on board for that tpusa event were inside the economic conservative/libertarian line where they did not stray TOO Far from each other where it counted.  They don't want opinions TOO diverse.

It's such a dishonest frame, but what else should we expect?  Conservatives are not the most honest people.I support single-payer healthcare. Any Rubin fans want to change my mind?Wow they just pick him apart so easily lolSams biggest failing is his continued association with Rubin and refusal to call him out for the dishonest shill machine he is. 

As for having Murray on, that was fine to me, but then I did not reject the basic conclusions of the bell curve.  No one to my knowledge has disproven the basic conclusions of the bell curve related to some of the group variance in average iq being based partly on genetics.  

And before you run off the rails, you need to provide definite proof that you can account for nearly 100% of the observed variances we see with environment and or some epigenetic factors (the latter of which may as well be genetic for all we know how to alter them).

Do you have that?  Does anyone?  Then no, Jesus, you do not have  proof his conclusions were wrong.  The best anyone has done so far is make arguments that Murrays evidence was insufficient to prove his case.  Even if you agreed with that, that does NOT say the case he was trying to make was wrong.  

Do you understand these points?  I get the sense so many do not.Correct. 

Example:

David Horrowitz:  Obama is a communist (say this phrase in the most snarling way possible)

Dave Rubin:  Huh, that's an interesting way to describe him, what makes you think he's a communist?

That hypothetical Rubin response is HYPER non combative, nowhere NEAR The level of verbal Fury I'd have unleashed on Horrowitz if he just puked up that nonsense in front of me, but of course Rubin said nothing of the kind.  Ridiculous charge allowed to stand.

Dave:  I just let the guest have enough rope to hang himself

(reads comments and looks at interview score)  almost no one bothered by the over the top charges, the rope was burned by the right wing cesspool viewers, nothing to see here.  

Such a jokeDang I completely forgot about Ben Shapiro's wife. How can I still support single-payer knowing that he is married to a doctor? That would just be such a violation of everyone's free speech. Dave is a supposed free speech guy, but here he is mocking an athlete for both using his speech (by expressing discontent with a homophobic politician) and his right to associate (or not associate) with people of his choosing. 

I'm really starting to think Dave is a little hypocritical with his whole free speech schtick.To be honest I've always found Dave's free speech schtick to be a scam. He's quite selective (had nothing to say about the Cernovich assault on Seder or Trump's threats on free press or to expand libel laws). 

I think Dave is selling the free speech schtick as a sort of existential threat in order to rile up his followers. Fear is a very palpable emotion and it's easy to corral people to follow your ideology if you hold the antidote. Dave is following the conservative modus operandi in this way by positing that the left are causing people to lose things (as opposed to extending benefits to other people), which has a very notable effect on one's psyche. Based on the title, the video seemed like an opportunity for Dave to offer a measured qualification of his previous socialism video. But instead, it is a stupid experiment to show how YouTube favors left wing-type videos. The problem is all political content is being demonetized. If Dave exposed himself to other types of political content on the platform, then he would know this. Looks like it's been deleted alreadyYea it's like just an ordinary LA douchebag talking non-stop. Wouldn't be surprised to hear him start talking about his new wheatgrass smoothie routine and how he's getting into tai chi or some bullshit. I don't think so as that would require Dave to expose his right-wing/alt-lite viewership to positions that are outside his echo chamber.How about a blobfish?

https://weirdnature.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/the-blobfish-and-20-other-animals-so-ugly-theyre-cute.png?w=748I didn't think of it from that angle. Holy shit I'm DaveI have read selections from that and I vehemently disagree with most all of the main arguments. Especially now that I am learning about legal contracts. But it may be worth revisiting. I appreciate the suggestion. Are you looking for empirical work or more theoretical literature? 

A lot of Marcuse's stuff deals with the role of capitalism and decay. [This book in particular is particularly salient for that topic.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/1969/essay-liberation.htm) In particular, his descriptions of the role of technology in fomenting decay is quite topical today.

edit: reread your post and this is probably not what you're looking for, but still an interesting read imo.He's so fucking dumb. Those kids without healthcare and those undocumented people who are scared shitless cuz they can be deported are doing just fine, right? Fucking shitheadI do think finance has a lot to do with it as Dave comes of as a bit of an opportunist. 

I think when he went down the right-wing rabbit hole there was very little he could do (even if he wanted to) to get out of peddling this kind of content (without losing significant financial backing).

Unfortunately I think the cause and effect are circular. The more Dave sees the right validating his ideas (particularly through cash payments via Patreon or Koch donations) the more he's inclined to drift towards an exclusively right-wing schtick, which in turn reinforces right-wing support for his show and so on and so forth.Dave Rubin is a pathetic, cowardly, despicable far-right wing shill. Its one thing to be a right wing partisan hack, but Rubin is such an asshole that he will never admit this and keep pretending that hes a liberal. True, but I still wouldn’t respect him mate! As people don’t change THAT much either when it comes to politics. Maybe a couple of people do but Rubins a sell out &amp; a spineless disgraceful hack.That one weird, not very funny Owen guy. I'm pretty sure Dana Carvey is a conservative but "conservative" and "comedy" usually aren't in the same sentence Sam Seder does hilarious breakdowns of Dennis Miller, a prized conservative comedian. I would recommend everyone watch them. I just found out another lovely tidbit, apparently whoever runs the prageru channel and looks at comments is an active shadowbanner.  I've been commenting up a storm, my comments appear to me, but I switched to another browser with nothing logged in and nothing I've posted shows up in the comments on Pragers channel.

I'm sure Prager hires people as part of the prageru funding drives to sift through the comments to make sure there are no links to videos challenging any of the assertions contained therein, or allowing too many critical comments to exist from "troublesome" users.

What a bunch of fucking pussies.  Battle of ideas my ass, this just confirms it, nothing but a useless agitprop channel, right down to the removal of dissent.  The big strong conservatives just can't take any scary wittle comments that go against their narrative.A twisted demon has captured your husband and extended family, in order to free them you must answer the following question truthfully on YouTube for the world to see.  The demon can detect lies, so doing so will result in the deaths of your loved ones. 

Knowing what you know now, if you were FORCED to vote for Trump or Hillary, and that vote would tilt the scales one way or the other, who would you vote for?Saying Gary  Johnson = people die, refusing to choose between those two = people die, which is it then?Not really a question or a challenge thereGeneral comment.  James on the left is just mildly irritating.  Rubin and Candice are genuinely loathsome to me based on how they conduct themselves. I'll subscribe, link the channel once it's started! Also in law school atm.I'll definitely check it out, we need more people on the left that jump into the fray on different topics like this, the right has too many tentacles and there is precious little pushback from certain angles.

Same goes for legal arguments as well, they love trotting out some "scholar" that is steeped in the federalist society dogma, as if that is the only angle worth defending and promoting.  (I'm more sensitive to this since I've listened to talk radio for years and hear more of their slanted arguments than most liberals.If it eases your worry, the link is actually to a Sam Seder video poking fun at the group, so no views/revenue actually goes to the clowns.I agree.  I am much less picky about my allies when it comes to picking on the bigger political obstacles I am opposed to.

I am not with people like Sam Seder in his hostility to people like Sam Harris, but I am also not bothered by Seder and Cenk as many people that are Harris followers are.  I realize most of these people are imperfect and not going to be aligned with me on everything.  In the end, it does not matter that Cenk is overly sensitive and has trouble distinguishing the difference between criticisms of Islam and muslims as people, he's more right than wrong when he goes after conservative and libertarian ideas against universal healthcare and numerous other policy issues.   

I do not think most of us have the luxury of being that picky right now. Id recommend watching the entire clip from the main show, stats at 1 hour 19 minutes.

its so fucking cringeHe definitely comes across as being remarkably indifferent and unperturbed by human bullshit.

He's friends with Deepak Chopra as an example, and now he seems chummy with another Chopra class bullshit artist in Rubin.Dave is trying to defend rape apologist Jack Murphy in order to trigger the libs. From Jack Murphy's website: ["feminists need rape"](https://t.co/lVQnl4aX77)I actually consider myself pretty left, but didn't they bankroll their whole economy on oil? Seems pretty dumb especially if you buy into renewables and EV being the future(which it probably will be)I don't think he was making that argument, no. Rubin and this guy are both horse shit on nutrition. Check out nutritionfacts.org for some high quality nutrition-related content. They remain evidence-based and avoid fad stuff entirely. A paleo diet high in meats and fish is going to be bad for your arteries because those foods are very high in cholesterol. Very important to limit consumption of meat. You could get heart disease rather quickly eating like that. Joe Rogan has consistently promoted dangerous nutrition advice on his channel. He has on people with no credentials or expertise that simply promote harmful diets. Lost basically all respect for the guy because of that. Two hilarious anecdotes from the crazy right wing conspiracy wing in Alex Jones.  

1.  Reports that his supplements tested for higher than safe levels of lead.

http://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-infowars-supplements-tainted-lead-687019


2.   This was more of a comment, some interview of his lead to him mentioning he was only 43 years old...  (dude looks mid 50s at a minimum).  One guy in the comments said:

I will NOT be taking his supplements!


Which I found hilarious, if that is what they produce, god help anyone who takes them.Yes. It is funny how the low carb high fat diet just keeps on popping up. It has for decades. This diet winds up being detrimental because people have to consume high amounts of meat and dairy. It pops up under another label every few years, then gets widely discredited and disappears for a while. Exactly, these people are giving dangerous advice. Now Rubin is promoting them. People want "experts" to tell them that you don't need to eat vegetables and can just consume insane amounts of cholesterol and still be healthy. This sort of advice literally kills people. Seems like the Rubin Report of nutrition haha. The colliding of these two worlds now makes perfect senseAvoiding processed sugars is good advice. Unfortunately it does matter where you get your nutrition from. Like we know processed meats are linked to cancer beyond reasonable doubt. We know red meat is likely carcinogenic. We know high cholesterol leads to atherosclerosis and heart disease. Paleo is cool insofar as it tells people to eat whole foods, but then it forces you to consume inordinate amounts of meat. Hence, it is not an advisable diet. Dave is a huckster who expresses his views vicariously through his conservative guests. Who would want to come on Dave's show when Dave acts in bad faith by mocking adversaries like this? Rubin fanboys are always saying how he's a neutral host offering a platform for discussion, but is there anything neutral about the way Dave is behaving here? I don't know anything about this Justin Ling guy, but this seems like an excessively offended tweet from Dave about someone he knows nothing about.

Dave we know you aren't a neutral observer but a right-wing shill. Come out and say so; stop with this reformed leftist schtick you're purporting.Don Lemon = milquetoast liberal, not too much rigorous push back there
Larry King = the king of fluff interviews 
David Sirota = didn't he come into Rubins show to shit on Hillary and talk about how awful she was?  Gee, I wonder why he was on.

Mark Duplass =  guy on the left that is not a defender of the left and advocate for its ideals, they touched on problems with the left as that is a favored topic with Rubin, bring someone on associated with the left to toss in criticism of the left.

Brett Weinstein = known for and reacting against over the top left wing activism, he was brought on to shine a spotlight on the worst aspects of the left.  Hillary Rosen, I do not remember much from her appearance other than Rubins right wing audience going ape shit


https://youtu.be/CLUpLwr9k9M

Rubin learned his lesson, don't upset the base, the kapuchinskis of the world are fragile creatures and want to be coddled

John  fugelsang?  Don't even remember that appearance, but let's assume that was an example of Rubin reaching out beyond his shtick of nothing but shitting on the left and blowing the right.  The scales of judgment still show Rubin to be an over the top right wing shill.
Don Lemon was on 2 years ago, before Rubin became what he is now. Sam Seder is like a battle rapper. He clowns people when he debates them and just laughs the whole way through. He is the guy from Bob's Burgers. What do you expect? He is a comedian. At least Sam is comfortable with who he is. 

Rubin doesn't offer anything really. Why would you even bring him up? The guy is irrelevant in the marketplace of ideas. Rubin go ahead and hold the LRubin would have called MLK an SJWI didn't know he ever said that. I try not to pay attention to the guy because he sounds like kermit the frog and looks like he's been dead for 10 years. But goddamn he is a delusional idiot. Jordan Peterson is an absolute moron. It's not even a new tactic.  Remember that book by Thomas Frank, What's the matter with Kansas?  Same tactic, different culture war issues.

The right lost their wedge over anti gay attitudes when that went away from under them so they switched to focusing on tantrum throwing college campus kids on THE most left wing concentrated campuses.

Do we drive/fly out to THE most right wing churches and protest with pro choice signs and pro choice speakers near their places of worship?  

But there is an asymmetry of cultural power dynamics, the left is more dominant in the tech world, mainstream media, and entertainment, and academia in large part because more left wing people gravitate to those fields and areas of study.  Those centers of power are clustered in cities and larger metros where more liberals live than conservatives.

Is it liberals fault that WE built the shit the right is so jealous they don't control?  No, but their bitterness overflows, and they are going full stream with guerilla tactics.  I have seem multiple examples of youngish guys being sucked in by these side concerns, real policy be damned, all culture war bullshit, more cats chasing the laser pointers on the wall.Well that is subjective. Also what a dumb question right? Who has had it better historically, men or women? Well it obviously depends on an infinite amount of factors, including personal preferences. Stupid question to try and answer. 

In the US and many societies, women were systematically denied rights. Like by the government. They weren't allowed to do certain things by law. State-sanctioned discrimination is not a good thing. Especially for the victim. There is some tention between Michaels environmental views and that of many other left wing environmentalists.

If I could give a phrase to describe the division, I would say it's being "pro human" vs "anti human"

For example, Michael is not indifferent to the energy needs of the third world, he does not look at their increasing energy use as some planetary catastrophe to be avoided.  He WANTS them to use more energy, just wants the energy brought online to be in a cleaner form.

His enemies on the environmental left are more indifferent to the energy needs of the poor of the world, and their desires to have better lives.  Solar/wind or bust, no nuclear, and no coal either, that leaves energy more expensive than it could be in some areas, or leaves a lot of coal and natural gas on the table.  

The solution offered by many of these people?  they turn into neo malthusians, neo paul erhlich clones and advocate for reductions of human population, because their mentality is that humanity can do nothing other than create waste and filth with every consumer brought into the world.  They have a dim view of the potential for technological breakthroughs to all humanity to have our cake and eat it too, so they are intrinsically less pro human, less pro prosperity, and have a kind of energy/population austerity attitude for the world.

There are some deep psychological schisms between the groups.  Again, I'm in the Michael Schellenberger camp, I think most of our problems are solvable.

With each passing month and year, solar and wind gets cheaper, I have no problem with expanding nuclear, particularly those new molten salt reactors that seem much safer than the types of reactors that have caused problems so far, electric cars and eventually planes are being expanded and developed as is the ever increasing quest for more battery power.

The economic engines of the entire consumer electronic and transportation world has an interest in batteries getting better in terms of energy density, longevity, and durability.  That march of progress will continue.  Our energy is NOT finite, the earth is not a finite pie, it is NOT a closed system, we literally have "free energy" pouring in from the outside via the sun, and we can harness that energy to do work without a neverending need to burn crap for day to day transportation.  In the long run, entropy will win out, but I'm not worried about billions of years in the future and the heat death of the universe or the point where the Sun expands enough to shift earth out of a habitable zone.  On the time scales I and most others ought to give a shit about, things can be great for a long time.

There is endless promise, so long as we are not blasted by some wayward Quasar or struck with a large meteor, or nuke ourselves to death, we have a decent shot at getting over the hump to a better world.  And the incalculable pessimism and nihilism of many on the environmental left is stifling.  I'm on the left, but I am not like them, nor is Michael.

I just hope he has not become so disillusioned that he's pulled a mini Rubin and started taking the crazy/libertarian pills for his general attitude about politics and life.Just to be clear, it was more mildly positive about the potential for the interview to be good.  Most of that potential I attribute to the guest, not Dave.  I am basically a consistent Dave Rubin hater at this point based on ample evidence we have all seen in how he conducts himself on his show, who he invites, and his virtue signaling to the right on twitter and conservative media.  His endless maligning of the left as if we are some holy evil / monolith, with only HIS brand of classical liberalism (i.e. less insane libertarians) contains any decency.

I can't stand Dave most of the time, but every once in awhile a guest says something interesting enough to shift my attention away from Daves failings.  Hope springs eternal.I'll take back the media portion as that is giving into the right wing victim complex that because entities like the NYT and washington post and CNN are not run by conservative ideologues, that they have no outlets or that their capacity to send a message out is less than that of the left.  I think in some ways it's greater.

But on tech, aren't the biggest concentrations of people that run tech companies on the left?

I do not think of Zuckerberg as a liberal.  Neoliberal?  Maybe, but that is a different standard/metric.  Same with Sergey Brin and Larry Paige.

Is Bezos a conservative?  libertarianish maybe, but he does not come across as a right winger.

Elon Musk?

Sam Altman?

The entrepreneur crowd seems overloaded with more liberally minded people, standard business owners are probably more conservative but since the tech scene was more tilted toward the former I thought it would be a more left wing outlier.I'm worried about generation Z, the generation after millennials.  They grew up in the backlash against sjw and many of them are still ardent devotees of anything people like Sargon of Akkad spit out.

I remember seeing some young kid (gen z) review a movie, the kid was surprisingly insightful and sharp, then look at another video of his before they were all deleted where he'd jumped with both feet into the anti sjw brigade.  He also seemed to follow Milo and Jordan Peterson.

He's definitely not alt right, and has not gone completely down the rabbit hole, but I think he has been lured in by these people and made hostile to "the left" writ large, when the left has a lot of better answers going forward for the nation.If it a pa else Rubin will be forced into talking pro Trump positions.He probably thought it was easy, until all of his vapid, forgettable platitudes left the system and his page count was still "1".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie-9Z5aN4OgCan we get Bill Maher off TV?No because I watch it and he gets under Donnie's skin."Well I think it's basically fine that Trump has just fired the guy who was investigating and indicted all sorts of shifty people associated with the administration, but it's so hard to make an opinion because of the hysterical left."This right here is the answer, when Trump does or says something clearly off the wall, he will check out to make sure he NEVER steps on the Trump/right wing fan bases toes.  

You can make a credible case for Sam being on the left, if not the hard left.  You can't even begin to do that for Eric Weinstein outside social issues.These three internet bores being described as the "frontline of free speech" is legitimately offensive to all the people across the world who are currently being imprisoned for speaking out against oppressive governments etc. About 5 minutes into the interview (if that). I cackled.Yeah, being interviewed on a soft seat in an air-conditioned room is exactly the same as being thrown into a Gulag camp.Christ, this is the most boring thing I've ever listened toShapiro is STILL talking about his Piers Morgan appearance (over five years later).

Rubin is STILL talking about Affleck v Harris on Bill Maher (over three years later).

Get the fuck over it...I'm not sure, but I'm more interested in the question of which is more likely to happen on Rubins show first, some left wing pushback against his narrative or the heat death of the universe.Sam is not a libertarian, is fine with redistribution and not openly hostile to government like the right and libertarians or "classical liberals"

He's not hard left at all, some might call him neo liberal, but that does not put him on the right.  Pretty sure he's fine with something like a universal healthcare system.  Not a right wing view.**James O'Brien** - British radio host. Probably the loudest 'Stop Brexit' voice in the media, an outstanding debater and a vociferous critic of both populism and unregulated capitalism.

**Miriam Margolyes** - Iconic character actress. A pro-Palestine Jew who is highly critical of the Israeli government. I'd like to see Dave's response to some of her arguments (some of which I've found quite shocking).

**Lord Alf Dubbs** - Refugee-turned-politician. Born in Czechoslovakia, he was saved from the Nazis as a child and now campaigns to offer unaccompanied Syrian refugee children safety in Britain.Just a powerful Dave Rubin quote I wanted to share with you allI don't think this is Rubin. I'm trying to find the source for it.

It has all the meaningless vacuity and platitudes from Rubin so it's plausible Rubin said it, but I'm not convinced it's from him.The peterson one had me in tearsMaher is firmly anti war.[sawce](https://youtu.be/-yFhR1fKWG0?t=5m19s)Thom Hartmannhttps://mobile.twitter.com/21logician/status/830956685644722177/video/1You sound like a casualty in the war of ideas. It's all good tho - I am too.Haha dude! Sam Harris would offer absolutely no pushback. On the contrary he would join in on the left bashing wholeheartedly. He would utter the same talking points about SJW's, free-speech, liberal campuses etc. For gods sake, a suppossedly intellectually honest man such as Harris funds this garbage show "The Rubin Report" on Patreon. How the hell can Harris an anti-Trumper, anti-fake news person donate money to a Koch brothers funded far-right, GOP &amp; alt-right apologist shill like Rubin who spends all his time attacking the left, CNN, NY Times &amp; promoting real fake news such as Breitbart &amp; Infowars?Perfectly exemplifies that Freedom Toons cartoon; “I agree!” I don’t particularly agree with Peterson or Shapiro but it’s pretty apparent Dave is too stupid to know what the hell they’re talking about.I remember in the first Faisal interview he said something like "I'd have Noam Chomsky on the show but I don't think he'd want to be interviewed by someone smarter than him." I think that was actually the beginning of the unravelling of Dave Rubin for me.[For comparison, Dave's reaction to the Don Jr./Russia meeting in Trump tower in July, 2017.](https://twitter.com/Alex__Katz/status/959485663795036160)I think he was butt hurt over the designation "alt right"

To which the reporter should have LOUDLY corrected his mistake, I misreported, you are not a member of the alt right, just a member of the right in general, and dared Rubin to deny it.I stand corrected, I was going off comments he made on a video bitching about the reaction where I recall him focusing on someone calling him alt right.  Should have known this cluster of deceit would be spinning there too.HAHA you have high profile "intellectually honest" people like Sam Harris, Weinstein Brothers who refuse to call him out and people like Sam that still donate to him on Patreon. How stupid is that?I honestly think that Rubin does not possess an IQ higher than 70-75 mate! He is colossally stupid &amp; also dishonest!He's too stupid to realize he's right wing. He truly believes that because he is libertarian on social issues and is gay that this means he isn't a conservative and is still liberal. 
Lol!! These people really think these things are turning points in history.It's hard to believe they were ever friends the way dave rubin always talks shit about them. As you said he was treated well so it's strange that he hates them so much. He's like an ex that just wont go away. 

apparently one of the things that made him leave was because of the whole feud between cenk and sam harris. If you're going to break a friendship with someone who's the reason you are successful over his personal opinion of a public figures view, you need to rethink your life.You're giving him too much credit. Dave Rubin is a moron. It's just strange that he would treat someone that he was good friends with the way he does, especially when Cenk hasn't even done anything to him personally. He had a disagreement with Sam Harris and they talked it out like adults, which Dave is apparently incapable of going and instead insults him via twitter in order to get retweets. I dislike Rubin as much as the next person here, but I don't think it's quite as one-sided as you make it seem.

I remember at the very beginning, the first months of the Rubin Report; Rubin talked about how he was losing friends because of the content of his new show, and how former friends and co-workers would write him angry e-mails about how he's a terrible bigot and a racist. It was strongly suggested that one of these people was Ana Kasparian, who he was very good friends with before. I think he said that it was after the Milo interview that this started.

(The Milo interview was when I started disliking him as well).

So some of them broke off contact (and friendship) with him early on. He said that they just wouldn't respond to his texts anymore etc. ...

He was still friends with Jimmy for quite some time and in contact with Ben Mankiewicz, but apparently that broke off too ...

It seems both sides got bitter at each other. TYT is handling it more professionally though – and that "Nice Tweet" was simply atrocious. 

But that was at the very beginning of the newly launched show, in 2015, when he said that, not now. I seriously doubt he made that up at the time ...I thought the same thing, they agreed on so much. Cenk has similar views on Islam as Sam does. That doesn't explain why his relationship with Jimmy Dore and Ben Mankiewicz soured. Even then I think it's better to talk it out privately rather than going on twitter bashing them just so you can get retweets.And projecting their own victim complex onto the left. Dave always talks about the opression olympics but he has his own oppression olympics where he is on the top. I dont know why TYT ever employed him, he never said anything of value. do you have a link?I didn't condone his behavior at all, I simply said it doesn't seem to be as as one-sided as you made it seem. In the end nobody of us know what exactly transpired between them, but from what he said at the time, allegedly some TYT people called him a bigot and broke off contact with him, and then it escalated further from there ...

It doesn't seem to me that they were just all really nice or neutral to him and he bad-mouthed them out of nowhere is what I'm saying.

But TYT conducted themselves more professionally, because they largely kept it private ...


It's possible, but I recall even after he left he had Jimmy dore on the show and he said that he was still good friends with Cenk, and Cenk seems to be his main target on twitter.I don't think him and Cenk had contact after Rubin relaunched the show, Rubin had an injury at the time, so they didn't ever meet for basketball anymore. But they were still on friendly terms, or even "friends", but I don't think they ever met again ...

I don't know whether Cenk wrote e-mails to Rubin accusing him of bigotry too; He did accuse hime thereof on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/668131932887126016), but this was in response to Rubin calling Cenk "demonizing and divisive" in regards to the Israel Palestinian conflict, which was in response to Cenk making straw-man arguments about Harris' opinions ... 

I read that superchat in the livestream and was like wtf, so over the top.  I thought for sure Dave would have the sense not to parrot that insult, but he just read it all out.

It makes you wonder what can't you get him to parrot?  Spend 5 bucks on a superchat with a female guest and ask why she is such a c$%t wh*re.
Sorry, wrong president (we're getting geographically closer though) ...

Of course that correction by Trudeau was ridiculous, although it's not irrelevant to care about what language conveys or perpetuates in my eyes – but of course it's totally over the top to correct somebody this way.

But seriously, from the guy who hasn't yet managed to criticize Trump in any serious way ... Don’t forget the time Saad went to the Canadian Senate and got laughed at cause he doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about: https://mobile.twitter.com/21logician/status/862597047823806465?lang=enI'm also in the banned twice group. I criticized, but didn't insult. He's a pathetic little snowflake desperately trying to keep the lie alive that he hasn't become a reactionary right wing Trump shilling pundit.

I don't disagree... since he's the **real**, the **last** and the **classical** liberal... that all makes him pretty liberal.

"marxists roots of postmodernism"

I am not that well versed on postmodernism (I only read culture, ideology and theory in https://thecharnelhouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fredric-Jameson-Postmodernism-Or-the-Cultural-Logic-of-Late-Capitalism.pdf), but isn't postmodernism at it's most basic the rejection of all grand narratives (which is what marxism is) and isn't it the reason why marxists almost universally hate postmodernism?Why would Jimmy Kimmel (a household name with a successful career) appear on a YouTube show filmed at someone's house?"the room felt lit with intellect and curiosity" - my eyes rolled so far back in my fucking head...It all seems to have been an inside joke anyway. Apparently Trudeau wasn't even serious about this. Watch his clarifying remarks which coincides with the crowd's reaction when he made the "peoplekind" remark.


Youtube: [Justin Trudeau clarifies his 'peoplekind' remarks after they go viral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG01jWQ0yCc)

More context: [Crowd laughing after his remark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z10goVbpLw0)

So glad Rubin held his feet to the fire ... 
It's lovely how he disses people on the left who he invites to this show (and how the invitees are mostly so famous that they likely won't come to his show anyway). And the "intelligence" remark seems to have been a joke, at least partially ... Kimmel is a comedian for god's sake. God, does Rubin get triggered.That's one of the most repulsive thing about a certain strain of libertarians.  People who were more likely than not more naturally gifted than average, perhaps better looking, more capable of "competing" and thriving in a dog eat dog world, and because of those random gifts choose to advocate for a world that just happens to tailor itself to them.

As long as they've got theirs, not a problem exists.28:50: "The left doesn't like minorities that succeed." - Dave Rubin

The left, in part, voted in a black president.Looks like Dave is using some Edward Said terminology "the other" to defend Israel. Interesting choice.meh skipped through parts. Mostly filled with banal observations and empty platitudes though I'm glad he said that once Sarsour is invited to speak she shouldn't be forcefully removed (Dave's making a little headway in principle).Then maybe Dave shouldn’t make broad, sweeping statements and cite specific examples. I’ll have to check out your example but can’t comment on anything.I think he has the inteligence to be Fox News host or even running his own show.

Afterall, Sean Hannity, who I would say is much dumber than Rubin (that ain't easy) can run his own TV show - all you need to do is having someone who writes script for you and being able to read that script.Yes, he did confirm it here: [Justin Trudeau clarifies his 'peoplekind' remarks after they go viral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG01jWQ0yCc)

As you say, it completely coincides with the crowd's reaction. Another win for the battle of ideasIf men wear neck-ties, a pretty obvious phallic symbol, does that mean they're hypocritical if they complain about sexual harassment in the workplace? What if they put gel in their hair? (Peterson seems to put gel in his hair) ...

It's kinda straight out of the Islamist handbook.

edit: The men who were sexually harassed by Kevin Spacey on the set of "House of Cards", if they did anything to look sexually attractive (which they most likely did, as that's human), were they hypocritical to complain about the harassment?"Well I think it's basically fine that people can be fired from their job due to their sexual orientation because they can just move somewhere else and get another job. What's really the problem here is that the regressive left is acting illiberal in opposing discrimination against this gay woman." - Dave's hot take tomorrow&gt; The political left is using facist identity politics. Literally shutting people down from speak based on their race, gender or political affiliation.

No, a tiny minority within leftist students does that (even Jonathan Haidt says it's a very small but loud minority). Not **the Left** in general. Get your facts straight. Try not to put people in boxes and make absurd generalized statements. All the serious studies show that the Left in the US is considerably more pro free speech than the Right.Of course the Left speaks out against Antifa. Violence is pretty unitedly condemned by the left. Get a grip on reality. Stop making absurd generalized statements.

[Mother Jones: The Left Seems Pretty United In Opposition to Antifa](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/09/the-left-seems-pretty-united-in-opposition-to-antifa/)

&gt;About a thousand words later they note that “some organizers” of a counter-protest in San Francisco last month declined to explicitly condemn “physical confrontations.” However, those same organizers “took to internet message boards to ask protesters not to initiate any violence.”

&gt;That’s it. That’s all they could dig up in the way of lefty sympathy for antifa. Every other person they quoted—including every single Democratic politician—offered straightforward condemnation.


Bernie Sanders, the most beloved politician on the left and likely their future presidential candidate has spoken out against it ...

&gt;Sanders, for his part, has disavowed violence and is not connected with Antifa efforts. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has come out against "hard-left" violence, saying of protests over Coulter's UC Berkeley appearance, "I don't like this."

&gt;"Obviously, Ann Coulter's outrageous -- to my mind, off the wall," Sanders said. "But you know, people have a right to give their two cents' worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation."

https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/unmasking-antifa-anti-fascists-hard-left/index.html

&gt;The left doesn't speak out against Antifa ... Or the insanity of social justice warriors pushing tons of complete nonsense.

God, this absurd obsession with SJW's, yes, they're ridiculous, and if they had power they'd be a real problem. But they don't. They're stupid college kids (a tiny minority of college kids) who most likely are going to severely change their opinions in the next ten years. 

Beloved figures on the left like Bill Maher speak out against them all the time and others like Mark Lilla etc. Barack Obama spoke out against them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVZVCbW63lc). Bernie Sanders called these students intellectually lazy. Van Jones, darling of the left, passionately spoke out against those students and safe spaces [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zms3EqGbFOk) ...

But they're not a problem on the level that the Republicans are, who have actual power, who want to fine people with 250'000 Dollars for boycotting Israel (which is a severe first amendment violation), who introduce bills to give extra-protection to car drivers running over protesters (yes, it's insane). 

They have a president who wants to jail and rescind citizenship from people burning the American flag. Okay. These people have actual power. Those are the people you most have to worry about ...

These people voted in an authoritarian madman, who psychiatrists say shouldn't have access to nuclear weapons. Who wants to commit war crimes, keep Muslims out of the country. Who wants to bring torture back. Who thinks there were great people on the side of the Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. And you worry about some powerless SJWs?

Trump couldn't even adequately distance himself from the KKK and Dave Duke for God's sake, yet Republicans made him the commander in chief and the most powerful man in the world. His Bible nonsense.What I would give to hear his answer to this.

"Well you see.. well, like I'm not a philosopher or anything I'll tell you that much and I don't pretend to be. Ya know, unlike some people I think it's okay to admit when you don't know everything, I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life. But anyway, postmodernism is.. it's kind of like a rejection of reason and logic and individualism because ya know, that stuff, it's all racist, it's bigoted, it's whatever. And THAT'S the real craziness of the modern left. They don't like facts, in fact they HATE facts because a lot of the time the facts don't line up with their crazy authoritarian worldview. So people tell me, Dave these Republicans, these conservatives, these Libertarians, they're crazy, they're racist, they're literally Hitler. But really it's THE LEFT that's throwing reason and science and tolerance and individualism out the window. And that's the stuff they... well it's the stuff I used to think they were all about. Ya know, liberalism. But the left has gone so far away from liberalism now that rational classical liberals like myself feel more comfortable around conservatives and libertarians."These cultural-Marxist, postmodernist, race-baiting, soy-boy, man-hating, communist, authoritarian, femenazi, fascist, collectivist cucks just want to call people racist to silence debate and avoid actually dealing with the IDEAS.Maher called Milo the new Hitchens. I think that program may very well be reciprocal fellatio with some commercials every so often.Jesus ChristTo be fair though, the analogy you suggest is precisely what they're fearful of (whether that's rational or not) and exactly why they're speaking out now while they have the freedom to do so. Do you have a timeline of his praise of Trump?But if you listen to him, he might be talking about certain people, but who really fits the description other than Rubin?I also just discovered this tweet from Ali A. Rizvi, before he had his falling out with Rubin, it's almost as if he was already trolling him then (and Rubin didn't take it well then either).

Sargon suggested Heather Heyer died of a heart attack, even though that's disproven by the medical examiners, and says the Alt-right was basically framed for her murder, then laughs about it ....

He's an execrable human being, but is held up by Rubin as this paragon of Liberalism.I think that's the reason he doesn't mention Rubin explicitly, but just having him on a thumbnail and in general criticizing classical liberals is not good enough justification for Rubin not to invate him, I think even for normal Rubin supporters (or what's left of them) that would be too much.

People should write Rubin *constantly* why he doesn't invite Pakman, since he's even bigger than Seder and Rubin would have even flimsier justification not to invite him.Glad you found somewhere to get these ideas out!

I think the reason that this sub is the way it is, is because it was formed in the early days of the Rubin Report. He opened up his content in a certain gap in the progressive/liberal/lefty field of YouTube; the uncomfortable, disingenuous and arguably dangerous apologetics from many mainstream and left media outlets for Islamic doctrine. There was a reflexive reaction from most established content providers to defend a minority that faced/faces genuine bigotry that resulted in excuses for a toxic ideology. So his early videos are secular this, atheism that, regressive left (when the term MEANT SOMETHING) the other.

Harris, Nawaz, Haider, Faisal, Hirsi Ali, Carlin, Santa Maria. That content was the lifeblood of early Rubin.

And I think that sort of disgruntled left was Dave's initial base and where this subreddit came out of. But if you look at all of his early videos and their view-counts, you'll notice something. The Milo videos blow EVERYTHING out of the water in terms of view-count. Nothing comes close, not even the first Harris interview. We're talking 26k views vs 2.6 million views.

So then he throws some more anti-SJW stuff into the mix and gets a bump again. Not as much as the Milo one, but Hoff-Sommers does noticeably better than Rizvi, Lemon, Bhoggosian.

Then all of a sudden there's a deep political shift in the kinds of guests and content Dave produces. The guest list now looks like Tommy Robinson, Ben Shapiro, Sargon, Cernovich, PJW, Crowder. And these sorts of videos get a lot more views than when he occasionally interviews actual experts in their fields, or generally any people with something intelligent to say.

Then the think tank money starts to come in. Ayn Rand Institute, Learn Liberty, PraegerU. These are all huge, rich think-tanks designed to protect the interests of the rich and powerful. And what do you know? Dave's editorial style content all of a sudden has a much harder right-libertarian edge to it. You can decide for yourself whether you think Dave changed his positions because of the funding, or whether a close relationship with these types made him sympathetic to their politics or whatever. But he said his positions most closely aligned with Sanders during 2016, then he gets a bunch of think-tank cash and all of a sudden, Bernie is public enemy number one.

Of course there was the infamous "I'll be the first to hold Trump's feet to the fire" line. But that didn't prove expedient.

I think we all have to just accept what the evidence of Rubin's behaviour suggests. Whether consciously or not, his views and content have always shifted to what will get him eyeballs and money at the time. Even at times when he was producing content that we may have liked. He's a businessman. The only way his views, content or style will ever change will be if it is profitable for him to do so.
The Dawkins interview is a great example of this. Dave tries so hard to get Dawkins to make statements about how awful college campus PC SJW stuff is and Dawkins just isn't interested. It leaves Dave floundering and asking Dawkins half-baked questions about science that he clearly hasn't bothered to research. That's because he never planned for the interview to stray outside of his bread and butter narratives.Eiynah is great!Yes, it was already clear he was irredeemable before, but he seems to have unravelled even more ...I think this is basically right but still have my reservations on nailing down someone's intentions without them being explicitly stated. In fact, a purely apolitical and self-interested reason is a bit too far-fetched for me. Does it line up with the facts and timeline of Dave Rubin? Yes.

I think the more likely explanation is that Dave slowly surrounded himself with people that were more and more anti-left, and the more he did this, the more popular his content became, and the more attention he was getting from the think-tanks. And this probably acted as a sort of validation. I think he genuinely convinced himself into his positions due to the incentives around him. But that's all just a guess.One sec, I'll dig through it. Sorry I'm not on here regularly. 

Right, after digging in, check out 1 hour 7 minutes in and listen to the sort of people Eric Weinstein is describing: 

Eric: You're going to need to see those people, the panthers [in the china shop, as opposed to the bull] who usually have the credentials, they're known in the community, people are very uncomfortable with them, they'll talk to them privately, they won't seek them on the main stage, and some of these people are very tough to deal with. 

He then talks about Naseem Taleb (spelling?) as an example. Along that description of Naseem is "he wants to protect the system against crazy risk-taking by bankheads." (Which, I just think is funny that apparently that went right over Rubin's head). 

Then Rubin says "Just to be clear, in terms of Trump, it seems to me that he *is* one of those guys. Whether you like him or not, (Eric interjects a "no", here but Rubin continues) he was one of those guys that was on the outside saying something that was kind of real... The guy's obviously a lot smarter than most people are giving him credit.

Eric corrects him on that front, thankfully. 

Maybe I'm reading too much into this, I dunno. But it sure seems to me like Rubin misunderstood what Eric Weinstein was saying. One sec, I'll dig through it. Sorry I'm not on here regularly.

Maybe I'm reading too much into this, I dunno. But it sure seems to me like Rubin misunderstood what Eric Weinstein was saying. I'm not really a fan of Kyle Kulinski but that segment was very funny.In defense of Peterson he condemned this and told them to stop.I think Peterson is very goofy and very wrong on a whole range of things (i.e. that some intersection between academic postmodernism and Marxism is having some profound influence on our culture, or his definition of truth, or his religiosity etc). I don't think anyone is helped by calling him a dumbfuck. There’s no chance he was being *sarcastic*! That’s just absurd, who’s ever known anyone to do that especially in the well respected area of *politics*. No, clearly he was drinking the Kool-Aid. No other explanation. I was being very sarcastic. To make the point that it’s (at the very least) plausible that Dave was being sarcastic. I’m new to the sub, but isn’t the proper form of argumentation to assume the best of your opponent and argue against that? If so, are we really ready to throw out the fact that he was genuinely intending to make a joke? Hasn’t he been known to do that? 

Tell me if I’m off base here. This is a place for honest discussion after all. This article doesn’t even take his ideas seriously before criticizing them. You’re not convincing people who think he’s right when you’ve got such an intensely condescending tone. Also. Pseudo - science of evolutionary psychology?!? I’m sorry?!? You can’t just claim any field you don’t like pseudo science without argumentation. This article does a poor job at creating discussion and panders to the low brow technique of making snide remarks and painting their target in a negative light from the beginning. IIRC he just said that the original article cited no tangible threats. Making it out to seem like she was upset over nothing or exaggerating the claims.Do you think that maybe there’s an alternative, more charitable explanation? After all, we don’t want to assume the worst. 

I could see Dave being inclined to hear more conservative opinions not because of donations or views, but rather because his ideology was primarily already on the left side of the spectrum, as you noted. If his claims about voicing differing opinions are genuine, it would make sense to give more conservatives a voice as he had been saturated with liberal politics. This might be compounded by the fact that there’s a place for many liberal voices. The majority of news has a left leaning bias (whatever you think about the left, it’s true). Fox News isn’t in the business of hearing people out most of the time, and if not there, where are reasonable conservatives to go? I don’t mean to be idealistic but let’s take the tinfoil off and ask ourselves if maybe we’re not giving him enough benefit of the doubt here. 

I don’t think that’s the end all be all of it, but I see a lot of criticism here, but I think many of us over step our bounds. In the same style that CNN oversteps it’s bounds when it gives breaking news on Trump’s latest bowel movement and how it hurts minorities (or whatever the hell their spin is nowadays). My point is, yes he has sympathized with more conservatives, yes he gets views for things like that, but that doesn’t imply that he’s a money grubbing shill for whoever pays him the most. Which was..?Ten years ago, a group of twelve students protesting someone's speech on a college campus would have made the university paper, and possibly the local news, before being swiftly forgotten about.

Nowadays, social media means that such trivial incidents have become talking points for navel-gazing debate across the internet, allowing the story to live on and be blown completely out of proportion, to the extent that it becomes apocalyptical. Add in a few middle-aged blokes who seem obsessed with the goings on of young people in colleges they did not attend and you've got dynamite.Hoo-boy, there's a bit to unpack here! Thanks for the measured response.

I said above that I think it's most likely that Dave is subconsciously responding to incentives and feedback. Some here think he's taking direct orders from the think tanks that fund his show and is deliberately pandering to a certain audience because he knows that's the best way to make money. I think that's too much of a stretch with what we know *but* his behaviour does line up extremely well with what will get him eyeballs and money. Any guess as to why is only going to be speculative.

You are right that Dave's expressed opinions were on 'the left' in terms of the American spectrum back in his TYT days. But I don't think he ever had any strong political principles back then other than thinking that getting money out of politics is priority #1 and a pretty staunch pro-Israel outlook on foreign policy. 

Dave has always operated on this weird plane devoid of policy and the real world. To the extent that he has principles, he has them in the most abstract way possible. He has always been hyper-focused on figuring out whether people are 'good' or 'bad' while ignoring the conclusions of the policy positions these people espouse. Look back at his 2016 presidential candidates video, everything is centred on the personal qualities of the people and nothing on the policy. I.e. Kasich I like because he seems like a good guy, Trump I don't like because he's a bully and mean, Bush looks very weak etc. 

I'm going somewhere with this, trust me! So I think you're right in that the whole conservative YouTube phenomena basically came about because there was a vacuum for that kind of content. And because there was this absence of a medium for these people to get their views out, they were always *very* receptive to Rubin giving them a platform. They were always nice, polite and grateful, which is the core of what Rubin cares about. There was no room for combativeness with these types and you could tell that Rubin's mind slowly ticked over to 'hey, these guys aren't bad people, in fact they're pretty nice!' Never mind the fact that the policies and ideas they push for would crush the most vulnerable people in society, they were nice and kind to ME in a way that I don't think lefties would be to a conservative interviewer. These conservatives are all nice to me and my friends, while these lefties can often be mean to me and my friends. In my opinion, it was this, not some superior infallible argument, not a genuine clash of ideas, but a sympathy garnered from the low bar of niceness that was the main factor in turning Dave ideologically.

I think we can rule out a dedication to having on guests that challenge his ideology as a principle because the opposite of this has been true for a long time now. IF this was such a concern for Dave, why has his channel been a steady diet of 'how terrible is the left?' for over the past year when this is his exact belief system? Shapiro might reach double figures before Dave has on a leftist to talk about the issues that matter most (healthcare, inequality, taxes, war, money in politics etc). Dave being committed to hearing a range of viewpoints, especially ones he disagrees with completely falls apart upon inspection.

I disagree strongly that the mainstream media is left-wing but that's a lengthy debate that I'm not sure is suited to this discussion. The mainstream media basically exists to protect the interests of the powerful. You get the full perspective of the opinions of the rich and powerful (i.e. from Fox to MSNBC), but almost nothing outside of that. For example, look at when Trump bombed in Syria. Brian Williams of MSNBC and Fareed Zakaria of CNN were both gushing with praise for Trump. This was when he became presidential in their eyes. Williams was almost in tears about how beautiful the weapons were. There was no mention of the barbarism of war or the pointlessness of it, just praise. That's because there is no one in power who benefits from less war, while there are plenty that benefit from the opposite. 

And your comment bout his bowel movement I think actually backs up my point. Yes, there are a lot of silly stories about Trump being dumb, or offensive or whatever because it's controversial and gets eyeballs/clicks. But these organisations DON'T push back on the most harmful aspects of the policy agenda of the Trump administration. It's Russia, it's diet Cokes, it's foul language, it's being un-presidential, it's NOT the attack on the middle class and the poor, the unconscionable wars, the draconian data privacy legislation. The meme that CNN is some lefty organisation is a nice bit of propaganda but it's not at all accurate. It's just Democrats say this, Republicans say that. What are the facts? Who cares. Then throw in a bit of moralising editorials when it has no chance to piss of anyone in power. CNN is a toothless lapdog for the establishment.And would you look at that, I went and responded to the media stuff anyway :p. Although I'm no longer a TYT viewer (and actively dislike them in some cases), it's interesting to note that this entire video is an exercise in the free exchange of ideas etc that Dave claims that Cenk and other progressives don't want.As I remember, you maintained the gross overgeneralization from the instances of one professor, and it wasn't even clear from that how it followed that leftists want to keep minorities from succeeding.

It read like something you had watched and wanted to cite that was of only tangential relevance.


edit: you didn't get down voted: https://www.reddit.com/r/daverubin/comments/7w1hvv/dave_talks_to_jtv_a_ukbased_jewish_channel/

Ah, I think you caught an important, subtle distinction. I drew, perhaps unfairly, implications from Dave's comment that leftists look to impede the success of minority groups, which is not true. It's a common trope used by certain right-wingers; they call it the blue plantation. 
Dave spends month after month telling us that the federal government is awful, nobody needs it, blah blah blah

He then invites a disgraced former Republican federal government employee onto his show - a man who resigned under a cloud of accusations relating to incompetence - and proclaims that this man is a victim of "outrage culture".

You couldn't make it up.
If you’re arguing that inference to the best explanation isn’t a valid form of argument, then I get that. But what, if it were true, would be the evidence for evo psych that’s accessible to us today? Are there tests un run? Actually I had the same question. So I emailed an old friend of mine who’s a personality psychology professor at a well respected private university. He didn’t have much to say about Petersen’s actual publication but he did validate the framework that JP works in—the big five personality traits are well researched but not without objection. Yet still, it’s the most prominent theory we have. What is your podcast about? Tell me moreSo here’s my take on it. I started more recently with Dave and similarly just watched his videos from a few years ago until now in chronological order. I’ll agree he’s had less than balanced lineups for his guests, that much is clear. But do you think it’s his place to challenge these “alt-lighters” (I have never heard that term before finding this sub, does it just mean alt right without the commitment?) or do you think he’s not in an intellectually level playing ground with them? For instance, if he were to argue with Sam Harris about Neuroscience and Free Will he’d be outclassed by a mile. I could maybe see the argument that Dace isn’t doing his Journalistic duty by asking hard questions, if that’s what you’re getting at. And on that I wholly agree. 

Has he not given the *chance* for reasonable leftists to appear on his platform though? Is there evidence of such a thing? I saw one guy claim he didn’t even invite democrats after a certain point in time. How can we know that it’s his fault and not just the fact that liberals are less willing to engage? I’m not committed to any of that, but if you have evidence that answers any of my questions, I think he’s certainly lost all credibility in my mind. I think you’ve convinced me thoroughly except for one small yet vital piece. You claimed this:

&gt;But I don't think he ever had any strong political principles back then other than thinking that getting money out of politics is priority #1 ...

I don’t think that’s something we can really comment on without some sort of argument, or evidence, or proof of any sort. He’s had guests on that claim the biggest problem facing America is the fact that money is so intertwined with it. IIRC he agreed enthusiastically. I’ll give you that that was at least two years ago, though, so maybe there’s more recent evidence that I’m ignorant of. If so, could you provide it?Pakman interview? I’m sorry, the reason I asked this was that I’m new. Could you give me more info or a link?Yeah, I’m gonna disagree (I am new though) on the percentage of well thought out discussion. Just read the front page comments, it’s ... less than intellectually stimulating. 

I’ll check out that post, apparently it’s very popular. 

That is inexcusable. Do you have a link to your twitter comment with him in it? I’m a bit of a radical empiricist and like to see before I believe. If true, Dave has lost any respect I had for him. The ONE principle he espouses to defend more than any other is freedom of speech / diversity of ideas. If he blocks people who criticize him he clearly doesn’t mean what he says. Of course, I came here to discuss. Not to dismiss those who challenge my views. Thanks for the source!Interesting. What I meant to ask, though, is what in general do you talk about?I don't think Rubin would hold that position today. [Here's his AMA link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Classical_Liberals/comments/6ipull/hey_this_is_dave_rubin_lets_talk_about_classical/dj886no/) from half a year ago where he states that "post modernism and the the Left" are much bugger problems today than Trump and his administration. 

But he did used to think that money in politics was the biggest problem in the American system. [Here](https://youtu.be/fv3WhVC5sFE?t=1m31s) are [two](https://youtu.be/qxljSAf_UlQ?t=37s) examples of him saying this back in the early days of post-TYT Rubin Report. If pressed I think he'd still say that money in politics is a problem, but it certainly doesn't appear to be a priority for him anymore.That does downplay what he seems to have believed, but it’s far from evidence that his “strong political principles” include getting money from being a politician. 

Edit: I believe I’ve misunderstood what you meant. I took it as “Dave Rubin wants to get money out of politics” as in, he wants to profit from his political speech, whereas you meant “Dave Rubin wants to get money out of politics” as in, he wants there to be less in the way of financial gain for politicians who align with wealthy donors. My apologies. 

Edit 2: I’m still not sold on Dave leaning the way he does politically because of money. From the top level comment:

&gt;Then the think tank money starts to come in. Ayn Rand Institute, Learn Liberty, PraegerU. These are all huge, rich think-tanks designed to protect the interests of the rich and powerful. And what do you know? Dave's editorial style content all of a sudden has a much harder right-libertarian edge to it. You can decide for yourself whether you think Dave changed his positions because of the funding, or whether a close relationship with these types made him sympathetic to their politics or whatever. But he said his positions most closely aligned with Sanders during 2016, then he gets a bunch of think-tank cash and all of a sudden, Bernie is public enemy number one.

Is this not the same kind of narrative spinning that we might accuse the left or right major news outlets of doing when something inconsequential happens and it becomes the public focus for the next 24 hours? I’ll admit this is more substantive, but my question is whether or not there’s stronger evidence than a narrative that Dave changed his editorial style shortly after getting funding from large conservative political groups. Please do. I love a good story, especially one with sources ;)If your point is that Dave won’t debate with what he calls the regressive left, then I can *prima facie* agree with you. However, do you think someone who staunchly defends those positions is willing to debate? If we take Dave at his word (and bear with me — just pretend you believe him) that he is interested in rational and logical thinking and creating a space where ideas can be criticized without ad hominem attack or whatever it is that you call the SJW shaming of dissenters, then would someone who *is* an authoritarian about speech wouldn’t be abiding by the rules of debate before they even get on the show! I can’t come up with an even keeled defender of authoritarian speech principles. It makes a little bit of sense at least that he doesn’t have many guests who diverge too far on this point. (However, are there really that many of them?)That does seem disconcerting. What’s Dave’s response to those who raise these objections? From the way in which you’re speaking it seems as if this is a well recognized problem. If that’s true, one might reasonably conclude that someone had brought it up to him in a public setting. Is he silent on the issue?Also, at the exact same time Rubin made fun of a Mother Jones journalist, who wrote a critical article about right wing media (including the Rubin Report) for refusing to come on his show and stating his criticism there, yet the reason of the journalist for refusing to come was the name-calling by Rubin. 

Literally the next day Rubin refused to invite Sam Seder because of the name-calling of Seder's producer, who called him "professionally stupid", even though Seder apologized and took the video down.

https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/876872811796496391

https://twitter.com/joshharkinson/status/876849760245694464

https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/876862242272276485

https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/877251291457638400

The article really wasn't totally fair, but it's pretty hypocritical to make fun of someone for not coming onto your show, whose reason is your name-calling. And at the exact same time refuse to engage wit Seder because of his producers name-calling. 

Also, before this incident Rubin ignored Seders offers to come on the show for months, it's quite likely he's seen those, as lots of people retweeted and liked it ...

Edit: The "free-speech absolutist" Rubin also threatened to sue journalist Josh Harkinson for libel for calling him "far right" ...

But then, when a conservative journalist wrote a piece defending Rubin from Harkinson's article she called him a "progressive tv-host", Rubin retweeted this (the "progressive" part was included in her tweet), even though he's waaay further from being a "progressive" than being "far right". And even though he said in an interview with Ben Shapiro that he considers "progressivism" a mental disorder.

But he retweeted her falsely labelling him a "progressive" whilst at the same time threatening to sue Harkinson for calling him "far right". The hypocrisy knows no end ...

Destiny once said that these people have "political dysphoria", they think they're on the left, even though they're massively right wing ...

Easy to get that one confused! I never even considered the dual meaning of 'getting money out of politics'.

I can't give you direct proof that Dave consciously chose to change the nature of his content because being anti-left would get him more money. Nor can I prove that he subconsciously 'followed the money' either. What goes on in Dave's head is for Dave to know. All I can do is connect the dots with the timeline of the kinds of guests, direct messages and twitter activity of Dave Rubin and notice how well it all correlates with either what will get him the most views, or open up more possibilities to 'partner' with rich, right-libertarian leaning think tanks. It's almost a 1:1 correlation.

His partnership with Learn Liberty did result in him taking direct talking points from the guests they 'provided'. Randy Barnett and Steven Davies first introduced the term 'Classical Liberal' to the Rubin Report language and that's his brand now. It was a term that allowed Dave to say 'hey, I've been a liberal the whole time, the only thing that changed has been 'The Left^TM ' degenerating into craziness. So Dave takes money from a big, [Koch brother run](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/koch_funded_edvantage_the_billionaire_brothers_are_bringing_libertarian.html) think tank, and then shortly after adopts their talking points and his editorials become more aggressively pro 'free-market'. Now did Dave do this consciously (I say libertarian things = more money for me)? Or did he just become convinced by the talking points he was exposed to via his connection to the think-tank? In my opinion, this question is almost irrelevant. When you can buy access, the people who are going to get access are the rich and powerful, who have an interest in promoting 'free-market' ideas. It's the same as the mainstream news media. There simply won't be a billionaire funded think-tank pushing for things that will help the poor and the vulnerable. Yet Dave found three, within a year, that have religious/conservative agendas, that were willing to support him. The end result is that the marketplace of ideas is just like it sounds. The more you pay, the more your ideas can get out there.

Like has already been said, Dave's early content had much to do with atheism. He even made a [pretty forthright direct message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGgFB_-2NQw) about the topic covering basic atheist talking points (you're making a big claim, I'm going to want some evidence). However, shortly after Dave did a show with Dennis Praeger (a very religious conservative figure who heads up PraegerU which has partnered with Rubin), he [said in a live-stream discussion](https://youtu.be/hp6hM4W8oHU?t=53m45s) that he was previously 'pinned' into atheism despite it not accurate for him. He even started to talk about how he wanted to create some space for himself to become more religious and even start believing things for which he had no evidence. He said something along the lines of 'I can't prove that I love my mother, yet I still do,' or something equally absurd. That is another area where there was a clear editorial shift, marked almost exactly by the time that Dave started taking money from a think tank that promotes Jewish and Christian religion.

I obviously don't have time to go through his whole catalogue, but I think the evidence is there.&gt; So Dave takes money from a big, Koch brother run think tank, and then shortly after adopts their talking points and his editorials become more aggressively pro 'free-market'. 

~~I couldn't find the evidence for this, does he list publicly his donors? I googled a bit and could not find a list or anything connecting the two. The link you provided answers the question of "is slate run by the Koch brother" not "does Dave Rubin take money from Slate".~~ Edit: I found it on their website

&gt;In my opinion, this question is almost irrelevant.

Fair enough. You've convinced me for that, we're not epistemically disposed to have that evidence. However, I generally like to abide by the [steel man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) principle and assume the best of people until proven otherwise. That's a difference of opinion I'm willing to live with.

&gt;Yet Dave found three

~~I think, though, if you're going to make the argument that it doesn't matter whether or not you believe he has intended to do that because of money, you shouldn't present his actions like that.~~ That's a stupid word game, not really a talking point.

&gt;He even started to talk about how he wanted to create some space for himself to become more religious and even start believing things for which he had no evidence. 

Being a staunch atheist, I can still see why a person would feel the need to move back in the direction of religion. Especially if his move across the political spectrum isn't intentional, but rather motivated by finding nicer company among conservatives (and potentially *actually* wanting to have a diversity of ideas, yet ultimately foregoing this principle as liberals were more disposed to call him out. Additionally, he's "interested in calling out the left because the right is so obviously past reform" or whatever he said in 2016 like that) and falling prey to the underlying attitudes toward religion that those who he now identified with.

I think there's a narrative with some evidence to bear on it that doesn't fall into the "money buys all of our political media/public political opinions" scheme. But mostly, I'm not willing to attribute a motivation by money until I see his donations. I think if you can provide that, though (and I seriously can't find it), I'd give the argument more weight and believe it.&gt; What we contest here is the degree to which these people exist outside of isolated youtube incidents.

Fair point.

&gt;There are authoritarian defenders on Youtube they are called the right wing who make excuses for Trump's actual anti-speech policies.

These folks, though, aren't engaged in debate. 

&gt; Dave only invites guests on who either A) agree with him or B) are invited on to discuss something other than his narrative like a few of his most recent guests.

I can see why you'd think that. I see the evolution of his show as less of a conspiratorial politic game and more of a man who felt politically ostracized finding an ideology that better suited him (whether orchestrated by the wealthy or not).

Agreed, I think now I'm at the very least convinced that his speech is deceptive as hell and he ought to do some self reflection and step outside his ideology to see his own hypocrisy.By extension, we have a similar lack of evidence (though admittedly to a weaker extent) that evolution itself is 'science'. We observe history, fossils, see how animals adapt today and say that it fits well within evolutionary theory by connection to what it is that we know (or think, depending on your trust in these claims) about biological imperatives. That's our evidence. Similarly, we make observations about human psychology and connect it to biology. It's still very different from evolutionary theory in justification (for one, evolution has been studied for much much longer and answers arguably more basic questions about our world), but there's an important parallel I think. Yes we don't have the necessary data, but should we put it in the same category as essential oils? Or is archaeology a better analogue? 

Now that I've described more clearly what I'm talking about, let me try to address your points:

&gt; they have little explanatory power in predicting human emotions/actions 1 billion (or insert whatever time period here) later

You're entirely right! Show me a model of human behavior that predicts human behavior well, though. It might not even be the best option we have right now (certainly there's plenty of debate) but to dismiss it as a pseudo-science as is done in the article is absolutely unfounded. 

&gt;if you show that lobster's change hierarchy when given serotonin, you only demonstrate that lobster's change their hierarchy when given serotonin. You don't demonstrate that the same is true in humans, that's not science, that's not logic, that's just irrational.

I'd be interested, then, to hear how you feel about the use of mice as human analogues in science. To experiment on humans is often unethical, so we *must* make inferences like these. I don't know if JP is right about that, but to argue that the jump from the lobster experiments to humans is *irrational* I think is unfounded. It commits you to (by the same line of reasoning) discount many important scientific discoveries that relied on analogues like this. HOWEVER! If you make the distinction between psychology using analogues and biology, then you might have an argument on your hands. After all, we're the most complicated thinking things we know of! How could we even begin to make comparisons to analogues within the realm of psychology? There's a lot of philosophical discourse to be had here, I don't have enough knowledge to facilitate a discussion like that but to dismiss the whole field without such a discussion I think is close-minded at best.

&gt;You wouldn't even be able to say that the same is true for a different species of lobster from the one you tested.

A radical empiricist I see ;)

&gt;But even then it may not work because humans are so much more complex both physiologically (thank our brains for that), and with our community structures than all other species. So there would be many confounding variables that may skew the results.

I think you're right here, but might not have developed this line of thought as well as you could have. *Because* humans would introduce many confounding variables, we might be tempted to explain human behavior in ever simpler terms so as to break the seemingly impossible puzzle down into manageable pieces. How we do that is something evolutionary psychologists are primary investigators of! Whether or not they're doing a good job is a discussion to be had, but it seems as if you would be very interested in the same questions as evo psych researchers.

There is a yet undiscussed alternative, though. Maybe human behavior is just epistemically untouchable to us. Maybe we can't understand it, it's too complex/it would be unethical to run experiments/our brains are too simple to understand themselves. This pattern of thinking has been prevalent throughout the history of science, mysterianism as it were, but it has been pushed back every time we make a new scientific discovery in the areas that skeptics are interested in.

At any rate, I'd suggest less rush to dismiss evolutionary psychologists. They have an (if not compelling) interesting take on human behavior that is actually relatively contemporary.I was presented with some other user's experience after criticizing Rubin for a similar sin. They were blocked it seems. That's disappointing to see for a "free speech absolutist" and someone who's concerned with "a diversity of ideas" and "rationality and logic"&gt; And even though he said in an interview with Ben Shapiro that he considers "progressivism" a mental disorder.

I'm pretty sure he clarified that he was being glib there. To take that literally is to misattribute nuance to the understanding of the english language. He may be hypocritical, but he's not THAT ridiculous. I think it's safe to assume he was being sarcastic/hyperbolic to make a point. I don't, however, think that that is a necessary or good tactic, especially when your major criticism of your opponents seems to be "they don't care about reason, they just blow everything out of proportion"

&gt;Destiny once said that these people have "political dysphoria", they think they're on the left, even though they're massively right wing

Who? Also, do you think there's anyone in the political sphere who is doing what Dave claims to be doing, but honestly? If not, what if I, a random guy on the internet did that? I'm genuinely not sure if people would be interested in that. It seems that Dave's fans like him because of his image, not his content. Or they are not being critical enough / only see parts of his political ideology. I certainly was, that's why I started this thread. There's no point to that comment, just an observation about the way humans seem to pick and choose who they listen to/take advice from/model their lives after.Jeez...it's almost like the people in this sub are more interested in making him out to be a bad person than they are in what good he may have to offer. Weird.

If you're genuinely reading this and think u/C-Ilii is somehow misrepresenting Petersen, I urge you to actually LOOK at the ideas JP is "selling" (though he is actually selling them, his personality tests, books, and self-help advice will cost you a small if not non-zero amount of money). Here's some academic papers defending the framework by which Petersen intends to give people direction for self improvement [source 1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00327.x/full) [source 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902000570). The so-called big 5 framework of personality is a well established psychological schema by which we can predict many important facts about a person and their future. If you don't believe me after reading the citations, here's a [book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Personality.html?id=PimuSGj1U_gC) you can read (to be fair, it's on my reading list and I have not yet started it) to get a better understanding of JP's clinical psychology. I think that's a good place to wrap up the discussion. :)

I'll freely admit that I don't know the full extent of Dave's partnership with these think-tanks. I don't think I will ever be able to tell you just how much money he has been paid to produce content for them or speak at universities or anything like that. Similarly, I will never be able to provide you a direct link between any of these transactions and Dave's behaviour and publicly held beliefs/content. All I can do is point out what I see as a pretty solid correlation. I respect your decision to assume the best without conclusive evidence. Does brain dead moron Rubin really think that the best way to invite people on his show is to insult them? He purposely sends invites to very high profile liberals (on Twitter) to show his Trumptard/GOP/alt-right fanbase that he’s open to hosting actual liberals! The man is completely disingenuous, as these high profile liberals will never attend an interview conducted by a colossally dumb YouTube right-wing hack.I will note, though, that the Learn Liberty group does almost commit to choosing some of his political guests. First, they claim: 

&gt;The Rubin Report will be releasing a new interview each month with top tier thinkers on topics related to liberty

Which doesn't sound insidious on its own. Until you read carefully the context it's in.

&gt;Dave is devoted to “big ideas and free speech” – needless to say, a great match for Learn Liberty! The Rubin Report has previously nabbed speakers including comedian Stephen Fry, presidential candidate Gary Johnson, and moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt. What does this mean for you? *The Rubin Report will be releasing a new interview each month with top tier thinkers on topics related to liberty*. Up first is constitutional law professor Randy Barnett, followed by historian Stephen Davies, and education and free speech expert Joanna Williams. We’ll be releasing our favorite highlights from each interview on the Learn Liberty YouTube channel.*We believe this is a huge step toward providing you with the best thought-provoking and liberty-oriented content*. (Emphasis added)

Which strikes me as a confession to not only steering Dave in a political direction by 'partnering' with him, but selecting who he's giving a platform to and why. Mainly libertarians because they're interested in free speech. That's an ugly picture to be painted to say the least.

Source: [Learn Liberty's own website](http://www.learnliberty.org/blog/the-rubin-report-and-learn-liberty-fight-for-free-speech/)By the way, this sucked. He dodged a lot, didn't want to answer any hard questions. Or even just ones that have to do with policy. He couldn't give a detailed argument for policy points?? I mean..what's the point of being a politician? The majority definitely do. Just not sure what percentage.The absolute state of this.

Dave spends the whole interview getting the violins our for this incompetent bureaucrat who oversaw the suffering of thousands upon thousands of people.

When the subject changes to the actual Katrina victims, the pair shrug their shoulders and say “shouldn’t live somewhere with a high flood risk, why should government take care of them?”!!!!!!!!!!!

They even show more sympathy towards DAVE’s FUCKING RESCUE DOG than they do the poor residents of New Orleans!Hmmm seems as if it were the latter, he’d be framing things in an intelligible way for right-wing demographics on interviews like these. There’s a not so difficult way to convey an opinion that’s intelligible that will also fulfill that group of viewers. Even alex jones seems measured and well thought out in some interviews. 

My guess is the dude is just in over his head. Would love to talk to him. &gt;&gt; And even though he said in an interview with Ben Shapiro that he considers "progressivism" a mental disorder.

&gt; I'm pretty sure he clarified that he was being glib there. To take that literally is to misattribute nuance to the understanding of the english language. He may be hypocritical, but he's not THAT ridiculous. I think it's safe to assume he was being sarcastic/hyperbolic to make a point. I don't, however, think that that is a necessary or good tactic, especially when your major criticism of your opponents seems to be "they don't care about reason, they just blow everything out of proportion"

Oh, come on … of course I know he doesn’t mean it "literally", in that he doesn’t think this should be classified as an actual mental disorder, treated by psychiatrists or medicined, or people even hospitalized … To suggest that this is what I meant  is arguing in bad faith … 

But it shows the utter disdain he has for progressivism. How much he disagrees with it. Yet he retweets this journalist who calls him a "progressive" and threatens with libel a journalist who called him „far right“ at the same time. Again, he’s waaaay closer to being far right than to being a progressive and actively cozies up to the far right, he’s an alt-right sanitizer, as many accurately have pointed out … It's pure hypocrisy ...


&gt; &gt;Destiny once said that these people have "political dysphoria", they think they're on the left, even though they're massively right wing

&gt; Who? 

I doesn’t matter who that is, I just wanted to credit the person for coming up with that expression (it’s actually a Youtuber, who engages the far right in long debates).


&gt;Also, do you think there's anyone in the political sphere who is doing what Dave claims to be doing, but honestly? If not, what if I, a random guy on the internet did that? I'm genuinely not sure if people would be interested in that. It seems that Dave's fans like him because of his image, not his content. Or they are not being critical enough / only see parts of his political ideology. I certainly was, that's why I started this thread. There's no point to that comment, just an observation about the way humans seem to pick and choose who they listen to/take advice from/model their lives after.

Well, certainly *he* is not doing what he claims to be doing, that’s why people are so fed up with him.

I think most people like him because he constantly bashes the left and almost never criticizes the right, meaning, a large portion of his audience is on the right. Some people on the left either hate-watch him or watch a discussion here or there, if they like a guest, which is rare these days as they’re mostly far-right.
It was far right. And by implication, look at the company of déplorables this tweet puts him in, this one is not any more flattering. Oh I agree and the headline was tongue in cheek. I just found the tweet and found it very amusing that everyone but Rubin considers him part of this 'conservative movement', among the people listed. Rubin himself still bullshits about his liberal cred. Oh god, so annoying knowing that these conservative sock puppets are all around my back yard.Please, the alt-right types themselves are responsible for the obfuscation of the term and many people that Dave has lobbed soft balls to on his show could easily fit within the moniker. 

Milo Yiannopolous, an at least onetime close associate of Dave, [called it an amorphous movement](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/), identifies openly with it and denied it had ties to white nationalism and antisemitism.

I would agree that it's a big tent term, but it's no stretch to say that a diverse array of right-wingers can fit within it. 

For the record the author of the Mother Jones article states "The crowdfunding model is also increasingly popular among the **right’s independent** media personalities." He doesn't get called far-right but if he does get lumped in with alt-right types I wouldn't scoff too hard at that characterization.

Dave's wishy-washy political demeanour doesn't help his case that he's an associate of these people.   Fun fact.  I think Knowles might be the most insufferable member of Shapiros entire operation.The misunderstanding there was unintentional. Apologies for that. I was quick to judge after having some less productive discussions on this sub with those who quote that, then just dismiss him. What you’ve said is entirely different. 

So I’m just typing out loud here, but if this whole “diversity of ideas in the marketplace” thing were really an ideal, would anybody actually care about honest, diverse, and critical thinking? I think a show like that would flop. Maybe I’m wrong though. I would love to hear from you again. Read my comment in the most charitable fashion you can imagine and try not to bring any conception that I even like the guy into it. In fact. I don’t. But you can talk about people you don’t like without mocking them believe it or not. And you can entertain their ideas in a charitable fashion. Else you’re more interested in offending than seeking truth. 

My point here is that even if you *did* have the ideals Dave espouses to have, is a discussion about authoritarianism with respect to speech possible? By definition, no. The entire worry of the free speech advocates is that authoritarian control over which speech is permissible denies open debate of ideas intrinsically. Is there something wrong with thinking he’s not a liberal? I thought that was the common belief around here. He certainly agrees on  some liberal issues like gay marriage. But regardless what is this “admitting dave isn’t a liberal” thing you’re on about? It’s okay not to be a liberal. In fact that’s a liberal belief.

Edit* yeah I saw that. Shit is concerning af. His persona on camera and his behavior off camera are strikingly different. It’d be interesting if a conservative prominent enough in areas he is interested in went on the show (apparently those are the requirements) and pushed him on it. I’d love to hear his response, as he’s been pretty much brick walling those who want to talk about it. Sargon is a moron. He's incredibly emotional and an awful communicator. His feeding into anti-immigrant and anti-left propaganda has paved a pathway for a not insignificant number of pasty loners to the alt-right or alt-lite.

I *think* he was basically saying 'you people act like the people you are trying to criticise and hate.' But he has the elegance of a baby giraffe and the verbal deftness of a 90 year old Eastern-European grandma accosting a rude bus driver in broken English.Meanwhile a big thumbs up to Sam Harris for calling out the NRA in his tweet! While its sad that Sam has not publicly separated himself from this asshole, at least he is showing by his actions that he is not going to bend over for the right a la Rubin!Rubin is alt-light! Case closed. The term alt-light refers to idiots that ride on the anti SJW/feminist/transgender bangwagon &amp; claim to be a centrist whilst exclusively bashing the left &amp; apologising/praising for the right. These idiots usually avoid mentions of a white ethnostate, white genocide and dont participate in sig heiling, so this distinguishes them from the full on alt-right/neo-nazi types. 

Prominent alt-lighters are Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin, Sargon of Akkad etc. If you however say that these pricks pander to the far-right, I would say that this is a very accurate description.  How dare you criticise this post, are you against free speech?!By the way, I read this and agreed with what you said. I don't have any reasonable or charitable response for someone who were defending him. But since I didn't know how to make the discussion continue, I just upvoted and didn't reply. Didn't want you to think your entirely reasonable opinion went unchecked though so I did think of something:

What in your opinion is the difference, then, between what Dave and Fox News does with political opinions? They seem to be following very similar trends, if Dave is a little less angry in person. Should we lump him in with them? Does he fit into another news category? 

I ask because in a political atmosphere where almost everyone is being a dick or unproductive, you have to be weary of those who associate together. If there are some Dave clones I want to know about themDude says absolutely *nothing* inflammatory. He even goes on to give examples for his claim. C'mon. Why is that worth the most down votes in a thread?

If you're in this sub and not a troll, think about how you react to opposing beliefs. That's what this whole project was about in the first place. I get that it's a meme to gang up on Rubin, but are we taking that so far as to dismiss opinions that call for *more* thorough discussion? Seriously?Just so you know, Rubin retweeted this.I guess IMO if someone claims that they’re opposed to low level commentary, and imply they would like better discussions, then it makes more sense to engage them, provide evidence, argumentation, whatever. Not just downvote and move on. Seems to only affirm his position, which would be that instead of going for critical debate, denizens of the sub take a shallower approach. But that’s just me I guessThere’s certainly a niche. But isn’t it the crazy shit he says that gets people interested and fired up? Isn’t that the kind of content that fuels political machines, not careful and measured responses?I’d love to read more from that science historian, any suggestions?Some legit contenders (in order of likelihood)

**Trump** "I guess my point is that he really tapped into something. Because everything is so fake and the Democrats have their crazy identity politics and he came in and offered to shake up the system. He's obviously much smarter than CNN would have you believe, you can't run a successful business empire like he did and not be pretty switched on."

**Obama** "You'd think with Obama being the first black president, that would have helped racial tensions but things only seemed to get worse while he was in office."

**JFK** "And that's the thing about JFK, he was a true classical liberal, unlike the sort of stuff, the collectivism that the Democrats are spewing today."

**Ronald Reagan** "Say what you want about Reagan but he wanted you to keep more of your money. He didn't think that he knew best for you, he wanted you, the individual, to take control of your own life." 

**Bill Clinton** "And of course there was the Juanita Broderick rape stuff but you won't hear the #metoo crowd talking about that."

**Bush Jr** "And of course you get these people saying that Bush was a racist and an islamophobe that just wanted to kill a bunch of Muslims, now I don't really buy into that."Thanks! Unfortunately I haven’t had the honour of being blocked by Dave, but I am hopeful.&gt; my SO who is a clinical psychologist on the topic of Ev Psych I believe the field to be more diverse and backed by rational thought than what JP has let on

What a coincidence! My girlfriend works in an Evo Psych research lab, the head of which I'm getting my affinity for the field from. Further, I don't think he's very interested in evolutionary psych, moreso in the big 5 personality traits. But his reliance on evolution remains.

&gt;So I guess I shouldn't judge a whole field on one person's inability to make a cogent argument.

Yeah I'd agree with that. I don't even think I can defend JP on most topics, he's got some weird things he's been saying recently. I just hate bad arguments left unchecked, it's better to take down political opponents with rationality not vitriol. 

Concerning your third paragraph, totally dude. I don't get the whole lobster thing, but I don't think that it should be left unstudied. I mean, if our serotonin receptors are integral in our having developed a hierarchy, then yeah we should probably figure that out. However, the bottom line is that it's hardly cut and dry. We don't know the things JP claims to know, but we also don't by extension know that they're false. IMO the hierarchical structure of society is more likely to be explained by a more complicated model than "lobsters do it too, x plays a role in lobster behavior, we have the same behavior and x, therefore x must be the entire explanation". Seems a bit fallacious to me. But as I've said before, I'm really more on about bad argumentation from supposedly rational agents than taking political sides.

Good discussion, man, hope the thesis is going well, I'm off to work on my own. Cheers![39:35](https://youtu.be/kVGXfgY9VFI?t=39m35s): Typical Dave, takes the conversation about Jefferson and uses it to draw a caricature about people who criticize Trump. Maybe, Dave, you want to talk about why people are so intense with their criticism of Trump? Couldn't be the pathological lying, endorsement of violence at his rallies, including cryptic threats to assassinate Clinton, attacks on the free press and readiness to curtail the civil liberties of political opponents. 

All in all not too bad though Dave sounds like he doesn't do a lot of background research on his subjects; his questions are either vacuous or sound coached. It's pretty apparent that Dave's week of talking about presidents is going to be about highlighting libertarianism. This goes to one of the general differences between the left and right commentariat. 

The bulk of left wing commentary focuses on POLICY, the bulk of the right focuses on culture war issues and attitudes and how one comports oneself.  When the right does talk about policy it typically involves less government (i.e. a RETREAT from policy specifics and leaving the details up to the market) and lower taxes.

Seder is exactly right, what makes someone a person of the left or right or center or whatever, is their views on issues.  If identity and factional affinity is the standard by which people are kind or harsh to different groups or individuals, then nothing matters aside from temperament and tribal identity. 

That is a shitty standard and demarcation line of ones political views and attitudes.  There are assholes and saints among liberals and conservatives, their specific views about policy and the role of government is what separates people from the left and the right.

And EVERY time someone like Bret Weinstein is allowed to give into the narrative that the difference is behavior and temperament and who was mean to who it distracts people from the differences conservatives do not WANT people to focus on.  There are an awful lot of conservative policies that most people who vote for the right are not behind.  But nevermind, culture, look at those BLACK lives matter people DEFILING our flag and spitting on our nation, etc etc rinse repeat.[Another freaking conservative, Dave.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gutzman) Get some new fucking perspectives, dude. Haven't watched very much of this, but it's clearly going to be a conservatarian discussion of early federalism. Gutzman's writings on Madison generally have gone against common academic consensus, but Gutzman does offer a conservative interpretation of Madison so it's perfect for Dave's show.
Dave is so stupid. It’s actually irritating.Remember, Dave thrown some soft balls to Dinesh on his show and has referred to him as part of his "new centre": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3PtvBFacW4Who wants to bet he gets someone to talk about Calvin Coolidge before the week is over?

I know he was the libertarians dream president, conservative shills like Larry Kudlow used to sing his praises.https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/964484454688477184That first response going in hard w no lubeFor the ultimate “Rubin makes a mountain out of a molehill” experience, I’d recommend the episodes with Colin Moriarty. Who knew that a man making a stupid joke on Twitter, and then voluntarily quitting his own job, was an assault on free speech?

The part where CM breaks down and thanks Dave for being there for him during this ordeal, whilst Dave guiltily looks at his shoes as he’s just been doing this all for ratings, is one of the most hilariously awkward things I’ve ever witnessed.Notice that Dave has invited all manner and of deplorables from the Right for a fawning ‘interview’, whereas people from the left are only ever invited on for a ‘debate’.Also, I’m cackling at the idea of Stephen King - one of the most prolific novelists in the history of that medium - being asked to follow in the footsteps of Blair White, Colin Moriarty and other lightweights by coming on Dave’s YouTube vlog.A classical liberal who lived in a time when Democrats actually tried to reach across the aisle and compromise on super important social issues!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9rJsJo-rdAIf you want some episodes legitimately worth watching;

OP, to help simulate a quicker rundown of what was not listed above.  Fill a bottle with bacon grease and down it all.  As you are throwing up, you will understand what so much of Rubin content is.Are you talking about Dave "The Last Liberal" Rubin?Please - the progressive stack of "oppression olympics" only makes up a portion of the left and it sure as hell makes up only a minute part of the platform of the neoliberal Democratic party, all of which Dave adamantly opposes. 

Don't pretend like Dave represents everything that stands outside of the "oppression olympics" element of the left. He represents a small element of "classical liberals" which in modern times can be called conservatarianism. And when talking about victimhood culture don't forget that Donald Trump, on the right, rode in on a wave of white resentment and victimhood. Let's not forget the whole "War on Christmas" bullshit and the rabid opposition to immigration.  

And sure as hell don't act like righties, at least in the United States, have LGBT interests at heart; [especially in the evangelical world of Mike Pence and cynical Christianity of Donald Trump.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/19/trump-lgbt-rights-discrimination-353774)Fuck off, people from [Rorty](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/9/14543938/donald-trump-richard-rorty-election-liberalism-conservatives) to [Sanders](http://reason.com/blog/2016/12/13/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-won-because) have criticized elements of the progressive stack. You choose to ignore those criticisms and identify a party with the most outrageous members. Should I pinpoint you as a supporter of the alt-right because Richard Spencer supports Trump? If I don't constantly see you disavowing the identity politics of the right can I fairly say that you've chosen to be in the same boat? Preposterous.It's from 19**98** and Rorty kept talking about it until his death. Sanders did not get crucified and [continues to be the most popular politician in the country](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xww4ek/bernie-sanders-is-the-most-popular-politician-in-america-poll-says-vgtrn) and "the entire right" did not disown Spencer and his ilk; I specifically remember a president calling these Unite the Right doofuses "very fine people."

The rabid, tribalist mindset at CPAC the last few days has been a perfect example of the rampant identity politics of the right. They booed naturalization ceremonies and chastised conservative Mexicans (certainly because they are brown). Oh and for good measure they ran off a fellow conservative commentator who dared to criticize herr Trump. So is Alex Jones, what's your point?  That more fools are born every day?

Much of this article reads like one of Dave’s “The Regressives have taken over the Left!” rants. Only this time it’s actually true.[Even more evidence of those darn politically correct campuses silencing free speech. Oh wait....](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/data-clashes-with-emotion-as-cpac-immigration-panel-goes-off-the-rails)I don't mind Joe or his show but he clearly has his flaws and blind spots.

He feeds into and fear-mongers about the scary, evil, censorious, SJW left. More in a 'both sides suck' kind of way instead of a 'go Trump' kind of way. But it's still way beneath him. He's smarter than that (asking for a cheap reply there).

He also buys into TYT/left media being the devil and is not to be trusted or communicated with while having cordial, several hour long sessions with Alex Jones, Milo, Shapiro, Crowder and other such bigoted dumpster fires. It's the double standard where you have to be completely pure and free of hypocrisy on the left to be 'respectable' while anyone on the right that can go 10 minutes without explicitly calling for bashing gays, hating black people or denying the holocaust is an internet 'intellectual'. Even then you can probably get away with it with a sexy foreign accent.

He's also very prone to believing dumb conspiracies. He still won't completely let go of the moon stuff even after NDT went and taught his ass.

All of these ingredients make him an unfortunate potential starting point in the centrist-&gt;anti-SJW-&gt;libertarian/classical liberal-&gt;alt-light-&gt;alt-right pipeline. On his own though, he's pretty much harmless. Has some interesting and worthwhile guests every now and then.-- someone on r/daverubinThis is a fantastic, clean rundown of the issue. The more you can abstract from reality, the more you can use abstract principles to justify positions that in real life do serious harm.I thought this might actually be good because I have my own problems with the Majority Report and its content. It didn't live up to low expectations.

But what should I expect from a 'Sweedish immigrants are raping everyone' and 'the wage gap isn't real' kind of content creator?I don't think the important thing is to 'debate' the nitty-gritty of any particular issue. Whether you and I could come to agree on what the wage gap means, what causes it and what the implications of it are won't affect much.

Something I'd be more interested in is why is it so easy to predict that someone who creates content about taking in refugees leading to higher crime can be reliably expected to hold views or produce content that attacks the notion of the wage gap. I haven't gone into the depths of your content history so excuse me if I'm wrong, but I would be shocked if you didn't also have strong opinions on issues like James D'Amore's firing, Antifa, free speech on college campus, Black Lives Matter, trans people/gender identity and the perceived left leaning bias of mainstream media. 

I would also predict with some confidence that you have little to no interest in issues like climate change, the damage done by the US private healthcare system, the effect of money in political campaigns, unionisation or women's reproductive rights.

These are such a diverse set of issues. So why is it typically so easy to extrapolate a whole suite of seemingly issue-specific ideas from just a couple (or even one) of data points? Why should someone who says that 'BLM is a terrorist organisation' be very likely to also oppose a carbon tax, for example?

In my opinion, the online-right (for lack of a better phrase) is very good at being very scared and outraged by social issues that in reality have minimal impact (a group protesting a Ben Shapiro speech, one guy at Google being fired because he didn't fit their corporate culture, a vulgar tweet sent by Linda Sarsour a few years ago, some feminist on the internet critically analysing video games, refugees on the other side of the world, Justin Trudeau doing something corny, someone being wrong about a statistic, some boys want to wear dresses etc) while at the same time, ignoring issues and policy that have a tangible impact on people's lives (universal healthcare, climate change, political corruption, minimum wages, workers rights, the ability to collectively bargain, T.R.A.P laws, spiralling wealth inequality, Western military intervention in foreign countries).

Because as long as people are rekting the SJWs and busting the wage gap myth, they're not getting angry at the people and systems that really have power and control. And that's what I find so frustrating.Your views are certainly a bit more out there than the typical anti-SJW. I'll politely decline the Skype invitation. I don't fancy myself much of a debater and I don't think there is significant enough overlap in things we find interesting for a debate to really be worthwhile. I would imagine we would get bogged down for ages debating the merits of democracy or authority without getting anywhere interesting.Interesting talk on how the development of automation will necessitate UBI. He also talked about the possibility of a guided economy. 

Admittedly I don't know much about Eric Weinstein and always thought he was a straight libertarian in the vein of Peter Thiel. 




P.S. Eric.. dude... your facial cysts. Please man.... You're not Lemmy from Motorhead.This belongs on r/fellowkidsMoney for interviews, what else?

Ok, we don't know how much does Rubin make aside from his patreon, could be a lot with his speaking gigs at conservative gatherings and maybe more dark money, BUT he angrily said during a twitter exchange (when accused of being a Koch shill or something of that nature) that Learn Liberty doesn't make even 20% of the show's funding, so people naturally assumed (probably correctly) that next to 20% of the show's funding comes from Kochs.

If I were to guess, he makes 50-100+ thousands of dollars from their partnership.[Well, according to Dave, Learn Liberty supplies a steady stream of academics for Dave to use to spread the philosophy of Learn Liberty](https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/966074083606745089).Wow. So much evidence.This has all the makings of a 4chan shit-stir. Google profiling users and flagging some as 'high risk' because they often visit Stormfront or watch a lot of alt-right/lite YouTube? Sure, I can see that. Personally, I'd be shocked if intelligence agencies in the US *weren't* collecting profiles of individuals that frequent common right-wing extremist sites/channels. It'd be gross negligence if they had the legal ability to do so and didn't. I mean, didn't we just go through the Parkland shooting where every right leaning outlet that didn't want to talk about gun control was horrified that US intelligence agencies didn't identify the shooter earlier, despite a history of right-extremist views and brazen YouTube comments?

However, Google sharing private info about people to anonymous leftist organisations out to ruin people's lives because they posted that corporate taxes should be lower, purely because of the political leanings of 'higher-ups'? That's a bit of a stretch. But I'm sure there's a massive portion of people online that are willing to believe that and be scared.

If there's shady shit going on (and I'm sure there is in the corporate world) then I welcome their Edward Snowden. But this 4chan post doesn't even rise to the level of interesting.Thank you very much!Is there a way to tell if there are any monetary transactions between them? Or is that private info?There is no hard proof per say - like document or something of that nature - just Rubin's words that the partnership doesn't even make 20% of the show's funding.God, this is fucking infuriating. You just KNOW that if some conservative kid that survived a shooting wanted to talk about 'protecting the second amendment' then Dave would just let the kid talk for an hour, unapposed, with sympathy and puppy dog eyes. They would be a 'big up and comer' that 'the radical left wants to silence'. The chances of him asking that kid to come on the show to debate Kyle Kulinski or someone over the topic are dead zero.

But as soon as it's a kid with a progressive (i.e. sane) policy agenda, they need to come on the show to debate NRA talking heads or Ben Shapiro.

I used to think Dave was just really, REALLY stupid. But at this point, his behaviour is too consistent not to be calculated. He's a genuinely awful person. Remember how he accused youtube of selectively conservatives discriminating conservatives and as a proof he used "socialism isn't cool" and "capitalism isn't cool" experiment (which is fuckin' retarted because youtube largely doesn't read sentences, but words and it was demonstrated by other youtubers)?

Seems pretty conspiratorial to me.Just watch his video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQWZLi9Fp2oBad (or sick) guy!Prediction: In a year, Dave will be selling supplements on InfoWars with his BFF, Milo.Huge win in the battle of ideasA, B, C, G, FIt relates to money I think.I think that Youtube demonetization might have helped Rubin, because despite him being a laughting stock for non-conservative youtube audience, he doesn't get that much views per month - he could make like 4-5 thousand dollars extra per month without it from youtube. That might be good for a good number for a lot of youtubers, but remember, that's nothing compared to his speaking engagements, his patreon and Learn Liberty buck.

You can take it as 4-5 thousand dollar month tax for being a bigger victim, which equals more money on patreon and more conspiracy theories (youtube is targeting conservative opinions!) to appease his audience.Of course he watches Fox News...Yeah. I saw the cartoon, too. This was a light spanking from Dave. He'll go back to holding Trump's balls to his chin in no time.Martha Nussbaum provides a better understanding of small-l liberal values and talking points and she's not as annoying to listen to, mmmmkay? So in recommending, mmmmkay, a female liberal voice, mmmkay, I'd focus on getting Martha, mmmkay.  


Actually what am I saying, mmmkay? I don't want Martha to sully herself on this show. Highlights:

*The viewer question about Rubin "platforming pseudo-intellectuals and racists". I cackled.

*The question on immigration. Dave starts by claiming that Trump has the same views on immigration as Clinton and Obama, he just articulates his points differently(!), before randomly pivoting to oppression of conservatives on campus.

*Dave claiming that Ben Shapiro was the guest he's most disagreed with and that they had an on-air argument over abortion(!)

*Dave calling his friend since childhood "profoundly warped". Charming.

*Dave bemoaning the Regressive Left for judging people for inalienable characteristics before telling everyone he's gay just moments later and introducing his friend "as a brown man" during the Q&amp;A.

*"I never have an agenda when I sit down with someone" - explain those Direct Messages that lead into the interview, hun.

*Dave "LOOK WHAT THIS BUZZFEED REPORTER TWEETED!" Rubin criticising people who get outraged over people they've never heard of over the internet.I haven't pressed play yet but I guarantee that he uses the fact he's "gay-married" to deflect claims that he's a conservative.

Because no gay person has ever held conservative views in the history of mankind. He Tweets out "jokes" like the below and then pretends he isn't as successful as the guys in that picture because he's a conservative and is being discriminated against.

&gt;All the movies black people make suck. We need more white movies.

That's just not funny or clever, Owen.&gt;Because no gay person has ever held conservative views in the history of mankind.


 And that's the same person who always talks about how your identity shouldn't inform your political opinions and how bigoted people are who think as a gay or black person you should vote left / Democrat ...

But then he's like; "Wanna hear my lefty cred? I'm gay married" etc. ...Wow I didn't even realize Dave had a troll like Katie Hopkins on. Not surprised at all either though. She is the UK's Ann Coulter.Gee, I hope it's 'real'.

If 2018 ends with a bunch of Bernie style politicians in power in the US, then that would be fantastic. 

I don't imagine Justice Dems is going to be a one-off make-or-break thing. It will probably take a few election cycles to get a strong caucus of these types of Democrats together but the timing is perfect with the huge anti-Republican sentiment and the engagement of young people.

As an aside, if 2020 could end with Democratic super-majorities, a Bernie presidency and a strong, genuinely leftist-progressive block in the house. But Repubs will probably bomb Iran/NK by then to make everyone scared, so who knows?At least he’s anti-Trump?(Still acted  as a cheerleader for Iraq War which murdered hundreds of thousands, if not millions). I'm not going to actually watch this, but how does Dave handle talking to a conservative who is extremely anti-Trump? Does he view Frum as being "hysterical," or is that just reserved for anti-Trump liberals?David's Iraq War shilling will always taint him, but yes he has some great wit on Trump's shenanigans. 

I've read his newest book "Trumpocracy" and as part of the conservative establishment he seems perfectly unwilling to take responsibility for the discord between free market corporate conservatives and the angry white populist base that has led us to this mess. 

I guess I should see if he commits the same excuses here, but was generally unimpressed with the way he addressed the conservative movement up until Trump. Trump wasn't a spontaneous spasm from the right. He's giving Frum pushback on Trump!SPOILER ALERT: He deflects.Okay Frum is actually making some good points here: https://youtu.be/Aq8b5-WX9Gg?t=12m19s

What I've been saying for awhile; the American right (current conservatism) is marred by resentfulness. Dave Rubin is actually getting owned. Go from 31:00 onward...."Why I left the justice Democrats"Wow, that was legitimately the hardest I've ever seen Dave push back in an interview.

It reveals what we all knew. Dave doesn't let right wing talking points go unopposed because of some interview-styling principles, he does it because he thoroughly incapable OR he agrees with those talking points.

Obama's a Communist? Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organisation? Black people are genetically inferior to white people? Have your say.

Trump is a moron? The mainstream American far-Left doesn't want to make all industry public? Medicare for all might be a good idea? Whoa there cowboy, do you have any evidence to back up any of these crazy claims?Jesus Christ...even Frum thinks Rubin is a goddamn fucking idiotComing form someone who got tired fo Crowder, Rubin etc because of their BS the MR was refreshing. This video, however, shows what I am routinely disappointed with the show.

I love humor, and the segment where they watched Alex Jones yell at PJW and then "Delete the proof on his phone" was funny, so that's a great time for humor. Other times though the show leads me to feel like even if I've become more open to ideas, the fact I wouldn't want their entire platform means I'd also be ridiculed. That is just divisive.The comments section of these YouTube clips have been something else...Dave tries so hard to downplay Trump-Russia. When Frum doesn't go along with it, Dave makes a poor attempt at whataboutism:

**Rubin:** You think the Democrats have any of the same dirt on their hands?

**Frum:** No.This was so embarrassing to watch.

Rubin should really reconsider his life after this. What a fucking idiot Rubin is

Frum is literally talking about conservative notions, of which I disagreee with, but least he's trying to be earnest, and this dumb dick comes across and just talks about government and identity politics out of NO WHERE

Is he even listening?!

Jesus Christ. So what about government fixing these problems?

DAVE...Frum literally was talking about fixing civil society

What the shit are you talking about you libertarian automaton?No kidding. Countless comments saying Frum is "no longer a conservative" and even accusing him of being a "Marxist"...all because he doesn't support Trump.Theres like two dozen indictments and over 100 charges filed 

RUbin is a fucking idiot&gt; why doesn't he just debate his guests on the issues 

I think you know that he doesn't know enough about the issuesAt 8:08: 

Rubin: "Do you think the democrats have any of the same dirt on their hands?

Frum: "No."

CHECKMATE

Dave Rubin is a goddamn idiot. Why would anyone promote contrapoints as their representative? &gt;interesting things

&gt;justice democrats

Pick oneI don't think either of those things are true. 
They really shouldn't. The video Ryan Faulk just responded to is cartoonishly bad. Muh lead paint etcIs there anything interesting about justice democrats?That's not an argumentI've never been presented with it. Most of the people who seem to think so are awfully silly on politics. Kyle, cenk and so onBecause I don't watch contra. Is that an argument?  I watch Ryan. Sometimes he says what I think are genuinely racist things, but I think he's worth watching despite that. I still don't see an argumentThe lead paint thing isn't an argument, but defending anyone who makes that argument speaks to how incredibly little they know. 

And I've a lot of the papers/ books he references. You haven'tFirst, Dave Rubin isn't right-wing, so this isn't a right-wing attack. Second, the right isn't attacking science. Feel free to provide evidence to prove me wrong. If not, the left is attacking science, ignoring facts and biology.He's Libertarian but not "right-wing". He's Liberal in the sense that he believes in personal freedoms. So essentially, socially Liberal economically Libertarian.I would like to thank you for citing sources. I don't usually see people do that. Now to your point he's Libertarian but not "right-wing". He's Liberal in the sense that he believes in personal freedoms. So essentially, socially Liberal economically Libertarian. To your point on evolution. That has to do with Religion and has very little impact on policy (For example, we don't see Conservative universities shutting down speakers who believe in evolution, as we do with speakers who don't believe in feminism at Liberal universities). Also, their opinion represents 4/10 Americans (nearly half) which don't believe in evolution (http://news.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx). To your second point, it's important to separate Trump and Conservatives. Trump's policies aren't reflective of many Conservatives, look at Ben Shapiro. This is backed up by a NYT poll which says that half of Republicans believe in Government action on Climate Change. That also doesn't include Republicans who believe in Climate Change but are unsure about what we need to do about it or whither or not it's man-made (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/us/politics/most-americans-support-government-action-on-climate-change-poll-finds.html). If you read into your third point it explains why this is. It's not because Conservatives have a hatred of science, it's because universities have been shutting down Conservatives and have been less open to debate from opposing points of view. The Atlantic article shows that under Obama science funding was lower during the beginning of the Obama administration after a big boost during the ending of the Bush administration. Also this isn't necessarily a war against science but just an extension of limited government, lower spending, and lower taxes. Also, again, Trump doesn't represent Conservatives as a whole. Your final article is just a repeat. If you take a look at the Lindsey Shepard story, you can actually see evidence of a Liberal leaning university not allowing discussion on gender being a social construct. That professor and administration who brought her in weren't "blue haired freaks". Also, "alt-light" rejects mainstream Conservative values, which all your studies identify Conservatives with. Again however, thanks for taking the time to debate me with facts, really appreciate it! Most people would just make a claim with no evidence, so again, thanks!Not true, the political graph is a square. (https://www.politicalcompass.org/composers). You can be left-wing libertarian, or authoritarian. Same with the right.But the Iraq regime was a dictatorship (not that I support the war). Also, invading foreign countries doesn't mean control over industry and commerce. That’s terrible bro. Dear god!!!! What I would have given to listen to that piece of audio, I’m so sad that it’s gone. More evidence that being dumb is the least of Rubin’s faults, he’s a despicable, shameless charlatan, a sleazeball &amp; a douchebag. He’s a real cowardly bastard; Rubin is!So we needed a right wing neoconservative to finally call out Rubins far-right hackery to his face! Oh I’m so glad that Frum went on his show &amp; completely decimated Rubins stupid, hyper-partisan talking points. But tell me this folks how in the hell does Sam Harris still not see this? He’s supposed to be a “liberal” intellectual for fucks sakes &amp; he continuously soft balled Rubin on his AMA podcast! Does Sam Harris have any clue about politics when it comes to actual policies?Making the lead argument should immediately disqualify you from the conversation. Anyone who makes the lead argument doesn't know anything about anything. They're just people who've read liars like Gould, Nisbett etc. 

None of the people who disagree with the idea that the gaps aren't going to be closed, and that they're going to remain significant, even know how they arrived at their position. What point is there in arguing with people who just know to say their 2-3 things?You're so damaged, that you'd actually probably need to be deprogrammed. What would the point be? You buy into the situationist lie. You also don't even know why. Sorry, but this is untrue. If you look at the Free Speech index, no university student union gets an A for there Free Speech policies. Only 3 get a B.http://campusfreedomindex.ca/Why, does he believe in traditional values? Does he believe in free enterprise? No, he doesn't. He believes in personal freedom, which is a Liberal belief.Here she is with Dave:
https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/837077622282559488

And her alleged letter from the British authorities:
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYGvqw4XcAApx45.jpgPlease can all Rubin Report viewers keep this in mind when assessing the calibre of Rubin's British guests.

Katie Hopkins, Milo, Tommy Robinson etc are only in America because they can't get work peddling hate in the UK.This nazi brat has a video where she walks around Paris without comment, to show how "Paris is changing" – aka filming all the non whites. I happen to live in the neighborhood she walks around in the video – Goutte d'Or is majority Arab-Muslim and has been so since like the 40s.Your right I can deny until you provide evidence.Ok, but that was just the worst part. Many of them couldn't get a B on the administration side. Also what "ideological bend" are you referring to. Also, this is Canadian because I'm Canadian. If you want American info, find it yourself buddy!Sorry but "endorsements" mean shit. Unless you can provide credible claims that the JCCF is partisan which isn't just that someone endorses them, then they aren't partisan. Also, I am now discrediting you because my Nazi friend endorses you so.... you're now a Nazi!No, this organization is like the ACLU. Their goal is to protect people's rights. To your point about representation, I have to disagree. If it's this bad in Canada, then it must be atrocious in the US. This is because Canada is much less partisan than the US.First to your claim that the "extreme right" is running the country and have been since the new deal, would you please provide evidence? Second, to that FIRE list, I am confused by it as it lists right wing speakers as "to the left". Look at Steve Bannon, it lists him as "to the left". If this is the case then I will tell you to flip your argument and thus I am correct that more right-wing speakers are dis-invited. For the Trump thing, he's a populist. He shares some opinions with Conservatives but diverges in other areas. An example was his meeting with Democrats where he supported strict gun-control, only to walk back to comments most likely when his advisors told him to. Also only half of Republicans support him (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-trump-nearly-50-percent-support-among-republicans-nationally-n546951). To your point "Also the religious right controls the left and it is the reason why we can't get climate policy so I have no idea what you are talking about", bro. During the Obama Admin we got the Paris Climate Accord. When you make arguments like this you sound like Sean Hannity with his left-wing Deep State shtick. And finally I'll leave you with this about why campus policy matters. "For centuries, universities have been nurseries of intellect, shapers of society and more often than not, agents of social progress and economic mobility. The passion and energy of young people have played an enormous part in that. But passion made brittle by ideology that goes unexamined or unchallenged promotes hatred; it does not fight it. And so, faculty, students, staff and visiting speakers must continue to be allowed to articulate positions that will offend, challenge and even upset. It must be done safely and respectfully. Otherwise, in the long run, we are all the poorer and our fundamental shared values are at risk." (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-we-invited-jordan-peterson-to-discuss-compelled-speech/).The thread completely fails to recognize what the “free speech crisis” on college campuses actually is. The crisis lies in University policies across the nation that are silencing free speech at the wishes of violent protesters who refuse to listen to ideas that aren’t their own. No one is claiming there’s a mass wave of young people who defiantly oppose the idea of “free speech”. It's that Universities turn away public speakers out of fear for what protesters might do, rather than defending free speech and punishing protesters for disrupting it.&gt; Please provide actual policy he proposes that isn't trade that deviates from the standard conservative line. 

https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald-trump-working-class-voters-219231
&gt;You are sipping some seriously strong koolaid if you don't know that the extreme righty is running the entire country. I never said they have been running the country since the new deal I said they have their largest governing coalition since the roaring 1920s

It's called wave elections, Vox made a video on it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15WhOT_lQiA)
&gt;Also when you look at public polling data students specifically are more likely to support all areas of free speech and dissenting ideas.

Evidence? No?
&gt;Less than half of republicans believe a free press is important to democracy while 76% of democrats believed it is

Again, Evidence?
&gt;more than half of the republican party would allow the suspension elections if Trump wanted to.

Trump's populist base is crazy, what's new.
&gt;Less than half of republicans believe it is appropriate for the press to criticize elected leaders while 76 % of democrats say the opposite

This is most likely a response to the media's repeated partisan attacks. It's not the medias job to criticize politicians, it's their job to hold them to account. 

&gt;only 2/3 of the republican party believe that people with dissenting opinions should be protected while 80% of the Democratic party believe they should be. 

Not Dissenting, unpopular. 
&gt;I challenge you to go through the pew databases on free speech and really look at the data because when you do you'll realize the Rubin narrative isn't accurate at all

http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/20/40-of-millennials-ok-with-limiting-speech-offensive-to-minorities/  35% of Democrats support censorship compared to 18% Republican. 40% of Millennials (The people in universities and recently graduated)
https://medium.com/informed-and-engaged/8-ways-college-student-views-on-free-speech-are-evolving-963334babe40   Students prefer "diversity" over free speech, 70% believe in limits on free speech with Republicans being the most supportive of no limits at 86%. Only 64% of students believe that free speech is secure, down from 73%. Students believe its easier for Liberals (92%) to express their views over Conservatives (69%). Nearly 40% of students believe it's acceptable to shout down a speaker, while 10% say violence is acceptable.
Alt-right means that there are elements of white nationalism. Dave Rubin in no way is a white nationalist. What number do you think is a crisis? The fact that there are that many dis-invitations is very concerning to me. Just because you disagree with Milo doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to come and speak. Also he didn't get "chased out of Berkeley", they burned the god-damn school down. Also you haven't shown any statistics, you just showed a twitter thread, which has no credibility as it's just an opinion piece. Provide evidence, then talk statistics.
It took less than 10 minute because I started with the Google auto-caption.The problem is that he doesn't push policy.So it turns out that the reason why Dave has been kicking up a fuss about this on Twitter is because he knows the man personally. Of course.

And why is he handing out phone numbers at the end of the video? What happened to “journalists shouldn’t be activists”?It's true tho. The US government doesn't care about you. If you don't like Republicans or Democrats, who are you going to vote for? A third party will never win.Bob Saget, huh? Does this officially signal that the Rubin Report is circling the drain?It happened in October or November of last year mate. Check out his AMA history, it was on AMA 8 or 9 (unfortunately it’s behind a paywall) but if you are subscribed to Sams content on his website, u should be able to access it.You know Shapiro's already been on there at least 3x, right? As well as countless other libertarians. That's, like, sort of Dave's whole shtick. Have you ever watched his show?Lol bless your heart.He also did the discussion with Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro.Sorry, there's just no way to be sure if someone is joking or being serious these days.I think the title plays fast and loose with the word "debate".

Dave does the best he can to dilute his own position whilst behaving like a total sycophant to avoid offending his 'friend'.

It's embarrassing.So much for the tolerant left....[sorry,  but no. Dave is concerned about large social media companies apparently unfollowing people from conservatives](https://twitter.com/classiclib3ral/status/975168904216662016?s=21) Haven't watched it yet, but hope they talk about the fact that Republicans are more beholden to identity politics than Democrats. Don't believe me? Check it out [here.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12485)

Oh yah, and while Pinker's not a bad guy, his new book, Enlightenment Now, sucks.This is the strategy Dave takes cause he's too stupid to offer an analysis/opinion and he wants to help Trump save face. Dave tries to reframe the conversation from the criticism of a shitty choice for NSA Advisor to an indictment of those criticizing Trump/Bolton without actually putting forth a defence himself. 

Dave is a huckster.It's not that he's "cool" with him, it's that he's tried of these fazes of anger.What is ironic, is that he he doesn't get the hysteria from the left after he admitted he hasn't even properly researched who Bolton was!It astounds me that this has been published with absolutely no evidence whatsoever (not even the name of the university!)Brietbart isn't MSM.https://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/Better question is what is the MSM?

Is Fox News not part of the MSM, when they are at times the most viewed TV network?Fox News is part of the MSM. MSM is used to talk about consumer oriented mass-media organizations.Ok, I accept that.

Well, Fox News is a kind-of niche market oriented IMO, but all these definations always get a bit blurry.David Hogg's out talking about white privilege, demonizing anyone that disagrees with him.  It's the Young Turks progressive viewpoint to a tee, which is far left since it perfectly aligns with far leftist parties overseas, like SYRIZA of Greece or Labour of the UK.

The "basic gun control" he's talking about is deceptive doublespeak.  The trick is you always say you want minor changes, then you write bills that are everything you really want, hiding things in details that few people understand.  That tactic goes back decades and takes advantage of people that don't understand the details of gun laws.He then left.He said he would vote for Trump over Gavin Newsom! He's pretty mainstream democrat. Yet Rubin calls him a progressive loon!

He's a full on Trump supporter.Not just Sanders or Warren mind you, he would vote for Trump over Gavin Newsom, who is pretty mainstream California Democrat.

He would possibly vote for Trump over the majority of the democratic party, if not every democrat.The animus for Sanders in particular is puzzling from Rubin and makes it clear he's just gone full right wing shill at this point. Sanders has repeatedly been clear that he wants all political viewpoints heard at college campuses - he's criticized the attempts to deplatform Anne Coulter for example. He also regularly discusses how he's not a fan of identity politics and prefers to focus on policy and big ideas.  

I can take Rubin's "small government" objections to Sanders - but to label him as a "regressive" and saddle him with all the authoritarian leftist tendencies is just a pure smear. Plus I'd take Rubin's small government objection more seriously is I had EVER seen Rubin himself (not Shapiro speaking for him lol) give any actual principled defense of those principles. I haven't. 

And let's also not forget that as recently as this summer Rubin was claiming to be a supporter of single payer healthcare - Sanders' signature proposal. Rubin has hardly given any in depth explanation for why he no longer supports this besides just general "small government". Surely THIS must be the one that Rubin will hold Trump's feet to the fire over. Like, this has been the entirety of Rubin's show for at least a year. Source: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dave-rubin-and-yaron-brook-at-ucf-tickets-43612816107Also - an event called "The Role of Government" from the Ayn Rand Institute &amp; Turning Point USA, featuring Yaron Brook and Dave Rubin.

I wonder what conclusions they'll come to! Such mystery...When was the last time you were banned from wearing a scarf to a university speech?Yes - Rubin's game is to never or almost never talk about specific policies and their impacts and instead just throw around a bunch of terms (usually political labels) and judge people based on those. 

This is why his constant talk of how the reaction to Trump is just "hysteria" and really his presidency overall has been just fine is laughable. He's almost never talked about concrete policies of the Trump admin - from Net Neutrality to enhancing drone strikes to the Syria missile launches to crackdowns on small drug crimes to the tax cuts to attempted Obamacare repeal to defunding multiple government programs (Head Start, Department of Energy/Education, the EPA, HUD, NASA, and more). And this list is just a start. These policies directly impact the lives of millions of people. To wave it off and claim it's just "hysteria" while showing no in-depth knowledge of any of this is such a joke from a supposed political commentator. 

Listen to Jeremy Scahill's podcast for example - now I don't agree with everything he says, but almost every week he interviews people who have seen direct impacts of the Trump admin's policies on the ground. I'd like to see Dave interview one of these people and say "everything would be fine if it wasn't for the constant hysteria". And if Rubin wants to defend these policies in their merits from a conservative/libertarian viewpoint - fine. Many people would be happy to have that discussion. But he doesn't. He throws his hands up, claims nothing has changed, it's all "hysteria" and the fault of the "regressive left" whining about nothing. That was disappointing not being able to see the Q&amp;AWhen Antifa came to town and used then to cover their faces like cowardsI really think there's a decent chance Dave is angling for a position at Fox News. He's really friendly it's Greg Gutfeld, he totally changed the subject with Pinker when he criticized Fox. "It's basically fine that far-right media apparatuses are smearing these kids who are mass shooting survivors by comparing them to Hitler, but it's so hard to get an opinion in because the left is so hysterical. Now I've got to go get into fights with and threaten to sue Buzzfeed journalists who call me alt-right." - Dave's responseI cringed so hardto be fair being a shitty comedian that no one liked and then putting a smile on your face and pretending you are still a comedian is alot of internal struggle.This is from the beginning when I actually had high hopes for Rubin's show. When I thought he actually could call out some of the hypocrises on "the left" while still making sense. It's really so unfortunate how far he's fallen....

And it's especially disappointing because from watching his show over the years (less and less recently) it's hard to see how he had an actual change of heart. Like why exactly does he not care about campaign finance at all anymore? Given the flimsiness of his arguments now it's hard for me to believe his conversion to the right is about anything but $ and opportunism.There’s breaking  news everyday. The deputy campaign manager was tied to GRU. Like promoting chemical weapons conspiracy theories.Greenwald prompted people denying chemical weapons usage.Hollywood children? Who are Dave's parents?If those are the rules, Prager will play by themComment on Youtube:
&gt;*Dean Ludwig: Not a Kasich fan, but I appreciate Rubin having* ***anyone*** *on his show﻿*

.

&gt;*Dean Ludwig: Keyser Soze, I agree with in that Dave hasn't had many (or possibly any) of the modern far left, which is why I praised this video* ***because Kasich is one of the most left person I've seen***. *But in general he does have opposing ideas on his show. For example he has had Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson on his show and they have FAR different philosophies. He hears both of them out equally﻿*Yashar claims that "the only Dave that Jordan Peterson follows is Dave Rubin" - https://twitter.com/yashar/status/979711560485691392Why do Dave's guests keep popping up as apologists for white nationalists?&gt;white supremacists exist

Present them. Who is a white supremacist, though?I think this is actually really good. It's a sign that the alternative media people are coming to be more consequential in everyone's mind. &gt;White supremacy or white supremacism is a racist ideology based upon the belief that white people are superior in many ways to people of other races and that therefore white people should be dominant over other races.

Which white nationalist thinks this? It really is so sad. I remember reading the "New Atheist" authors Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens about a decade ago. As a young person who grew up semi-religious I had already rejected religion. I loved their advocacy for science in public policy, their standing up for civil rights, and their opposition to the influence of the Christian Right, mostly from the legacy of the Bush admin at that time. 

To think a decade later that a big chunk of the this movement's following would be making excuses for and in some cases even allying with "white nationalists" is truly astounding. If you would have told me that a decade ago or even probably 5 years ago I wouldn't have believed it in a thousand years.  I would've thought a movement committed to science and rationality would have done the only thing that makes sense in dealing with these "white nationalist" types - laughing them out of the room and paying them as little attention as possible. 

And I really do see Rubin's show as kind of instrumental in this shift, and as a former major supporter of this "movement", I really don't think you can easily underestimate the damage Rubin has done. From my point of view it is really sad....She’s an opportunist. I actually felt she was treated unfairly but this is too far.Jared Taylor, a white separatist, wants to have dominion over people who he wants nothing to do with?So you don't care what's true, you care about using the spooky word that doesn't describe anybody. You have to see how convenient all of this is? No white supremacists come to mind, an alleged white supremacist doesn't even want to associate with non-whites, and nobody says they want dominion over the other races. 

Do you think that the term "white supremacist" might actually only be in use because it plays off of resentment?test "white supremacist", "ethnonationalist" and " white nationalist". See how people respond to them all. There's a difference, and it's a difference that isn't based in an honest assessment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50kP4S0peAsSo you don't actually know what they think. It's not available in my country. 

Wikileaks thinks they can flip a consequential number of people through Jordan Peterson and people who'll flip through his influence down the line (other youtubers).  

That's them recognizing their influence. What "conservative Reddit troll" did Dave host?Rubin sits at the perfect intersection of stupid, uninformed and malevolent. Harris is well intentioned and smart, but in my view very misguided in his anti PC crusade. Harris is someone I love to hate, Rubin is someone I just hate. I'd say the latter is worse, the former more frustrating. How is he "misguided"He called the entire left irredeemable and blows the whole "PC-problem" out of proportion, his anti-Trumpness is pretty neoliberal and consists of him and warmongers like David Frum crying about the good old days when neocons were running the show, he can be pretty arrogant and allergic to criticism, calling out even honest critics for misrepresenting him, he's much more willing to engage with dishonest people from the right (like Shapiro, Bari Weiss or Peterson) than to leftists he disagrees with, those a just some points. 
The Ezra Klein debacle (and I'm no huge fan of Klein either) was pretty embarrassing for Sam Harris I think, to the point where he basically told his audience they were just too stupid to understand his side of things. For your comment that he said the ENTIRE left is irredeemable, may you please provide a source? How does he blow the whole "PC problem" out of proportion? Have you seen the Dems? I don't understand your comment about crying that neocons aren't in charge, when Trump has surrounded himself with neocons. How is Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson "dishonest"? For your last point, messing up doesn't mean one is "misguided".To back you up on Sanders being a fierce defender of free speech, here's this from a speech on the campaign where he VOLUNTARILY offered up the podium to BLM activists staging a protest. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV-ZSP0zAuII noticed you're using a common leftist tactic.I find your lack of denial interesting. 

I'm a lolbertarian.&gt; Flynn Effect

Flynn Effect was coined by Murry......using someones own argument against them self.... how would you debunk someones work with their own discovery?The funniest things about this:

a) Dave seemingly can't count - the word "couple" means "two".

b) Ana Navarro is a progressive?!

c) Who else in the world solicits guests for a talk show in this manner?I listened to his Joe Rogan episode(s?) and they were quite boring. He just went along with whatever Joe had to say and didn't have much to contribute.

Doubt a Rubin Report appearance would be particularly excitingb) Only in Dave's right wing world where everyone to the left of him is a progressive.

c) This is part of his schtick in saying "err I invite the left on my show but they won't come on!" He knows damn well these people aren't going to come on his show (probably don't even see the message) and this is his way of trying to shame them. 

I'm waiting for the Sam Seder or Contrapoints episode. I think it would be very interesting.

Good to see a little bit of pushback in the comments.TJ can force the issue by invoking right wing SJWs like Shapiro.It should open on the timestamp - 1:03:4211:27, he literally espouses identity politics. I mean I keep thinking it SHOULD be ironic when he says "I'm gay married, that should give me some cred" but it sure sounds like he's genuinely sincere there.

That's ridiculous. One of the things I actually agree with Rubin on is his distaste for identity politics. Unfortunately like everything else, he's only against it when they're not working in his favor it seems.  That's what I find absolutely apalling. I am genuinely against identity politics so every time Rubin says "BTW I'M GAY MARRIED" it's just so heartbreaking. Like, at first I think he was being ironic about it. I think. But now it's like Jesus we get it dude you're doing the EXACT damn thing you claim to be against. Like, I don't give a shit if you're gay, or if a leftist is gay or if an alt-right troll (Milo) is gay. I care about people's politics not their identity. Fucking hell.&gt; What will his show turn into then?

It'll be the exact same it is now I think. He'll blame "the regressive left" for shutting down "valuable ideas" or something like that. When in reality, that's literally democracy. Totally agree man.

It's so frustrating because I thought Rubin was a voice against this shit, but nope. I legit hear far more criticism of Trump on Ben Shapiro's own podcast by conservatives for conservatives than Rubin's "creating a new center". It's absurd. 15:00 to 17:00

Dave and Jimmy discuss the exact future problem of the Rubin ReportDave's views aren't that similar to Sam Harris, other than that they are both talk about free speech a lot. The main difference between the two is that Sam is at least genuine and sincere. He isn't shilling for anyone or anything. Dave, on the other hand, is about as disingenuous as possible and is clearly shilling to the conservatives that fund him.They can go here, nobody is banning them / silencing them here. The thing is, some of Rubin's hypocrisies, pandering, lack of basic political knowledge, all around dishonesty is next to impossible to defend.

Also it's not about views, his views are not the problem. The problem is his dishonesty. Sam Harris isn't perfect, but he's generally intelectually honest, compared to Rubin at least.

And the only active fans that I know of are really toxic subset of conservatives, everybody else doesn't view many of his videos or know his history to see what a fraud he's.https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/74mcyg/can_someone_fill_me_in_on_this_dave_rubin/dnzsf6o/

Since then he only became worse - still this comment shows you pretty well that he's not an honest actor.Dave finally snapped from all the supposed subscriber removals from Youtube.

(just kidding Dave please don't threaten to sue me you free speech guy lover guy you)Therefore Dave Rubin is a potential shooter? Grow up lolHave I misunderstood? Rubin is infamous here for complaining about potential demonetisation of his videos. Is this not a comparison between the shooter in the title and Rubin? If not, why post here?He gets meme'd on for going on about demonetisation. Saying there's no link between those two is disingenuous at best and slander  at... second best actually, because I could call it a lot worseOf course he won't address this. This is precisely the criticism everyone has of Rubin. He is entirely one-sided in his criticism. Just imagine how many post we'd see from him if a conservative high school student was engaging in civil discourse on a controversial political issue, then some liberal commentator responded with Tweets like what Owen Benjamin said.

Another example is the countless #ReleaseTheMemo Tweets Dave posted to try to get the Nunes memo released. He kept saying things along the lines of, "If there's nothing to hide, then why not #ReleaseTheMemo?" Then, after Trump refused to release the Dems memo a few weeks later, Dave was completely silent. He was called out for it on Twitter several times, but he still never responded.Look at [OP's](https://www.reddit.com/user/byelection) post history. This person has about 6k karma spread over hundreds of posts (content and comments) ragging on Rubin for 11 months. Like, there must be a single thing someone says or does that you can agree with. Which is what makes me think there's something more sinister to this particular post. And there are plenty of users like this. It looks so one-sided that it absolutely stinks of something conspiratorial, or at least prejudicedDid this guy really just say that because you don’t like the President, you logically shouldnt want the government involved in these issues? What an asinine thing to sayNo. Because there is evidence of prejudice (long-term almost singular targeting) I can reasonably suggest that there is motive in OP's post. That motive probably isn't to imply Dave Rubin is a potential shooter (hyperbole) but to imply those ideas are somewhat connected in some more abstract sense. Additionally don't straw man me, it makes your idea look weak.Yes it seems so

Rule 2: Digging through someone's post history (blatant ad hominem attacks) *may* result in your comment being removed. *Focus on arguments, not those who are making them.*

Firstly, "may" implies discretionary moderating. I'll argue why the discretion should be awarded in my favour if it came down to it.

Ad hominem - (of an argument or reaction) directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining.

I've not attacked OP personally, i'm attacking his arguments which span over time and which are very relevant to the discussion. I haven't called OP an X, Y or Z. I've called his arguments over time prejudiced, targeted and one-sided. I stand by this.Are you saying that Rubin is somewhat culpable because he said he was frustrated with the YouTube demonetisation policies?I'm being honest here, I don't know what you're saying. Or rather - I don't understand it's relevance in this context. I'll be more honest, I think you were saying something, thought better of it and now you're saying something else because the original comment didn't look kosher in retrospect.When the the attack is both 'dug' and 'ad hominem' meaning attacking the person and not their argument using information gained about them through previous posts. It isn't unreasonable to assume that this meaning refers to digging up personal facts and using them to argue the person not the idea. If I post something on /r/happy with a selfie and I was particularly spotty (or something similar) and we had this spat, and you said "fuck off pepperoni face" I would consider that grounds for actively moderating Rule 2. My comment is *obviously* not that kind of comment. I think the lack of specificity in the rule would allow for both interpretations though if i'm being truthful.This is the president of an organisation that has 2,468 Twitter followers.

Yet Dave will only host a progressive if its someone as famous as Jimmy Kimmel...I'm 8 minutes in and this must be his dullest interview/subject yet?The straw manning taking place refers to your comment before last. I've made the point that it's quite clearly not just criticism, its a years worth of singularly targeted negative spin. But when you say "So because op criticises Dave means that he thinks he is a potential shooter?" you've ignored points I literally just made in the comment that you were replying to - it's more than that! So yes! Ignoring my points makes it; 1) an easier argument to beat and 2) not even my argument and. I would absolutely classify that as straw manningBest part was when someone asked what books formed his political ideology and he said zillions and "zillions of books, some of them here on my bookshelf". Then after a bit of thought he mentioned a Carl Sagan's book Billions and Billions. 

Like ok, Carl Sagan is good, but you would expect when asked what formed your political ideology you would mention a book that was primarily political or philosophical! It's almost as if he can't name any, despite acting like this all wise classical liberal discussing big ideas, so he mentions a book he read from a pop science guy (again, there is nothing wrong with it, you would just expect Rubin to know more when he says he's interested in philosophical underpinnings of politics).This kid's commitment to repeatedly mispronouncing the world "nuclear" is astounding.

He deserves an award.These are, presumably, the posts that got him in trouble. I didn't link to the article as it's from Brei*bart and I don't want to provide them with hits.

https://twitter.com/SeeDaneRun/status/981367567620206592

https://twitter.com/drmistercody/status/981999668358868993But seriously - look at the number of horrendous people who manage to somehow stay within Twitter's rules. 

Then look at the number of Rubin's guests who find themselves thrown off the site (Milo, Tommy Robinson, Owen Benjamin are the only ones that immediately come to mind).

This would give any serious person pause for thought about what kind of shitshow they're running. But not Dodgy Dave.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_suspensions

This page tells me that Thunderf00t - another RR guest - was also suspended temporarily.

This is a very small list and it's rather alarming that a plurality of these names have appeared on Rubin's show.I'm sure you didn't know but this has been posted a few timesWhat's going on with Dave's eye area in that clip?

I don't like to comment on people's appearances if I can't help it but I don't know if it's bad botox, too much make-up or something else...You're optimistic. I was going for Shapiro, Peterson or one of those two brothers.

Don't think it'll be a comic as I can't see Dave inviting someone who is potentially funnier than him to his "return to stand-up".If you want to express your disapproval due to his disproportionate number of interviews with conservatives, try asking something like "do you believe, as the host of a show that values having open discourse, it is important to interview a balanced number of people from both the right and the left, and how would you best achieve that?"

It's not confrontational, and he'll probably spin it to say something like "the left-wing doesn't want to have a dialogue", but when he has the microphone, there's not really much you can do beyond that. Confrontational questions aren't productive at a Q&amp;A, so the best you can do is get him to squirm. The "and how would you best achieve that" part of the question will either force him to admit he has failed to represent both sides or say that he actually doesn't value giving all ideas a platform. Although I wouldn't put it past Rubin to (like I mentioned earlier) blame left-wingers for not wanting to come on the show.You gotta tell us how the rest went. We all know that Rubin is a terrible comedian, what you described seems very simular to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzvaNGPDBI). 

Rubin's unfunniness is a great source of comedy on this sub.Dave doesn’t actually have an argument nor does he plan on contending with the criticism brought up of Apu. “Good for you” is about the level of political commentary I’d expect from Dave.

And the less said about the replies, the better...

https://twitter.com/NJOverclocked/status/983471422117904384What's funny about "OMG this Asian man looks like someone who works at a store cos loads of Asians work at stores hahahahaha"?Good job misrepresenting the tweet! All he said was saying that he supported blackface and how stupid such an accusation is.I'm going to go out on a limb here: he probably won't.

Shocking, I knowSo? YouTube/Twitter is a private enterprise but Dave won’t shut up about them.Unlike a public university, which has to uphold Constitutional values, private Christian universities don't."We're partnering with Learn Liberty this week..." - I am SHOOKWhat's this!?!?! A... CONSERVATIVE college professor on Dave's show? But I thought the left had taken over the colleges?

And, now he's speaking at the Oxford Union, Dave can never again claim that left-leaning college groups don't invite him.What the hell is that noise at 1min 17secs?

Is the Rubin Report filmed at the departure lounge of LAX!?It's one thing to argue that British colonialism did more good that bad - I have lots of sympathy for the argument that the introduction of democracy, infrastructure etc outweighs some negatives.

But it's disingenuous for her not to mention the negatives at all. Just Google the Bengal famine of 1943 and Churchill's extremely controversial actions there.Dave suggesting that people should go after university donors to pressure the professors.

But he's against ad boycotts of TV shows?Just finished. This is a boring one. Dave referencing the crib sheet he received from Learn Liberty towards the beginning indicates he probably wasn't all that keen on interviewing her.

The first half is her fairly standard life story (left India for America, Dad wasn't impressed but they later reunited) and the second is all about college campuses, freeze peach and the usual.What has he done of value to speak at Oxford Union? I watched two seperate interviews of Dave Rubin and he said the exact same thing using the exact same buzzwords, which to me is a sign that a person is a total hackThe Oxford Union will literally invite anyone:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2048349/Katie-Price-Oxford-Union-No-excuse-try-earn-living.html

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2094489/Peter-Andre-gives-inspirational-talk-Oxford-Union-just-days-Katie-Price-speaks-Cambridge-Union.htmlWhat the hell is this guy talking about? "Pro-torture executive order"? He's just making stuff up...Muslims specifically Pakistani muslims have been around in large numbers since the 50's, if there was a plan for invasion it would have happened by now. 

If you want to discuss the muslim communities attitude towards integration that would be another thing but this is straight up racist.Amazing how a son of Irish immigrants who grew up during a time of anti-irish sentiment is saying stuff like thisYikes, she's boring...Again? Were you the guy who challenged him before about his questionable guests?

Record it on your phone (even if it's just audio or video of the floor) if you can.Good for you! And thanks! You're doing everyone a favour by holding these people to account in a respectful and honest way.No. I never subscribed in the first place, you absolute melt.Just shows how quickly people forget. I heard Robinson talk about it once how his mom is from Ireland and she was able to integrate better than muslims despite facing worse discrimination than muslims do. So basically he thinks muslims should stop complaining because his family had it worse or something.

There has to be a psychological term for something like this. Reminds me of Henry Kissinger who escaped the holocaust is on record saying he has no problem if jews in the soviet union will be put in gas chambers.I unsubscribed from you a long time ago Dave, no youtube conspiracy here. Conservatives love playing victim and think the whole world is out to get them.Conservatives have the biggest victim complex and part of that is projecting it onto others so they can play victim over the fact that other people are playing victim.You were the one who called into sam seder to talk about it right?I mean, you could ask him why he doesn't respond to David Pakman, who would love to be on his show, but he can't, because Rubin doesn't respond to his request.

Is Pakman dishonest actor that just insults people?

https://youtu.be/yWKm947sLEo?t=2m40s

Proof.

He's is a self-described progressive that wants to go on his show, while Rubin is insisting that progressives won't go to his show. He has cut off all communications with him after disaster interview that Rubin did with Pakman.Thanks for the question last time! Please ask him why that part was removed – and please be prepared to come with examples this time for other questions \(there are so many more names than Cernovich you could have named!\).  

But I know it's hard, there are a myriad of things this guy needs to answer to, but that would require an interview with someone who isn't on the Learn Liberty/ Prager U sponsored list of guests he trots out every week, not a quick question at an event full of his supporters...If he really wanted to, he could start a free mailing list/newsletter to get around this problem in seconds. But moaning and whining for attention is apparently more fruitful.bye feliciaDave wants his cake and he wants it now.&gt; uh, wait - I thought Dave Rubin was supposed to be a Liberal himself??

He's talking about Progressive Liberals, who, as Dave Rubin has said, has become synonymous with Liberal&gt; He's talking about Progressive Liberals, who, as Dave Rubin has said, has become synonymous with Liberal

He's talking about Progressive Liberals, who, as Dave Rubin has said, has become synonymous with LiberalYep, he goes to conventions and events that are libertarian promoting small government and free markets but he is somehow not a libertarian.You can be Libertarian and Liberal. Political ideology is a grid. Have you studied polsci?Yes you can. Yes I have. When I can find something via a fucking Google search, it doesn't look good for you...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianismI'm not pretending. There was a piece in the NYT about Progressive being synonymous with Liberal and Left-wing. Hillary Clinton during the campaign used the fact the she was a woman as a reason to be elected.Source: http://www.rubinreport.com/about/#crew

Not that there’s anything wrong with that in and of itself, but the false bragging about the pure might of the operation, what he’s “built” etc is a bit much from a man who films a YouTube show from his house.When did I claim that American Liberals were libertarian? I said that you CAN be Libertarian-Liberals, as Dave is, and that Progressives and Liberals are essentially one in US politics. Yes, their a difference! We agree! That's what Dave has been saying! He even made a video, The Left Is No Longer Liberal, where he talks about this. No. YOU don't get it.

I never said that the American left is close to Libertarian just than Liberal can be Libertarian which Dave has moved to seeing it as an ideology that encompasses his prior beliefs and offers solutions that he believes will work.Sounds like Dave is just another contestant in the "oppression Olympics."Good luck dude! :\)

I really think you should focus on one damning question, he's surely gonna shut down an attempt to list a lot of critiques. It's Dave Rubin after all, he's not exactly interested in having an honest conversation with critics.

[Here's what I asked him](https://www.reddit.com/r/Classical_Liberals/comments/6ipull/hey_this_is_dave_rubin_lets_talk_about_classical/dj8brzn) in his catastrophe of an ama.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/74mcyg/can_someone_fill_me_in_on_this_dave_rubin/dnzsf6o) is a rundown by u/Tsegen everybody questioning the pushback against Dave Rubin should read.Never said that left-libertarianism is liberalism. Also your ideology is responsible for the death of millions.No, but I've twice been blocked by Dave on Twitter for simply pointing out his hypocrisy in a civil manner.A good question in my eyes would be; how he can claim that his political positions have hardly changed (except shifting slightly right on taxes) and that he's still the same liberal he always, and that it's in fact it's the left that has gone crazy?

How is this continuously made statement reconcilable with the fact that he completely loved Bernie Sanders two years ago, said he agreed with him on literally almost everything ...

... to now saying he's going to fight Bernie Sanders on every step of his way and would actually vote for Trump over Bernie &amp; Warren or a similar candidate if that was his choice in 2020. And that he won't feel bad doing so.

We all know, Bernie hasn't changed his positions within the last two years, hell, he hardly changed his positions within the last thirty years. 

So how are those statements reconcilable? Will he admit to have shifted from the left to the right, and that is was in fact a pretty huge ideological shift?

I hope someone can record the Q&amp;A so we can get it archived. An extreme ideology that Sadiq Khan doesnt support.I agree he was wrong, but he was just reading out random tweets, I doubt he took the time to actually look deeper into who was sending them. He was probably just given a handful of random tweets criticizing him.Collecting patreon money is tough work.&gt;Punishing people for making something of themselves creates a disincentive to be a productive member of society

This would explain why Dave isn't a productive member of society.Excellent postThis is definitely the way I'd approach itReminds me of the george orwell quote, war is peace, slavery is freedom ignorance is strength. 

Now we can add the rich are oppressed and the poor are privileged Inviting people on your show and listening to them talk is hard work. So is going to events and spouting the exact same talking points a thousand times.Nope there is a video of him from two years ago saying he agrees with everything Bernie Sanders says. Truth is he knows nothing about policy and bases his decisions based on the last person he talked to. Before he was around progressives so he was a progressive, then he started hanging out with Ben Shapiro and Milo so he became more conservative.There are plenty of interviews Sowell has done, he could've asked those exact same questions and it would still be a better interviewDon't forget he's getting paid by Republican think tanks now too, which is why he's gone full Republican shill. Did you ask some questions?Really? That must mean his patreons have access to that questioning of yours.

Or he's full of shit.I wouldn't use that language to describe anything, quite frankly.Here's The Last Liberal standing before a crowd that chants "build the wall" at two people. Awful. Surely he's embarrassed by this?Candace says that transgenderism is a mental illness etc and ends her rant with "Blaire White, your friend, is a man!"

Alleged gay rights advocate Dave replies by nodding and saying "Yeah. And I won't get you jailed for that".

Weak. Weak. Weak.The "I don't challenge people's views because I'm not that kind of interviewer" was blown apart this evening.

Charlie Kirk is here ranting and raving about Democrats wanting open borders and loving illegal immigrants and whatever else and Dave is sitting there with that derpy look on his face.

I'm half an hour in and Dave hasn't corrected any clear mistruths and has only stated his specific opinions on issues when pushed. This wasn't a Dave Rubin interview - it was a discussion between three people - so there's no excuse.These people claim to hate identity politics but I'm 43 minutes in and they've talked about almost nothing else than people's skin colour, nationality, gender or sexuality. Charlie Kirk has even asked the audience to "put your hands up if you're a person of colour!"

But THE LEFT is the faction obsessed with identity politics...Is there a Patreon supporter who can confirm that the Q and A was provided for them?He did NOT like that first point about the Q&amp;A. You got Dave very rattled. Amazing.

Your further points about immigrant crime, the minimum wage and competition etc were fantastic.

Well done Ibrahim (sp?). Keep up the good work. The fact-based, moderate people in Western politics (be they on the Left or the Right) need more people like you to challenge these people in a calm and collected way (as you did).I'd love to read a detailed account of your thoughts/feelings about the event, u/ed_1138

For instance, some of the heckling is inaudible in the feed so it'd be interesting to hear what all that was actually aboutIs it common knowledge that jesus and muhammad are 600 years apart, even among people who didnt grow up religious?all words are made up words"theres a place for inforwars in the media"

"What has trump done that is indefensible?"

and every single time he goes on about the regressive left, identity politics, classical liberalism etc.

Illegal immigrants are bad because they are working for less money, but corporations are good for paying them less illegally, makes perfect sense.And its obvious that he's only doing it for retweets and to look good in front of his then new audience who want him to insult Cenk.Dave knows nothing about immigration, he recently did an interview with nick gillepsie (Which I can send you if you're interested) and when he's asked about immigration, he says, "Well yeah but this brings up the real problem we are facing which is identity politics"Yeah this interview is a great example of how despite claiming to be about "big ideas" and not labels, Rubin actually is obsessed with talking about labels.  

Sowell is actually an interesting voice and a very substantive person, even if (like me) you disagree with him most of the time. Minimum wage, welfare programs, UBI, foreign policy, and education policy are all topics where I'm sure he would've gladly gotten into the actual issues. But Rubin kept going back to, "So are you a classical liberal?", or "The left really sucks today doesn't it?", or (the funniest imo) "Isn't it so great we can have a conversation? The left doesn't want these conversations."

To see a critique of "social justice" that actually has substance and is (usually) focused on actual policy, this is a great video of Sowell from the 1990s:

Candace’s comment about transgender people is basically conservatism in a nutshell: a bitter, vindictive and resentful ideology. Even if being transgender was a mental illness Candace uses the term with such malice that it’s clear she’s not concerned with general well-being, she’s interested in inflicting pain.I said this months ago actually: https://www.reddit.com/r/daverubin/comments/6k15c6/rubin_got_gay_marriage_and_weed_now_he_can_go/Because it's very different to have a safe space from being murdered and persecuted compared to having a safe space from uncomfortable opinions.

For example; for jews, blacks, trans people etc. the classroom and school should absolutely be a safe space from being attacked physically, just not a safe space from uncomfortable opinions.

To my knowledge Israel also has a rich debate culture and sharp criticism from within. It's not a safe space in that sense. 
You’re right! Thanks for framing it this way.Too bad I can't see the Tweet because Dave blocked me for simply pointing out his hypocrisy in a civil manner.So...is Dave somehow trying to tie his car being broken into to policies like high taxes? I just don't even know where to start with that. I guess Dave's natural reaction to anything negative that happens is to lash out at liberals.

"Just got on the scale and saw that I've gained 20 pounds over the last year. Fuck you for your liberal policies, Gov. Jerry Brown!"Dave is a complete dumbass and all, but I'm really not understanding how you're comparing safety from violence to safety from being offended by words.I don't know how you hadn't already lost all respect for him way before that, but I'm glad you've seen the light.I think it's more a matter of being educated than religious. In fact, I think religious people are less likely to know that than religious people. Religious people tend to be the least informed. Many Christians don't even realize that Allah is the same God from the Bible.1st two are for memes, r/JordanPeterson is for intellectual discussion since I won't find it here with people like you."The Q&amp;A will be live streamed, and then made available to our Patreon supporters after the show" 👀Highlights (up until the Q&amp;A):

*The graphic that was posted on social media advertised this as a "debate" but - despite Onkar Ghate and Dave taking different positions on federal monuments and Trump's criticism of Kaepernick - I'm yet to see anyone actually disagree on anything, and the talk went on for over an hour.

*Dave seemingly toys with the idea of a civil war!!!! He says he'd be "completely against it" but asks whether the "battle of ideas" will be fought in some other way.

*Dave had a Jeb Bush-esque "Please clap!" moment at the very start

*Yasmine Mohammed introduced herself and Dave responded with "It's nice that you're not in the niqab and we can see your beautiful hair!". She laughed awkwardly and I died a little inside.

*Dave doesn't believe that monuments of confederate figures etc. "We can't give an inch on this" as they pertain to history. He thinks we should build "counter-statues" to put them in context but doesn't believe in putting them in museums, which would provide adequate context. Odd.

*Can't remember the exact quote but Dave used the 'we're all products of our time' excuse for slave owners. There is some truth to this but he seemed awfully complacent in a way he isn't when he discusses his relatives that escaped the Holocaust.

*Dave defends Trump's statements on Colin Kaepernick. Onkar Ghate rightly pushed back on this on free speech/government overreach grounds, also citing the Amazon/Washington Post drama.

*Onkar Ghate - the Canadian with German and Indian ancestry - says "I think multiculturalism is a codeword for anti-Americanism". Lots to unpack there.

*Dave says Apu got married "in an Indian wedding" on The Simpsons when he meant "Hindu wedding".

*Dave is pro-gentrification - "Where Starbucks goes, there's more economic success". He doesn't address that this means that the rent goes up, leaving families turfed out of the only neighbourhoods they've ever known. There are decent arguments on both sides of this issue but Dave wasn't interested in the nuance of the debate - shocker!

*Yasmine Mohammed criticises Jeremy Corbyn's allegedly lapse attitudes towards female genital mutilation - this is a false accusation. Current Labour policy places an "emphasis on routine training for teachers and health workers on how to help victims and working with local authorities to make every effort to engage parents and local communities about the risk young girls are at" in regards to FGM. The Serious Crime Act 2015 (under the Conservatives) and the Female Genital. Mutilation Act 2003 (under Labour) deals with FGM - it's not a non-issue and more work needs to be done but the UK is not an FGM safe haven either.Q&amp;A highlights (it was boring)-

*After the first question, there was a silence and nobody else had anything to ask. Dave had to beg for questions.

*Dave criticised Trump's "best and brightest" comments(!) and praised Mexican immigrants(!)

*Dave described Richard Spencer as "odious".

*Dave discussed an experience at UCLA with Milo and repeatedly told everyone that this was before Milo "imploded".

*The panel discussed the prospect of civil wars in Canada and Europe. Dave went on an uninformed rant about the various 'failings' of EU countries. Onkar Ghate says that Europe is "much more tribal" than America - the mutli-party political systems and frequency of coalition governments across much of Europe proves this wrong.The venue was quite sparsely attended, by the way. A small lecture theatre with quite a few empty seats. Probably around 40 people at most.&gt;Rubin reiterated why he mainly goes after the left: Because they have "all the power".

Considering the fact that the Republicans have all three branches of government, executive, legislative and judiciary, in their hands right now, that is quite a remarkable thing to say.They also control the majority of state governments.Yea, that's what the entire show is about. It's centered around the whole "regressive left" and "SJW" nonsense. There's a whole crew of people who are focused on that issue, and they always appear on Rubin's show: Gad Saad, Sargon of Akkad, Ben Shapiro, Colin Moriarty, Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris, etc.

I hate to put Sam Harris in that group, because I generally like him and he does talk about other stuff too, but it seems like that's been his focus for the past couple of years too.You're right, that too ...&gt; Then the Peterson and Weinstein scandals broke and they saw how much they could capitalise on the anti-PC/SJW shtick and that’s all it’s been ever since.

This hits on something else that amuses me when it comes to this crowd. Seems like they largely become defined by whatever SJW antics brought them onto the national scene. 

Do the James Damores of the world really think they're going to major influencers of our society by bitching about how they got fired from Google that one time, 10 years ago? Seems to me the #BattleofIdeas will just devolve into a bunch of these people telling their stories of SJW oppression around the campfire, welcoming whoever else may be "oppressed" in the future.Haha, I was thinking of her too, but I haven't followed how much she's held on to that moniker.

I agree, too, that at least Weinstein and Peterson seem to have other things going for them. But seriously - you didn't see people at the dawn of the electrical age deciding to spend the weekend with the light switch off. Dave's very notion that what he is doing, simply by putting his phone onto airplane mode for 48 hours, is some sort of noble gesture is virtue signalling of the highest order. 

It's not clever to cut yourself off from such a rich and valid source of information and entertainment in the year 2018. I completely understand people who take social media breaks because of their mental health - that's 100% valid. But there's nothing virtuous about being a anti-intellectual Luddite.*Title should say proposed and not passed - but the narrative as it applies to Rubin still stands. Hopefully the bills are defeated. Remember, [Dave Rubin is supposedly a supporter of free speech and he can't think of anything to condemn the right for.](https://twitter.com/classiclib3ral/status/952171190298251266?lang=en)Dinesh D'Souza is an intellectual huckster whose positions today are rightly scorned, [even by those on the right.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/opinion/sunday/conservatism-jeff-flake-dsouza.html)  

Otherwise I'm not sure what point you're trying to make in the first sentence; African Americans tranisitoned to the Democrats in the 30s because of the social democratic benefits of the New Deal (that is, left-wing economics) though they were still distrusting of FDR for his general lack of support for civil rights. This, of course, changed when LBJ supported the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s and solidified support for the Democrats.

&gt;A lot of black people polled actually like Trump because he's a successful businessman. I've also noticed that there's quite a lot of overlap with conservative values (2nd amendment, family values, business / free markets) and the black community.

Citations needed. [The African American community in the US continues to poll in belief that Trump is a racist who prefers whites to blacks.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/12/09/nearly-9-in-10-black-americans-think-trump-respects-people-of-color-less-than-whites/?utm_term=.0adb2900ad55) Your comment here about support for free markets also contravenes your point in the first sentence about the benefits of the New Deal (that is government intervention in the markets) garnering support with African Americans.It's almost as if, and hear me out on this, Republicans/conservatives aren't acting in good faith when they are decrying identity politics, they are decrying the kinds of identity politics they hate. 

Check out this study: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12485

&gt; [W]e find that this effect is more powerful among Republicans than among Democrats, due to the general social homogeneity of the Republican party. Contrary to the assessments of modern political punditry, Republicans are more susceptible to identity‐based politics.
It's funny. She's not a conservative, and her audience isn't even black in all likelihood

....It's almost like it's all an act, or something. The fairy tale is more black people voted for trump than they did for [Republicans who ran against Obama], therefore, people like candace are leading the charge(!) of this outpouring of black support for Republicans. 

She's working this angle very competently if you ask me. Better than most women in the WWE would, anyways. Wish I could see this Tweet, but Rubin blocked me for pointing out his hypocrisy in a civilized manner.I don't put Sam in the same category as Rubin. I think Sam is sincere, but wrong. Dave is just a paid shill who willfully shills for the right.I would LOVE Kanye to turn around and tweet "Changed my mind about Candace Owens", if only to see the extreme back-pedalling from the New Centre.The hypocrisy of right-wing shills like Dave Rubin when they tell celebrities to shutup with someone they disagree with and then readily embrace celebrities who express an opinion they agree with shows just how desperate they are for cultural capital. 

He doesn't just do that on Twitter. It's all he does everywhere he goes.A lot of conservatives have tried to make the argument that Trump did well among African Americans because he got a higher percentage of them than Republicans in 2008 or 2012. A couple of problems with that analysis:

1. the Democratic candidate in 2008 and 2012 was black, so he naturally did better among African Americans

2. Hillary still got 89% of the black vote, which is really fucking good.It's because Dave has a victim mentality and feels like he's constantly being persecuted for being a conservative. All he ever talks about is how "the left" is attacking conservatives.

Oh but he hates identity politics.Is he just really struggling to book fresh faces at this point or...?Come on, Gorka called it a "probing" interview! I'm sure Rubin jokingly asked him if he's a racist, Gorka said no, and then they both laughed and talked about black on black crime and mentally ill liberals for an hour!Why would you have this guy on? If you've seen him on CNN, you've heard all he has to say. He's a Trump man.Because Dave Rubin is a Trump man himself.I would have to disagree. Dave Rubin literally said he would vote for Donald Trump over not just Bernie Sanders \(whom he agreed with on EVERYTHING about 2 years ago\) and Elizabeth Warren, but even over a mainstream California liberal like Gavin Newsom. He also hasn't found any reason to criticize him more than a year into his disastrous presidency. How is Rubin not a Trump man?Isn't he connected to fuckin' Jobbik? One thing is to give interview handjobs to boring republican talking heads and completely another is to give interview handjobs to authoritarian ethno-nationalists from Hungary whose party just few years ago denied holocaust as jewish hoax. Ironically they're better now than Fidesz now, but that's just because Fidesz is simularly racist AND extremely corrupt at the same time.

This made me legitimately angry. What a fuckin' tool Rubin is. Giving him enough rope for sure. Giving 'em enough rope for them to hang their enemies by normalizing them in the US media landscape!So, despite her record of appalling comments, Candace Owens is not anti-LGBT because she's been for food at Dave's house.

Who knew that a short chingwag over a tasteless brunch with Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Producer-Husband could absolve anyone and everyone of their sins! 🙄Dave, if your arsehole guests aren't far-right then who the fuck is!?He doesn't actively advocate for Trump. He makes pointed comments against the president.Oh, come on, he's at least dogwhistling his support (if literally coming out saying he'd vote for him in the next election can still be called dogwhistling?) 
Show me where he criticized Trump on any of the issues he's supposedly passionate about - free speech, freedom of the press, having civil dialogues, etc. Or on all the rest, his appalling racism and misogyny, etc. How has Trump violated free speech, freedom of press, or having civil dialogues so far?The last part of the question must be a joke. Ever read his Twitter? Seen him mock a disabled reporter \(doesn't matter how often Breitbart "debunks" that\)? Disparage a gold star familyy? Call a federal judge biased because of his "Mexican heritage"? Insult his way to the top of the Republican primary? Joke about sexually assaulting women for fun? Retweet a British neonazi group? Refer to a female reporter as a "bimbo" with "blood coming out of her wherever"? Even a Trump supporter should concede that "having civil dialogues" is not his strength.   

Freedom of speech? Well, he wants football players to be fired for taking the knee for one thing. I know, a private company is allowed to do that, but the same thing is true for 90&amp;#37; of the cases Dave Rubin and the free speech warriors whine about.  

The [Committee to Project Journalists \(CPJ\)](https://cpj.org/blog/2018/01/press-oppressor-awards-trump-fake-news-fakies.php) has named DT the "world’s most oppressive leader towards press freedom" when he announced his fake news awards – in an of itself pretty problematic if the President of the United States paints the entire press as an evil enemy, "Lügenpresse", don't you think?LMAO!! The timing of saying this right after he and his gang have jizzed their pants over Kanye all week. XDGood of Dave to have another "moderate" voice on his show...The hearing on Capitol Hill was an unmitigated disaster to such an extent that most members of the committee left before it was over (lol).

Your tax dollars at work to entertain these clowns.

Relevant cause Dave is always bitching about it but we know he’s a huckster.Ah yes. The guy who is a member of a Hungarian Nazi organization and literally [wore their uniform and medals to Trump's inaugural ball.](https://lobelog.com/wp-content/uploads/gorka1-620x350.png) Way to go, Dave!Anyone catch Dave trying to float the idea that California may be able to flip red in 2018 or 2020? Lmao, FOH clown.I do hear you, but you're leaving out a HUGE part of his thesis - the greatly exaggerated outrage culture in the US. This creates a massive double standard.

If those on the Left speak out against someone/something, it's "virtue signaling". If someone on the Left is *criticized*, it's simply free speech flowing both ways.

For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvXtuxFBkCkEspecially considering this is was a hand-picked bit out of his whole routine. Lol, imagine the lowlights..Dave won't say anything because the Kochs fund Learn Liberty which is in partnership with Rubin Report. 

The utter hypocrisy of Dave Rubin is not surprising but it is shocking he continues to advertise himself as a neutral commentator when in reality he's a right\-wing shill. It's pretty clear at this point that Dave isn't even a true libertarian though - at least in the issues he focuses on. Most true libertarians are anti-war, generally pro-immigration, and against government overreach in things like surveillance/civil liberties. 

Yet to the extent Dave focuses on the issues above, it's always from the point of view of a right-wing culture warrior who makes apologetics for the Trump admin. He almost never talks about substantive policy issues that actual libertarians might even be concerned with - at this point it's pretty much all "culture war" stuff from an unabashedly right wing perspective.

The extent to which his "political analysis" (if you can even call it that) is divorced from any discussion of policy detail or even actual news events is actually pretty remarkable. It's just building up the exact same SJW strawman and then knocking it down over and over and over and over and over and over again.A liberal back before the Civil Rights act.Checked out your post history. 

There’s help out there man. Get to the hospital so you can see a psychiatrist.Yep. But when you ask him why he never holds the feet of his conservative guests to the fire, he says that the purpose of his show is to just give people a platform to express their ideas, not to debate with them.

Classic Dave...A little while ago, he said there would be a big time guest on in May.

My guess: DJT.. Jr! 

He had him on his Sirius show back in the day and I believe he's mentioned him on Twitter a time or two.You were way too kind to him, Joe.Roseanne Barr, Kanye West, Candace Owens, David Duke...I agree with a lot of what you wrote, but I feel like you're giving him way too much benefit of the doubt. For example, you wrote that part of you "wonders if Rubin’s affiliation with the right has begun to influence him." I think you already know the answer to that, Joe. You are a smart guy. You also said, "I think Rubin is an honest guy, but even honest people can have some blind spots that overtake them."

Dave is not some naive guy who just doesn't know what he's doing. He is willfully pandering to conservatives, because that's his audience, and that's who sponsors and supports his show. Look at which of his videos get the most views. Look at which conservative think tanks line up most of his interviews and speaking gigs. Look at his hypocritical Tweets on a daily basis.

Either Dave is *incredibly* stupid and unaware, or he's a bad actor who is willfully pandering to a conservative audience every single time he Tweets or makes a YouTube video. Those are the two options, and I think you'd agree with me that the former is very unlikely.I think Dave is too smart to be this hypocritical and uninformed, but maybe that's just *me* giving him the benefit of the doubt when I shouldn't. Maybe he really *has* just turned into the average conservative. I think that's unlikely, but it's possible. I appreciate the response.I'll add also that it really isn't just that he's had an ideological shift from left to right. If that was the case, I may disagree with him but I'd still have some respect for him as being open about his change of convictions. 

It's more that he's become so much more vapid and so much more focused on trivial issues. In the past he didn't clearly intentially avoid the whole news cycle except for what fits his agenda, in the past he seemed actually concerned about substantive issues (listen to his commentary on campaign finance in his early shows, for instance). Now his entire show for the most part is focused on "culture war" issues. When his guests try to actually bring up something substantive, he usually goes back to those issues. Sad all around....Generally speaking, the people who comment on YouTube videos are the dumbest people walking the face of the earth. Even dumber than people on Twitter. Go to *any* YouTube video, and you'll notice this phenomenon. It's not just a Dave Rubin thing.Because right-wingers tend to spend hours and hours a day watching bullshit on YouTube about conspiracy theories.She's a perfect match for TPUSA. Bumper sticker politicin' ALL DAY!!! lolShit article from the one track Weiss but she dunks on Dave, which is nice.&gt;But people who pride themselves on pursuing the truth and telling it plainly should be capable of applying these labels when they’re deserved. It seems to me that if you are willing to sit across from an Alex Jones or Mike Cernovich and take him seriously, there’s a high probability that you’re either **cynical or stupid**. If there’s a reason for shorting the I.D.W., it’s the inability of certain members to see this as a fatal error.

.

&gt;But is a statement of principles necessary to make a judgment call about people like Mr. Cernovich, Mr. Molyneux and Mr. Yiannopoulos? Mr. Rubin has hosted all three on his show. And he appeared on a typically unhinged episode of Mr. Jones’s radio show, “Infowars.”Adding on to above...

And similarly, Bernie Sanders has also come out multiple times against campus protests trying to disinvite speakers. Read below:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/04/23/bernie-sanders-defends-ann-coulters-right-to-speak/

This is the full quote from Sanders:

"I don't like this. I don't like it," Sanders told The Huffington Post after speaking at a rally . . .  "Obviously Ann Coulter's outrageous ― to my mind, off the wall. But you know, people have a right to give their two cents-worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation." . . .

"To me, it's a sign of intellectual weakness," he said. "If you can't ask Ann Coulter in a polite way questions which expose the weakness of her arguments, if all you can do is boo, or shut her down, or prevent her from coming, what does that tell the world?"

"What are you afraid of ― her ideas? Ask her the hard questions," he concluded. "Confront her intellectually. Booing people down, or intimidating people, or shutting down events, I don't think that that works in any way."

Contrast this with Donald Trump - who has called for NFL players to be fired over protests, who has wanted to open up libel laws for years, who sued Bill Maher for joking about him, who argued against Pamela Geller's Muhammad cartoon contest (you'd think that would be a red line for Rubin). The reality is that there is not a single elected official in the Democratic Party who has shown even one tenth the hostility to free speech that Trump has repeatedly and on many occasions. For Rubin to support Trump over people like Warren and Sanders on free speech grounds, while he claims to be a "free speech absolutist", is beyond ludicrous

No. Dave Rubin only cares about free speech when it's "leftists" protesting outside a Milo Yiannopolous event, not when the actual US President is punishing the press for writing negative stories about him.

Obviously, this is in line with what our founders were thinking when they came up with the First Amendment.Another point on this issue that I think goes a long way towards explaining why it's stressed so much by the right-wing media machine- 

There's a huge asymmetry in the weight of this issue for left and right. In my experience the typical left wing view on this is not hostility to free speech - it's more like "whatever....Milo or Anne Coulter (or whoever it might be) is an idiot, let's talk about something that actually matters, like climate change or health care or criminal justice reform or foreign policy or college costs". Bernie Sanders isn't going to place huge focus on this issue because he (rightly) recognizes that it's ultimately a sideshow and a distraction from issues that actually have a huge impact on most people's lives.

Whereas the right treats the disinvitaiton of someone like Milo as evidence of the collapse of Western civilization. That's why someone like Milo being protested or disinvited makes headlines, while someone like Ana Kasparian or Chelsea Manning or Noam Chomsky being disinvited doesn't. The left has bigger fish to fry.but muh free speechAs one commenter noted, Rubin is a public figure and alt\-right is a fairly vague term. He has no legal case, but it's telling that Rubin defaults to wanting to use the government to silence critics.I would say he's a moderate conservative (at best).these people make dave rubin look good lolthey make rubin look good"I have an array of guests on my show: Ben Shapiro, Thomas Sowell and Jordan Peterson." AKA three conservatives.

LMFAO, get Seder on you fucking hack.Look at how fickle this fucker is 

"I proposed a curious hypothesis"

No, Dave, when you [stated it it was in the affirmative](https://twitter.com/thejd800/status/989201588630708224). A rather confident sounding assertion. He gets called out on it so he backs off. This guy has absolutely no conviction cause he has no backbone intellect to stand on.Dude (or gal), just stop. Collectivism isn't just people joining a movement, it's a comprehensive political framework. Not that Dave Rubin would know anything about this, but your attacks at him sound desperate.Public universities are "state actors" (aka the government) for the purposes of constitutional rights. Welcome to the not-so-exclusive club, brotha! There are a lot of us.If anything he kind of bought his PHD lol. Read up on it. He used donation funding from his book to schmooze the university into getting into the program and then he essentially did as little fucking work as possible Is this the same Rubin that said he would vote Trump over Warren has said Trump's presidency was "basically fine" and couldn't name a single thing wrong with the right other than "maybe being a bit too religious"?It won't be "off the grid." That's reserved for times when he really wants to avoid addressing something big in the news, like when his BFF Milo got in trouble for defending pedophilia.What have been his justifications for them? I'm sure they'll piss me off but I still want to hear what they are regardless.Hahaha oh god, has this mainly been happening on his twitter page then?Oh right, ty!Every time Rubin's voice becomes vocal fry.I savoured every bit of this article with some savage glee. It was like an explosion of endorphins in my brain. So glad that finally someone heard us, Anthony Fisher from The Daily Beast is a legend!!How does the writer ‘intentionally misunderstand’ it? They refer specifically to Peterson describing allegories and then merely present what he said with minimal commentary. Where’s this misunderstanding? Where does the writer ever imply Peterson was speaking literally?A: No it doesn’t, it’s just a fun jab at his rambling. Only a child would think it was meant to sound like an actual quote of his.

B: The author clearly mentions ‘biblical allegories’ and then makes no comment at all on Peterson’s use of the term ‘categories’. We don’t know whether Peterson explained these categories elsewhere in that conversation but there’s no reason to assume the author intentionally left this out if he did.

C: Where are these commentary points you refer to? If you mean elsewhere in the media you can hardly blame the NYT author for that.A: It’s clearly a joke though. It doesn’t imply he thought witches were real it just makes fun of him for his coiled conviction over fairy tale characters. If the author wanted to imply he believed in witches don’t you think they’d make a bigger deal of it e.g. “...and he also believes in witches, apparently...”

B: But they don’t inaccurately describe him. All the writer says is:

&gt;Mr. Peterson illustrates his arguments with copious references to ancient myths  - bringing stories of witches, biblical allegories and ancient traditions. I ask him why these old stories should guide us today

And that’s it. The author moves on. If Peterson explained other key details and they were left out why hasn’t he exposed this on Twitter?

C: But how has the author framed this particular quote wrong? You still haven’t proved this. And again, why should the author be held accountable for other people’s interpretations when it’s up to Peterson himself to clarify the meaning of his words. “Be precise in your speech” and all that.A: A serious piece isn't allowed to have flourishes of humour? Do you seriously think "why won’t these wives and witches just behave" is meant to be taken completely seriously? Look I'm Aspergers but even I'd never fail to comprehend a joke or assume literalism in a piece of hyperbole this fucking badly.

B: Where does she actually fail to summarise what he's saying though? She certainly doesn't do it in the section we're discussing for the reasons I've already pointed out. Where does she actually make an inaccurate commentary that would make anyone think Peterson has a literal belief in the supernatural? Nowhere, nowhere at all.

C: But you haven't proven it. We can both look at the exact wording of that section of the article and none of the text whatsoever supports your accusation. If she left out anything, again why hasn't Peterson exposed this?It's not in quotation marks or in anyway attributed to him. It's perfectly clear that the author is just making a snide remark about his worldview and referencing the absurdity of the witch anecdote as part of it. This sort of subtitle is unmissably common in media, especially doing so with some kind of pun or wordplay. It'd be like if [this Empire magazine cover](https://comicsflix.org/2017/09/12/july-1990-big-shot-dick-tracy/) literally meant that Madonna and Warren Beatty talked about turning the character of Dick Tracy into a man. It's not supposed to be taken literally, it's clearly just a punchy joke to set the tone for an article. You'd really have to be monumentally stupid or socially deficient not to understand this.

What you're giving me is just your own interpretation of what Peterson said, as the author gave her own. It doesn't mean she misrepresented him in anyway it only means you're more partial to what JBP said than she is and gave it a more charitable reading. Is the author not allowed to interpret Peterson's typically vague words at all unless she literally takes his meaning exactly as you do?

The retweets I've seen him do have been to shit like Ben Shapiro's response article (and he accuses the NYT reporter of writing a fucking hit piece...). These don't prove Peterson's been taken out of context they just have separate interpretations of JBP's highly ambiguous language.

Again how is it dishonest though? And if people think Peterson literally believes in those things what has the author actually said that made them think that?&gt;The indication that he said that is from the fact that she wrote “he said”.

But it's from her perspective. "He says there's a masculinity in crisis" is her describing Peterson. "Why won’t women — all these wives and witches — just behave?" is clearly just following on from that.

&gt;To your example, if that article would’ve said “Madonna and Warren Beatty said that Dick Tracy has problems. let’s make him into a man! Then yes, I would think that they literally said that or something like it. The headline in your example is describing the authors feeling about the movie’s scope, not their conversations.

That's a terrible hypothetical because it's not like something any author or editor would write. A better one would be "Madonna and Warren Beatty say they're bringing Dick Tracy back. If you didn't think he work in the 1990s, think again!" You see no-one would assume the rhetorical question following the first sentence is meant to be coming from the people mentioned. It's clearly an editor's addition.

&gt;He has talked about these subjects a lot, and they have recurring points that he talks about when he does, which is why I know when there is a big hole in the conversation

I've seen him in plenty of interviews where he failed to do this. That was the problem with the Matt Dillahunty debate. Dillahunty was never sure whether Peterson was talking about a literal or metaphoric God and thus he rebutted Peterson purely on a literal, scientific basis of the existence of a deity. I know myself from consuming other Peterson statements that he only believes in a figurative God so I knew where he was coming from, but he failed to make this clear to Dillahunty and thus came off as a literal theist. I have absolutely no reason to believe he explained any of these allegorical elements to the NYT author. The author likely hadn't read as much as either of us had and thus could only interpret Peterson on the face-value of his arguments, as everybody else reading the article will.

Even if Peterson was taken out of context, again, why hasn't he pointed this out?

&gt;If I write an article about you titled “The arbiter of the autism spectrum” and it was subtitled “he says that he has asbergers and he can see humor. Why won’t these fucking autistic people stop whining and learn to take a fucking joke?” Would you describe that as a fair representation of what you have said or what you think?

But these aren't even comparable. Peterson's argument is critical of feminism and female independence so the subtitles criticism makes sense. I'd have to be at least somewhat critical of the sensitivity of Asbergers people for this to make sense. My comment to you before wasn't like this at all (nor would I ever say something like this). I assumed you weren't on the autism spectrum and made the joke that even me, the clinically emotionally impaired one, could see the humour here that you couldn't.Why is it her job to speak for Peterson? I have friends who write stories for online publications and they never spend exhaustive amounts of time trying to clarify the statements of their interviewees in comment sections.No, she's essentially the British version of Ann Coulter. Few points.

1. The NYT should retract this and apologize.

2. Jordan Peterson should be more careful when using terms that are not in sync with the common parlance of the phrase.

3. /r/JordanPeterson sucks and they shouldn't jump to automatic conclussion that it was leftist media trying to silence their daddy. I can't even google that term anywhere besides JBP response, so it's more likely this was an honest mistake and not a deliberate attempt to smear him. If you use an obscure academic terms that I can't even find online, this tends to happen.I think it's probable that she thought there was none and thought that enforced marriage means:

enforce: **compel obedience to, to impose (a course of action) upon a person, to support (a demand, claim, etc.) by force, to impress or urge (an argument, contention, etc.) forcibly; lay stress upon.**

and monogamy, which leads to a conclussion that he wants to force it.

Again, The NYT should apoligaze for making a mistake (every publication makes mistake like this from time to time) and JBP fans should carry on and not take this as a proof that leftists media wants to silence their daddy.I agree with your latter two points but why would NYT need to apologise? The author never took him out of context and only offered her sincere opinion of what he said during their interview. She add a link to Peterson's blog post and say "Peterson has attempted to clarify his comments", but why would she need to do anything beyond that?Why would she assume 'enforced monogamy' meant anything more than what it sounded like? It's not gotcha journalism when you honestly report what you hear an interviewee say without any clarification from that person.Ok, maybe you are right. I am not even sure what the normal procedure is when something like this happens. Whatever is accepted norm should be applied.As I said just add a disclaimer to the article and then just leave it. It's not the author's fault JBP can't be bothered to explain his rambling.The vagueness of this man's sentiments are still disconcerting. I never thought he was talking about the government literally pairing up a man with a woman and Peterson doesn't really have clear cut sentiments as to how he would accomplish furthering monogamous norms.

Monogamy is still quite prominent in the U.S.: [91% are opposed to infidelities and 83% are against polygamy](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/gallup-poll-reveals-ameri_n_3354778.html). Thus we are likely to run into the ceiling effect with regard to socially enforced monogamy. Me suspects he would want to do things like decrease access to abortion, the pill, paid leave, no fault divorces etc. to facilitate further monogamous norms. Offering an early version for review as you describe sounds excusable but why would the journalist need to have sought clarification and a phrase she didn't know was terminology?But he failed to explain it here and that isn't the journalist's fault. If she didn't question him it might have just been because she was letting him speak for himself. She'd clearly already realised Peterson was crazy so why would she be surprised when he said something like that?But again, why can't Peterson just point this out himself if what he said was miscontextualised?The 'innuendo' is just the journalist's opinion, but if there's any suggestive editing why doesn't Peterson point out which parts of the article were like this?If Dave stays on his current trajectory, within 10 years he'll be using the nickname "Skeeter" and working in a coal mine.I have to give him benefit of the doubt and go with what meant in his response.

https://jordanbpeterson.com/uncategorized/on-the-new-york-times-and-enforced-monogamy/

That doesn't change my perception of him, which is entirely negative. I know that he's a reactionary who says a lot of crazy, incomprehensible and indefensible shit. I just have to be intelectually honest.Instead of posting this Rubin might as well have just stabbed me in the back of the head. It would have the same effect.People like Milo, Crowder and Ben Shapiro certainly do deny it or are skeptical on conspiratorial grounds. And beyond the punditry level right now the current Presidential administration is run by climate deniers, most egregiously Donald "climate change is a Chinese hoax" Trump and Scott Pruitt at the EPA.Must be a Koch-brother approved liberal, like I assume Frum must have been.Lol are you not familiar with Dave Rubin?It's not just the current presidential administration. It's also virtually 100% of Republican elected officials in every part of federal, state, and local governments.Of course he says it with his patented shit-eating grin.OK, after reading through the sub a bit more I realise what you're saying. Hrm... so, have I entered some sort of meta circlejerk with this post by accident or something? 

It was a genuine post, fwiw. Honestly, why even tune in? I won't. You already know exactly what they're going to talk about the whole time, which is the same thing Rubin spends every waking second talking about.I don't know. Joe rarely calls out his guests, and he seems to be on the whole "regressive left" wagon, so I'm guessing they'll talk about that the whole time.

Dave will also probably try to act a little less hardcore conservative when he's on Rogan's show than he does on Twitter and his own show, just like every other conservative does when they come on Rogan's show (Shapiro, etc.).I disagree with you on Abby Martin, but it sounds like we generally agree on Rubin.And yet he doesn't find it a problem the right wing all deny it?I'm not making that claim at all. But it seems so foolish to me that those people were aware of the cataclysmic danger posed to us by climate change and decided it was worth voting for a denier in spite of this. If Trump was still as awful as he was but was pro-climate action, and was running against a candidate who was a climate denier, honestly in that circumstance I would vote Trump. That's how important I think this issue is.Which assumption are you even talking about? It's not a disputable fact that almost all Republican politicians deny climate change, and that their voters keep supporting them in spite of this.Yes and that's a terrible flaw within the Democratic party, thus I support people like Sanders and Warren, but it's not even at the same level as climate change denial. Corporate corruption is terrible, but climate change denial is flat out unforgivable to me.You're missing the point still. Rubin was asked whether he has any problems with the right and couldn't name one, and yet you've just explicitly pointed out that many Republicans might be voting for their party's politicians in spite of their views on the climate, implying they *do* think it's a problem. So why shouldn't you be irritated Rubin didn't mention this as an issue he had?This sub's been occupied by an anti-Rubin resistance who are trying to hold him accountable for how he's enabling the far-right. Just so I don't get labelled a 'hater' or some bullshit, I was actually largely on Rubin's side when he left The Young Turks. If he'd tried to be a more honest voice from the Left he could've really accomplished something, but now he's just a shill paid by the Republican owned Learn Liberty organisation who does nothing but amplify the voices of truly despicable people like Milo Yiannopoulos, Stefan Molyneux, Lauren Southern and countless others.Sam Seder's been trying to get on Rubin's show for ages, and many many people have suggested he have on Natalie Wynn from ContraPoints, but Rubin's clearly not interested since both are leftists who have been very critical of him. I doubt he'd be a good enough debater to defend himself from them if they ever came on.&gt; good example on harris was his podcast last month with ezra klein

I actually thought that was a good episode. I know some people claim klein was playing politics etc etc, whilst harris was mr rational, but I felt there were some reasonable points. As well as some genuine points of disagreement. &gt; I don’t get why folks care about his opinion

Because he's in the position to be able to influence certain narratives, which puts him in the hot seat instantly I guess. 

I'm not sure why you'd fuss about people making a fuss either. If you look at it that way, it seems a bit silly. 

Of course people can choose what they want to follow and listen to, but it's reasonable to want those who do have platforms to use them wisely, and to be as consistent as possible. Criticism, if reasonable, can filter through and help people realise they might be distorting / misrepresenting things or whatever. It's pretty fair, and a pretty integral aspect of western society.   Yeah, for the most part I agree. But when someone makes a large part of their "thing" about open discussion / challenging ideas and such it can seem a bit disingenuous if they constantly have people talking along similar lines to themselves. 

So it doesn't have to be a full debate or whatever, just people who aren't along the same lines as him. 

Most others seem to share this opinion though - I hadn't read through the sub before making this postSadly, as I believe you’ll begin to see (if you haven’t already.. seems like you’re onto him), this is one of his major hypocrisies. If the Right does something like this, it’s TECHNICALLY not a free speech violation... If however, a private university like DePaul bans Ben Shapiro, he rails against this (rightfully so, imo) as violating the spirit of free speech and another example of the Left shutting down debate. You can either advocate one principle or the other, not both.But when Twitter (a private company) bans Milo, or Google (a private company) fires James Damore, it's a free speech crisis.As others have said, if Dave were consistent this same argument would invalidate his objections to anyone being banned from Twitter, Google's decision to fire James Damore, university deplatforming, and YouTube demonetization. In other words it would invalidate almost every one of his pet "free speech" issues.This is nothing new - there have been many left wing speakers who have been disinvited from campuses for various reasons - Ana Kasparian, Chelsea Manning, Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker, Norman Finkelstein, and of course Sarsour are some just off the top of my head. A lot of time it is for their pro-Palestinian activism or comments. 

Of course we never hear anything from Rubin or the so-called "IDW" about any of this. They totally ignore it. Then someone like Milo or Anne Coulter is protested (usually not even deplatformed) and it's the new moral cause of our time and evidence of the fall of Western Civilization. Hypocrisy is the rule, not the exception.You should Tweet this out to Dave. It'll be an easy way to get blocked, assuming you aren't already blocked.Same here. I have two accounts, and both got blocked immediately. I've never seen anyone who blocks as quickly and often as the Free Speech Warrior.The NBA didn't institute a new rule specifically to stop players from kneeling as a form of protest. They've always had a rule requiring players to stand during the anthem, and it's got nothing to do with stopping protests.

Also, it's not like a single NBA player has ever expressed any desire to kneel during the anthem. If they did, and the NBA stopped them, then you can be sure that there would be a backlash against the NBA.I guess it just comes down to whether or not you want to trust Dave Rubin's side of the story, considering what a dishonest opportunist he's shown himself to be over the past couple of years. Personally, it seems unlikely to me that everyone at TYT would suddenly shun Dave because he sided with Sam Harris on something. Hosts on that show have disagreements on issues all the time. They still put up with Jimmy Dore for fucks sake.You should ask Dave that on Twitter. It'll probably be the quickest you've ever been blocked in your life.God, Dave is so dumb.. 

Mr. Free Speech/Anti\-PC Culture, tell me: What could be more PC than the President telling Americans the POLITICALLY CORRECT methods of protesting in the US? First, the flag burning, then I believe he said something to the effect of "kneeling not ok, but locking arms is all right with me.. do that!" Lmao, anyone remember how it's the *regressive left* that's shutting down civil discourse?&gt; I’d love to see something like “I disagree with Dave because X, which I see this way, and Y, which I see that way, and I don’t see how you could disagree.” Then we can talk, I can give my point of view, and we can talk.
&gt; 

yeah, you didn't watch the clip
I get annoyed by Rogan when he starts talking politics, but it's not like his show is centered around that. It's few and far between. Also, Rogan at least comes across as being sincere, even if uninformed.As expected, Dave is playing it up as though Roseanne was fired for being right-wing. She got fired for being a racist conspiracy theorist.Honestly, Jimmy Dore is almost as insufferable as Rubin.Lmao, his "analysis" sounds like a teacher going over freedom of speech with a bunch of 5th graders.Not to mention the common defense: if there's a business banning service to customers based on racism/bigotry, word will get out and people will boycott it \- market forces in action!

I guess all the whites\-only diners went bankrupt during Jim Crow?..LOL!!!! This truly might be the dumbest thing he's ever put out.If Dave was in Keith's shoes, the libel lawsuit would already be filed! lolWhen he started repeating the same buzzwords over and over again about free speech, big ideas, and the regressive left. I started to realize then that he was a hack who had no idea what he was talking about.I would like Dave Rubin to come on Bill Maher's show only if Sam Seder was also invited.The White House can't handle someone who uses the word "cunt," but they will defend to death our president who bragged about grabbing women by the "pussies?" Okay.

Anyway, I'm sure Dave will harshly condemn this effort by the White House (aka the government) to censor speech..../sIt didn't bother me that he left TYT, but the *way* that he left (publicly trashing TYT) rubbed me the wrong way. Cenk and the others at TYT have always been pretty professional about the whole thing, while Dave has not at all. That alone wasn't enough to make me dislike Dave though.

I initially thought his show had some promise, but it very quickly became obvious that he was just going to be...well, what he's become. A shill for the right-wing. During the first year of his show, he had Milo on at least 3-4x. That alone says a lot about Dave as a person, and that's when I stopped watching. For what legitimate purpose would anyone bring a person like Milo onto their show even once, much less on a regular basis? His other guests were almost always people like Shapiro, Crowder, etc. His entire shtick became the anti-SJW and "regressive left" thing.

But I still didn't hate him. That didn't happen until I learned more recently that he's actually getting paid Koch money, and I learned (from firsthand experience) that Rubin is the most prolific blocker on all of Twitter, which is extremely hypocritical of him.It's interesting that he's only able to empathize with Israelis. "How would you feel if you're an Israeli parent whose kids are at risk??"

Well, Dave, how would you feel if you're a Palestinian parents whose kids just got killed because an IDF airstrike targeted their school? Why can't you empathize with them, just like you empathize with the Israelis?"Freedom is messy, folks!"and when he had the same people on 15 times. Why does Ben Shapiro need to keep on coming on the show to talk about the same things? he will give some really vague answer that isn't actually an answer and then go on about how identity politics and the regressive left are the real threat.People in glass houses...Because they are constantly entrenched in identity politics, despite their purported disgust for identity politics.

"We hate identity politics," they say, right before proceeding to once again rail against the group of people that they label as "the regressive left" or "social justice warriors."No, Dave, Trump is *not* correct about the "double standard." Roseanne got fired for being a fucking racist. Samantha Bee didn't do anything even slightly racist. She just called Ivanka a cunt."I hate identity politics.....now can someone tell me why Lefty's are so dumb???"Bunch of right wing political commentators that all sort of have the same following. There was a piece written in The NewYork Times (I think), that coined the term calling this group 'The Intellectual Darkweb' because for some reason they seem too think that thier ideas are somehow new and revolutionary, and the MSM is doing everything in their power to keep these guys/gals quiet. These people really are something else huh?Yep thats the one! Thanks for linking, I was just to lazy to bother trying to find it.Never seen such a perfect diagram of a circlejerk before.There are certainly plenty of people to the left of center for in the IDW.  being on the left does not proclude.Measuring them by the focus of their critique they are certainly right of center.  The fan base is right of center.  But about half of the IDW members are left of center.  I don't think it is fair to call them right-wing and I am a liberal/progressive who is a fan of the left of center IDW types and find them all and the movement interestinghttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-trade-wars-who-winsYes your right sorry, I should have stated that they did have left of center members, I got lax due to it usually being the right of center members that cause the controversy and carry on about free speech and such. He might be slightly more challenging of his guests than Rubin, but he still plays buddy with them so much he still essentially enables them much as Dave does.Not *as* much.https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gore%27s_LawNo don't get me wrong I appreciate him having people like Martin and Kyle Kulinski on, but when he has people like Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder or ESPECIALLY Stefan Molyneux on and laughs along with some of the disgusting lies they peddle, it's definitely enabling. As far as I'm aware none of his liberal guests have had ideas this grotesque.But that's a terrible strategy when you're having on people who want to promote detestable opinions. If Rogan doesn't challenge Ben Shapiro on his lies and bigotry regarding transgender people then the audience will just accept what he's saying.You'd like to think a self-proclaimed "progressive" like Weinstein would have an ounce of self-reflection about going to DC to support what has become a major right-wing conservative talking point...

This isn't to say that everyone who worries about the excesses of "PC culture" on campuses has to be conservative, just that in the political reality of this moment in time, it's being used to fuel the political success of the right wing. People like Weinstein and Sam Harris, who claim to care about making a better world and claim to be left wingers themselves, seem to be entirely blind to this point&gt;it is not rogans prerogative to challenge his guests , he is not a journalist nor a political commentator, his show is literally a podcast with a guest and talking about themselves/topical issues or something random.

But one where political guests can come on and promote their opinions. If Rogan wanted the show to be more innocent he shouldn't allow people with such questionable opinions on.

&gt;to compare rogans podcast to rubins show is like comparing fox news to the daily show , one is pretending to be a non partisan news organisation which people take seriously and the other is a comedy show looking at the news.

But Jon Stewart would never have allowed his right wing guests to get away with the same sort of shit Rogan does. With the millions of people who do watch his show Rogan has the responsibility of making sure the audience get the other side of the argument. He did that very admirably in this part of the Candace Owens interview, but the more he likes a guest personally the less likely he is to actually do this.I'm on my phone right now so I can't give you an exhaustive list based on either of their appearances, but I'll give you two bookmarks I have for lies both of them have made separately to show you how intellectually dishonest they are about topics which could potentially cause great harm to people.

1. Shapiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWMFKRkhwmo

2. Crowder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEylCS6-hBE&gt;dude its literally a podcast where rogan invites whoever he wants on the show its NOT a political hard hitting serious media outlet its literally a guy in his home talking with people. saying he shouldn't allow certain people on is ridiculous he can have whoever he wants on its his podcast.

But that's the same shit Rubin pulls. "Oh I just want to have a relaxed one-on-one with a guest and let them say what they want". Well if you're having people with such gross opinions on you should have more responsibility than that. Either you do some nice talk show with some inoffensive celebrity guests where everything's just hunky dory, or you let on political pundits with provocative opinions on and you try and challenge those opinions. You can't combine the first format with the latter kind of guests.

&gt;you have completely not understood my point with the fox news daily show comparison. but i think you shoudl correct your sentence with "guests" and not "right wing" guests as this assumes he wont challenge his non right wing guests which is exactly the partisanship you seem to be arguing rogan not to employ

Oh I'd fully want him to challenge all his political guests, but Kyle Kulinski isn't denying the civil rights of transgender people like Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder.

&gt;he is also not an expert in politics and so therefore he cannot give the "other side" without appearing to have no idea what hes talking about something which his viewers rip him on ALL the time

Yeah it is a problem, and hence he's clearly not fit to have on guests who can walk all over him like that.

I won't respond to the last point since I'd only be repeating my same arguments again, which I imagine I'll just have to keep doing in any subsequent responses anyway.Perfect! hahaIt's an article about Gore's Law which it defines as:

&gt;"As an online climate change debate grows longer, the probability that denier arguments will descend into attacks on Al Gore approaches"Another gem from the intellectual dark web.It took me a week.   I am not a Rubin fan per se but I find his growing phenomenon very interesting.  I am generally a fan of the IDW movement and find that all very interesting.  I am interesting in measuring these things.Has he ever read Breitbart, InfoWars or Crowder's site? He can't just pin this sort of smear headline on publications from the side he doesn't like.From the vid with Rogan I found out Owen and Shapiro are kind of feuding.  What side are Rubin fans taking? What do you thinkI haven't made it through the whole thing. What's their beef together? Is it maybe that even Shapiro can see she's a grifter?Are you actually claiming that Rubin challenges the views of his right-wing guests?I'm replying to your comment, where you suggested that Rubin is already engaging in the type of journalism described by OP. You asked, "Who said he wasn't." Now you seem to be changing your tune.But you are a Rubin fan?No link to a specific time.Are you a Rubin fan?It was before the last hour. Around the middle maybe I thinkYou a Rogan fan?It started there but it has expanded and gotten worse. Maybe not that bad yet though.I am interested in the divisions and differences among IDW suppoerters and contributers, particularly differences and divisions among the right-of-center IDW base like Rubin fans. I am not interested in stoking divisions.To be fair, it's more like this...

When inviting a conservative. "Hey, I'd love to have you on my show!"

When inviting a liberal. "Hey, I dare you to come on my show and debate _____ issue. Maybe we can even bring on @BenShapiro and [insert another right-winger] to debate with you!"Yea, how the hell did Carlin even end up on this list. I wonder if he even knows he's gotten lumped in with these idiots. Poor Dan.Don't forget Candace Owens, Kanye, and Roseanne!

But seriously though, I'm pretty sure they consider Candace Owens to be part of their posse.Rubin: "*Rule Nr. 4: I won't be a partisan hack etc.* ..." \(2:55\) He doesn't live up to his own rules he set at the beginning of the Rubin Report:

It's an insightful, depressing read.Rogan fan?Is there somewhere on Reddit where Rubin fans will come out? I am not trying to critique them or DaveLOL, yeah, smart people are often spending their time finding ways to hate on something on the internet. I'm sure that's what Bill Gates does, and Elon Musk does, and what Stephen Hawking use to do, go on forums and talk about how bad some stranger they never met are.

So long! Call me when it gets fixed, if it gets fixedHe also supports abortion and trans rights, so he's essentially that one irritating friend everyone has who's 'socially liberal but fiscally conservative'.Except for adding trans identity as a grounds for illegal discrimination, anyway, as we see from the C16 bullshit.Good point.Theoretically, a "classical liberal" is essentially a right-libertarian. In Dave's case, he is just a parrot who repeats whatever the right-wing talking points of the day are.Him responding to people on his Twitter timeline is exactly the same thing as someone who spends their time on an anti-someone forum posting day in and day out.I just find it amusing how people will devote their lives and anonymous accounts (plural) to talking about someone they hate. If he was such an irrelevant idiot why do people spend so much time investing him into their lives?Does Rubin get many supporters in some Republican or conservative sub?  I don't think I want to be in an overwhelmingly  pro-Trump sub.Why do you think this Rubin sub has so few Rubin supporters?He's definitely duplicitous on the issue though.

He claims to be for the civil rights act (but doesn't understand what that entails or means **at all)**,

[https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/875939879175278592](https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/875939879175278592)

&gt;*Rubin: Yes, we should have laws so we’re all treated equally like the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Asking a private company to provide a service they don’t want to is something else. Should a black architect be forced into designing a house for a KKK member?*

https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/962085536616853505

It's just nonsense from him; Neo\-Nazis aren't a protected class, so people can always refuse to serve them, bake a swastika cake or design a house for them. Rubin doesn't get that. Or acts as if he doesn't get it ...

You simply can't have it both way;  if you're for the civil rights act, you have to be against discriminations such as this (in Colorado gays are a protected class).

The civil rights act *means* you're potentially forcing a company to provide a service **to people** they don't want to. Since this baker does provide the service of making wedding cakes generally, he just refused to provide the service to **those people** (who are a protected class in the state of Colorado), you *can* force him to.

You can't force him to bake wedding cakes in general, but if he does provide that service generally, you can force him to not discriminate on whom he provides this service to.

Also funny, to his tweet celebrating the decision (not understanding what the decision was even about) the highest voted reply is:

&gt;No one should be forced to do business with anyone. That precedent would have been a dangerous one to have.


https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1003643974639181824

That *precedent* has already been set, It is literally the law of the land that businesses can be forced to do business with protected classes. Jeez. The misinformation ...Thanks for your time that is very insightful!  So Rubin's base has changed. But hasn't it gotten like 100 times bigger? Why haven't new right-wingy pro-Rubin fans reclaimed his space here.  Are the anti-Rubin's just that much more motivated or whatever?
Well I can see why people that Rubin was going to that Liberal who will #maketheleftgreatagain but obviously that never happened but I think the best way forward is simply to understand why people think a certain way (ie Conservative or pro life) and demonstrate why it's not the right way forward/thinking rather than invite a bunch of right wingers to say what ever they want without anyone challenging them&gt;*Govt shouldn’t be able to force a private business to do a specific service it doesn’t want to*

He doesn't get it. You're not forcing them to do a specific service, you're only forcing them to apply it equally. If you offer a service, you can't discriminate to whom you provide it to, if the discriminated parties are protected classes.

But the baker is free to just not bake *any* wedding cakes, if he so pleases. This wouldn't be discriminatory and therefore completely legal.But when you're having on guests with really questionable views running the gambit from Ben Shapiro's intolerance of trans identities to Stefan Molyneux's open racist pseudoscience, how does it benefit the world in anyway for Rubin to sit back and just let these people talk unchallenged? These guests have YouTube channels and other publicly available work where people can consume their respective opinions, having them come on the Rubin report just to repeat those views without opposition does nothing but platform them to do so.

Rubin is definitely feeding into this same current political tribalisation you and he criticise. He barely has on any left wing guests and generally just uses his interviews to promote right wing opinions he either agrees with, or has minimal issues with.

I don't grant you any of your continuation of this circlejerk. Rubin is an enabler for dangerous people and by giving him these compliments you're merely approving him to continue doing so.&gt;People who think the trans issue is best handled with gender reassignment surgery and with companies should be forced by law to tolerate them should have an open and free platform to say their views largely unchallenged.

No they shouldn't. But Shapiro has his own news site and YouTube channel anyway, what do we benefit from him just repeating this shit on Rubin? An interview like this should be a chance to actually hold a guest to account. Look at how Candace Owens fell apart when her clearly poorly educated view on climate change was challenged by Joe Rogan on his show the other day. That's infinitely more useful than Rubin just sitting back and watching his guest spew whatever the fuck they like for 40 minutes.

&gt;It's a more dangerous road to go down when people start arbitrating which view points are okay and which are not

But it's Rubin's show. He has the same freedom of speech to disinvite a guest as a guest has to speak in their own time. He's under no obligation to let anyone on (hence why he has none of his detractors on like Sam Seder or Natalie Wynn).

&gt;Calling for direct violence is the point at which I will jump onto your ship and say it's dangerous to allow a platform to someone

And not bigotry against trans people (Shapiro), clear racial prejudice (Molyneux), condoning child molestation (Milo Yiannopoulos) or claiming the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax (Alex Jones). Why should monsters like this get an extra platform?

&gt;Short of that, open and free discourse leads to the best bet at reaching the best conclusions

Maybe David should have holocaust denier and proven fraud David Irving on his show then? Clearly if Rubin allows a 'free discourse' and doesn't challenge Irving's lies about the existence of gas chambers then the audience will just know for themselves what their personal conclusion should be. There's no way this could mislead anybody or encourage bigoted sentiments against Jewish people!How much fighting goes on in r/the_donald ???Are the mods of this Rubin sub pro-Rubin? They active here?To a certain extent as long as those ideas are challenged they can be cautiously platformed. But there are many ideas so evil or so disproven there's just no reason to platform them at all. Irving for instance is clearly an antisemite and his arguments have been demonstrably debunked, so to platform him in any form would be a purposeless way to spread his awful ideas.&gt;Yes I agree and I think we can take it a step further, I'd say that hopefully anyone should be allowed to be given a platform and not feel pressured physically to not allow them to speak but we should all be free to judge and criticize openly anyone who gives such a person an unchallenged platform right?

Aside from the 'pressured physically' aspect (since their are certain kinds of legitimate protests that might fall close to this so I wouldn't want to blanket accept this statement) I don't know why anyone would disagree with any of this statement. But that's an issue I have with Rubin and the free speech brigade. You seem to assume this is something liberals *would* take issue with, and therefore by proclaiming 'the right to free speech but also the right to protest' you're just propagating a truism that you seem to take as some kind of wisdom the left has forgotten.

&gt;Like I think that's the best angle of your argument, not that Rubin's giving them a platform but that he's giving controversial and potentially bad ideas a platform without at least holding them under scrutiny because if these controversial ideas are actually legit and good ones they'll hold up to it anyway, theoretically.

Yes, I think you understand it.

&gt;So for instance if Rubin gives a platform to a bunch of dummies and doesn't challenge them my guess is a growing number of people will tune out. I have faith in people that way, I guess because I don't see any other way out of it other than like, trying to legislate against it...which we can certainly both agree is bad?

Well no it's not always clear who's the dummy and who's smart. Ben Shapiro sounds like the smartest guy alive to many people but his opinions on many subjects might be completely eviscerated by people with the right knowledge. An interviewer should challenge any idea that seems dubious or contrarian. I fail to follow your point about legislation though, certainly I'm not pushing for that beyond laws about slander, hate speech and scamming people.

&gt;This is maybe a little off topic but I think it relates, I always felt a similar bad vibe from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart he used his platform as a way to demonize Conservatives which I thought was a total misuse of his power. Like it had the net effect of making people feel like they couldn't even talk to each other because "the other side is evil" I agree people need to be careful of how they use their platform and what the net effect of their media message is so I see your point from my point of view definitely.

But Rubin does this all the time in his interviews, editorials and on Twitter. He's compared progressivism to a 'mental disorder', called completely run-of-the-mill centre-left neo-liberals 'far leftists', and frequently made nasty comments regarding these liberals while [challenging them](https://www.reddit.com/r/daverubin/comments/8jr0cc/back_to_back_tweets_with_good_faith_invites_like/) in very bad faith to come on his show (to be met with his killer debating skills no doubt...).From looking at the thumbnail is that Ed Helms in lipstick?&gt;Terrible legal argument, which is why this case won out 7\-2.

The case wasn't  won on this issue, so you're totally wrong, the baker won the case because the lower court was "mean" to him.

Andrew Seidel, Civil rights &amp; constitutional attorney and former Rubin guest in response to Rubin's cluelessness on Twitter:

&gt;*The Court did not decide that bakeries were being forced to deliver unwanted messages, instead, it decided that one sentence from one commissioner, spoken after the commission had made and written an opinion, was mean to the bakery ... who it had just found to be discriminating.*

&gt;*So yes, the couple was denied a cake. A cake for their wedding. They were not denied because of what the cake would have said, but because of who they were. And today the Supreme Court said, that's cool because some people said some mean things about the baker's bigoted beliefs.*

[https://twitter.com/AndrewLSeidel/status/1003829330290593792](https://twitter.com/AndrewLSeidel/status/1003829330290593792)

Also, it's really weird to say that *"it's a terrible legal argument"*. This *is* the law. It's the civil rights act. Since this is the law, it has to be enacted. If you're against that law you have to propagate to get rid of it. But the supreme court has no option to just disregard that law.

It's policy that you have a problem with, not the "legal" argument, which is completely sound because that is the law in the US what I've just described.Candace believes global warming is a hoax, while Watson, well, [you'll be there a while...](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Paul_Joseph_Watson).Can't tell if sarcasm.Oh good, relieved to hear it haha :)Isn't 41 a little old for that?So she just simply really likes an alt-right conspiracy theorist? Okay, Candace. Thanks for clearing that up.It's my nature and I am a bit new to Reddit. ThanksI just can't fathom how people like Rubin, Milo and Candace Owens etc. will accept that CNN and MSNBC can be dishonest, but at the same time be perfectly fine supporting Fox News, Breitbart, Louder with Crowder or even InfoWars.Remember when Dave claimed he was going to be an advocate for science literacy and the use of science in public policy?Again he and the 'freeze peach' crowd conflate protest with censorship.There's a difference between asking a university to deplatform someone and claiming they want them censored. A university is a privately operated institution, they can choose to give a pulpit to whoever they want but also can decline to give a pulpit to anyone they want. If a student doesn't want a bigot like Ben Shapiro to speak at a college that's different to saying Shapiro shouldn't be allowed a democratic voice in our society, that just means they don't want their university to platform someone with such misinformed and hateful opinions.Well even you admit it would need to be cleared by the administration first, and if it is then the right of the students to protest the decision to allow x person to appear doesn't change.

I disagree on principle with the louder protests with bullhorns and chanting that you refer to but even still it isn't censorship. This may be the only time in my life when I praise Mike Pence but I remember him telling the story of the time he and his family saw *Hamilton* and he mentioned receiving both boos and cheers. He said he told his daughters "that's what democracy sounds like". Heckling is still democratic. One can argue with the appropriateness of it in different contexts but it isn't censorship.But shouting at a person is still heckling. If it gets violent that's wrong, but otherwise the disagreement shouldn't be about this protesting being censorship, it should be whether certain people should in principle be protested, and at what level. Those antifa guys rushing Sargon went too far and made critics of him look bad, but what they did wasn't censorship. In this context it really isn't censorship unless it's institutional. Speaking of institutions someone being cleared to speak by a college is still someone the college is allowing the platforming of, thus the students have a right to process that person being allowed to appear.There were more elements that made that one wrong. I'm fairly sure it didn't happen on a university campus so those guys didn't really have the same right to try and deplatform him, plus they legitimately rushed the stage which I think was an unwarranted act of physical aggression.

But while these sorts of protests do happen more than they should and are wrong, over-zealous university kids are hardly the worst thing going on in the world today, nor are representative of the entire left anymore than picketers at abortion clinics are of the right.

In an age where Scott Pruitt's EPA is actively censoring climate science, there are far more pressing concerns regarding free speech than the college campus bubble.Dave Rubin *hates* identity politics, but every other word out of his mouth is "the regressive left" and "SJWs."You'll have to actually prove it is some kind of 'ideology' and not just highly opinionated teenagers having poor optics. I know the Lindsey Shephard case and while it was totally unfortunate and what happened to her was wrong, it's a totally anecdotal incident that hardly represents some wide ranging global problem. The fact that most universities do regularly let most of Rubin's conservative friends speak and very seldom do they choose not to is proof that this intolerance of controversial opinions is hardly as widespread as the freeze peach crowd makes it out to be.

I'm appalled you don't consider what Pruitt is doing censorship. What his EPA is up to is far closer to authoritarian censorship than anything happening on university campuses right now. There need to be more people on the left who call out those students that occasionally overstep the mark, but they can do this without allying themselves with dubious right wing figures like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson, but I'm confident those kids will mainly just grow up and realise their mistakes. The Democratic Party now is full of baby boomers who likely did shit pretty much comparable to this back in the Vietnam War era and it doesn't show at all. However even spending time on problems like this now is downright suicidal when we have the ticking time bomb of climate change to deal with and the most dangerous organisation in human history in the Republican party currently choosing actively to do nothing about it.&gt;I need to prove to you college students and their professors are breeding an ideology that uses censorship as a debating tool? No problem. Watch the Berkeley debacle that happened when Ann Coulter was invited for a speech. As annoying as she is she is very tame compared to, say Milo Yiannaoplous. Do you even get on YouTube?

No you still need to prove some kind of ideology of censorship exists beyond anecdotes. Also watching YouTube doesn't meant I've watched the exact same videos you have. Ann Coulter might not be as openly provocative as Milo but her rhetoric is just as disgusting (remember her calling Mexico a 'peasant culture'). Students not wanting her to speak is totally reasonable.

&gt;Freeze peach -.- that was cringe. What's truly appalling is that its a joke to you. Free speech got womens rights and black people the right to vote and be seen as equals in the eyes of the law. Clearly free speech should only apply to you and those who you disagree with are shit out of luck cry babies if they are silenced. I'm guessing you werent a fan of Mitch McConnell not allowing Elizabeth Warren to speak on the senate floor? Hmm....

The point of that meme is to make fun of people who use free speech as a blanket, inarticulate defence of obvious stupidity. Not allowing bigots to speak on university campuses in the age of the Internet is not a free speech crisis. I've made clear that I do care about free speech but where it's legitimately being threatened like the EPA under Pruitt. Pro-Palestinian activists in Israel have also been pretty blatantly censored this year and yet you don't find anti-identity politics warriors Rubin, Sam Harris or Ben Shapiro defending them for some strange reason. There are clearly anecdotal incidents like what happened to Lindsay Shepherd or Bret Weinstein that were wrong, but these were still anecdotal and could easily have been addressed within the left without siding with right wing crazies as Weinstein has done with the Intellectual Dark Web.

&gt;The only thing I said about that was it was a different topic for a different discussion. You are trying to deflect from the actual topic. What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything? xD

You have clearly not followed anything I've been saying. I mention Pruitt at the EPA because it is actual, real censorship on an institutional level with legitimately significant consequences unlike this college campus bullshit. If I must explain the Vietnam point again, it is that activists in the 60s and 70s in that era would also frequently pull stunts similar to what students are doing now, and yet when they grew up it didn't inform some sort of anti-free speech ideology, even if they might have been interrupting speeches by military officers using loud chants and musical instruments 50 years earlier.

&gt;I believe there are far worse people on the right than people like Jordan Petersen or Ben Shaprio. You act like its Milo Yinannoplous or Alex Jones we're talking about. Ben Shapiro clearly does not like Trump, he was targeted by the Alt-Right trolls, calling him antisemitic names and mocking his children. Jordan Petersen actually isn't very political too. He talks about ideologies. Both men use facts and statistics when presenting their arguments and not fake shit like Alex Jones would pull out, so what exactly is the problem having a conversation or debate with them?

Peterson has dog whistled some very alarming sexism (to paraphrase: 'how about women stop wearing make-up in the workplace if they don't want to be harassed') and Ben Shapiro has [misrepresented science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWMFKRkhwmo) on gender dysphoria and used his fake facts to push an anti-trans agenda. They're not as rational and reasonable as they try and make themselves out to be. No-one on the left should be cosying up to them. Conversation, maybe, debate, perhaps also, but not making them your allies as part of a movement like the IDW.You're killing brain cells even arguing with these idiots.He's platformed Alex Jones in spite of Jones' disgusting comments like this.Now there's the problem with you guys right there.But plenty of people did see the Jones interview, and it meant Dave legitimised a man who uses his show to spread stories about school shootings and tragic suicides like this one being orchestrated by the government.

I don't need to watch the interview to be angered that Rubin would platform a man as awful as that.

To 'discuss ideas' over a subject would be to try and teach you things which should be fucking obvious; "don't give a pulpit to liars", "don't legitimise shitty people on your side of politics just because they share a lot of your worldview". If these things aren't already clear to you there *is* a problem.But Dave's interviews are always completely complimentary. He always just lets a guest say whatever it is they want to without any pushback. If he consistently challenged them this would be a different story, but as it is all he's doing is giving them a platform so much so that his own presence in the studio is almost completely unrequired. He could literally just ask them questions off camera and film their responses.

To give Alex Jones this kind of interview is to fail to hold him to account for all the awful things he's said. The real greatest interviewer on Earth, Leigh Sales, could absolutely do this, but all Rubin does is legitimise Alex Jones by having him on the same show as guests like Stephen Fry while not adjusting his interview style one bit.

He's platforming them. Either give them a proper challenge through the interview process, or ignore them if that's not your style, but don't just invite guests like Alex Jones if you're just going to give them more attention. That's what platforming is.Then why would Dave need to interview Jones?

If everyone knows he's an idiot, why give him the legitimacy of a serious interview like he did? Especially after knowing Jones' disgusting comments on mass shootings etc.&gt;He never said the left was evil though.

Of course he did. How else to understand this?

&gt;Prager: "*Right now the left is so* ***nihilistic*** *a force in the world, that almost anything supersedes it, there is a* ***level*** *of evil I wouldn't vote for, obviously, even to defeat the left ...."*

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkD\-ex\_Mz6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkD-ex_Mz6M) (3:25)The last time liberals were reasonable they were intervening in Vietnam and trying to covertly overthrow the sovereign government of Cuba thank you very much!Ed Koch: Endorsed George W. Bush for President and Rudy Guiliani for Mayor

Daniel Patrick Monyihan: Senior Advisor to Richard fucking Nixon.

Those are some bleeding heart liberals right thereI don't know if he's commented on it since Trump came into office, but [he commented on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuumO0xjKOg&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbC_wB8rAiwZfbUr8SISsYd5) in 2014, claiming then that the FCC (under Obama) killed net neutrality. Whatever that means...Initially I was going to engage politely with this comment, but black-on-white racism? Are you kidding me?do people watch Rogan for legitimate political commentary? I always just tune in for the jokes i assumed others did aswellI don't think we want her tbh.I totally agree with D. He seems pretty self aware at how stupid the idea of the IDW is By choosing inexplicably to attack #MeToo like this, I'm pretty sure Owens has pretty much just outed herself at this point as a contrarian more than anything. "If the left supports a thing I must hate it!"I think you should re-listen to the entire interview. Joe actually challenges what Rubin has to say a number of times like when they talk about government regulations, Candace Owens, Jordan Peterson, Anthony Bourdain. I think the reason for this is that Rogan is a conversationalist and likes to talk about specific stories/events in the news. Despite the fact that they are both part of the IDW, Rubin is not like this at all. He says so over and over again with his asinine "I like to talk about ideas..." bullshit. You can tell in this interview when Rogan asks him about specific things Rubin falls flat on his face because he has absolutely no fucking clue what he's talking about. Its what you get for hosting a show where the only topic of conversation is " i left the left because of their PC identity politics on college campus and also Trump/the GOP/the right is actually ok because they believe in the individual and the left wants to control you"If you actually watch this video, he really does get humiliated. He tries to bash the USPS and when he goes into the story about his chickens he basically says "The chickens were born on Monday in Cleveland and then they were at my door on Tuesday. Which i guess is an example of the uSPS doing something good." That is fucking embarrassing when its the first example that comes to his head after he said the government does nothing right and the USPS is hopelessly backwards. He literally could have said anything else to prove his point and instead he goes for "this one time the USPS was actually really great"Ok first off, this is not my video. Calm down, i'm just sharing it. Secondly, you can spin it whatever way you want but i think the title is pretty accurate. Yes, it's true that Rubin tripped over himself here but he only did so because Rogan pushed him into the corner. 

Anyway, your criticism is just as vague and vapid as Rubin himself. Who cares what the fucking video is titled. That's such a "i believe in ideas..." criticism that if Rubin read this he would cream his pants and look to have you on his show. You literally have no proper response to this arguments against his stupid small government/USPS take because you're so hung up on fantasising about the members of the IDW jerking each other off and being best friends forever. Stand up straight and go clean your bedroomThere's a very simple solution to that, Joe.Lol i hope they are able to surgically remove your nose from Rubin's arse. We're treating Rubin with the exact same amount of respect he has for anyone broadly disagrees with his "PC college liberal neo-Marxist post-modernists are using identity politics to destroy Western Civilisation" crap. 

I really don't know what to say to you if you think this sub doesn't like Rubin because he tries to make cross political alliances. That requires an unhealthy amount of naivety or ignorance. We don't like him because he's a vapid, opportunistic and one-dimensional, Koch brother funded political hack."I would vote for Trump in 2020 if he was against Warren, Booker or Sanders"


"Leftists like to cheat at games because they look for shortcuts and handouts at life"


"Jesus was really kind to Muslims"


"Martin Luther King Jr. would have been a conservative today and hated socialism"


"The idea that we exist do things for the greater good is totally antithetical to the purpose of being human"


"Mick Huckabee and Ted Cruz don't care about gay marriage anymore"


"The only problem with the right is i don't like the religious aspect but other than that i can't think of anything they're doing wrong"


This is just a sample of some of the stupid things Dave has said in just the last 6-12 months. Where does one even begin to address material this lazy, ahistorical and yes, sorry to say, controversial. For someone who prides himself on rational, logic-informed conversation, Rubin has absolutely no fucking clue what he's talking about and its why he usually resorts to vague platitudes or never challenges his guests. This is why we don't like him. He is a dangerously stupid commentator.I don't hate Rubin, i don't hate anyone. I just believe in the free exchange of the market place of ideas or whatever
This is not my video. I'm not posting this as an endorsement of Joe as much as this a criticism of Dave, which seems to suit the sub fairly well don't you think?I love that his libertarian solution to not having construction codes is "we all have phones now so we can give a construction company bad yelp reviews if a school collapses in on itself and kills all the kids."

The moral and ethical issues with that line of thinking aside, its very interesting that he's seemingly advocating for outrage culture.Yes I think that Harris has an outsized ego. Especially ironic as he criticises Trump for it. And this statement was extremely stupid. I think that Harris loves Rubin as Rubin allows him to vent about being misrepresented &amp; how he is the most unfairly treated intellectual of all time, without receiving any pushback whatsoever.Yep that’s true of Bill Maher. He’s a generic Democrat but I still like him. Harris less so these days, as he is sliding further and further to the right.Agree mostly but I think you do a disservice to Harris. He is about 100 times more intelligent than brain dead Rubin; it’s just that he is clueless politically and he has become a reactionary with all that IDW bullshit which is not a good look for him. Plus he has behaved deplorably over the last year or so with regards to his genuine critics. He called Ezra Klein far left!! I mean WTF???Probably because there are more identity politics geoupies on the left than there are uktranationalists on the right

But the whole conversation is kind of petty&gt;Why does Rubin think there is more racism on the left?

Because that's what his funders and right-wing listener base wants him to think. Pandering 101.i dunno. You ever been to a University these days?This is a very correct post aside from the Koch brothers stuff.He can get those when he stops using SJW, cuck, etc. like a fucking teen gamer bro. Until then, when a guy his age, with a political show,  has such a lack of understanding of poli sci, we'll keep calling him retard.The construction argument is really interesting. I think it's challenging to address under a libertarian perspective. 

One method is through private litigation through breach of contract or implied warranty. These involve the government but only to the same extent that enforcement against stealing or murder would.

I don't necessarily believe that, I'm just saying if I were Dave Rubin I would have probably said something like that.Deus Vult!Those folks are really hard to find. Do you have any good examples of "steelman" philosophers of Critical Theory?

I feel like I have a decent idea of the theory just like everyone else but no debates really go deep into it.Well I'm asking you where there are those who don't profiteer off of SJW shit.Thanks for the attempt. I can't find it either. But tbf to the conservative movement I can't find anything like that on the Left either. John Oliver is decent though.

I know I can look up like professors that are Conservative and lectures but I'm interested in a consistent youtube channel.Give me some on the Left then. I don't mind that either they tend to grapple with the other sides arguments squarely so I can learn about Conservatism by that way.Yeah he can't be precise in his speech if some dude clips out the rest of what he was saying.I appreciate it friend. I will check them out.secular talk and jimmy dore are good onesI think David Pakman is a very reasonable liberal with a great channel.I don't know. It has the same effect as regulation...punishment for fucking up. I also forgot private litigation through the torts of negligence and wrongful death.

Plus private inspectors can be paid to do the work of government inspectors. It has the same effect of preventing death and suffering it just puts the burden on individuals to do it.Lawyers being expensive is a tricky solution. There probably ought to be public prosecutors as well as public defenders.

Good attorneys are needed because our laws are ridiculously complex.

I also think pro se litigation should be taught in schools as part of civics.

Also, there are several easy changes to make to prevent that somewhat. Just make it so attorney's fees are paid not by the person but by the other party. We do this through class actions now, where lawyers representing cases that are not economical for individuals to bring by themselves.

And I can also dispute inconsistent. Financial incentive is one of the most predictable ways of changing behavior. If anything government official conduct seems less consistent because failure to inspect properly doesn't expose those inspectors to a risk of civil litigation. And if it does, then that's basically the same thing as my argument, but removing the middle man.I loved Kyle Kulinski until he started totally downplaying the Trump-Russia connection. I think that's the biggest threat to our country in modern times, but he still treats it like it's some kind of crazy conspiracy theory.Yeah I should have made it more clear i listen to these folks for fun/interest and not necessarily to inform my political philosophy.

Deep conversation is hard to get to from the Left as well. Im just interested in these new conservative YT personalities as a phenomenon.Im not above that.well jimmy's pretty right wing now here's one of his latest [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPcsOF7Gd8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPcsOF7Gd8E) it's very informative. and secular talk gives a very strong critique of the Left here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdTmCI74\_rw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdTmCI74_rw)

so theyre very much to the right but then again with so many regressives it's hard not to be. also they like to cite actual facts without being hacky or needlessly arrogant like shapiroWhile the right is ripping children away from their parents, attacking the free press, our intelligence agencies, our allies, and our entire democratic system.....Dave is concerned about some students who protest conservative speakers on college campuses.Wait haven't you listened to his response? THEY HAVE TO READ DIFFERENT BOOKS DEPENDING ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN!!![Justy like this gracious man](https://pics.me.me/when-the-little-girl-that-you-bought-on-the-deep-12482897.png)If the subject matter weren't so terrible I'd find it almost adorable that Dave thinks he's made some deep and profound point here.I don't know who that Cody Johnston guy is, but he's letting Dave have it.

&gt;He's the one who originally implemented it, Dave. You're incapable of criticizing him and it's very weird.Interesting. I'll check out the podcast.I wonder if Dave will block him like he blocks everyone else that questions him.Would you say it always sucks or always has sucked? When would you say it stopped carrying weight for you?Even when Trump is committing human right abuses, Rubin,  who was going to be 'the first who's  holding Trumps feet to the fire', finds a way to criticize Democrats instead of saying even one critical word of Trump.

&gt;*Amnesty International:* “This is a spectacularly cruel policy, where frightened children are  being ripped from their parent’s arms and taken to overflowing detention  centres, which are effectively cages. **This is nothing short of torture.**  The severe mental suffering that officials have intentionally inflicted  on these families for coercive purposes, means that these acts meet the  definitions of torture under both US and international law,” said Erika  Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s Americas Director.

[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/06/usa-family-separation-torture/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/06/usa-family-separation-torture/)Nah. Im i watch john oliver and he's cool. I used to watch a lot of stephen colbert too. 

Ill check it out. Only thing that really turns me off is Marxism apologeticsI appreciate your input.  While I agree pjmedia was biased in their presentation here and normally not to be trusted(and I was clear about that in the posting) I don't think they were wrong to present this story.  Hopefully the SPLC will win most of these lawsuits but this battle for them is coming I think.

I think the SPLC is vulnerable to losing lawsuits by some that they labeled anti-Muslim haters like Nawaz and Ali. But I do not think the SPLC is that vulnerable to losing lawsuits by anyone they labeled as anti-gay, anti-immigrat, anti-minority, or anti-Semitic and I don't think they will settle with any of those.
I read a good point on another thread.  The SPLC may be seriously affriad of what, during these suits, discovery might turn up and show to the public.  Discovery and exposure may be a, if not the, goal of prosepective plaintiffs.For me personally, I think the only policy on that list I could potentially support/agree with is the engagement with North Korea. And even for that it remains to be seen what will come of it, and I don't trust Trump as a negotiator or his intentions. But still In general I believe in diplomacy and I don't think it's a bad thing to open discussions when they had been totally closed. As the list mentions, it's also worth noting that while opening up with NK, Trump has gone in the opposite direction with Cuba and Iran.

Aside from that, I don't think there's a single policy or idea on that list that's positive. All the rest are negative, and some of them are or will be hugely impactful despite flying under the radar right now.Keep in mind where his funding comes from: (1) right-wing think tanks; and (2) his right-wing followers through Patreon. He doesn't want to bite the hand that feeds.

I don't doubt that Dave actually believes some of the stuff he says about libertarianism and small government, but I refuse to believe that he's so stupid that he actually can't come up with any reasons to criticize Trump.Yep - I've said this before but it's the old Upton Sinclair quote, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” Here's a detailed Tim Pool YouTube discussion on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkn5_gCvtC0Yeah - I think you've more or less got it. I've been reading Jane Mayer's fantastic book "Dark Money" lately, and it really gets into the various programs, institutes, and think tanks the Kochs and others have funded over the years to promote right wing ideas. Rubin's show fits very well into this pattern. A tactic for example is to focus on generalized "culture war" issues rather than the details of specific policies in public statements, which fits perfectly into Rubin's M.O.

The only thing that distinguishes Rubin to me, and makes the whole thing SO disappointing, is that Rubin has gotten support and a cosign from so many respected intellectuals who really should know better. Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, and I'm sure others I can't think of now really should be able to see Rubin's con at this point. That they haven't has lessened their reputation a bit in my eyes.Their is nothing conspiratorial about sales people being paid to promote faith in a product and to use  psychology to cast said product in a positive light. In fact, it's more of the norm now than at anytime in history. Nothing they are doing goes against their beliefs anymore than a model who doesn't drink beer being paid to promote a beer brand. *It's just sales*.I listened to about a 3rd of the audio book version of Dark Money and then cliff noted my way through the rest by listening to some of her talks. Mayer has done a public service with her work. I don't think that most of the people that Rubin has on his show are interested in muck raking in any substantive way, they just want to promote themselves and cross pollinate one anothers websites and youtube channels. As the saying goes - don't shit where you eat. Exactly. It's like people who have a desire to 'fight' against people who aren't there heheheI love how it's obvious that Rubin is peddling talking points because it's his job - not because he took the time to learn what he is talking about.  I'm glad Seeder pointed out how the tail is wagging the dog If we had a more free market economy Seeder would be incentivized to buy him flowers instead of ass raping his lack of intellectual fortitude on air. I'm aware that he works with institutions they fund. But posts on this sub would have you believe they're feeding him lines to say or something of that nature. He's merely partnered with right-wing organizations that are naturally Koch-funded.

Again, the problem isn't that he's right-wing, it's that he refuses to admit he is.Dave spends so much of his time defending Peterson. Just watch his recent interviews with Joe Rogan and Sam Harris. Then, after spending all of his time defending Peterson, he says something like, "Not that I'm here to litigate on Jordan's behalf or anything like that."*Twist*: Rubin actually voted for Trump.

Let's be real. He probably did.21:22 is when Dave Rubin realizes that he's built a monsterHave the FBI always been this stupid? I remember reading a story that the FBI sent a guy to pretend to be a radical muslim into a mosque to see if anyone would agree with him and they ended up reporting him to the FBI.&gt;Also his constant apology for trump and making it seem like sjws are the worst thing in the country is plainly dishonest

But again, it's only dishonest because he claims to be a liberal. As a moderate conservative, I do think SJWs are the worst social problem in America and I do agree with a lot of what Trump does. If Rubin was actually a liberal, he would disagree and claim Trump/Republicans are the biggest problem. Instead, his constant attempt to appease both sides and create this simplistic "I'm for freedom!" middle-ground just alienates everyone.SJW logic has taken over the mainstream media, Hollywood, and the norms of public discourse. If that’s not institutional power, I don’t know what is.Left-wing extremists are 18-19 year old idiots on a few college campuses, and most liberals don't even know they exist. Right-wing extremists get elected to Congress and the presidency. That's the difference between the left and the right in this country.Minimum of at least one absolutely idiotic Tweet per day from this guy. Sources? Lol, you want me to prove that SJWs are prominent in society? This is like the basic premise of Rubin’s show, so if you disagree with that I don’t even know why you’re here.

But go to any left-wing news/opinion site (HuffPost, Vox, Buzzfeed, etc.) and I’ll be shocked if one of the top articles isn’t about identity politics.The media hated Bernie because he was challenging their beloved Hillary Clinton. And not sure how this even relates to my point, I never said the media loves everyone on the left.If you believe social justice equates to politeness, you are highly uninformed and I have no idea why you are on a Dave Rubin subreddit.&gt;Once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all persons within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.

I would agree that Bernie is more popular amongst SJW types because he embraces things like BLM more wholeheartedly. But Hillary still got a lot of support just for being a woman, especially in the media and amongst women.I do not believe that states can control immigration. Immigration is federal jurisdiction.It's also his birthday.just watched it and DAAAMN she went raw, no lube

no way he stands silent after this exposure. Ana v Dave Politicon 2018Btw this makes TYT actually look good because they've been completely silent, letting him spew whatever false narrative about his departure with no push back or counter claim.Why? Sure, states have rights but there is still lawful seperation of power. States don't get tot control everything.WIll someone please do an Ana Karsparian destroys bum Dave Rubin video. /s means seriousi read that in his voice. seems accurate.a lame "soy joke" no doubt.Bro, I know. It's a joke, lol.I wish Ana had the opportunity to express these views in a long form interview show. Maybe one that prides itself on reaching across the aisle and exchanging ideas no matter how dangerous or disagreeable they may be to the host of said show. 

In all seriousness though, this honestly makes me think that we've had Rubin wrong all these years. I genuinely don't think the Koch brother money changed him at all. I'm starting to think his time on TYT was all an act and the Rubin we are seeing now is the real one. He is 10x more passionate about all this small government/pro-trump/civility/free exchange of ideas/anti-identity politics crap than he ever has been about anything even remotely liberal or left wing during his time on TYT.&gt;hackery is an unsustainable business model

Works for Shapiro ....This is definitely Dave Rubin's subreddit and he's such a lolcow we detractors gather every day to laugh at whatever bit of political naivety he's tweeted or otherwise said that day.

This being said I actually do think Rubin's enabling of the far right is dangerous so beyond just laughing at him the need to expose him is genuinely important. I agree the TYT segment was melodramatic but I agree with their point about why Rubin is such a tool for the radical right wing.Isn't 'people' too PC Dave? Shouldn't you be specifically saying 'ladies and gentlemen' to avoid giving into leftist gender equality hysteria? /sWhile I don't doubt Kasparian's sincere emotion over this I just feel that style of presentation is too likely to evoke more 'TYT are so cringe!' response rather than successfully get across the truth about Rubin's incompetence.Alex Jones is a fat cravenness fuckRead the description of the subreddit. This is a place to discuss anything related to the show. That doesn't mean we have to bend over backwards and jerk him off. His supporters are more than welcome here you know cause its all about the free exchange of the marketplace of ideas or whateverFirst off, i don't think anyone on TYT or this subreddit implied he's a fascist, that's a huge straw man. I can tell you're a little shocked that not everyone on this subreddit is a Classical Liberall™ and that we actually have the capacity to disagree with a dishonest hack. This place isn't about TYT, i personally don't have particularly strong feelings about them one way or another. This is about Dave Rubin the Last Classical Liberal ™.

Here are some of the things Rubin has said in the last year or so. Since you obviously care so much about dishonesty and ideas, i'd love to know what you think of them.

"I would vote for Drumpf in 2020 if he was against Warren, Booker or Sanders"

"Leftists like to cheat at games because they look for shortcuts and handouts at life"

"Jesus was really kind to Muslims"

"Martin Luther King Jr. would have been a conservative today and hated socialism"

"The idea that we exist do things for the greater good is totally antithetical to the purpose of being human"

"Mick Huckabee and Ted Cruz don't care about gay marriage anymore"

"The only problem with the right is i don't like the religious aspect but other than that i can't think of anything they're doing wrong"

I challenge you defend any one of these positions or ideas. Remember that Dave Rubin is a Classical Liberal™ and definitely not a conservative or right wing (he is married to a guy after all).possibly and that's because they have the same sugar daddies. TPU and DW are millionaire/billionaire funded propaganda pieces aimed at misleading my generation into thinking "brown people are taking from you" and "the guberment is bad". Sadly it's somehow been effective although my generation cant move out of our parents homes without making at least 50k a year (where i live longisland), saddled with thousands of dollars in debt and amazingly they lean right because "we hate femenazis". 

So will Rave Dubin be bigger in 2020? Possibly, but nobody is jealous of that disingenuous koch puppet Wow you are such a individualistic, free-thinking, small government, Classical Liberal™ that Rubin just shed a solitary tear at the thought that he's herded so many sheep to adopt such a lazy and orthodox political outlook like him. &gt;Ana v Dave Politicon 2018

I AM HERE FOR THIS!! lolLargely agree, although I differ on just how must JR is weary of Dave's intellect. Pretty sure JR tweeted out a link to Dave's extremely vapid Oxford talk (imo) and said something like 'excellent stuff' shortly after the podcast.

Your point is well taken, though. Good to see Joe push back.I bet it will involve some threat of a lawsuit. As you know free speech absolutists like him actively support libel laws, that's the Classical Liberal™ way.I bet Rubin will not address it directly. Instead he will do some passive agressive monologue on his show about the evils of journalists without naming names. If he so much as even entertains this issue it will be gobbled up by Twitter. The twitter algorithms feed on fights. The more he perpetuates this the more he will:

1. Promote himself....
2. Promote himself ...in a bad wayDamn! Go Anna, she performed the ultimate RKO on Dave Rubin here. To be honest, Anna just confirmed what I head always suspected. Rubin is a dumb, lazy, greedy, slimy, despicable hack.If he responds at all (i doubt he will) it'll be something vapid like 


"Freedom is messy! You have the right to not to associate with him if you don't like him. I don't agree with him but it's not as bad as the CONTROL LEFT who want to control you and conform to their politically correct intersectional identity politics. This is the natural progression of their oppression olympics. That's why i "Left the Left™"
That picture they use of him is perfect. He always has that perpetual "deer in headlights" look.It seems to me that until now this is his reaction on Twitter.

I read that as a response, triggered by the TYT video. I might be wrong, but that's how it seems to me, lamenting a lack of civility in public discourse (hypocritical for so many reasons):

[https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1011983064572952578](https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1011983064572952578)I think he’s just naive. After having discarded  everything he previously thought he knew about politics, he’s now a blank slate that can be filled with whatever ideas his guests espouse. You can hear him directly repeating talking points of guests, i.e. the Ayn Rand stuff.

And that’s actually the main reason I don’t watch his interviews much anymore. The fact that he just regurgitates stuff and rarely pushes back with his own ideas (like Rogan does) just makes him kinda boring to listen to.Yeah Rogan’s great, I listen to him all the time now. Surprisingly smart guy, listens intently when he doesn’t know stuff and not afraid to push back when he does. Basically what we hoped Rubin would be doing too.he seems to be trying to summon his idw super friends to come to his aidAna is very career minded, and she wants to get ahead and become more successful more than anybody at TYT. thats admirable of her. so on a personal level, and putting aside politics,  when Ana sees Dave Rubin, who was close friends with her, and someone who was at her level at one point.. when she sees him being way way way more successful than herself.. hosting a big channel with huge viewership.. hosting sold out shows with a very relevant intellectual.. it gets under her skin.. it makes her hate him even more than she should. specially when Ana has been doing the same show for years now. still on the second hour and not the first.. and it seems like there hasn't been any promotions.. and essentially doing the same thing when Dave left.. mostly reading news from other sites, and then commenting on it. shes not setting the tone of any conversation, and she is not as relevant as she wants to be.. thats just painful on her part i bet. now I dont personally like Dave Rubin.. i think he is an opportunist.. but i can't deny the level of success he's had ever since he quit TYT. and i think that just creates a lot of animosity and jealousy against him regardless of his politics..yes of course. but the element of personal success is always relevant when discussing colleagues in the same industry. its a very natural reaction.wow, honestly i was swayed by the Jimmy Dore vote third party rhetoric however i thought the worst that would happen is Trump passes some fucking tax cuts crashes the stock market and hurt the economy in the short term. I was never on board with not voting for Hilary because i knew Trump would be a puppet for the worst fundamentalist in this country. Now, the anti-protest bills proposed in 20 states, the ramp up of voter suppression laws, charlottesville, neil gorsuch, somehow worse immigration policy,  trying to kill the clean energy sector, ignoring global warming in general, the human rights abuses, bloody gina, pro torture executive order, the killing of social programs... ect the list goes on. 

And now with 5.4 trillion in proposed cuts which are completely unnecessary, that hurt the most vulnerable Americans, I i have a seething resentment towards the Bernie or bust or third party dickheads. I imagine this is the same feeling people had in 2000 i bet you didn't read the part where i said I think Dave Rubin is a fraud. dont be so triggered. yes i did.
If dave had become less successful than Ana, she wouldn't even care to comment on him. the fact that she did, proves my theory.Daily Wire ran by Ben "my wife is a doctor/my voice is a virgin" Shapiroi watched it twice. my point is beyond what she said publicly. im going deeper than just words.. Yes, I do think that part is downplayed as well. I just view that as Rogan trying to find common ground and build bridges (perhaps to a fault). 

Even with that, I feel like Rogan tries to help his guests out by highlighting the kernel of truth he agrees with while largely ignoring the more hyperbolic sentiments of someone like Rubin (i.e. FREE SPEECH IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO WESTERN CULTURE!)

I'd prefer he downplay those things, instead of brush it off or even lending it some credence, but I can get past it as long as he pushes back when absolutely necessary.I mean, I have many larger bones to pick with Dave than that quote alone. And yes, I do think it was facetious. It is, however, a little cringe for someone whose whole schtick is being open to ideas and above the fray of divisive discourse.I really do like her. this is not a political post.. pls be mindful of that. 
Milo has no relations to Ana.. so its a moot point. Dave used to be her close friend.. she had dinner at his place every week. its way way way more personal for her.they do discuss them true.. but this one just felt different because Ana used to be close friend with Dave and they both worked at the same company and started at the same time and they are the same age.. etc etc... this is a very natural thing that happens between people.. you cant relate?I think the fact that Ana and Dave were close friends, worked at the same company, started around the same time.. indicate that jealousy can be part of this equation.

also as much as i hate Dave Rubin, if im realistic, i have to admit that he is setting the tone in a lot of current conversations. he's from a different ilk than Sargon and others. he has managed to fool a lot of people into thinking he is the next Larry King.. his channel's growth is impressive.. and im always surprised when I heard his name in every conversation... 

and my "very relevant intellectual" comment doesn't mean he is right on every issue.. it only means he is the most talked about at this moment.. I'm very well aware of his work and where I disagree or agree with him.. this is not a political post and I'm not talking about who's right or wrong.. it's an observation on human behavior. yea im sure that's the case... but some of her animosity towards him comes from the fact that they used to be on the same level at one point, and they are not anymore.. that happens all the time between professionals. That’s because I agree with all those things you mentioned and I’ve already said Rubin is a fraud. And I’ve discussed all that in this sub before.. pls check my history. 

I’m only on this one post focusing on their personal life and the natural human behaviours that are at play here..  but you keep bringing it all back to politics.Agreed. Whatever the reasons may be behind the success of Rubin, it is still painful for someone like Ana to witness.. we might all say what a moron this guy is and move on with our lives, but she sees it through a more personal lens that makes it more painful and also resentful..  he is after all setting the tone of the conversation (for better or worse) way way more than Ana at this point and I bet she resent him for that a lot. I think even between peers, there’s a certain level of competitiveness. If you’ve been in any professional settings, you’ll admit to this. You always want to do better than even your peers or if not, at least be at the same level as them. This is almost always true in most professional settings. I never said what she said is right or wrong. I personally agree with her.. I’m only observing human behaviour here not politics.  If it doesn’t matter to you, then you don’t have leave a comment and engage. That’s the whole point. Just wanted to point that out.. there is no agenda here.. relax. 

But it seems that ppl are arguing with me that what I’m  saying isn’t true.. why is it so hard to admit the obvious?Are you saying Discussing human behaviour is not valuable? To me it is. It’s important if we want to take seriously what she says on the subject.I think it still matters if we are after the truth.. and if we are against tribalism. to be clear i wasnt registered to vote and i was expected the same thing to happen under Hilary. She didnt have a plan to stimulate the economy from the bottom up, just more of the same, leaving 90&amp;#37; of this country in a lull with an ever increasing debt bubble ready to popI don’t hold the truth.. even if I agree with something that doesn’t make that statement objectively true. 

It’s tribalism because you think what she says is objectively true because it agrees with your opinion.

She didn’t really give you any new information.. she basically validated our bias.. and she’s highly bias on this matter because of her personally being close with Dave.  that’s why this is a good example of tribalism. You’re talking semantics here.. they started around the same time means within a few years.. they’re in the same generation of work force.. its different with say cenk and Ana. AiU is a scientific racist. I hate Rubin but at least he's better than that monster.Agree. Even if it was genuine, his totally one-sided rhetoric where he constantly bashes every minor thing the left does while completely ignoring the many scandals of the Trump administration would have put him in league with Sean Hannity &amp; Rush Limbagh for dishonesty, lies &amp; selective outrage.The screen shot of this "Rubin Report" episode with this womans face in a subtle cross eyed look reminds me of some old south park episode or something. I feel like if I click on it she will drool all over her self and go on about how civil liberties are fascist and we need the freedom of billionaire sponsored politicans to raise large somes money to offset the emerging north american fourth reich of the radical left. How about how much could we bid up to get Dave Rubin to spill the beans on learn libery and the kochs. I mean if a go fund me got up to like a million dollars would Dave just flip and admit everything he has been saying is horseshit? The point is maybe she regrets that now seeing how she has hit a wall in TYT and hasn’t had any promotion for years now. Next time read the whole thing before voicing your opinion. Then just shut up maybe and don’t leave a comment here. Typical person on the internet.. reads one line, makes up his mind. it took me forever to find, but here you go

https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/884640536056930304?lang=csIf somebody tells you "it is not even 1/Xth of that number" when asked about a finance issue that make you uncomfortable, you can rest assured it's somewhere very close to that number.

Just based on his patreon from that time, he makes about 0-70.000 dollars a year just by inviting few libertarian guests (not even can theoretically mean zero lol). But that doesn't account for other parnerships, speaking gigs, his standups and other sources of income that I didn't think of. The old joke says that Koch brothers are cheap and I seriously doubt that he's making 6 figure income from this. But it's probably still a large number for doing very little work.Since you're new here, allow me to go ahead and burst your bubble. Everyone in this sub hates Dave because we realize the huge fraud that he is.

To answer your question though, Dave is definitely more than an interviewer, especially outside of his show. He tours the country preaching about the evils of "SJWs" and the "regressive left." He makes media appearance on shows like Rogan, where he embarrassingly spouts libertarian talking points. His entire Twitter account is a constant feed of criticizing liberals.

You're right that he doesn't have much to offer to a conversation, but it's not because he doesn't try.Yeah that all I get. His JRE appearance was pretty embarrassing. I’ve noticed lately he tries to play as though he was Jordan Peterson which he isn’t good at either. I guess his opinions are fluid enough I can never tell when he’s saying his own or agreeing with his guests.To be fair, Jordan Peterson isn't very good at it either.Jordan Peterson isn’t good at playing Jordan Peterson? We’d have to disagree He's very good at playing Jordan Peterson. He just isn't very good at making arguments.The only right wing, or I guess admittedly right wing, talk show I listen to is Ben Shapiro and he’s nothing like Dave’s show. I’ve found a wide variety of different political podcasts to listen to, kinda embarrassed I started with the Rubin report.$5-10k is nothing compared to what Dave's making from the Kochs and Patreon. That's not enough to go and get humiliated on Seder's show.I don't blame Jill Stein, I blame leftists who voted for her and other third party candidates out of spite for Clinton. I also think Hillary was a horrible candidate and her and Obama didn't make a big enough deal about Republicans openly keeping a Supreme Court seat vacant.I’m absolutely shocked that many people pay Dave monthly. true, but what's his "budget" anyway? maybe loan on the studio, but even in L.A. that thing can't be *that* expensive. with the money he receives, that thing is probably paid of already. not to mention that part of the budget is money he gives to his husband, so it could just be basically income.His role models for civility, which allegedly has been the key to the IDS's success are also:

Jordan Peterson (on Twitter):

At worst it's only partially funded by them. His montly income dipped quite often and quite significantly when he made a mistake.

For example, ehen he interviewed Patreon CEO after he disallowed Lauren Southern to be part of the platform (of course his justification was solid and in accordance to Patreon's rules). He tried to be hard on him, but that didn't matter, his income went down by 3-4 thousand dollars.And Ben Shapiro is also a role model for civility:

&gt;Palestinian Arabs will not be moderated: Israel has ceded land continuously since 1993, and the Palestinian Arabs have demonstrated their preference for murder over peace. Palestinian Arabs must be fought on their own terms: **as a people dedicated to an evil cause.**

&gt;Viewed in its starkest terms, the Arab-Israeli conflict may be accurately described as a war between darkness and light. Those who argue against Israeli settlements – outposts of light in a dark territory – argue for the continued victory of night. They argue for the dominance of the same **terroristic population** that elected Hamas. They argue for the appeasement of populations and leaderships who value murder at the expense of those who value life.

[Hey @cenkuygur, I see a couple tweets since #Nice attacks but nothing about what happened. For or against?](https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/753794898134986753?lang=de)That's putting it mildly. He humiliated himself and showed everyone that he has absolutely no idea what he's talking about.I'm interested as to why you think thatYea I didn't realize until after posting that I had totally misinterpreted this sub lolI'm asking him to have a stance on something not necessarily to pigeonhole himself. 

I agree that cable news is a shit format but not because it promotes argumentation, its because it forces political viewpoints to be expressed in 5 minute soundbites. Long form debate is where people learn the most and where the best ideas are found because they are held to thorough scrutiny. People who were champions of this form were guys like Christopher Hitchens and even admittedly Dennis Prager--his troubling beliefs aside.

This is precisely the problem with Rubin. He has the opportunity to have a good long form show but he's so passive it's frankly nauseating. Milo Yiannopolous is a Nazi or at the very least a Nazi collaborator and apologist and anyone who questions that has big fat blinders on. When Dave had him on he just let him rail off his anti-semitic drool and didn't challenge it at all. This isn't to say you can't have a guy like Milo on a show, but at least give him a little pushback when he outright lies and says outrageous things.

Yes, not every show has to debate ideas. However, those that don't are of poor quality in my opinion.You're spot on in your first paragraph, but I disagree with your second paragraph. Dave is way past the point where I can give him benefit of the doubt. He very clearly has a capital "A" agenda.You make a good point. During his most recent appearance with Rogan, he really did come across as a college kid who just recently learned about libertarianism and is simply spouting the most basic talking points. Joe was able to trip him up using the most basic responses, and Dave immediately backed down and went with, "Uhhh I'm not necessarily advocating that we do the things I'm advocating for, but I'm just saying that a libertarian argument could be made for it..."Because the policy was never done through a formal bill or executive order to begin with. Trump could've ended it with a phone call at any point.Well the fact he did it at all and then held out on it is still reprehensible. Especially because it seemed like he was trying to blackmail the Democrats into giving him funding for the wall for it by offering to end the separations as part of a larger immigration bill that would provide that funding.the grin on that screen cap 🤣I think he just wants to be accepted and feel cool. I legitimately think he's just a lost person trying to find some identity and his pretender syndrome just has him falling upwards.

I mean, imagine Dave Rubin writing a book on any topic. It'd be basically freshman year of college level of insight. 1/5th of anything is ...quite a bit.makes you wonder why Rubin doesn't do his show from a non-coastal state...But Snapchat! Instagram! Yelp reviews!

If your house collapses and kills your entire family because the builder took shortcuts and didn't follow building codes snapchat it and give them a one star review on Yelp. Looks like they have a big thing coming up together in two weeksHow can you criticise islam without criticising muslims? It's like saying, 'yea I don't like Nazism, but I have nothing against Nazis'. 

All that is a continuation of an 8 year pre-Trump tend.  I know that I made a lot of money in the stock market before Trump's economic policies were put in place in November.  Ever sense Trump economic policies were put in place and the trade war talk started the stock market has been flat, even down a little, despite all the other good economic news.  But if the Republicans are not going to make me money in the stock market like the Democrats do then I have absolutely no reason to support Trump and the Republicans.Doubtful. Peterson tends to lead with his chin :)Record inflation to eat up those wages and record tax cuts to funnel GDP growth back to the top. Great PresidentOf the three examples, Maxine Waters is the only one that did not explicitly make reference to any violence, yet it's the only one you're claiming incites violence. Maybe you should reconsider.He's had Milo on 3x. Mike Cernovich. Katie Hopkins. Lauren Southern. Tommy Robinson. Sebastian Gorka. Dinesh D'Souza.

Those are people I would call "alt-right." Then there are other shitheads who aren't technically "alt-right," but more just usual right-wingers.If he's going for 'honest liberal' or something along those lines, those are pretty odd positions to take. I wish there were more Steven Pinkers in this world. He has a lot of these conversations, but also doesn't get too hung up on himself and is pretty intellectually independent. (Not that he didn't build on the shoulders of giants, just that he isn't so swayed by whoever he happens to be in the room with.)I think the point is that it shows that clearly he’s doing the libertarian thing for money and not because he believes it. I feel like you wrote "niggering" and then added an "s" at the last minuteGee how surprising that Dave is having an episode about how regressive the left is. Glad he's finally tackling some new topics.I don't think it's a big deal that he asked for more money and then left when he didn't get it. That's something people do all the time. The problem is that, over the last few years, his shift from liberal to conservative has directly coincided with where his money has been coming from. I think it's worth pointing that out so his fans are at least aware of it. He's a chameleon.

Also, Ana had other criticisms of him than just wanting money. She also said that he wasn't willing to put in a lot of work to get informed on topics. That definitely seems to be the case ever since he started Rubin Report. He doesn't even conduct a basic amount of research in preparation for his interviews, which is why he just ends up parroting the exact same talking points on each episode (regressive left, outrage culture, etc.).Of course. Welcome to the club. You don't even have to be rude or uncivil for Dave to block you.Ok so the users are largely white men.. and that’s bad because why? 

Edit: 81% of users are white, but according to the only numbers I [can find](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3dct7x/why_is_reddit_so_white/) reddit is 80% white so that number is essentially meaningless. It does skew more male than Reddit at large but my question remains. I'm sure that nearly all of JP's supporters are while males in their twenties and thirties, but that's also the general demographic makeup of most subreddits, so this probably isn't the best place to conduct such a poll.I'm not sure what any of this has to do with communism, but okay.I don't think you're going to get much play on this sub.

But then again, i guess there are those occasional people who tell Dave on twitter that they don't like him giving a platform to conspiracy theorists, racists, xenophobes, Islamophobes, white supremacists and unabashed sexists so its probably all evened out. So much toleranceI love how he has to include a #RegressiveLeft in every Tweet.I guess it's kind of like how recovering drug addicts are treated as heroes, but people who never got addicted to drugs or alcohol in the first place aren't.

Maybe we should all go and get mixed up in Islamic extremism for a while so that we can later snap out of it and also be viewed as some kind of hero.Environmental regulations *and* the existence of Yelp haven't been enough to stop companies from polluting, but if we were to get rid of the regulations and leave only Yelp, Dave seems to think the polluting would somehow *decrease*...I read this as "swallow phrases" and i fucking lol'dI like his set and just the overall look of his show. That's about the only positive thing I can come up with. this makes this thread worth it Rubin should leave Los Angeles and take his "gay comedian" schtick to a few states...&gt; Liberty University doesnt recognize the student Democrats

What?

Wow.Has anyone pointed out the irony of how the "intellectual" dark web types generally free thinkers? So let me get this right..

When someone of a certain group (blacks, latinos, gays, women, etc.) considers themselves part of the Left, it's bc they're pressured into it or they fall victim to identity politics/collectivism.

But if that SAME person is conservative, they're hailed as a FREE THINKER(!!!)

Couldn't it also be possible that progressive blacks, latinos, gays, women, etc. aren't simply brainwashed or shamed into it? Maybe they simply came to the conclusion that it's their rational self-interest as a freethinking Individual™ to support progressive candidates/policies..

But ya know, that would actually require DEBATING those Big Ideas...."Writes tweet destroying celebrity"

It's astonishing how little self-awareness Dave has. I know the whole point of this tweet is that he didn't send it but this notion goes directly against his PragerU video on tolerance and his whole "listen to and respect different ideas in the free exchange of the marketplace of ideas" IDW shtick. Even the fact that he decided in the end not to engage with them at all shows that he really has absolutely no desire to change minds like he claims he wants to and that his current platform is entirely about pandering to the right.Really? Oh my god that's hilarious!https://graphtreon.com/creator/rubinreport

that was only because of expired credit cards at the end of that month, which accounts to about 5-10% monthly drop in revenue for every patreon account there is, not just Rubin's

the only times when his revenue drops is when he makes a real mistake - interviewing someone who is not Trump supporter and isn't touch on them (Patreon CEO)Lol i think its more likely that he labels him a "True liberal who believed in that the individual over the collective"idk who destiny is but i came for the rubin slander and stayed till the end. Sharpe to Dave: Have you ever run for office?

Dave: Not yet.. \*bites lip\*

Oh boy.... lol. (25:52)Honestly I wish she had gone even farther in her criticism of Israel I would even give her the benefit of the doubt on that. That question was so terribly vague, I don't think she even knew where to start. I don't even think ardent supporters of Israel would dispute that the territories are being occupied; they would just argue they're justified. I have literally no idea what Hoover was fishing for her to say.Dear Rave Dubin,

I'm a gay California resident who was a lifelong progressive until I saw that the left was a little soft on Islamic fundamentalism, at which point I inexplicably decided to accept right wing positions on small government, economics, guns, foreign policy and every other issue barring some pissweak social ones like weed, gay marriage and also single payer healthcare for some reason. I also decided to take money from two brothers well-known for their investment in spreading misinformation beneficial to their business interests in order to start a boring talk show that's even less engaging than the CNN show it was ripping off.

I love your show because as a lone gay ~~conservative libertarian~~ classical liberal (which has only *become* a conservative position) in a liberal state I really appreciate a program where even the most reasonable members of the left will be demonised while right wing guests lecture others about the need to not insult or dismiss one's opponents. I adore the way you have race realists on without doing any research on their opinions in order to ensure your audience realises the other side of that issue have more evidence on their side and aren't getting their views from actual racists. I cherish the way you invite on serious academics like Steven Pinker alongside YouTubers that used to rant against video game feminism on the Internet with names like 'Sargon of Akkad'.

All of this stuff is good because it shows that you're happy to treat all opinions as equals. You just let a person say whatever they want no matter what their standing is and respect it all the same because that's what free speech is! ...Aside from those fucking SJW fascists of course because they're just so fucking terrible. Why should you even bother having soyboys like Sam Seder and Natalie Wynn on your show since their opinions are so stupid. They might both have said repeatedly that they really want to do it be we know they're just Dunning-Kruger types and as you proved when debating libertarianism with Roe Jogan you'd DESTROY, ANNIHILATE and EXTERMINATE them with your logic if you ever had them on to spout their anti-free speech Nazism.

So thank you Rave for leading this free speech revolution! By the 2030s when the President is Rand Paul throwing everything to the states, leading a party filled with everyone from current party line partisans like Charlie Kirk to conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and far-far right Anarcho-Capitalist racialists like Stefan Molyneux, and the only types of Democrats are those with the beliefs of Bill Maher and Sam Harris (though they'll see the light soon enough!), we'll have your wisdom and guidance to thank!

Yours truly, the most embarrassing and dangerous man in online political commentary today!please don't disturb him and let him write his book

it's going to be the best political comedy even writtenHow can any jackass defend this guy?Ben was pretty harsh, although this comment is basically peak Rubin. Offering nothing of his own Got to love his commitment to free speech and debate by consistently ignoring any criticisms of himself almost every single other person is talking about.And yes this was the same site Elon Musk once touted as a reliable news source during his bizarre 'Pravda' phase:
https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/05/elon-musks-idea-of-excellent-journalism-comes-from-an-alleged-sex-cult/What am I doing with my life? I am black and Hispanic and should probably start a YouTube channel where I pretend to be a conservative. Easy moneyShe really got him here.. wish she had spoken earlier. I wonder if Rubin will respond.. my guess is he won’t until this video becomes a threatening to his fake career. Bingo. I definitely believe black conservatives exist and believe what they preach"she got him, she fucking boomed him!"Wonderful moral logic here.Gotta love it when those seeking civility and honest actors jerk off to the same, out-of-context quote time and time again. Good for you, bud! XDI never said anything about Dave being civil/uncivil - I'm pretty sure he prides himself on not misrepresenting people though. Be the change you want to see in the world, bud!Didn't make this btw, found it on hbomberguy's Twitter.Have you ever seen Dave Rubin try use the soyboy meme on Twitter?i think better term would be useful idiot

he clearly knew nothing (or he just didn't want to know) about Cernovich, Southern pretented to be a libertarian back then (his famous noding when she said Spencer is a white nationalist was because he's inept) and Molymeme is not a completely obvious racist AT FIRST GLANCE (you have to watch  his longwinded speeches and who's up for that)

other than that he just invites basic bitch conservatives, who are often hideous, but are totally mainstreamBut it's completely accurate.You're strawmanning. Rubin clearly has enabled the alt-right with the cushy interviews he's given to those that overlap with that movement like Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux, it's not just some inarticulate smear.&gt;Being in proximity to awful people makes you a cheerleader for them?

He chose to interview them on his show with his "I uhgree with that!" free speech schtick and failed to challenge them on what makes them so horrible.

&gt;I hate to break it to you, but these people have platforms regardless of what Rubin does

Of course they do, but you can choose not to give them a further platform, or if you have to you should have the integrity to actually challenge them.

&gt;Plus, you give zero credit to people’s critical thinking abilities. An argument in favor of anti-semitism isn’t like a disease that you catch and become helpless to. I can hear a lunatic make lunatic arguments and still hold the opinion that they’re a lunatic. I’m not helpless and neither are his listeners. 

There's potentially an audience of countless uncritical people on any video you upload to YouTube, especially when you have a sizeable audience. You might be able to think critically about these people for yourself but heaps of other particularly younger and/or less educated people won't.

&gt;What’s more, Rubin is pro gay marriage (obviously), supports marijuana legalization, pro abortion. Those aren’t alt right positions, just so you know. Those are all left of center positions.

This has nothing to do with whether he's enabled the alt-right. I can criticise your invoking of his positions on these things in a discussion over Rubin's weak personal political views, but again it isn't relevant to this subject.

&gt;You’re the one making the straw man here.

How so? Nothing I've said has been inaccurate to the truth.No the original tweeter got blocked for calling Rubin an alt-right enabler, which I've just explained the reasoning behind and why I think it's a completely accurate label. It does undercut his message because it echoes this valid criticism many others have made and blocking it merely continued Rubin's habit of ignoring all substantial critiques of himself and focusing on highlighting only those he can point to to frame the left-wing media as distinctly dishonest.There's a big gulf between smearing someone as alt-right and describing them, much like others have publicly done on solid grounds, as an alt-right enabler.&gt; I think people really didn’t know what the alt right was and he could have just been a little bit ignorant. Maybe not though

See i'd be willing to accept this premise but Rubin begins the video by saying "I am in no way endorsing white supremacy or neo-Nazism." He's fully aware of what the alt-right representsYou consider The Globe and Mail "Conservative Leaning"? You must be joking.You aren't Canadian I'm assuming. The Globe and Mail only endorsed the Conservatives because they believed that Liberal economic policy would hurt the economy. They lean centre-left (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-globe-and-mail/) and are comparable to the New York Times in terms of bias. They are not Conservative or centre-right in their political leanings.He simply brought it up as part of a conversation about conspiracy theories. He doesn't actually believe it. They were talking conspiracy theories, and he brought it up as it was relevant. I do the same thing during discussions, bringing up stuff I've heard which might end up being wrong, which in this case it was.Yes conspiracy theories are odd. He's implying that he's heard it but isn't sure about it being true.I know he believes that but isn't that quote what Kanye said?When you're too afraid to have your own opinion on an issue and Ben Shapiro rides in to tell you what to think.To continue the conversation.....I don't think you understand how conversation works, and I think you're too trapped in your hatred of Dave to see that.Oh of course. This man's basic levels of dumbness somehow always surprise me.Don't downvote this guys it's a Simpsons quote used mockingly.This isn't a hate sub. This sub is for people to discuss Rubin and his show. That's what we're doing. It doesn't mean we have to bend over backwards and sniff his arseIt's not a double standard though. Being antifascist isn't morally the same as being a fascist, even if they both sometimes use violence. The Alt-Right advocates for ethnic cleansing and genocide, ANTIFA opposes it. Using violence to oppose ethnic cleansing is actually morally correct. &gt;who are not harming anyone?

They are harming people by supporting Trump. Anyone who supports Trump supports immigrant children being sexually abused in concentration camps (And yes, I know this happened before we found out about the camps but as far as I've seen, Trump's approval rating among his base has not dropped since we found out). A dude getting hit in the head with a bike lock is nothing compared to what Trump has done to normalize fascist discourse. So yeah, I honestly don't care. That happened at an alt-right rally, though. It's not like Antifa is just attacking random Republicans for no reason. the one where the guy got hit in the head with a bike lock There were numerous white supremacist/alt-right groups there too. &gt;Was the guy that got domed one of them?

He was at a rally with a bunch of white supremacists so as far as I'm concerned, yeah he is. Look, it sucks the guy got hit by a bike lock but I'm not going to condemn antifa (who have never killed anyone, unlike the far-right) over it. My point is that they're not just like different sides of the same coin. One side believes in ethnic cleansing, the other opposes it. Lol. I doubt anyone in the corporate funded Democratic Party supports a bunch of anarchists and anti-capitalist. Even fucking Samantha Bee condemned them. lol yup. the leader of the resistance. Yes that was good. Let me tell you a secret bud. Fascists don't support free speech and Sommers isn't a feminist. Where's triggilypuff when you need her“I will be the first person to hold trumps feet to the fire if he insults my benefactors”I was right to say in my last post that she was jealous. ONE FIFTY! DAAAAAMNNN he's fucking greedyKeep it up Ana. We need more juicy details to come out about this oily, despicable hack. I’m glad that she has finally broken her silence regarding Dave Rubin.I think you missed  mine Why does everyone on his show always have the same views? Why is Dave funded by the Kochs? Careful. Don't hurt yourself trying to think, brainlet.This is a fun video that demonstrates how Ben goes out of his way to bullshit his audience about things he knows nothing about.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oInAlTKlw64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oInAlTKlw64)This is some rapper that tried to capitalize on the tone-loc subgenre of rap. Go listen to "Wild Thing" by ton loc and you can hear the similarities. His wikipedia page says he was in that loop of rappers and did some writing.

He went on to fund some company and now is worth 200 million hence why Dave Rubin wants to be his buddy.

Overall he seems like a decent guy but I have my suspicions.  Why does Destiny get so mad at him? Dave Rubin didn't even the Prague video or any direct message, his husband did! Dave Rubin knows absolutely nothing but the talking points he is supplied with!great, now my eyes are covered in stupidYour argument is exactly what is toxic. Baseless claims based on no real evidence other than emotional speculations. I might be wrong though if you can provide any valid evidence then I’ll take it back. But I’ve read many accounts of those attacks because I’m front Toronto and this is the first time I’m hearing this.How many leftist or progressives have offered to come his show? But yet he gives "who ever the fuck this is" a platform.The right is just way more witty. 

\&gt; 'Theresa the appeaser'

\&gt; 'Can't Clogg the Mogg'

\&gt; 'Can't stump the Trump'

\&gt; 'Can't barrage the Farage'

Compare this to 

\&gt; 'I have been silenced' Can't tell if brigading or not.The Brigadier Generals. So basically what you're saying is that exploitative people will exploit things. 

All you need to do is look at the mob against Bret Weinstein as an undeniable example of absolute frothing-at-the-mouth leftist insanity to see that this is a huge fucking problem. Regardless of border cases where people are in it for money. It's not as simple as saying 'what happened to Bret Weinstein would only happen in a minority of Universities' because that view completely ignores the progress of time. The fact that something so insane was possible means it is possible in any University in the country. Given the right conditions the problem could worsen. We know that opportunists and charlatans will pop up in every place they can, so it's completely pointless to point to them as the big deal here. 'Horrible state school'? Evergreen was an innovative and fairly well regarded University. This hasn't just happened there, it's happened all over the place. The entire point of silencing tactics is to silence people, has the idea ever ventured into your brain that maybe this is why we only see a few cases relative to the amount of universities? 

Here's a reality check: hospital workers in Australia will soon have to apologise for being white before treating POC patients. 'It's only the entire Australian health system! Isolated incident!'. 

Donald Trump is for the most part a bog standard Republican in terms of policy. Nothing crazy about the man. It's obvious that he can read a crowd, use his Tweets to distract the media and is semi-competent at forming deals. You don't have to like him but pretending he's Hitler will get you nowhere and get him re-elected. So what should we do, give an 'honest representation of our political opponents' where we study every single person who voted for Hillary, say that they're mostly fine people, ignore them and stop talking about politics alltogtether? 

Maybe it would be a better idea to study the fringe elements who can rely on silence from moderates to operate with impunity, the ones with the real influence, the ones who don't need huge numbers to push massive changes upon the nation. 

It's a complete lie that minority extremists have no political power. You should also look on Twitter or Facebook a few times. Hoping Trump gets assassinated is an extremely common belief in the UK among even the most normie of middle class leftists. So yeah, calling out the fringes is absolutely neccessary. The battles that saw National Socialism overrun Germany were carried out by extreme communists and far-righters but once the fights were over we all know how much power the victors accrued. 

But nah, I guess Dave Rubin and the IDW don't give a shit and are all in it for money! Seriously I'd love to know which subreddit you brigaded here from. The fact that you mentioned Soyboy is proof that the right can meme, you idiot. When was the last time you heard an insult coming from the left that was as recognisable as that? All they can do is steal words from the right and play catch up.

At worst Soyboy is about as bad as #drumpf which took John Oliver's entire fucking research goon squad to come up with. Thanks for proving the guy's point my dude.'Make America Great again' is clearly superior to 'Love Trumps hate' which includes Trump's name in the fucking slogan. Scott Adams may go too far in many places but he's not wrong about this. So basically you liked it when he talked to moderate left wing people, then once he started talking to the right wingers he became a craven hack. God you people are easy. 

Also, disregarding all of my other correct points because I got one thing a little bit wrong is *definitely* how you're going to own the cons. Any gays in this comment section? Thank goodness. Comedy was dying until our lord and savior Dave ~~Koch~~, sorry Dave Rubin came along to save the day. The bit when he said conservatives are nicely dressed and married in particular was hilarious. I mean, why aren't lefty comics making jokes like that? What are they fucking stupid or something? They need to broaden their horizons and participate in the free exchange in the marketplace of ideas™. I don't know why they don't. Maybe its just all the soy amirite^amirite?She said his husband prepared all interview questions and Rubin was essentially just a cue card reading monkey.

As somebody said, the only time Dave doesn't sound completely dumb and inarticulate is when he's reading script. Maybe his husband didn't write all of his material, since so much of his direct messages are just copy pastes, but he was almost certainly heavily involved (kind of ironic when direct messages are supposed to be Dave's unfiltered thoughts).

It's also reasonable to assume that if his husband wrote interview questions for Rubin's TYT show he also does it on Rubin Report.Dave never engages in identity politics. How could he? He's gay and he's married to a dude after all. He never repeatedly brings that up in order to validate his anti-left takes. And then there's Candace Owen. She's black AND conservative. Woah. It's not like that's her entire brand and what many people like Rubin seem to glean her legitimacy from. No no no. Rubin likes Candace because of her BIG IDEAS like how she's can be black AND a conservative. Also, did i mention Rubin is gay and married to another dude. CrazySorry, I am not aware. If he is (which I need proof for), I would have never posted it in here.No because that's not what anyone is saying. YouTube, not the advertisers, is determining that this type of content is not safe for advertisers and thus demonitises them.Yes, advertisers don't care about the content unless it makes them look bad. They trust YouTube not to put it along side "unsafe" content.There are probably other camera people that we can see in the frame. I for one am absolutely shocked by this resultSo cynical. You forgot all about Yelp reviews!There has been something (4-5 years back when I was watching "sceptics" on youtube) off putting about her and her content. And not just her plagiarism that was later exposed. I remember and when I watched one of her videos that was about science in abortion, she said she knows wtf she is talking about, because she was medicinal degree student... which later turned out to be a nursing school which she left early on. Her clickbaity titles, her forced personality... everything about her seemed fake to me.

You have to realize that the vast majority of successful youtubers that focus on politics and culture war are grifters that don't know wtf they talk about, have no depth of knowledge and can't do research well beside flat earth and anti-sjw shit that maybe few people in Evergreen trust. Rubin is not an exception but the rule and so is she. 

Don't trust youtube personalities (and trust them even less if they haven't proven to you yet), always be sceptical of them, even they confirm your priors and sound reasonable on surface. Do your own research.like i don't know that lolThat is what you call textbook filibustering. she aint got shit to say but airLooks like the Dave Rubin movement is withering and the intellectual full-of-shit web is looking for a new "liberal" uncle tom to fit the bill. They can. I know multiple both ftm and mtf who are gay. Most are straight, but that's to be expected. 

Rubin allowing this pile of shit so go unchecked is horrendous.I doubt Ben Shapiro would debate Stephanie Kelton. She is too smart for him. 

all she can do is memorize 10 second BS soundbites, takae adderall and say them 2 times faster

but her soundbites are so weak that even her extreme gish gallop doesn't save her - it takes a second in my head to debunk them

&gt; unemployment is lower than is has ever been

https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate

WRONG

&gt; Trump has brought this economy to a place it has never been at

doesn't mean anything but if we somehow interpret it as GDP growth then WRONG

https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth

and that's just the economy! i only picked it up immediately because i know these figures!Yes, it's a theory without evidence. I've never heard about it until the left-wing started to debunk it, and I'm subscribed to r/the_donald. Which means either 1. I missed it or 2. It's being blown up to a big thing when it is in fact not.Except Antifa is a real thing. Unless you're saying that it's a conspiracy theory.[http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Nigga\_e7fa28\_674048.jpg](http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Nigga_e7fa28_674048.jpg)It’s so low even Dave Pakman and Cenk’s nephew made it to the list.. so happy to see Kyle (secular talk) name on the list He’s pro Israel and pro establishment.. have been shitting on ocasio nonstop. What part of it isn’t true so I can provide you with evidence.&gt;she said 200million Americans make under 30k a year... but yeah Pakmans' completely out of line and a pro establishment shill lol.Wow looks like an exclusive club of ANYBODY 

i just hope Shapiro debates Kyle, so he can shut his nasally whiny mouth forever  He also said trump can’t read and ran that story for weeks when trump was inaugurated. It turned out to be bogus story and he never apologized for spreading false information. Alex jones is also reporting on theories. That was def a very low moment for David.. and he got a lot of attention for it. Fox News also reported on obama not being born in America as a “theory” 
You sound very tribal by defending your side against the same things you condemn the other side with.. Are you pro Israel? Curious Ok so were you ok with Fox News bringing up theories about obama not being born in the US. What do you think Pakmans intent is? Do you think he doesn’t have a certain agenda against republicans and specifically trump? I said: what do YOU think. Haha very political of you.. the way you kept dodging all those questions, maybe, you should run for office.. No.. at least she states her position as idiotic as it is. You dodge questions.. Define pro israel“Israel is just defending itself and is not the aggressor”Under that definition im definitely not "pro israel". I think they have a right to exist, obviously, however their government loves to throw rocks and hide their hands.Pakman would disagree with you on that.The "i'm not a victim" part of Milo's rant had me in stitches. Even though i don't think it's true, you can damn well be sure that Milo thinks he's one."Will Dave keep doing events with them"

Have they stopped paying money?The main funding of this guy came from Robert and Rebecca Mercer. They are the power players. Milo is just is just a pawn with unresolved emotional problems and was molested as kid. Yep, Owen wants to lock up journalists for doing their job, and "free speech" Rubin has got nothing to say or criticize about that. If it came from the left of course, it would be a different story ...

And she's so extreme, and definitely at least partly a grifter. For example; when she was on Rubin's show for the first time, she didn't have a firm position on the abortion issue yet ...

Now, how very "*surprisingly",* she's anti-choice, and she's come to the conclusion that it's actually **a** **genocide on black people,** but *she* made it out of the womb to talk about these murders! Jesus!

​

&gt;*But his commitment to free speech looks a lot shakier when it comes  to his support for Candace Owens, who only shares his hostility toward  censorship when it’s coming from the left.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In January, Owens*[ *called for*](https://twitter.com/realcandaceo/status/954225295980032000)  *the imprisonment of Hillary and Bill Clinton, James Comey, Robert  Mueller, Loretta Lynch, George Soros, Jeff Bezos and “ALL compliant  members of the fake news media.” Then she listed Jake Tapper, Rachel  Maddow, Anderson Cooper and Jim Acosta, as if the secret police had  asked her for a good place to start.* ***It’s difficult to think of a more  direct assault on free speech than a demand for journalists to be thrown  in prison for criticizing the president. But instead of admonishing  Owens for expressing near-total contempt for one of his most cherished  principles, Rubin has defended her at every available opportunity.***

​

&gt;*Just take a look at a* [*tweet*](https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1025802764180316160)  *she posted earlier this month: “Great news, liberals!* ***The plan you  hatched to exterminate blacks via Planned Parenthood is going well. 61%  of us never made it out the womb. Bad news: I did make it out and I plan  to be the loudest voice against the MURDERS you have committed.”*** *During  an* *interview* *with Rubin, Owens said Planned Parenthood was “literally built for the  purpose—and it served its purpose, you know?—to decrease the black  population by a lot.” A follow-up question would’ve been helpful  here—e.g. “So you believe Planned Parenthood is a genocidal, racist  organization?”—but Rubin just moved on.*

​

&gt;*When Weinstein says, “Almost all of us now want out of  fake division, other than those who sew and profit from it,” it’s  astonishing that he sees Owens as the solution to this problem rather  than the cause. Nearly everything she says is calculated to generate as  much hatred and division as possible.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Owens’s tactics mirror those of the hard left—particularly her  incessant use of imagery designed to maximize disgust and outrage  (genocide, slavery).*** *This is why opportunistic ideologues on the left  use the word fascist every chance they get. Unfortunately, some  members of the intellectual dark web have seen the utility in this  tactic as well,* ***but instead of seeing petty führers everywhere, they see mini Stalins.***

​[Areo - What the Intellectual Dark Web Can Learn from Orwell](https://areomagazine.com/2018/08/21/what-the-intellectual-dark-web-can-learn-from-orwell/)Shit you're totally right. It's gonna be some glib "i guess NK hasn't nuked us yet"What a sanctimonious wankerHe’s the red dressed lady on the street it has to do with Dave leaving for more than a month, which he let his supporters to know im advance so they could temporarily cancel his support, so you will probably see some donations come back

this is a non-story, what's suprising to me is that his Patreon numbers have been consistent and that only tenth of his supporters cancelled - his numbers aren't going down soon that's for surehttps://graphtreon.com/creator/rubinreport

look at graphtreon, it's a fluctuation caused by him being innactive for more than a month (also people lose 5-10% at the start of each month because of expired credit cards) - i don't doubt his numbers will go up after he comes back

this is hardly some continuation of larger trendno it's not, people at the start of their month have about 5-10% less than they have at the end of it due to expired credit cards

you can look at other patreons and you will see the same thingI think the purpose of him "going off the grid" for a month was to work on it. I don't know why he feels he can't do it if he's on social media or watching the news. Jordan Peterson is as un-conservative as North Korea is a Democratic People's Republic. But really, where is the diversity in Rubin's guest list? With VERY few exceptions, they all fall into his libertarian/ anti PC/ anti SJW bubble. When did he last invite someone that would be challenging for his personal views? Bad faith invites on Twitter to people that have zero reason to go on his show anyway don't count.

And if he made his interviewing style so clear, why does he constantly challenge David Frum, a rare guest to challenge Donald Trump, but lets Molyneux babble on about racial IQ bullshit without a peep? You bet your ass if someone said "I like socialism" on his show he would freak the fuck out and call Ben Shapiro to explain his guest why socialism isn't good, but calling Obama a communist or making other shit up is 100% fair game.What about the other question? Do you honestly think that he has a diverse set of guests?
I generally agree that one should avoid ascribing motives to actions with false certainty, but Dave Rubin just seems so obviously malevolent/ purely opportunistic in his intentions I'm having a hard time not to do so. His hot takes are ALWAYS horrible and vapid. He blocks people on Twitter for the TINIEST disagreements. He doesn't criticize Trump, full stop. How much cred does a libertarian get when he can't be bothered to criticize a wannabe dictator?
I think Rubin is at best plain stupid, at worst just a cunning fraudster.
Oh and for the record, the downvote isn't from me, appreciate the conversation ;) This is a conservative website btwwhile I believe that Hoppe flair ancapistan would lead to that and not by accident either (I suspect that's the reason why so many reactionaries, like in /r/anarcho_capitalism, are ancaps), this is just one premise and you would need much more than that for it leading to believing in segregation

for one, you can believe in a limited governmental system that could *potentially* lead to segregation, but you can also believe that segregation is immoral and unjust and do everything in your personal power to prevent it (living inside diverse community on purpose, buying from any group of people and also selling to any group of people)

this is a position that perhaps most libertarians hold, but would you characterize it as 'believing in segregation'?Exactly what happened to Jordan Peterson when confronted by Jim Jeffries. He literally had to reverse his opinion.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdvS2Re21Og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdvS2Re21Og)Not true. He refused to sell them any wedding goods. And would only sell them birthday cakes, cookies etc. ...Interesting to contrast the Rubin article with the Ana Kasparian article by the very same author. It's pretty amazing to me. I have about a thousand times more respect for Ana than for Rubin. Even though there is certainly some legitimate criticism or scrutiny on the Armenian genocide / Young Turks name-fiasco.

But god, is that article ungenerous, painting her in a real unfair light, and pretty dishonest too ...

She's famous for fat-shaming? She is against it – and once, in the heat of the moment, when Alex Jones stormed their set when they were live on air, called him a "fat fuck" and later apologized for it. It's completely disingenuous and misleading to call that "being famous for fat-shaming."

She is there as a *public relation strategy? "she values platform-building over her own intellectual honesty, which she’s traded in for a digital safe space wherein she can be paid to slut-shame the Kardashians."*

What a fair journalist.

And Ana Kasparian never refers to herself as a "person of color" as the author implies. Ana is always called "white" on the show and never refers herself as non-white, and actually; Armenians are the original caucasians, as they literally live in the caucasus region where the name stems from.

Checking his twitter profile, Art Tavana is a conservative, so really no wonder he likes Rubin and considers him non-partisan.

[The Complicity of Ana Kasparian](https://www.playboy.com/read/the-complicity-of-ana-kasparian-1)He himself said he's on the conservative side of the spectrum. He regrets not having voted for McCain instead of Obama. And would vote Romney over Obama today (said that on Rogan).

And Obama isn't even particularly left-wing, he also supported right wing libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in the last election. He considers Rand Paul and Paul Ryan the most perfect liberals in the US. Just the other day he called libertarian right-wing anti-abortion candidate Austin Peterson the only politician he liked.

He considered the election of Trump a win. He says he's going to vote Trump 2020, if the Democrats bring Sanders or Warren as a candidate, and he won't feel bad about it!

So yes, that clearly makes him right wing.

Also, he wants the next election to be between a conservative and a small government classical liberal. Which is both right wing. So the choice he wants the Americans to have in the next election is between a right wing conservative and a right wing socially liberal, fiscally conservative candidate. Again; both right wing.Shapiro also made some absolutely bonkers point when he said that if his sister chose not to marry an Orthodox Jew, he would disassociate with herRight lol plenty of things to dislike about Rubin but this isn’t oneYeah his justification was "It would be really disrespectful of her to go directly against how she was raised and what she was told to do by our parents." You can do that and I’m sure you’ll find lots of agreement in this suband tell me please if and how you find that headline misleading, because from what i read that's exactly he's saying

also this

&gt; (Other additions include accusations of selling out / wrong side of history and several other lines that usually are just projections of their own beliefs.)

i guess democrats are the real sellouts, right Rubin? 🤔it might very well be political (what's not anyway), but then again why are two republicans on judicial committee (Jeff Flake and Bob Corker) saying that they are not going to vote for his nomination (it's 11-10 republican/democrat) until the accuser is heard from? 

it's not just a partisan political maneuver and you are seriously underestimating the seriousness of this, maybe because you didn't read what this woman said and are just assuming that 'the libs are at it again', like that uninformed dullhead Rubin&gt; But a bare allegation should not be enough for any senator

yes it should be, at least to postpone the vote until more facts are on the table (which these two republican senators are trying to do)

it's not like the GOP has that many better things to do (what major bill did they pass this year? or planning to pass?) and I am sure that they have a plenty of time until 2018 elections are resolved&gt; believing this story is the left's constant wolf crying

your problem with believing an accusation is that 'the left is presumably hypocritical'? even if that's true, how is it related to what's going on with this accusation?that has nothing to do with left's presumable hypocricy either

and we might get some evidence it if the senate postpones the vote and hears her testimonylol i already posted it here :D[Some of the replies to Dave's tweet promoting the show](https://imgur.com/a/NlBRC33) This is the idea revolution. These are the true liberals who believe in the INDIVIDUAL. They haven't got time for that regressive shit.Well, that like to dislike ratio clearly demonstrates that its not just his most extreme members. Its a relatively small difference. Now i will admit, me cherry picking those tweets IS probably highlighting his most extreme or just willfully ignorant fans. But the point of doing that is to show how full of shit Dave his. His whole shtick is look "Look at that crazy SJW at Berkley or that one who yelled at me on Twitter. The Left has gone crazy and are dangerous to society." By his own logic he needs to do a direct message on how his fans response to this video was regressive and not in keeping with true classical liberal ideas.[this report seems to be really poorly made](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEIq3DHEb4)

again, Rubin's reaction is that it's a hit-piece and smear and he's right *by accident* (he would say the same thing if it was a legitimate research with the same conclussion, because he's a lazy BS master that doesn't know or read anything, he just labels people based on how nice they are treating him)
this motherfucker is really pushing it

now explain me, anyone who is conservative or likes Rubin and lurks around: a lefty youtube channel would say "Dave Rubin is welcome to go on my youtube show, including @learnliberty and Koch Brothers, which appear to fund his show"

would you be ok with that? that's functionally the same thing as he tweeted right now

now in the past Rubin dismissed anyone who suggested he's sold out to Koch Brothers (because Learn Liberty's main funders are Kochs) as a conspiracy loon because they don't determine his content, just because they offer him a portion of his funding, yet when he accuses someone from a non-profit that Soros himself funded the thing he didn't like, it's ok?

([Data &amp; Society is funded by Open Society along with ~100 other non-profits, including **mainly** Microsoft, so i guess he should invite Microsoft's CEO instead lol](
https://datasociety.net/about/#funding))&gt;There's  a lot of validity in Rubin's statement, and it seems like the kid  agrees. If we're going to be critical of the right, why is it frowned  upon to be critical of the left?

What an absurd thing to say, you really think there is any lack of criticism of the left in Rubin's show or by Rubin in general?  I mean even when the Republicans do horrible things, Rubin will find a way to blame the Democrats.

It's frowned upon? It's literally the premise of his whole show to constantly shit on the left, whilst mostly excluding the right from criticism, Rubin still hasn't even held Trump's feet to the fire! He promised he's going to be the first doing it, and here we are, still waiting ....&gt;I wasn't talking about Rubin, I was referencing this subreddit's demeanor to chastise the right while simultaneously being critical of Rubin &amp; Co for attempting to hold the left to the same standard.

You weren't talking about Rubin? The poster you responded to literally criticized Rubin, to which you responded:

&gt;*There's  a lot of validity in Rubin's statement,* and it seems like the kid  agrees. If we're going to be critical of the right, why is it frowned  upon to be critical of the left?

You were **literally** talking about Rubin.

&gt;Seems hypocritical to discuss strictly the faults of the right within this board without aknowldgement of the utility of what Rubin is attempting to do, which is to hold the same social standard to the left.

This is just completely convoluted. The person talked about the show, not about this sub. And I think in this sub probably everyone agrees that the left deserves some criticism, that's why people *used* to like Rubin, but they don't like the right wing, even extreme right, alt right/light (Cernovich, Milo,  Molyneux, Katie Hokins etc.) apologist/hack he has become.

Constant criticism of the left, no criticism of the right. Which is even more outrageous considering Trump and what the GOP has become, which is just a thousand times worse than anything the left does. But Rubin has no perspective; talks about some college kids being stupid whilst the Rebublicans are undermining democracy.

&gt;This is in contrast to public discourse that basically gives the left a free-pass in mainstream rhetoric without being concerned for the unintented consequences of their ideology. We hear this criticism of the right everywhere else, why would Rubin need to repeat a formula being perpetuated within the mainstream?

I get it, you're against the left, but that's like your opinion ... The mainstream press can't criticize the left the same way they criticize the right when they don't do stuff that is *as* deserving of criticism. This wouldn't be objectivity, if the right acts bat shit crazy, you're going to criticize them more ... That doesn't mean the left gets a free pass, it means they don't act as crazy ....&gt;If I'm understanding your statement here within the context of the paragraph you wrote, are you implying Rubin is an alt-right hack like Milo and the rest of your examples?

No, I might have phrased that not ideally, I think he's an extreme-right/alt-right/light apologist and a right wing hack. But I don't consider him alt-right himself.

And again, I'm completely fine with criticism of the left, but what I'm for is perspective. I find it absurd to focus that much on the left when the Republicans act the way they do. Rubin literally sees the left as the main problem at the moment. He said that people might be killing each other on the streets if the left doesn't stop with identity politics etc. ...

He said that the regressive left is the main problem in the US. He also considers the *whole* left regressive etc., it's not just criticism of a part of the left.&gt;I'll have to disagree with your assessment on his criticism of the entire left as being the problem in the US. Liberalism, by definition, is a left-wing set of politics. I hear an awful lot of Rubin being critical of leftists, which would be the extreme view of left-wing politics.

You don't know what you're talking about. "Liberalism", as Rubin defines it, which is "classical liberalism", is **not** a left wing set of politics. Most people understand that; on the left and the right. But you seem to be one of the few who still thinks Rubin is on the left. He's not, and he doesn't even claim he is anymore.

Here Rubin explains why he **left** the left:

[Rubin; Why I left the left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiVQ8vrGA_8)

Here he tweets that **leftism** is a mental disorder: (so yes, he's talking about the **whole** left)

[Fine, but they have to call it Jew Hatred 101. (I've tried. It's official: Leftism is a mental disorder.](https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/930296303480983552)

Here he says the left is no longer liberal. So Rubin thinks that nowadays being left and being liberal is not the same thing, being liberal is explicitly not on the left in his eyes, because the left is no longer liberal today.

[The left is no longer liberal](https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/824294053151850496?lang=de)

&gt;And he'll have good reason for it since that's the majority discourse with regards to public policy (IMHO). He's free to have on whomever he wants, but when it comes to being critical of an ideology, it makes little sense to have discussions by supporters than of critics. He's had on liberal critics too, but it makes sense to have on those critical of the ideology from the outside, which happens to be the right-wing.

You literally want his show to be about criticism of the left by the left and by the right. Yes, that's what his whole show is about; to shit on the left from every side you can ..., exclude the Republicans from criticism at the same time.

There was a video, but I can't find it right now, where a student interviewing Rubin asks him whether he has any criticism of the right, and Rubin literally can't come up with any, in the end he says they might be a bit too religious, but that even that is getting better.

He literally doesn't even know what to criticize the right for. If you think that's normal I can't help you.

&gt;If that makes him an alt-right apologist because he had a handful of the alt-right on his show, despite having those from the liberal left and otherwise reasonable centrists and right-wing people also, well there isn't much else we can discuss here.

That doesn't make any sense; that's like saying: "you have a problem he had a Neo-Nazi on, but he had liberal leftists and centrists also." How does that make any sense, you hardly think they're equivalent, do you?

And nobody criticized him for having them on. That's a complete strawman, the problem is that he's having them on uncritically, unchecked, that's all he was ever criticized for.Here is the video timestamped, Rubin literally doesn't have any criticism of the right, except for *“a bit of a religious tone”:*

[Dave Rubin on his career, free speech, and why he left the Left](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxjpfipA3vE&amp;t=7m0s)

Right after he lies about the right changing on gay marriage, allegedly taking on a libertarian view. That's not true, they still oppose gay marriage and they don't want to get rid of the institution of marriage either.I'm not going to respond to everything, as that is to time consuming ...

&gt;*"Liberalism", as Rubin defines it, which is "classical liberalism", is not a left wing set of politics.*  
&gt;  
&gt;You either must not be an American, or are otherwise applying Western-European political values to the American system of politics. However, even in the context of European politics, liberalism is at least center-left. In the US, liberalism has always been to the left as a contrast to the politically conservative right. People like JBP, Sam Harris, Steven Pinker, Stephen Fry, the Weinstein brothers, Eric W's wife, to name a few, have all made this distinction regarding the political spectrum in the US, and if you follow JBP's theory of temperament, it makes sense to call these people left-leaning liberals.

Rubin is not on the left, what are you talking about? This is just super dishonest. Rubin  himself said he's on the conservative side of the spectrum (in a talk with Ben Shapiro, and Milo). He regrets  not having voted for McCain instead of Obama. And would vote Romney over  Obama today (he said that on Rogan).

And Obama isn't even particularly left-wing, he also supported right  wing libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in the last election. He  considers Rand Paul and Paul Ryan the most perfect liberals in the US.  Just the other day he called libertarian right-wing anti-abortion  candidate Austin Peterson the only politician he liked.

He considered the election of Trump a win. He says he's going to vote  Trump 2020, if the Democrats bring Sanders or Warren as a candidate,  and he won't feel bad about it!

To claim he's on the left is totally dishonest, and even Rubin himself doesn't do it anymore.

And yes, in the US liberal means left, I'm completely aware of that, but Rubin uses the term differently, talks about classical liberalism, small government etc. this is explicitly on the right side of the spectrum.

And that liberalism in Europe is on the left is wrong. Liberalism in Europe means being on the right.

Steven Pinker, as far as I know, doesn't consider himself on the left, he considers himself to be libertarian (which usually is on the right). And that you think Jordan Peterson is on the left is truly hilarious. You're really one confused person.

&gt;*Here he says the left is no longer liberal. So Rubin thinks that nowadays being left and being liberal is not the same thing, being liberal is explicitly not on the left in his eyes, because the left is no longer liberal today.*  
&gt;  
&gt;You're also missing the context within the Democrat's platform. Rubin has made it clear he's left the Democratic-left, and it is this ideology that is no longer liberal.

How dishonest, he left the **left.** Nowhere does he say he left only the Democratic party, or Democratic left. He said he left the left. Like; literally; How dishonest can you get?

I doubt I'm going to continue this conversation if you're just going to continue with lying.

&gt;*You literally want his show to be about criticism of the left by the left and by the right. Yes, that's what his whole show is about; to shit on the left from every side you can ..., exclude the Republicans from criticism at the same time.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Consider this. If your "house" has come into disorder, you're going to be inclined to be critical of it in order to "fix" it. This means being critical of what it is you understand within the specific context of that understanding. In this case of bashing the left but not the right, he has no reason to bash the right since that's not his claim to identity; he's not trying to clean house of the right-wing politics. What he seems to be doing is using the right as a means to understand the problems of the left, which is the utility of the left-right paradigm in the first place.

It's not his house, it *was* at the beginning ... Now he's **left** the house. He's **left** the **left**, he's not criticizing the left from within anymore.

How dishonest to claim the right is not his claim to identity. Rubin literally said he's on the conservative side of the spectrum himself and left the left.

You are one of the more dishonest people I had the displeasure to converse with. I mean, it's quite extreme.Here is a timestamped video where Rubin admits he's on the conservative side of the spectrum.

[Milo Yiannopoulos Talks Establishment vs Trump, Bernie, and Cultural Libertarians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pONZu_qXAno&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=21m35s)Here the video where he admits it as well with Shapiro, he says classical liberalism is technically defined as "conservative" or "libertarian".  Libertarianism, in case you don't know it, is usually on the right. The libertarian party in the US is right wing, their candidate Gary Johnson, the guy Rubin voted for, is very right wing, socially liberal, but very right wing.

[Dave Rubin Calls Progressivism 'Basically A Mental Disorder'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekTe7mWQNJY)&gt;I get that you're trying to make the argument that Dave was never on the left, given his statements of having left the left.

So you're just continuing to be dishonest? And that statement is again super confused and illogical.

Where did I say he never was on the left? Literally right above your post I said:

&gt;It's not his house, it *was* at the beginning ... Now he's **left** the house. He's **left** the **left**, he's not criticizing the left from within **anymore**.

So I'm literally talking about how he *used* to be on the left. If you've **left** the left, then obviously and by definition you've **been** on the left at some point. I never claimed he *never* was on the left. He was part of The Young Turks even.

But he completely changed his politics. For example in December 2015 he loved Bernie Sanders, agreed with him on almost everything. Now he would vote Trump over Bernie. And said in a tweet that he's going to fight Bernie and his agenda on every step.

He made a complete 180 degree turn in politics. So, please, stop lying about Rubin being on the left ...

Or lying about me claiming he **never** was on the left. I never said that. He used to be on the left, now he's on the right.**Hate crimes** are (often violent) crimes committed with a hateful motivation. It's got nothing to do with speech. If somebody beats up a Jewish person because they're Jewish, that's a hate crime.

Peterson is against **hate** **speech** laws.

So you seem to be very confused.

Peterson is against compelled speech, yes, but he also claims to be for free speech in general.No, you're *obviously* confused, because this sentence doesn't make sense whichever way you look at it, and especially considering the whole context, it doesn't make sense whether it **was** or **wasn't** a typo. That's why I said you seem to be confused ...

If it was a typo and you meant to say; hate speech. Then you're confused because he ***is*** in fact **against** hate speech laws, contrary to what you claimed.

Being against hate speech is literally his whole thing; the right to offend, the right to offend minorities, women, the right to offend everyone. That's exactly what he talked about in the Cathy Newman interview. And especially considering the context you tried to make the opposite case; "well, he is against compelled speech, but not against restricting certain kinds of speech, for example he is against hate crime (**speech**) laws." And that's just wrong.

If it wasn't a typo, and you meant hate crime laws (because maybe you've heard him arguing for those), those have got nothing to do with speech and so it made no sense to bring it up to specify where he stands on free speech; "*He is against compelled speech but* ***not*** *against hate crime laws."*

So, to claim this was just a typo, and otherwise it made sense and wasn't confused, is wrong. It's confused every way you look at it, regardless of whether it was a typo or not.Wrong.

&gt;*“It’s a demand that the population uses a certain kind of linguistic  approach,” he said. “It’s an appropriation of speech. There’s no excuse  for that. That never has happened once in the history of English common  law. It’s a barrier that we do not cross.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Dr Peterson said hate  speech laws were “bad enough”.*** ***“Who is going to regulate it? Who is  going to define it? I know the answer to that — the last people in the  world you would want to,” he said.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*“And then we’ve crossed* ***another  barrier*** *and we allow the government to compel speech for some  hypothetically compassionate reason? No way. That’s a really bad idea.”*

Example please?Totally agree. Devon Tracey is a despicable far-right prick &amp; the way he talks about race - IQ, well even Sam Harris would recoil from that. Tracey is absolutely a racist. Even Richard Spencer is an atheist and holds some left wing positions, that does not make him a figure worth promoting.C'mon man. What happened to the free exchange of ideas? Defeat my bad speech with good speech. Be a true liberal and give me some examples of this subreddit taking stuff out of context or putting words in Rubin's mouthI can assure you i am. I promise to be open minded. No gimmicks, no take downs, no ad hominems. If he really believes in free speech, which is his main issue, then why does he sue a journalist for calling him a misogynist, which is an opinion and clearly protected as free speech? Why does he sue professors for what they said in a private meeting, which was recorded and published without their consent?

And why is his reasoning that he wants public people to be more circumspect with they say? This is clearly intended to have a chilling effect to free speech.

No, he's clearly fraudulent.There really isn't much difference. At least in this case.He literally didntoh course he's completely out of his league when it comes to SCOTUS hearing so naturally he gives these "everything is so tribalistic these days" platitudes that have absolutely no value because he knows the moment he would give an opinion or even an actual analysis he would get obliteratedI don’t even know what this means?!???!!!!


Jesus effing christo!

Is this profound?

It’s just a non-caloric statement with no wisdom or value!

You can’t even tell where he stands! 

Just popping my head in to confirm Rubin is still a fucking cuck&gt; This tweet embodies Dave Rubin... an enigmatic, vacuous statement which he thinks reads like it came from the reincarnation of Ben Franklin.

then you have center for immigration study which has Tucker Carlson's and Trump's face on their cover which is somehow even worse (40 million illegals even if the biggest reasonable is like a half that number, then using the lowest estimate to prove they commit more crime per capita, immigration is destroying the economy because Americans are left with no jobs even if immigrants increase overall consumption type of 'reseach') 

for all the shit talking about Kochs at least Cato Institute has at least somewhat respectable research that is offen at odds with their agenda (they figured that healthcare is more effective when it's not left to the market even when they tried to prove the opposite lol) and some people in there are pretty cool and smart - Rubin wouldn't get a job there lol

overall i think he would get a job at many think tanks, though not Cato because he's too dumb to be employed by Kochs directly lolWho are 75% of these people? didn't he also recently join the astroturfed #walkaway movement, which is explicitly about leaving the democratic party and joining the GOP? 

why do you bother with these stupid disclaimers any time you say some Republican partisan talking point (i am gay, i am for choice except when i am not, i don't vote the gop because i live California so it doesn't even matter if i throw it away to libertarians) and don't come out and say you are a republican? or are you so afraid of losing your status of "the last reasonable democrat according to /r/t_d" because that's all you have to market yourself? because ultimately you don't have any interesting ideas or good analysis but only your status?except when he talks with Shapiro, then he's more ambivalent on that frontit was a joke, though as with anything Rubin related, extremely unfunny, uninspired and unintelligent jokei don't disagree, but also he bitches about youtube 'censoring' him every second day so it stopped paying attention to it since now it's just boring

when i go on twitter i only look for his politics takes because that's where his true stupidity and lolcow-ness and his utter stupidity truly shinesDONALD. TRUMP.
It's actually shocking that this guy hasn't been anointed a member of the IDW yet. I thought the only qualification was that you need to just blurt-out total non-sense based on old and outdated ways of thinkingImagine thinking Ezra Klein and Vox have credibility. In 2008 he said Obama hates white people. He's been EXTRA-dead to me since then. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIZDnpPafaAI sub here to see opinions I disagree with, the sub is small enough that everyone keeps it chill and i just lurk to see varying opinions. I used to really like Dave but now I just kinda see him as meh. He’s trying to parrot IDW members ideas but it doesn’t fit, he doesn’t present the arguments well, as seen on JREYeah i think it sounds dumb, but the shorthand makes it easier lol and exactly, completely agree.This has nothing to do with Rubin and you should stop spamming this sub with unrelated BS for karma, i am here for his lolcow comments, not for /r/enoughconservativespam contentthe only reason why Trump was againts TPP was because Obama was for it, that's it, that's how vain he actually is

also Hillary and Obama had pretty good reasons to support TPP except for "being working class traitor" or whatever&gt;He's a completely different person than the one he presents on Fox News in that debate. He tries really hard to be relatable and likeable, and it worked on a lot of people in a lot of ways it seems. This is something sociopaths do. Rather than affirming something they think, they'll try to pretend they agree with someone else in a way that brings your mind back to their own point of view as a manipulation tactic. One thing you'll notice him do is create the idea that he doubts his own point of view and considers cenks, and then uses that to kind of bring it back around to make the two look like they mirror each other. So it looks like he's making some sort of concession when the outcome is that cenk's point appears to be similar to his. There are also parts where he fake laughs, which is another thing sociopaths do. Mimicking behavior that neurotypical people exhibit to look more connected and invested in whatever's going on than they really are. It's an obviously fake laugh when he does it, so I'm not just saying he wasn't really laughing. The big one was toward the end of the debate iirc. At about 53 mins in maybe. Could be remembering it wrong.

Don't let him get off easy. What matters is what he does on his main platform, which is his show on FOX News, that he might be more nuanced and just plays an outraged, racist, Trump loving conservative on TV for money makes him even worse than an honest reactionary, in my view. I was surprised, too, when I saw him in the Roger Stone documentary and found him to be quite likeable. He's still no better than what he pretends to be.So politicizing it later is OK? Just in the immediate aftermath, when people actually care, we shouldn't? 
How deep in the sand is your head when you don't think a mass shooting of Jewish people by a white supremacist in this climate isn't inherently political? 2:58 **"i say short of being impeached - if democrats win be a landslide in the house and just impeach the guy, i suspect Trump will be reelected"**

lol Rubin thinks being impeached means Trump is getting kicked out, he doesn't even know that you still need 67 senators to convict Trump in order to kick him out lol

for a guy who brags about his knowledge of how the US goverment works, he doesn't know the 101 (more like pre-101) basics... and he has a polisci degree? also nearly everyone who somewhat follows politics knows this stuff (Clinton anybody?)

not only is he a massive moron, he's a massively ignorant moron pretending to know stuffKanye and Candace's relationship is the basis for like 50% of Rubin's content. Every interview links back to them in some way. I'm sure he'll never reference it directly, but he'll have to change course
