I think Democracy Now! is a great resource and give money to them every year, but I find it very hard to listen to Nermeen Shaikh's segments.  She just sounds... snooty?  I'm not sure how to describe it better.

Does anyone else have this reaction?Doug Jones is down in Alabama but is extremely close for the state, and is taking on the radical GOP candidate Roy Moore. The election is DECEMBER 12TH THIS YEAR. He's raising large amounts of money from small donors, and needs help from contributions and getting involved. If he can outperform even by 5 points by people showing up, he can take this seat from the GOP. Link below to donate or get involvedGuys this next 2 weeks we will see a draconian tax bill be put to a vote, a neck and neck senate special election that could go blue and destroy Donald Trump and Steve Bannon, both in ego and other ways, AND a vote for the future of net neutrality, yet again. Get motivated! Call and email senator Flake-Az, Mccain-Az, Murkowski-Al, Collins-Me, Corker-Tn, and Johnson-Wi. All of these senators have either not supported it or have been skeptical. Hell, even give Rubio a call, as he's been a skeptic too. On the senate election side, do what ive done and donate whatever you can to Doug here https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_jones_ad_2017?refcode=MS_AD_ACQ-DD_2017.09.26_X_Google_keywords__X__eyJjcmVhdGl2ZSI6IkIiLCJhdWRpZW5jZSI6IlJhcGlkUmVzcG9uc2UifQ&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500&amp;recurring=auto

And if you're pissed about this FCC dumpster fire, donations in support of Net neutrality here https://act.freepress.net/donate/internet_nn_wake_up 

Election is December 12th if you're in Alabama and I believe the FCC is just 2 days after. Hope you can help with even a call to senators! =]My best guess is that our Chaos President has no plan to actually push through these tariffs. It‚Äôs all just a staged distraction to change the news cycle and get the public‚Äôs awareness off of gun control efforts.

This morning Amy Goodman said theo germal and didn't correct herself and I thought it was funny.Today's show hilariously played the theme from Spaceballs! Good for a laugh in the middle of some not so funny news. 

Thanks Amy!Could it be because many democrats (and their lobbyists) have a vested interest in exploiting cheap slave labor from the Chinese people to undercut manufactured goods made in democratic countries with strong labor unions?  God forbid we support Domestic manufacturers over goods produced in communist countries at the barrel of a gun..Donde esta el sitio? No lo veo. how doest thou know?üòÇ don't know for sure but I was assuming since they are a non profit There are lots of good ones like that.

The things I hope for most is that she takes at least a full week off soon. She works too hard! She had a bad cough for awhile a few months back, it was very concerning.She's earned it. She can talk any way she wants.National anthem standing just encourages nationalism.Wish there was a spotify/youtube playlist of all their selections... :)now that is a great ideaI've been watching the show daily for about a year now. Have donated twice (and I am from europe). Needless to say, it's the best single source of news there is.

I have noticed that any time Juan is on the show, she gives a broad smile when she introduces him. He's a bleedin legend so I can concur, but I just find it quite charming.Where do I need to sign up to go see the show in person?  Thanks in advance!!This is what I'm thinking so far:
With all the political activism going on right now, it seems as though there‚Äôs a need for a tool specifically for getting people organized and out, to have their voices heard in a peaceful productive way.

I wanted to engage some Community Organizers (or other folks that face the same problems as them) to better understand the following:

* What tools do you use today
* What problems do they solve
* What struggles do you have with them
* What gaps are there in the toolset you use today?
* What tools would be helpful for you?
* What problems are you facing with organizing?


What I‚Äôve seen used so far (and I‚Äôm only just getting into this) is Facebook groups and Twitter. But this seems really disorganized to me.


We need to ensure their message is clear (One of the major reasons the ‚Äúoccupy‚Äù movement was broken up is everyone thought it was about a different thing. Ie: no clear leadership or direction)

Empower people to become organizers (They can look up a cause they believe in and see if there is a local chapter, and if not, they can start one

If you or anyone else you know that might be interested in joining, please let me know!
I really appreciate your help, and if you want to have a more in-depth discussion about this I welcome it, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

About us - http://AccurateRep.com/about.htmlI was just wondering if there's a radio show that covers the same sort of material but with a conservative perspective.  I enjoy listening to this show every morning, I would just like a conservative perspective as well, and am wondering if you guys have any favorites."This is a pivotal moment in American history. Do we, as a nation, join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee comprehensive health care to every person as a human right? Or do we maintain a system that is enormously expensive, wasteful and bureaucratic, and is designed to maximize profits for big insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, Wall Street and medical equipment suppliers?"

Apparently somebody, including Amy Goodman, believes that the United States with over a $1Trillion annual budget deficit can spend another mountainous wad of cash on another scheme that could never escape being hijacked by the corporate elite.

~toktomi~ Amy mentioned that Vice News is unionising and I asked the obvious question about whether DM is unionised. 

(I probably shouldn't have to say this but) I am a big fan of DM. I watch it every day. I have donated in the past. I will again when I have the money. I searched online and couldn't find anything on the topic.At the end of Noam Chomsky's AMA video, [he posed a question to Reddit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke6YXjaZ9HY#t=29m35s). After [some discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/bcj59/noam_chomsky_answers_your_questions_ask_me/c0m2puu) with a fellow Redditor, we decided the way to organize and unite people was through a number of actions.

One is to create this subreddit as a meeting place of people and ideas. The next was to help revitalize already existing places, like /r/protest, with information on how to get involved. Third is encourage people to join networks outside of Reddit as well, such as [ZNet](http://www.zcommunications.org/znet).

Ideas are encouraged, but the goal should be to unite different groups and organize actions. This subreddit is *not* for articles or theories about socialism or anarchism, those subreddits already exist. Let's get organized!Any tips on how we can be effective?So we have a small membership in this subreddit so far and the beginnings of some discussions, but no real direction yet. In order to keep the ball rolling, let's start with a simple question.

What matters most to you? What issues affect you personally and what do you feel passionately about? Anti-war, the rising unemployment rate, health care, marriage equality? Hello everyone! 

**First off**-- It is AWESOME that Chomsky has inspired the creation of this Reddit. I'm sorry it took so long to get the video up, but the reception has been great. I'll also hopefully have an unedited version with better audio up soon under a free content license. 

Anyways, it may seem trivial to some of you, but what do you all think of **[/r/RedditRally](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrally)**? I created it a while ago and have been waiting for something like this to announce it-- but it looks like i was just a tad too late! 

**The idea**: Reddit Rally would be where Redditors can post actions (vote on this poll, call this legislator, donate here, something creative, etc, etc) and additionally have the kinds of organizing discussions that have already begun here. 

**Why a name change?** DemocracyNow is a good name, but i think RedditRally really emphasizes the community we have here. A good name goes a long way and if we get the ball rolling, the name will pretty much be set in stone. Of course, i will add the current mods to Reddit Rally if you guys like the idea. Once we get the ball rolling (whichever name we decide on) i'll talk to hueypreist about a blog post to see if we can't **really** get things going =]

Thoughts?We need your help.

Twelve dairy workers have been fired by Ruby Ridge Dairy, in Pasco, Washington. They were organizing a union to resolve unredressed grievances and for that reason they were fired. Two in the last two weeks. Darigold (Northwest Dairy Association, one of the nation's largest co-operatives) buys, processes and markets Ruby Ridge's milk, but has refused to meet with them or their supporters in the faith community.

We think they should meet, and we'd like you help. Email Steve Rowe, Darigold Vice President, and urge him to meet in Pasco with the workers who have been fired. Tell him that, as a socially responsible company, Darigold should, at the very least, meet with these workers, and should encourage all of its members to engage in fair labor practices. Its members should recognize the right of workers to organize themselves, and should negotiate in good faith.

You can write to Steve in care of his administrative assistant: michelle.carter@darigold.com.
Please send us a copy at ofwm@ofwm.org
You can also call Steve at 877-632-6455. If you call, send an email to ofwm@ofwm.org to let us know.

Please share this with friends.


Peace and blessings,

http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bd30h/if_you_could_rally_all_of_reddit_around_one_idea/  Go add your ideas, and vote on the idea you would most want to Rally around. This might be the way we get the power and might of Reddit to work towards a goal we all care about.So far, we have talked about [what issues matter most to us](http://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyNow/comments/bcok8/what_issues_matter_most_to_you/) and [a few places where you can get involved](http://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyNow/comments/bcuuz/existing_groups_in_your_area/). We also need to [start asking what kinds of actions we can do](http://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyNow/comments/bd31i/so_weve_created_rdemocracynow_and_rredditrally/).

But what about people in other parts of the country and other parts of the world? What if you want to get involved but can't find anything in your area? What if you want to start your own group, but don't know where to get started or what kinds of actions to take? Here is a partial guide for people who want to become organizers, based off some limited experience that I have had working with a few groups. 

Note that much of this is written for American readers, but can be applied to people in other countries as well.



**Finding other organizations in your area**

Before starting your own organization, try searching for other groups that might already exist in your area. They may already be working towards the goals you're interested in or they might be interested in joining your group too. It's going to be harder to find people in smaller towns, so look around the nearest big cities to you. Also check college campuses, which usually have at least a small number of people interested in the issues. 

Also, look for local chapters of nationwide organizations, like [Food Not Bombs](http://www.foodnotbombs.net/) and [Veterans For Peace](http://www.veteransforpeace.org/). Check [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) for people in your area who are interested in the same issues you want to work with.



**Working with other organizations**

Keep in contact with the organizations you find. If you start your own groups with just a handful of friends, consider cosponsoring their events. My group in NYC does this often. We have worked with pro-education groups, demonstrators against the wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, support for the [BDS Movement](http://bdsmovement.net/). 

The benefit to this is that you can organize for a number of different things and build unity, but also choose which issues are the most important to you. If the BDS Movement, for example, is too controversial for your group, you can choose not to endorse, but continuing working with other groups on other anti-war causes.



**Start a book club**

This one is pretty simple to do. All you need is a handful of people and a place to hold it. True, your reach will be limited to only those people who show up and you're just sitting around in a room instead of changing the world. So what good is this? In my experience, a few things. 

First of all, it's a great way to meet new people. My book club has attracted some people who always wanted to read Chomsky but never knew where to start. When they come in, we are able to discuss in the book with them and recommend others. Additionally, they can give us their perspective and maybe give us some things we didn't think about. Reading enough Chomsky, Zinn, Naomi Klein, or whoever you're most interested, and then meeting other like minded people can energize you and get you talking about other things you can do. Besides the fact that it's a good excuse to finish those books you haven't gotten around to reading yet.



**Host a movie night**

Also, pretty simple to do. All you really need is a place that can accommodate a good number of people and even a decent sized TV or a digital projector. A lot of bars and theaters have them now and some will be happy to let you use their space free of charge (they'll make money on any food or drinks your audience buys anyway). Then you just need to advertise it to the public, fliers on college campuses are great, or online on meetup.com (not free, unfortunately), Facebook, etc. 

One thing to keep in mind is that you often will need permission from the filmmakers and/or distributors, so use your own discretion. In my experience, most documentary filmmakers really want their films to be seen and will be happy to let you do. Some even encourage it.



**Good old fashioned demonstrations**

Demonstrations can sometimes be affective under the right circumstances. You may not change policy, but passersby might take notice and become interested in what you're saying, particularly if they've never heard it before. They may even be interested in joining your group. 

To put on a demonstration, you're going to first want to learn about what you can and can't do. If you're on a college campus, find out what kinds of rules govern the school for those kinds of things. Also consider contacting [a local chapter of the ACLU](http://www.aclu.org/affiliates) to get information on the laws in your area and tips to follow. For example, you may not need a permit for a march if you are not blocking traffic and are not using amplified sound, but it will vary depending on your location. If you want to do acts of civil disobedience, make sure your members know the laws, consequences and their rights first. The ACLU can help. And keep it peaceful.



**Musicians, artists, and actors**

There's no reason you can't have fun while trying to make a difference. If you want to do a demonstration, try to get some musicians to come out and help get it some attention. Or find some artist friends who want to help make banners. Of course, this is all subject to your local laws (see above). You might even be interested in purchasing a [pocket sized digital projector](http://store.apple.com/us/product/TV748ZM/A), although use your discretion. Some people might not be too happy to see projected images of dead Iraqis for example, even though it makes a point.

If demonstrations aren't your thing, you can still use your talents in other ways. Find some actors who want to do some public readings from Howard Zinn's [Voices of a People's History of the United States](http://www.amazon.com/Voices-Peoples-History-United-States/dp/1583229167/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1268602987&amp;sr=8-1) or perform some street theater in the form of political sketches. 



**Fliers and pamphlets**

A good, simple way to get your message out. Do some research, document your sources (it's recommended that you use more mainstream sources, like Amnesty International and UN reports, and less Chomsky), and put it together into some literature. If you know some graphic design, all the better. Include information for your group so people know how to get in contact with you.

Not everyone is comfortable standing on street corners handing these things to strangers. A lot of independent book stores and coffee shops will be happy to let you leave them somewhere.



**Road trips**

Feel like you can't get enough done in your area? Consider a road trip. If you want to be part of an action taking place 5 hours away from you, see if your friends would be interested in hoping in the car to go there. Next weekend will be full of events happening in Washington, DC and activists from around the country will descending on the capitol. Connect with other organizations around the country to see what you can take part in.

If you're feeling really ambitious, you can even go international. Activists friends of mine have flown to the Middle East to help out and/or show their solidarity. There could be risk involved of course, so do some research and try to go with friends you trust. 



**Fund raising**

You'd love to buy a ton of movies, books, digital projectors, banners and plane tickets, but you just don't have that kind of money. Take some of the ideas above and see if people are willing to donate. As an example, this past Friday, my group held a fundraiser for some of our future plans. We booked a venue, showed a film, displayed some art work, had a few bands play, and got some actors to do some performance art. Many people donated and the bar (happy to have a ton of people there) even agreed to give us 15% of their profits from drinks for the night. 

Be creative and see who's interested. Many performers and artists will be happy to help out free of charge if they like your cause.



**Talk to people (even people you disagree with)**

Listen to what other people are saying. You're not going to like it all and sometimes it's going to be hard to take seriously. Some people you're not going to win an argument with. But try to find out what people's real concerns are. Obviously, I'm not suggesting supporting people who may be racist or sexist, but they may have legitimate concerns that we're not aware of. Listening to them will help build our worldview and give us new perspectives.

Town hall meetings are a great place to start. And if you're feeling adventurous enough, you can even try talking to people at Teabagger rallies. Some of them just don't know the alternatives that are out there.



**Tell us how it went**

Post your success stories here and on [/r/redditrally](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrally). We can help offer each other tips based on good and bad experiences we have had. Plus, it can help inspire other actions and continuing building our community.



**Suggest your own ideas**

I called this a partial beginners guide because I'm sure there are people out there with other great ideas. This is intended to get the ball rolling, but feel free to contribute your own ideas. And good luck!One of the easiest, closest and I think most overlooked methods we might use is quite simple: support credit unions. 

Naturally, we wish to encourage democratic methods of organization for society: workers taking over factories, etc. Credit unions are but one expression of this, of course, but they have certain points that the practical activist should welcome. They already exist, are already successful, and fulfill any requirement we have for democracy. They are a fantastic place for us to start. 

In the spirit of the old [friendly societies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_society), we can through credit unions fulfill our goals to better the lot of the have-nots, while simultaneously lessening the power of the haves.

What do you think?I would think this is obvious.http://www.democracynow.org/You know what I mean, like when Juan has written an article and Amy congratulates him. Or the recent induction into the New York Journalism Hall of Fame. I mean they have been doing this for years but the interaction remains really awkward (and cute).

So, yeah. Someone should do that.He was just about to comment on the Left's response to the Syrian crisis, when the satellite feed went down. Am confounded at some of my friends' FB responses to Syria, and would really want to know what his take is! What sort of things on here would people want to read? Should these just be self posts?

Should it be like an /r/activist_advice ? 

... That's actually not a bad idea in itself. Is this a place to discuss ideas and then make them happen somewhere else other than this subreddit?

Just trying to get an idea what others want to do, where the value is.I like that idea. I was also thinking that people could report back on actions they have taken. Say if you go to a demonstration somewhere, you can post something about the experience. What worked, what didn't, what kind of people did you get there, what frustrated you, etc.That's a good idea. 

Now, to keep things active and lively. Always an important point when starting a new endeavor.
I have some experience working with other people and organizations. The hardest part seems to be getting people involved. With all the problems and discontent in the US (and elsewhere) today, it should be an organizer's paradise. People are frustrated and want to do something. The problem is that the likes of Glenn Beck are getting to them first and giving them answers. They're insane answers, but for many people it's the only answer they're hearing.

The next question is how to motivate people to start something. It's not that hard to get a group of five people together on an issue, but many people are reluctant to take action when they are so few in number. It requires some people who are dedicated (and sometimes even courageous) to encourage others.

Education is really important too. I think Reddit does a great job overall, informing people about issues in certain subreddits, but it's disconnected from actions. Once people are educated, they may still need an extra push to realize that they can contribute to solutions beyond the comfort of their homes and computers. 

Those are some of the challenges we face, but they're not impossible to overcome. Private control over resources. It's the one major issue that isn't really being addressed by existing movements, and I see it as the central problem of democracy. How can we have participatory, collective decision making if we don't have control over the resources that...more or less determine the material conditions of life?

We should think of some moderate baby steps to take in the direction of public ownership of resources.More than anything else we need to start spreading values.

1. **Selflessness**: too many people are concerned with their own well-being over that of others.  Too often we let others suffer because it doesn't affect us. It's disgusting that many are only interested in a cause when they find out it may affect them personally.
2. **Truth**: lying as one pleases is not an issue of privacy, it is an issue of understanding.  How can we ever understand one another if we're all telling lies about ourselves?
3. **Knowledge**: it's not a privilege, it's a right.  You are free to learn as you please, about anything you please. 

Once we get that down, we can tackle universal health care, an end to war, unemployment, and marriage equality (and overall equality).

So start spreading those values around, but remember, the best way is by action, not preaching.  Act out what you value instead of saying what you value.

To get things started though, I'd prefer to see this ball rolling in the direction of finding ways to remove power from corporations who seem to most value the opposite of all these things.

**tl;dr:** Let's start by finding a way to remove power from corporations!I'm going to make sure my girlfriend and I will be at Hollwood and Vine on March 20th.Yes, this problem of action is a tough one. Personally I'd like to see some sort of internet TV show that focuses on labor issues. Fifteen minutes that takes one issue (like the loss of highspeed train manufacturing jobs) and explains 1. Why it's happening, 2. Who's making it happen, and 3. How to solve the problem. 

It would need to be more Mike Rowe-ish and less Noam Chomsky-ish. Or maybe have a worker guy and an egghead guy to provide both perspectives? I dunno. You'd only need five or ten people to do something like that, but if done well it could motivate thousands. The key is to have labor all on the same page. 

But really I'm just talking out of my *ss, because I don't have any background in labor relations or organizing or any of that stuff. I'd like to get involved, but the idea of working a phone bank or marching in a protest is 100% meh to me. There has to be a way of getting people to do what they do best (and enjoy) in the service of promoting worker and customer rights (or however that would be best phrased by somebody who knows the lingo). Might it be worth creating a post that links to other subreddits that address specific topics or areas?  

/r/electionreform comes to mind for me as an example.All people are selfish, deceitful and ignorant. But they're also selfless, honest and informed! Human nature is complex and contradictory, incorporating every quality humans have ever been known to possess.

I've always found that the best way to overcome the negative qualities you mention is simply to engage people according to the better aspects of their nature--and try to encourage them to act in accordance with them, and create conditions under which those qualities will predominate!

I think you're right to suggest that modern capitalist society creates conditions under which negative aspects of human nature, like selfishness, apathy and ruthless competition flourish. For this, and other reasons, I agree a primary goal should be removing power from corporations.I have been an activist / organizer.  I have lots of ideas about how to be most effective, but only one is really important: practice.  

Join (or start) an organization.  Attend meetings.  Propose ideas for actions.  Do them. If nobody comes to your meeting, keep talking to more people trying to get them there.  If your idea for action doesn't work, try another one.  Then, after you've been going for a while, it'll become a lot easier to incorporate other people's advice on how to be a better activist.The ones that stand out for me are ones dedicated to fixing our electoral system.

First, campaign finance reform.  REAL reform that stops practically requiring politicians to kowtow to the folks with the money, so they can worry about the concerns of the people.  Like Lessig's [FixCongressFirst.com](http://www.fixcongressfirst.org/).

Second, a voting system that fixes the numerous problems with plurality voting.  Allow voters to support more than just a single candidate, to break the two-party system and increase the diversity of views that can get support.  Approval Voting is my choice here.  There's even a subreddit devoted to voting discussions - [/r/votingtheory](http://www.reddit.com/r/votingtheory/).I'm not American but I do focus on America as I think that it will be the centre of change when the time comes.

* Campaign Finance Reform (this is crucial and action is needed immediately)
* Universal Healthcare
* Unionisation (to help raise workers rights and minimum wage)
* Investment in Cooperatives or other worker models


Although I'm an Anarchist I don't necessarily disagree with working in the current system if it results in incremental progression.I think the most important issues are:

Getting food to the hungry in our neighborhoods. 
Getting shelter for those on the streets and in wretched shelters and camps. 
Preventing the eviction of those that are losing their homes. 
Make sure our neighbors have heat, water and electricity. 
Getting medicine and medical care to our neighbors that need it. 
And to help organize those that have no voice (not to vote; but to fight for themselves in solidarity with one another). Very important issue!

And also one that is related to corporate power. Thomas Ferguson wrote an excellent book called "The Investment Theory of Party Competition" (cited by Chomsky, if that matters) arguing that the amount of money and organization required for effective participation in the American political system necessarily marginalizes people, and allows for blocs of investors to concentrate and invest in control of the state.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_theory_of_party_competition

Campaign finance reform is a fundamental problem that is easy to agree on, and is directly related to the larger problem of corporate power. Classic anarchists like Bakunin would agree with you!

I think working within the existing structures and pushing for small but meaningful reform ought to be an overriding principle in all of these discussions. The idea is to eventuate large-scale social, political and economic change, but the means needs to be consistent with the ends (no violent revolutions, no sudden upheavals, no...vanguard party leading the way)...and that entails slow, democratic, careful change.I agree.  As infuriating as the problems with the current state of affairs makes me, slow and democratic is the only way to create a long-lasting, stable change.  Sudden upheavals and violent revolutions will only catalyze polarization, and we can't afford to lose unity on our issues.i think alot goes back to land and food, i cant explain it simply but i think we can rebuild around land and foodUniversal Health Care, because the majority is for it, and it should be a slam dunk issue. If anything will work, it will be that.Absolutely. But it is a complex issue, connected to so many other problems that are being raised, like campaign finance and lobbying.

Still, the right amount of public pressure might do the trick. It worked for the Civil Rights movement in the 60s. Organization!Localisation of food sources. This will also take money away from big corporations that mass produce chemically enhanced poison to feed to the masses.An end to foreign wars, and with it, a gutpunch to the military industrial complex.  I would include an end to any prospect of a draft (an end to registration) and the auctioning off (or gifting, to host countries) of our bases around the world.

If war is indeed the health of the state, it seems an obvious place to start.I think your intuitions are good ones. Issues surrounding agriculture, the production of food, land reform, etc. are key to creating a equitable, sustainable and healthy society.I think that would severely dilute things. Better to have a strong central place to organize before we splinter off =]I'm not thinking as "go to these subreddits instead if you you're interested in this topic", but as additional places to go.  After all, those other places already exist - some cross-pollination could be good both ways.  More people for those other topics to go over and discuss, and when those other subreddits come up with action ideas, they can bring them up over here and get more people involved.ah, that works for me then ^^Funk the War is probably the most masturbatory thing you could possibly to to be "against the war". All it does is make rich kid activists feel good about themselves.&gt;a place to discuss ideas and then make them happen somewhere else other than this subreddit?

Perhaps [/r/RedditRally](http://www.reddit.com/r/DemocracyNow/comments/bcrei/whats_in_a_name_rredditrally_vs_rdemocracynow/) could be where we post direct actions? Fuck this Stalinist bullshit. I hope APOC disrupts this again, that's about the only thing they're good for.&gt;Although I'm an Anarchist I don't necessarily disagree with working in the current system if it results in incremental progression.

Working within the current system can sometimes do this, but rarely, if ever. Additionally, most of what you're proposing (especially campaign finance reform and state-sponsored healthcare) are reformist traps.&gt;Classic anarchists like Bakunin would agree with you!

I don't think Bakunin gave a shit about campaign finance reform. Bakunin fought the state, escaped from prison, and fought the state some more. He fought multiple different states across Eurasia. He was not a reformist, but like all anarchists, a revolutionary. There is no such thing as reformist anarchism.&gt;lying as one pleases is not an issue of privacy, it is an issue of understanding. How can we ever understand one another if we're all telling lies about ourselves?

So you are against privacy? I don't understand what this means.I'm considering starting up an organization in my city Austin to advocate for policies that make it more convenient to live without a car: for example, safer bike routes, better public transportation service, denser housing (changes in land use and zoning regulations to have less required parking and setbacks), etc.

At a wider level, these things benefit both the environment and economic justice, because poorer people generally have fewer cars, and fewer cars will help the environment.It's already turning into the /r/americanpirateparty!!!I'm against using privacy as an argument to defend the act of lying.generalizations FTW!Transparency, accountability and oversight -- in government at all levels, in business, Wall Street, Main Street.  These are not even partisan -- independents, sane Republicans, libertarians could get behind them.  They are general overarching goals that need specifics developed.  This group would be a good start to flesh them out and see what we could support.Dude, I meant Bakunin would agree that "working with in the current system" is a good idea. This is the part of the post I was responding to, and therefore what my response itself was about.

He WAS a reformist, and in fact Chomsky refers to his quote about working within existing institutions in the video that inspired this subreddit.I very strongly disagree with this notion, and don't believe it's well-founded.I don't think any individual is under any obligation to give you correct information, especially pertaining to themselves.Good for you?...so go troll somewhere else? 'All anarchists are revolutionaries', 'most reformism is a trap.' Such crap.i've read a bit-- just not enough of him.  to anyone reading this, i cant recommend him enough.

the concept of a commons is a powerful one, and is a completely valid and almost always unmentioned 'third way'; aside from private ownership and public [read gov't] control.'dont take food from strangers'is your sn derived by any chance from 'kibbutz' ?

yea its an area i'm intending to make progress in very soon.Anarcho-liberal.Food Not Bombs is awesome. It's like a free Vegan cooking class, and you get to feed the homeless.No, the idea is that human society is too complex to improve through revolution, and that notions of revolution or upheaval are especially immoral/irresponsible if we're seriously concerned with human consequences and the wellbeing of all.

The point is to work towards radical change, but effect it carefully and through democratic means. That involves working within AND transforming/eliminating existing institutions. That's a responsible and moral way to establish a basis for change, and then proceed with it an efficacious way.Are you a Marxist?Nope. I don't read Marx, don't find him very useful. Also, there's such a cult-like mentality surrounding his thinking, I find it really obscures important issues.Haha, excellent guess! "Kibitz" is actually an entirely different word, it means "to offer unwanted advice" or something along those lines--which I find appropriate for internet message boards.

I am sympathetic to the Israeli Kibbutzim, though. Good experiment.You should try it, they'd love you.Why? Because Marx also says a thing or two about the transformation of social institutions? Kind of tenuous.

Some elements of left-wing Marxism correspond with anarchist currents, anyway. That's why anarchism is usually referred to as a range of thought.Boston: www.bostonmayday.org

That said, maybe we can find specific purposes of each and have them work together? I don't have any specific ideas, but I really do think we should be encouraging one another to create things like this and find ways to work them together rather than fighting over what name we use or who will get more members or something. Oh i by no means wanted to create a competition-- i'm merely suggesting that we discuss which reddit is a better name and organize in that one before the choice is made for us by having too many people to be able to change it. Yeah, I definitely see where you're coming from. I'm just wondering if it needs to be an either/or issue. Can we have both /r/democracynow and /r/redditrally, each with a different focus? The names aren't that important in my opinion, but if we can manage to get two subreddits thriving and active in things, as well as working together, all the better. Of course, we'll have to figure out exactly how to do that without any unnecessary overlap.That's legitimate. There are things that I'm not crazy about with this stuff too. Making an internet TV show is a great idea and easy enough to do as long as you have an idea and some people who are willing to work with you. You can always learn everything you'll need to know about labor relations as you produce the videos and may find some more compelling and surprising things than you realized.Anti-war, marriage equality, militant anti-fascism, anti-globalismIt seems to me that we need a place for strong central organization as well as getting the word out about actions which RedditRally could be well quited for. 

Discussion and organization about the more specific issue of fairer democracy (like campaign finance reform) could happen here

Would you (and AndyNemmity) be opposed to joining /r/RedditRally, i will add you as mods, and adding me as a mod here? Then we'll do some cross-linking, and i'll see if we can get blogged? I'm not exactly sure what shape these will eventually take on, but you're all set as a moderator now. I have some ideas for this subreddit which I will start trying out in the next couple of days. Let's keep in communication about what you're planning for /r/redditrally and we'll work out what makes the most sense and probably do a little cross posting where it makes sense.San Diego, CA (USA)

My first piece of advice would be to pick up a copy of Alinsky's "Rules for Radicals." It's pretty much the bible of organizing. 

Thank you so much.

This right here, this is the foundation. We need sustenance, shelter, medicine, education. Everyone needs these things. We can build communities around these things, free ourselves and especially the poorest amongst us from the requirement to sink most of their life energy and resources into chasing these things.

If you do it right, you build strength.

The rest becomes so much easier after that.

\*facepalm\*"The looming environmental crisis". If Chomsky hadn't mentioned it himself, I'd think this was the wrong place to mention it. Heaven forbid activism gain momentum by being fun.I'm interested.  Are you on [/r/Austin](http://reddit.com/r/Austin)?Yeah, I'm on /r/Austin.  I'm basically waiting for a second person to run my ideas by before I went about putting together a meeting, etc.  So if you're up for it, PM me and we can get going.  Otherwise, I'll just let you know when I've got it started.Gain momentum towards what? More privileged-only street parties?

Hell, activism against what? One particular war which will only be replaced by another, foreign or domestic, as soon as it's ended?Actually I probably agree with you, it's just about strategy.  You can't do much towards whatever your goals are without people and lots of them.  You aren't going to get a lot of people without appearing appealing - this is just human psychology (maslow, alinsky, etc).

Activism (or whatever your word for it is) is a hard sell and as far as I can tell, a judgmental all-or-nothing approach hasn't been working well lately.  So some rich kids want to dance in the street and maybe they all won't become die hard converts and do other actions.  But some of them will and I suspect it's the only way they will.  I say more rich kids should be dancing in the streets, more masturbatory "scene" pseudo-activism and i hope they enjoy themselves because it will attract others.  Successful movements have always built a "culture" and have had a spectrum of strategies and levels of involvement.  The only people involved in Funk the War are already committed activists. They use activism as a social club and do ineffective things like Funk the War which make them feel good but produce no actual product.

Further, it's very much not clear whether actions like Funk the War are "appealing", and your appeal to mostly-debunked empiricism-free opinion psychology is disturbing.I'd like for this subreddit to make it as easy as possible to get people from being closet anarchists who only get to circle jerk around it on reddit or with a few select friends to being active participators in a movement which focuses on small steps with goals (and ideals) that anarchists and non-anarchist alike could rally behind.

As a student I am really curious about the potential universities have to be a part of this movement. As an aspiring entrepreneur I'm curious what sorts of practices I could incorporate into my business that would be a step in the right direction.Can you elaborate? What sort of information is in Rules for Radicals?Thank you for your support.
Last month, lab workers in our town got their employer to ratify a union contract after 2 years petitioning.  The local community began writing letters and displaying signs in support of the workers only recently.  I believe the management of the laboratories were swayed by local opinion to finally recognize the union.   I am hoping community pressure will also assist the Ruby Ridge workers in their efforts to improve their working conditions.It's basically a set of guidelines for organizers - ethical and tactical principles. He described it as like Machiavelli for the have-nots. There's not a lot super-specific information, but the principles themselves are quite practical. 

Here's a [sample](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:nESFAW4j21oJ:www.jasongooljar.com/AlinskyTactics.pdf+%22rules+for+radicals%22+pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgP16m46zUHcDIWCxmdqAdIoJAiGVf9Dh-DAxF0M-9s8y7ecAqdwWDztqcsNYmC5UUYHfBWkODxSA74euuAY6GQYkgz9syKuqrDLgRrq6ZLWXrdGHhVqTFi65UQfW8hNordwIvB&amp;sig=AHIEtbQKT1OEC3JQrp2IpWtZqsTWrjaq7A)Open internet for all.This isn't actually true - the anti war movement is one of the few consistent voices in American organizing. Just look at the web site of any committed anti war group, say Code Pink or United for Peace and Justice, or at the effort for the March 20 protest in Los Angeles, and you'll see that the message is the same as it was under the Bush administration.Creating more subreddits to hold the committees of causes we have decided to support. There should be a new subreddit to debate which committees to form and where.Free education seems an easy achievable goal.  The web being the primary tool to provide the needed content.Longtime organizer here, trained by several national trade unions and political orgs. Short list:

(1) Get training. If you can, take a job for a while with a community organizing group or trade union. If not, read all you can about what techniques have worked for others. Look especially hard at the two sectors I cited, rather than progressive political orgs, because in the US the latter still has a lot to learn from the former.

(2) Get humble. Recognize that others have working for decades on every issue you can imagine caring about. Survey the field and learn from their history. Identify elders in your chosen topic area, and talk to them.

(It's alarming to see that the OP had never heard of Alinski's Rules for Radicals. This isn't the only core text, but it's certainly one of the best and best known. The OP should take that as a sign that there may be more background study needed that s/he anticipated.)

(3) Remember this axiom: Paper doesn't organize people. People organize people. 

There are several aspects to this, but the core is that it's the human connection that moves people to start and stay involved. No leaflet, no newspaper, no video, no website, no online discussion  or campaign is enough by itself.

There is no substitute for one-on-one, face-to-face organizing. You have to go where people are, at home or in public venues. The internet is most useful to arrange meet-ups.

(4) Exposes are not enough. Inexperienced organizers think it's the issue that moves people, but it isn't. You have to be offering specific steps that move toward solutions, even if those steps are tiny.

(5) Expect everything to take much longer than expected, and plan on a lifetime commitment. You'll never be sorry you chose this path.

 


In a few months, UFPJ and the rest of these reformist groups will start canvassing and sending out fund-raising letters warning about the dire consequences we all face if the Democrats don't win the fall elections.   

It's true, they are very consistent.  I whole-heartedly support my local credit union.  Whenever my coworkers complain about being screwed over by a bank, I chuckle a little and advise them to look into joining a CU.I'm down with credit unions, I belong to BECU.I would also suggest that when you open your account that you make it a branch that offers free debit cards and shard branching. The former to enable you to make it your main store of money, the latter cause it sucks when you're out of town. I've lived on the opposite side of the country from my credit union for about 6 or 7 months now, and honestly haven't had a need that can't be met through online banking, my debit card, and shared branching.This is one thing I have not done, and need to do.

On Tuesday, voters head to the polls in Wisconsin for both the Democratic and Republican primaries as one of the country‚Äôs toughest voting restrictions takes effect. Wisconsin‚Äôs controversial and restrictive voter ID law could prevent some 300,000 registered voters from casting ballots. According to Wisconsin‚Äôs strict new requirements, voters must now have a government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot. 

While supporters say the law prevents fraud, critics note 9 percent of the Wisconsin electorate could be disenfranchised, a disproportionate number of them poor and people of color. The voter ID law is just one of several new voting restrictions passed by Republicans in Wisconsin since 2011. The state Legislature also eliminated early voting hours on nights and weekends and made it nearly impossible for grassroots groups to conduct voter registration drives.
