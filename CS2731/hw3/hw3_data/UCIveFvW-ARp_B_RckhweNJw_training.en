to mine here so turning to I guess
Entertainment News Amy Schumer said that
she feels quote really bad for women
more attractive than her a lot of women
I think a specific woman in the
interview is what spurred it she said
quote being a woman sucks I feel really
bad for these girls who are so hot
because guys can't handle it you can't
have a conversation I actually feel
really bad for them oh that's so sweet
respond the woman in question while her
boyfriend used Amy Schumer to help her
over a puddle what a gentleman that is a
gentleman yeah attractive woman where
her foot
placement is like just to add insult to
injury right right to the future to
think about like leftist they they don't
see individuals so it's just women when
she says I feel bad for women or it
sucks being a woman she's basically
saying it sucks being me and I don't
know how to say individuals so I just
say a demographic yeah yeah this is like
a beatdown plate and every stocks being
fat and socks
I feel bad for you because you're in
better shape than me like the fact that
you just have you just have the big the
big hips because you're you were a
football player listen I can Bob I give
God some don't pout you're stronger I'm
wearing black so it doesn't show you're
stronger leaner and quicker let's be
honest freak athlete here is Gerald at
Jim Morgan Jr is all that wine I guess
it's beating up on Michigan's actually
actually I guess helps a prevent s good
cardio best estrogen buildup in the body
aroma taste I guess I guess the
resveratrol and wine is good for that
yeah definitely hope that's why you have
that's why you don't have ladies to give
you nightmares well anyway you were
taught you just talking about like a
complete sociopath you don't even talk
you're not looking at jails or me
looking like this
well then I see my thoughts ahead ones
like a cat he's always plotting our doom
no protective I'm like plotting but it's
good stuff yeah James O'Keefe Dean Cain
coming up something that gives children
nightmares there's a video from a police
dashcam which shows we have video right
you actually shows despite a giant
spider ready and poised to attack a
traffic cop oh my gosh yeah do we have a
clip
that is look the thing is just it's
ready to pounce that is absolutely
terrible terrified the spider by the way
was later detained and questioned
regarding assault on a police officer as
well as his involvement with the
arachnid Brotherhood so that does seem
yeah okay okay that's like spider-man's
older brothers that gotten a mess you
know he wasn't all about helping people
he's all about our mess yeah deep fear
of spiders by the way this is this is
like snake island what you did to me oh
you say snake island actually in an area
of several areas of Texas but South
Dallas there are these spiders that now
actually work as a team and you will see
it have whole canvases Oh lighter webs
over them oh yeah yeah we were driving
by there one from we're on a road trip
johnny-boy and I what what is that we
walked up and it's just the look on her
face which oh it's just oh it almost
looks as though your it looks as though
you're staring at a tree through a
cheesecloth and a film of spiders we
made a spider or tweet the pictures I
instantly know now that you say that I
didn't know it was a team about camel
spiders oh yeah they're not really
spiders though technically what are they
what are they
there are technically closer to the
scorpion family yeah they eat like
lizards and stuff they're gigantic
so my buddies that served in the Middle
East says they'll go in a camel and just
I don't know I mean I'm very good mr.
visual with you do it we'll show him
again
we got it it's that's important up for
me that really ought that drove the
point home otherwise I would have been
very confused thing to the audio sorry
so finally if spiders don't terrify you
there's there's this tryna think about
introduced it just there's no way to
it's a new viral video entitled my
partner identifies as a dog yeah
I've been involved in a pet play for my
entire life a lot of people like to play
pretend that's a man tend to be an
animal yeah there's no man to woman
doing it I just never been a man and a
woman yeah start dating let's not put
this in our time capsules they say when
the student is ready the monster appears
yeah all the S&M gear yeah oh
every boy dreams of man's best friends
is it okay to call her Timmy's in
the well you want to do weird sex tricks
to him okay boy good girl girl good
actor was a boy yeah it's no longer good
enough just to be gay yeah you really
have to outdo the nice love just what is
this this is normally they're dressed up
as a dog with leather chokers and the
ball gag with the whole like ever gets
to go through a PowerPoint to tell their
parents they want a dog I'm gonna walk
it I'm gonna feed it I will brush it
that's not what Sarah McLachlan added
fine hard to bleep on that
what is completely both ways yeah the
trans if you look at the common we're
gonna hey whatever you want to do to
live your truth and in the same thing by
the way it is it's a transgender I think
male to female a female to male so who'd
have thought that surprised you'd keep
on going down that slippery slope and to
living as a dog and he says you know
puppy plays you as well or he goes I
don't know just hey hang me from the
gallows for saying the wrong thing I
don't know whatever yeah just just and
he says she says like well no actually
I'm a real dog but then later let's just
play it say oh you're a real dog yeah
but that's a crime no no I'm not a real
dog because you still have sex with me
you know but we can just treat these
people as crazy if they were if they
were okay with like yeah I'm kind of
psychotic
that'd be okay with that but they're
saying no I'm completely normal well
devised mental illness yes I just hope
Michael Vick kills this person we can
put them in the ring dogfighting when
it's actually good my I think it doesn't
kill anybody I always had a choice
it was tryouts who let the dogs out who
dog you're just lying dog related titled
it's just getting a little lazy that's
Augie dog he's a snoop now it's like
boys at Puff Daddy P Diddy than just
Diddy yeah they keep changing I think
John Combs Mark Sean Combs
so let me trigger the strawberry so
she's a male to female transgender
before becoming a duck so it's just this
complete concoction of perversion you're
crazy so which is bruised screwed up at
what's crazy it means what right now
we're actually you know you know this is
absurd yeah yeah we're just talking yeah
sure about jazz Jennings yesterday know
yesterday was advocate two days ago
talking about his her her penis or his
penis to a girl I know it's a slice it
in half inverted banana split that whole
business and you have to make sure
there's enough tissue so that you can do
that inject yourself full of cancerous
estrogen we know what it does to the
male body when injected in an excess
amounts and this person then still by
the way doesn't change your chromosomes
doesn't affect the body tries to close
it as a womb yeah and then they say well
we all go along no you don't get the
drug every seer is the point everyone
has a line you don't get to draw the
line on someone putting on S&M gear
walking around like a tamagotchi or nano
pet when you allow jazz Jennings they
are both equally absurd you don't get to
draw your own line by the way there's
more to this I actually spoke with my
fiance who's in the medical field about
this and apparently you have to keep
inserting something into it yes
and gradually be bigger because it's
close and close itself at the wound does
it change him because no you're still
thinking about the dog this is the
filleting of the penis we'll go back to
something more sane like how is it not
an illness if you require surgery and a
wife is a nurse I want to yes yes you
basically said so you have to insert a
a dildo or some sort whatever right and
you have to whoa whoa sorry you can
believe that I guess I don't know and
then you have to keep it like it doesn't
produce its own moisture and so you have
to keep it like that
wait is that actually a thing no about
that we're not supposed to you can't use
the word moisture on the show yeah we're
gonna block them yeah that's a bleep for
sure it's just just like with
transgenderism where caitlyn jenner just
becomes a walking Barbie doll right it's
like hey I think I'm all of the
stereotypes that we you know have
perfected that we have perpetuated a
society or a patriarchal society of
women down that's all these transgenders
really attempt to fulfill they just end
up being a walking stereotypical woman
but we never call on that as totally
accept that it's the same thing here
these people they're only attempting to
perpetuate the fun stereotype of a dog
at least wouldn't win oh and I reload
the weekends we put some commitment into
it did you take a dump on my laptop woof
why would they dress as a blueberry for
some reason I don't know I think you're
chewing bubblegum I was in Willy Wonka
or opposed to I already feel awkward
seeing dogs poop out in the wild like
they always look over their shoulder at
you like why you looking at me if I saw
a human being doing this dress up as a
dog I don't know what I would do hopper
doesn't look you in the eye hey that's
no fear like a Hodgman yeah I don't like
the word either maybe like grossed me
out
I know really you wouldn't fare well in
Germany or San Francisco okay so
everyone everyone got all this topic are
we good yeah we're good
you can I got one more joke about it
okay this person has to go door-to-door
Petco to say that they're a sex offender
who let the dogs out that's it that's
all I got look at Penn ya little
bow-wow no Romeo yeah well now you're
not even dog just saying things with Lil
I don't know okay so we're gonna be
talking about because it's a slow news
week but I think this macro context
matters coming off the transgender dog
story Keira Knightley and here is it
Kristen or Kirsten I always get that
wrong I don't really care you know made
news recently for taking issue with the
classic Disney Princess film so both
kind of towards different approaches but
again if you
Google keira knightley if you google
Kristen Bell you can see just just the
laundry list of feminist complaints and
male bashing but in this instance they
were both very specific about the Disney
films they hate and why let's let's
start with nightly problems with I think
Little Mermaid in Cinderella Cinderella
mm-hmm and because you know she ate she
waits around for a rich guy to rescue
her don't rescue I mean the suns are
great but do not give your voice up for
a man made so I'm having that one's a
little tricky one bit now but I'm
kidding to give your voice up for a map
didn't Ariel gain King legs pretty good
trades a trade-off yeah it's a great
trade if walk on land by the way good
bravery going on a lesbians talk show
bashing men I dunno I will say that I
I'm gonna be won over all right this was
followed by Kristen Bell I think this is
an over like there's no clip of this
finding Snow White problematic saying
that she wasn't comfortable with Disney
films these are some quotes from Kristen
Bell every time we closed Snow White and
a look at my girls I asked don't you
think it's weird that snow white didn't
ask the old witch why she needed to eat
the apple or where she got that Apple I
say I would never take food from a
stranger would you and okay
nope this is by the way lit in the
article comes from parents come when she
talks about why she's uncomfortable to
Disney film that's the point the point
to it the witch work that is the
stranger danger it's a conversation
starter it's like Aesop family just they
can't write what are you setting to
follow the bouncing Aesop along the
bottom of the screen to learn to let
it's your job as a parent which goes eat
the apple and she starts convulsing in a
seizure for you go see bad things happen
are you just stupid to have children how
is this a problem that's the point
well the hilarious part is that she was
a princess in frozen she was Anna yeah I
know that let's try said the old ones
are bad the new ones right like she's
like Jack and Jill went up the hill to I
got nothing I hate these people
it's like the whole point Kevin Spacey
says tell me more about Jack did you
break his crown
what's a crown did he get to fix did you
break my crown is polishing straw you
know you saw the ride you butter took it
anyway
Bev Christa's go she goes time to add
don't you think that it's weird that the
prince kisses Snow White without her
permission because you cannot kiss
someone when they're sleeping
congratulations
firstly you've completely missed the
point of a fairy tale this is unreal
this is just the macro issue that now
all of a sudden there's a problem this
idea of princesses and princes and a
dragon distantly were talking on this
with Jocko there's a great book called
wild at heart it's human nature but now
it's become the movement just like me
too everyone's afraid to speak out so
Disney's been inundated with feminist
complaints lately and unfortunately been
crafting more modern fairy tales in
response princess we were here to save
ya know she can save herself she looks
at you look plenty and power that
breachers got a handle you know it's not
because we're man decides the English
page took a hard turn that's a burn
victim out there Ariel do you need now
we can't hear you
helper if she does oh she's
actively asked for it
title 9 you stay away from no joke
because she's and all the pop castles
that's the devil's triangle
you mean like the drinking game no seen
that coming Hollywood now thinks a fairy
tale is just a snappy story from a gay
guy yeah I just thought that Wow
no little boys like rescuing princesses
and little girls like being pretend
rescued yes here's something else that
people don't notice it and we'll get
into each kind of it we'll go through a
few examples of Disney I think it's
important to get into the specifics down
now why does this matter than why you
spend so much time in Disney for the
same reason that people complain about
there not being enough black people in
in films and then I laughed my ass off
and eating the Beast when they come on
and carbon-based fuel is the most
efficient source of energy
although second hold on a second ring
ring Angela Merkel oh it's for you she
says that's bullsh alright thanks for
glad to be with you last installment did
was with Jordan Peterson a lot of
feedback people really enjoyed it wanted
to get some more prominent conservatives
on the show just to talk about you know
most pressing issues - the most
requested person was our necks yes and
the topic we'll be discussing today here
in devil's advocate is basically the
merits and the drawbacks of socialism
he's the host of the Benjamin Shapiro
program on The Daily Caller thanks for
your time Benjamin absolutely skylark
heard uh-oh thank you free you
being here so obviously we'll be talking
about socialism if someone is very
popular at your shows where I do a lot
of you know QAS and you're very popular
in conservative circles and far-right
circles and all tried circles I've heard
a lot of this you know socialism is evil
socialism is theft I wanna know why you
believe that to the case I've heard you
talk about it because obviously in
principle I mean will be agree that in
principle it's good you know Old
Testament talks a lot about not
oppressing the poor giving to the poor
often the rich are portrayed as villains
because of their greed so I was a
descendant of the Jewish people and
faith who we're not agree that helping
the poorest among us is is a moral
immoral mission sure I mean that's
called charity but what is not moral is
stealing money for me to give to
somebody else on the part of a
government the points a gun at me that's
that's not an actual thing and the Bible
doesn't talk about that in any way did
the Bible and if we want to talk about
the biblical dictates with regard to
charity yeah
there's Emily Newton Hebrew I mean
there's master there's master Shanee
there's true there's pan like that like
there there's a bunch of different
aspects of Jewish law that talked about
charity but they are all relegated to
the the realm of private charity meaning
that it's more about my obligation to
give charity and less about your
rights to my money so we're supposed to
recognize that wealth belongs to God but
my wealth does not belong to you in the
in the biblical view sure well I was
using ignore as a moral sort of using as
a moral deem I don't really want to get
off on sort of the metaphysical and God
and that kind I don't want to get into
God's definition of what's necessarily
moral but the idea that as a society its
moral to help the poorest among us
especially when we look at systemic
right oppression of the poor as we see
we're not just talking about a level
playing field right we're talking about
a playing field where the middle classes
is shrunken dramatically we're talking
about you know wages have not kept up
with inflation the rich keep getting
richer that gap keeps widening so
there's a system in place which to me
yeah none that's true no that's no
that's actually true is the problem so
actually the middle class in the United
States the upper middle class was about
12% of the population of the United
States in 1979 and by 2014 that was 30
percent of the American population so
the disappearance of the middle class
folks talk about is really the middle
class becoming upper-middle class and
the standard of living for everyone in
the United States has risen dramatically
since 1979 one of the favorite
statistics folks like to cite here is
they say that there's been wage
stagnation in hourly wages since 1979
adjusted for inflation well that's true
it also doesn't not entirely obviously
because it was you know minimum wage
laws which we'll get to in a bit well
the fact is yeah we do that in a second
but the fact is that the wage stagnation
that has taken place does not take into
account additional benefits which is 30
to 40 percent on top of the salary it
doesn't take into account the different
way that we count households then we
used to it also doesn't take into
account the fact that you can get more
stuff for the same inflation adjusted
dollar than you could in 1979 you have a
nicer fridge now than he did in 1979 and
it costs you basically half of what it
would have in 1979 an inflation adjusted
dollars so if you're getting twice as
much stuff for the same buck now that
means that you're basically twice as
rich as you would have been in 1979 and
for anyone who disagrees I would
recommend you go back to 1979 and live
in 1979 and see whether your standard of
living is the same whether you enjoy it
well now we're getting back into the
meta economist Benjamin Shapiro if we'll
have a time-traveling machine let's try
and keep it in you know reality like you
say fax fax don't care about your
time-traveling machine
what about homes
what about homes you know what about
retirement middle-class family today is
much more difficulty affording a home
you know if you go back to the 50s you
could live in a single income household
and have the vehicle have a home retire
at a reasonable age that's not the case
now who really cares if you have you
know Frigidaire in your kitchen well I
mean I've got a couple of things about
this one homes in the United States have
radically increased in size over time so
homes back in the 1950s you can see this
when you go check them out
much smaller than the homes that are
being built now to the increase in home
prices is really because of this massive
urbanization that's happened where
people are rushing into massive cities
and these cities are heavily zoned so
that's created an incredible shortage of
housing in major liberal cities you're
not seeing the same sort of housing
shortages in places that don't have
those same sort of zoning regulations
places like Dallas places in the middle
of the country you're mostly seeing it
in Seattle LA San Francisco New York
places where it's difficult to build new
buildings and where the government has
mandated that you also build affordable
housing tax you heavily created new
regulations that's what's creating a
serious pressure in that sphere right
right so it's a it's the government's
fault I just wanna make sure I have this
this right so it's the government's
fault that people cannot afford homes
it's the government's fault or that peep
that the the wage gap is actually
increasing that the middle class is
shrinking I know you say it's not but we
look at the 1% who are wealthier than
ever before and the rest of the
population right that time oh no the
wealth gap the the fact that there is a
greater disparity between the top tax
bracket the bottom tax bracket is true
but the bottom tax bracket is a lot
richer than it used to be and again one
of the things that is a huge mistake
folks make when it comes to analyzing
economic issues is the suggestion that
if you are in the top 1% you are always
in the top 1% you started there you
finish there you live there you died
there there are people I've been in the
top 1% I've been not in the top 1%
people tend to get wealthier as they get
older and so the upper tax brackets are
disproportionately older than the lower
tax brackets again that movement is
suggestive of the facts that folks are
earning more and less over the course of
their lifetime it's not just like
there's this ingrown cased of people who
are born rich and stay rich inherited
wealth accounts for very little of the
the top tax brackets yeah well you know
I I've heard this talked about a lot
sort of class mobility so I think it's
often referred to what I've noticed it
seem you talk about going back to 1979
you talk about how these people will be
wealthier down the line as they get
older again we're kind of in the realm
of meta economics right things that you
feel will happen down the line but
that's not what's happening with these
people right now
when you're talking about these people
today in 2018 who can't afford to go to
college who can't afford to purchase a
home who can't afford health insurance
right Oh Benjamin Shapiro of The Daily
collars if his ideal world works out
down the line these people will be great
they'll be the next coax or whatever but
today that's not the case
well my deal worked out if my ideal
world worked out what you'd have is
lower prices and better products in
virtually every area of American life
from health care to colleges the fact is
the government subsidies are one of the
areas that's creating upward pressure
and prices when you give a bunch of
people subsidies to go to college what
you are doing is generating additional
supply or additional demand without
additional supply that creates upward
pricing pressure I mean this is a simple
supply demand curve and the fact that
folks on the Left don't seem to
understand this they think that if you
just dumped a bunch of money into free
college education that this is going to
somehow alleviate all of the all of the
economic woes of a society that is
already absorbing the cost of a bunch of
college graduates who can't get jobs
because they majored in silly things
it's it's a little bit bewildering and
in fact it's really interesting a lot of
the socialist countries that socialists
like to talk about the the quad you know
the quote-unquote socialist countries of
Scandinavia they have a lot more heavily
regimented idea of what colleges should
be for I mean if you look at Sweden if
you look at Switzerland there's a lot
more tracking people who are going to
colleges or vocational schools based on
the vocation they wish to pursue liberal
arts majors in in Scandinavia
significantly less of the college
population than in the United States
because they feel like if they're gonna
get the government to sponsor college
degrees at least you should come out
with some marketable skills okay so it's
interesting you point to a lot of these
candidate event countries and we talked
about that on my program quite a bit
Denmark Sweden Norway so it sounds like
you'd be okay with sort of moving toward
the more socialist model they use in
those countries that are really quite
successful we've heard obviously senator
Sanders and people like Cortez talking
about says a lot of people said there
are no successful socialist country I
would point to well I mean and and this
has become the favorite the kind of
favorite tool of quote-unquote
socialists today's to pick countries
that have built their entire wealth
based on capitalism and then have placed
on top of that capitalism some
redistribution of systems then call this
country socialist that's not a socialist
country a socialist country is a country
that uses abolition of profit as a tool
and nationalization of property as a
chief tool and public ownership of the
means of production as the chief tool of
wealth production and distribution
that's not actually what happens in
Denmark or Norway or Switzerland or
Sweden or any of these countries which
is why the prime minister of Denmark
suggested back in 2015 when Bernie
Sanders kept jabbering about Denmark
being a socialist country went to
Harvard Kennedy School government he
said we're not a socialist country or a
capitalist country all of these
supposedly socialist countries ranked
around or higher than the United States
and the Heritage Foundation free
economic Freedom Index than the United
States does which would suggest that
these are these are not actually
countries that are focused sincerely on
regulation of business above all and
redistribution of property through the
means of brigham a jump in there I think
it's important that we you know the
economic freedom index like we're
talking about there Canada was higher
than the United States for a little
longer even though they have a universal
health care plan so it sounds to me like
you're okay with sort of the model that
we see the Nordic model so then would we
be okay with a universal healthcare
program or a single-payer because if you
look at these countries that you just
said right are not socialist but then if
we're trying to mind it here in the
United States people say oh that's
socialized health care Universal
socialist right so the program can be
socialist but the question of communes
hire a country socialist because it has
a socialist program in medicine that's
that's a little bit silly I mean it's
like suggesting that you who have a job
and you bring home money to your family
and then you redistribute the money
among members of your family you have a
joint bank account with your wife this
means you're a socialist no you're a
capitalist who is who uses socialist
methods of redistribution in your own
home it's the same thing with Norway or
Denmark
then we have to look at the efficacy of
those programs we also have to look at
the rights of the people that are being
violated by those programs do you have a
right to your own use of Labour's you
have a right to the the product of your
labor do you have a right to the
alienation of your labor and then we
also have to look at whether any of
those even if you believe that it didn't
violate rights you'd have to look at
whether those programs were adaptable to
the United States which typically they
have not been because the reality is
that in places like Sweden or Norway or
Switzerland what you have particularly
in a place like Norway right is a really
really high level of cultural
homogeneity you know a high level of
capital that exists that doesn't exist
in the United States and quite the same
way so it's Mike's fault
that's one make sure that's what it's
the fault of the blacks know that it is
the fault of cultures that are not its
culture that's right I forgot what the
alright that's the Norwegians ask the
Norwegians have significantly curtailed
immigration from the Islamic world
specifically because they're having
problems of cultural assimilation I
probably have a really good conversation
because they have a higher higher
literacy rate they have more public
education there and of course their
populace is generally healthier because
they have socialized health care and
they spend less on health care their
population is healthier and has been
healthier for decades because they don't
need as much crap as Americans to
virtually all wealth generation that
happened in the Nordic countries
preceded the socialist redistribution
systems that people like Bernie Sanders
Elizabeth Warren of kasnia Cortes loved
Norway was actually ranked higher in
terms of relative health to the United
States in the 1960s and 70s than it is
now and that's because again these are
countries with very high levels of
social capital a tremendous work ethic
sure a certain level of egalitarianism
between men and women that goes back
generations that was not established by
radical feminism and what you've seen is
actually a lot of difficulty in a
similar similar immigrants in Nordic
countries there's a great book called
debunking utopia by nima Sun and Angie
that's that's totally worth reading on
this he's an actual Iranian immigrant to
Norway and he talked specifically about
the shortcomings of immigration in these
places it turns out that it's much
easier to become employed as an
immigrant in the United States than it
is in in Nordic countries yeah well they
also do have better
bitter healthcare outcomes overall was a
lower percentage of their GDP being
spent per average person so I was also
pretty important let me ask you well
care system is a disaster area but
that's that's largely to do with
governmental regulation no not the
blacks it's about it's not about any
particular race obviously it's about a
mishmash of regulation and deregulation
that has created some of the worst of
all possible worlds although the United
States still leads the world when it
comes to five-year cancer survival rates
for example so if you can afford health
care in the United States it's still the
best health care in the world
Benjamin Shapiro really color are you a
Nazi okay we're gonna move on so I've
read that you have made the claim that
capitalism is like consensual sex
socialism is rape and the one thing I
think that's interesting right now that
we're talking about is sort of where the
line is first if I disagree if it's
democratic socialism when we're talking
about the public consenting by a vote
and I know you're gonna say not everyone
goes along with it but that's true of
any law passed right democratically we
have all kinds of look that you'll never
get a hundred percent of people to agree
on a law but in this case we're talking
about socialism versus capitalism do we
really think that's that's a fair
comparison that it's like non-consensual
sex versus rape and where do you draw
the line I mean it seems to me like you
enjoy some some social programs some
socialism is okay you use public roads
if I'm not mistaken roads are the public
roads and public goods generally our
non-rival wrists and non-excludable
that's what makes them public good so
it's not quite the same thing right now
you're talking about
everybody's access to a road that
everyone can use and I can't exclude you
from use of that Road in the same way
that the military is non-rival wrists
and and non-excludable
that's the definition of a public good
that's not the same thing as alienation
of my labor so the question really is
your rights you know when it comes to
sex you have the right to consent or not
to consent when it comes to how I use my
labor I have the right to consent or not
to consent and you voting to remove my
right to consent or not consents does
not alienate the right it just means
that you're violating it that's
interesting that you know you bring that
up ray talking about the right to work
but what about what about
the right for example of people who are
working to be in healthy conditions to
be in at least a humane conditions are
these laws that you support you know
workers rights know what I'm getting
into unionization or collective
bargaining I like what they're
bargaining better than in fact if again
if you want to use these favorite
socialist countries as examples you know
places like Denmark and Norway ik have
have much more use of collective
bargaining by by unions for work
conditions than they have regulation
from the top down because that allows
the workers to actually negotiate with
the employers on what work conditions
should look like I don't have a problem
with private unions getting together
collectivizing and then you know
negotiating with with management but I'm
not a big fan of the idea of a top-down
cramdown that happens from a government
entity that rarely knows how a business
runs and again prevents people from
actually using their labor as they see
fit just not when it's public roads
police or military got it I just want to
make sure that I'm clear on it's not
excludable goods well let's talk about
that none rival it's not excludable
College then that's a great example you
you screwed up she has a problem that
she can't get past it so here's what
should have happened you shouldn't
mention that she had smaller breasts in
the first six months but I understand
you want to be honest if she laid it and
I've had this right am i perfect is
there anything about me that you would
change it's a setup
run name time dear Steven I'm a 26 year
old male and I've had the same
girlfriend for two and a half years now
she's 22 I wish to marry this girl one
day I have known her since very long I'm
deeply in love with everyone okay okay
we communicate very well we have very
similar values when it comes to morals
politics and religion we both enjoyed
working out staying active being fit
healthy although are interested for
greatly and how we do that what matters
is she cares enough to take care of
herself and look good the first of all
cause that's not what matters primarily
but like yeah you know we both you know
we're both Christians well it's just
same values but she's got a great set of
dick she ain't never gonna lose him I
mean everyone SiC transit gloria gloria
fades so do breasts mmm that was latin I
didn't know the Latin word for breasts
well next time do some research I know
Gloria fate I have seen your skits and
heard you talk about what women think
men talk about when it comes to finding
them attractive this has been the only
major point of constants of contention
between us and our relationship she
thinks that I do not find her attractive
she does not look like the stereotypical
American model this is her she has small
breasts now I feel bad about the joke
but not really and I made a comment
towards this the first six months in our
relation okay it's tough to overcome
them but you can you can for six months
even if it's some of this really
bothering if you're like this is the one
except for that you wait a little bit
and you know you find a brochure in the
mail where it's half off
you don't just mention that first thing
you just blurt it's like it's like a
Christmas story blurt not about the BBU
seeing Chris Lea bears buy plastic candy
store
okay and I made a comment about this in
the first six months of relationship
that is never that has manifested and
grown into an ugly monster that I would
have never envisioned the comment was
something like and he writes this out of
the script her
do you like my boobs oh me yes I like
them a lot and then in parenthesis many
other compliments then dot dot dot in
parentheses trigger button sorry again
this is this is the email then where I
stop quote maybe they could be a little
bit oh okay and this a monster was born
first off you come back you could
probably be a writer compare developed
from a heavy monthly discussion into a
weekly fight and now a daily one to the
point where she messages me big long
paragraphs and essays about how she is
not my ultimate physical preference mind
you this is only concerning her boobs I
have spent countless nights staying up
till midnight
to get nowhere with her just to midnight
she believes it the only way she's going
to feel loved is if she gets constant
words of affirmation detailing specifics
why I love her boobs more than all other
people I don't know that that's possible
to say rapunzel Rapunzel you have the
fairest mirror mirror on the wall yes
who has the best funbags of them all I
mean you have to say although all boobs
I'm either
even if she were you know like there's
someone out there who we haven't seen
yet yeah kind of like the best
basketball player we don't know it's not
LeBron it really quiet ears everyone we
were deal with with with disabled
veterans thing about suicide everyone's
odd comfortable now because of a guy who
mentioned is I feel like this guy or two
years ago this guy set a noose up for
himself and he's just been tightening it
ever said okay I got have to finish I
tell I tell her that you are my ultimate
physical attraction because I am in love
with you she tries to force me to
separate the physical from the emotional
to say that she is not my ultimate
preference and comment about what it is
about her boobs at lack attractive
qualities I tell her I don't even know
if I like bigger boobs in yours the ones
that I have had past experiences with I
didn't like more than your smaller ones
don't bring up past
now let's get use the objective smaller
yes just say I don't even know just say
I don't know I don't just say here's how
that could go right like I love your
boobs I have nothing to compare them I
don't have anything compare them to the
bass that's all I see first off this is
a joke I don't know if this is real
because there are a couple things I'll
get into here and then we'll wrap this
up right I tell her she ages she's going
to look stunning because she won't have
[Laughter]
don't care about the future is that I
was was your ultimate physical
preference so I know I've come a long
ways about the subject of this email by
now but all this conflict came about
when we started having sex I guess my
question is well do you think we brought
this problem upon ourselves on by having
sex before marriage I know this point is
probably and something that keeps going
going on okay first off jail I have a
bunch of opinions here what's your read
so I think there's a number of things
that you can kind of run through here
first off yes I think having sex before
marriage does something that it
shouldn't do to you right it focuses you
on a physical part of the relationship
that you don't need to be focusing on
before you've developed all the other
parts of your relationship together and
I think that's one of the biggest one
your case don't - wait yeah here's the
thing - but both of you guys are
spending way too much time so look I
think as you I want to kill Stephen so
many no look it you're I'm not a boob
guy I'm going somewhere all right I'm
not a boob guy but if I were a boob guy
I wouldn't judge a girl based on her
breasts that's not what you should judge
somebody on because no matter what no
matter what you have as your thing
that's going to change okay anything
else don't judge the one in the physical
appearance you have anything else yeah
but he's not he's obviously he is oh he
is it that's what you're saying okay
first off you screwed up okay you
screwed up by saying this with me first
off if it wasn't a prophet but was not a
problem for you
don't bring it up but if you're just
pointing out that she has small breasts
you're just being an ass so
I think that your this was a dumb
comment to make I agree with Gerald yeah
particularly as you said you've had
experience without the breasts I think
that if you're having a lot of sex
relationships before you get married to
listen think of two pieces of tape right
this is analogous they're sticky and you
rip them apart right you have each
person here and haven't sexually keep
ripping it apart it's that salt and help
sudden the tapes no longer sticky right
you have it's not necessarily a good
thing people think test drive all the
cars we talked about this earlier about
about orgasms about people who wait
until May they have far more uh
fulfilling sex lives they have sex more
on average listen this is these are
statistical realities I can make the
argument to wait until you're married
just don't don't have sex before he
married so you don't get some kind of
disease and emaciate like Tom Hanks in
Philadelphia but the truth is there are
a lot of reasons why it's beneficial as
far as this I will say you made a
mistake okay you repeated the mistake
when you talked about her smaller
comparing other breasts to her smaller
ones that being said she also sounds
like a psycho I would imagine that both
of you are very respected very vain yeah
so it seems to me that you would make
this comment because you're very vain
person and she picks up on the fact that
you're a very vain person and so it
really bothers her she thinks she'll
never be happy because of your vanity
and she feels as though she's not
perfect my guess is that's what's
happening right now there's there some
kind of triple levels deep of projection
going on because it's not especially
like I said if she's attractive if you
love her if you find her attractive
listen nobody's perfect no okay and you
need to get in you but you need to be
able to get past this so it sounds like
this is not a relationship that's going
to be conducive toward a long-term one
men are getting married to this and this
is still constantly coming up you
screwed up she has a problem that she
can't get past it so here's what should
have happened you shouldn't mention that
she had smaller breasts in the first six
months but I understand you want to be
honest if she laid it and I've had this
right am i perfect is there anything
about me that you would change it's a
setup run negative every time
here's what I always tell people your
husband wants to see you naked we don't
you're probably not perfect everyone
here of everyone that we are married to
or engage to there's probably something
that we would change about you
physically if we had a Photoshop right
and just hit shift this a little bit
okay right scale it maybe don't hit
shift maybe we do the whole kind of Tim
Burton vibe I have no idea
but we're point is every single thing
one of us here we have something that
would change physically no one who says
that is not the case is lying because
you're not perfect just like I know I'm
not perfect right just like all of us
know we're not perfect you think that
all your women think that you're perfect
no no you're not red spark okay um
that being said she can't seem to get
passes I think it's because she's
picking up on your vanity there's some
level that but either way she does have
to get past it yeah if you want to get
me this you're gonna at some point in
time say this is this is either going to
be a sticking point for the rest of our
lives
we're just gonna have to get past it
because I love you I want to see you
naked I'm attracted to you period okay
you're not gonna I don't want you
writing on a chalkboard 50 times that -
her boobs are better than all other boob
let me give you are you gonna end up kid
because if you can't handle this guess
what you're gonna be tried by someone
else by external factors let me give you
a prime example my wife is gorgeous my
wife has appeared every now and then in
video songs by accident and I've had
people that come and go oh yeah she's
pretty good she could use bigger tilt
those people guess what my wife goes
like yeah got small boobs I love them I
have no problem with it I'm not usually
I'm not a giant boob guy some people are
it doesn't matter I love my way it's not
perfect I'm not perfect my wit has some
physical scars so do i I want to see her
naked she wants to see me naked we want
to have sex with each other
we love each other that's really what
matters yeah right if my wife if like if
my wife and one poor is like there you
know you got one one ball looks a little
it looks different from the other like
one looks like one looks like it's like
a vertical Cadbury egg and one looks
like it's horizontal I'd go I guess I
never thought of it shall we continue
with their prior it's not that big of a
deal right now if it were something that
for example she were nitpicking about
saying like oh you know what you really
you really need to change your balls you
know whatever it is I have no idea I
really need to grow to get your biceps
bigger right I need bigger biceps oh you
really need a you really need to fix the
gray in your hair or something she can I
was in it for example my wife at one
point said you know you might want to
look younger since you kind of have
Gray's pretty young and I said you know
what no I'm just gonna go with it
and
this is this how it's gonna be and I
hope you and she said okay yeah now she
likes the gray hair that's fine see it
works out no one's perfect
but if you cannot get past this you're
not gonna get past the kind of crap that
other people will throw your way and
it's too late once two years of this by
the way that's that's a long time not to
be able to get over to some degree right
that's a long time you think at some
point they would they would be able to
like discuss it well I think if he's
been nitpicking like let me okay let me
ask you this are you getting into fights
right are getting into fights and every
now and then thrown in like a jab or
something like that like well no I'm
just bumping just mad cuz I'm hovering
cuz dinner was so small like you're cool
you know cuz we know how about we know
how to ID and I don't either when you
heard that and there did you you know
I'm wondering if you've brought it up or
alluded to in several always like have
you is this the only time you ever
brought it up was you she said am i /
and you said maybe your boobs could be a
little bit bigger which is stupid but
have you brought it up again since it
seems like it because either you have
which again is stupid many times over or
and by the way it could be and or she
sounds like she has real she has real
self-esteem issues that probably need be
worked out before this goes like the
same kind of major point when we're
talking about marriage don't marry a
project and don't improve yourself only
for the other person it's good when you
get married you'll find yourself
improving in ways that you didn't
necessarily anticipate because of the
other person showing you your blind
spots and that's a good thing
but your spouse shouldn't be the reason
you clean up your room your spouse
shouldn't be the reason you take care of
your health your spouse shouldn't be the
reason that you do a daily devotional
and keep your spiritual health line your
spouse should not be the reason that you
are driven and want to be successful in
business your spouse shouldn't be the
reason that you want to be a loyal good
friend and a stand-up guy who people can
rely on it shouldn't be your spot you
have to get this in order before you get
married to somebody because if someone
else on the opposite of the opposite sex
sex had all the problems I just listed
would you want to marry them and and
then if your answer to that is yes
that's because you're prot you probably
have self-esteem issues and you're
looking for someone who's down here so
you can feel as though you're above them
you want to marry somebody first if we
talk about being equally yoked right but
that things that nobody is perfectly
equally yoked that being said
if you're gonna if there's gonna be
discrepancy you want to try and marry up
you want to try and marry someone who's
gonna make you better than you are
someone who's not not someone for whom
you'll improve like I'm a complete loser
but I'll improve for her but someone who
will show you ways to improve right that
are more productive someone will be of
assistance to improving and becoming a
better person that's what you want to
marry I don't this is a miracle because
you're both managing to drag the other
person down but usually there's one
person but no come on no no no you get
back down here
somehow she's like it's like she's
dragging you down and then and then
you're climbing above her but then
you're like rockets and then she's
dragging you back down be the kind of
person that you would want to marry and
by the two women out there watch this is
not indicative of most men know you may
have small breasts you may have a large
but you may have a flat but you may you
may not have the perfect set of all the
parts you know what it doesn't matter it
really doesn't matter particularly if
you are already married to a man right
he doesn't sign on the dotted line at
that point if he's like well everything
else checks out except it's really gross
to see her naked yeah we don't expect it
to be perfect but I don't know what's
going on here
so hopefully that advice help listen man
look get smarter learn how you learn how
to deal with women better and I would
also maybe have person in a message to
send her side of the story because yeah
sounds like she's got some issues yes to
resolve it absolutely anything else you
want to say no no you covered though you
worse off from the generic PBS don't
judge someone by their appearance well I
was trying you interrupted a few times
dead gummit well I wasn't
Rumplestiltskin spinning gold it was a
woman who spent its pinnacle for some
years a needle that made her sleep right
yeah I don't know either way trouble

like in the woods boom
bertie's man camp is it really any
equivalency at this point genuinely
i want to know uh what are we that later
you guys have been pretty safe though
yeah yeah everywhere you go what's funny
is you know if i get recognized
it's like either people really like me
or hate me with you guys sometimes it's
just a novelty because you're like oh
two black twins
tacos and i remember the one guy was a
real fan he was like oh man mentioned
specific and then a girl was just like
oh i know you
yeah it's always that uh expression yeah
the cream pie twins
no no no no no double maintenance sounds
censored right off the bat but the guy
was a big fan i remember what he
referenced
okay listen leading the news um
president trump's meeting with kanye
west
didn't exactly go as planned uh
this comes from the hill possibly the
best quote ever that we've had in this
show
the rap star launched into a monologue
touching on mental health the prison
system
and improving life for african-americans
in inner cities you need it really was a
breakdown
if you watch the monologue it's a shame
too the two have actually been really
excited about the
white house sleepover for some time now
la
la la wait till i see kanye tonight
i had a dream of a sleepover with donald
watch netflix maybe eat some tacos
he told me he was gonna be so dope
though me
grabbing entrance by the truth i wish
everybody chill man i ain't one of the
clintons i ain't have nobody killed man
i pissed pelosi off of funsies make
america great in our onesies
i don't know what happened there exactly
it seems like you know what if that's
what it seems like it makes sense that
they
they they went off the rails in a pod
right i love how when when they were
inviting him over to like they're gonna
talk about manufacturing resurgence
violence
and prisons and i'm like you through
manufacturing resurgence yeah
and not talk about violence in prison
exactly really kanye knows a lot about
manufacturing i want popcorn with your
white popcorn
yeah just passionate every time
last name corn first name pop cut okay
was that good my toronto friends
[Laughter]
gosh drake buttersoft from toronto was
he the sprite guy that you used to
in the movie yeah yeah yeah oh my god
the whitest way to know him was that the
sprite guy hey was that the guy selling
the soda pop
all right another trump news alec
baldwin claims that ever since he's
played trump black people
love me his direct quote here's another
direction he says i think it's because
they're most afraid of trump
i'm not going to paint every
african-american person with the same
brush and then he does
but a significant number of them are
sitting there going this is going to be
bad for black folks
um funny enough i like baldwin for his
voicemails i don't give a damn that
you're 12 years old whether you're a
child
whether your mother is a thoughtless
pain in the ass who doesn't care about
what you do as far as i'm concerned
you have humiliated me for the last time
of this phone
i you know what's funny is he blames the
daughters
for homage i mean that's really not fair
i get the daughters of pain in the ass
but yeah
and your mom's a why do you gotta
throw that in there
you know apparently rating a 12 year old
since playing trump black people love
him hodge twins
i don't think so i think it's just
because he's cooning
wait how does a white guy do this wait
what yeah he's the first man he's just
it's amazing white people are cooling
for black folks now
i got bad news yeah black people
don't like you man they're not big fans
of
reruns of 30 rock that's not that's not
yeah a lot of people don't like donald
trump because these are
because they're racist black people are
racist
they don't like your white ass knees but
you get but you guys did say you did
tell me that that
some black people are afraid of trump
you thought nah
they just they just don't understand
them they don't understand he's missing
i don't think they really care about him
or politics no it's the economy right
i mean would you say that's true like if
they're doing well they're going to be
like i don't care wait a while
wait a while oh come on it really it
really depends on how
um cnn proceeds everything and that's
what also yeah
okay the sources are bad it's not their
fault i didn't really think that black
people were watching cnn
yeah that's who's watching the black
folks mama used to watch it all the time
really yeah she'll watch that andy
griffith will come on
and then she look at red fox and then
re-wrap it in son yeah
that's when you guys leave just like
every stereotype possibly
i'm watching jefferson's then you leave
and she goes
here's another what about uh how local
government works for you the houston
city council actually found a new
loophole to prevent a sex
robot brothel from dangerous so let me
explain this too because the story might
seem a little tough
the city council actually expanded its
definition of an arcade device
okay which are already barred from
operating within 1500 feet of churches
schools daycares parks residential
neighborhoods
so let me clarify this they're actually
they're classifying creepy sex
robots as arcade machines now because
those
are apparently easier to regulate oh man
you can crack down those which makes
sense actually given when you consider
what some people do with the uh with
their
well hey there you go hey come on get
out of come on
every day at least twice i've been sex
with eight machines
i want to go play that's the last time
that's the last time
those things look so you said that last
time that's the last time we let him
have sex with our arcade machine
did you guys ever play the hot shot like
the basketball hot shot deal in the
arcades but get those games i want to
play the game he was yeah exactly
my time apparently was misplaced i was
really good at that i should have been
good at the other games also is it odd
that uh
i have a walther on the desk but use a
2x4 with nails no because i'm not the
liability i don't want to lose them as a
sponsor
oh speaking of city councils things
doing that they're doing weird stuff uh
detroit now
is there areas of detroit being
designated as no spanking zones
this comes from detroit yeah they passed
a resolution to discourage corporal
punishment
that makes sense by creating hit free
zones in at least 10
public areas with signs that actually
specify that so
good to see detroit on on track towards
solutions yeah
hey how about not disciplining your
children
no shooting stones on the right track
was it yeah it's no shooting zones
that would be great right yeah that's
what i would have came up with but i
don't know here's
here how about this detroit no spain if
you have a dad take it as a win
let's go with that let's not get picky
at this point all right detroit like
maybe he has a couple too many comes
home starts swat that's fine
he's you're lucky to have him in your
life
we need more consequences not less
consequences in these situations beat
tan their hide you guys got weapons
lord you are so uncomfortable around
black people what did i say
you guys got whoopings right didn't
y'all get weapons
he starts talking like steve harvey i
wouldn't call them weapons that was his
beatings
straight lashes see i wasn't trying to
say that
but you did daddy give us lashes
yeah yeah oh yeah did they got the belt
make you go get your own switch oh the
switch
every time i try to defend you from
gerald's sort of assuming something that
stereotype that's right
you fulfill it i remember one day these
little kids was throwing rocks at cars
and we hit this guy's car nut it was a
white man
he was pissed he goes
and talks to my daddy i'm running away
from daddy for like days he finally got
us
oh my god he said i'm going to kill you
boy two states away
he beat us back he beat us real bad i
blacked out man woke up he was still
hitting me
i learned a valuable lesson though don't
throw rocks at cars no don't throw rocks
at a white man's car
no don't get caught throwing rocks at
cars thank you a real lesson
yeah god you know what i did the exact
same thing
except it was a pudding packs well
that's funny i used to love them lobbed
them from
atop the bridge yeah one time a bus
driver got out and kicked my friend's
ass
he stopped his route he just stopped he
came out
before a song there's a french canadian
[Music]
i understand
true story that's awesome uh hey by the
way did everyone know that it was
national coming out day oh
today my day if you've been if you've
been anywhere is this
that that makes sense i'm engaged to a
woman
now it makes sense what's the emphasis
he's queer as folk as ron paul puts it
yeah i'm coming out i'm transracial
i'm going about a white man crept in the
nigga's body
so how does that even happen well rachel
she paved the way for a lot of stuff
she did trendsetters did you watch that
the documentary that rachel dolezal
documented oh man i got to catch that
one
one beer by the way my eyes are up here
they're looking at the camera
like dustin hoffman and hook with the
clocks they're like
i can't handle it so national coming out
there was trending everywhere and
celebrate of course facebook unveiled a
new
coming out feature coming out feature i
think was a came out fishing
it was hard to read from the headlines
so let me read exactly this comes from
mdc
for the lgbtq community facebook is a
way for you to come out
oh good visibility is so important
because it changes hearts and minds
about being lgbtq
when friends and family see us living
our true selves so actually here's a
look at uh one of the coming out
features they're uh their emojis
okay which makes sense but facebook went
a step further in an ill-advised spirit
of balanced
uh unfortunately simultaneously
unveiling the drag them behind a truck
feature which was not received very
well oh dear god yeah that was um by the
way just for
you know we obviously we use a joke
because you know why not but uh
it's only happened a handful of times
gave you being dried behind a truck
when people talk about hangings
lynchings those those happened all the
time yeah right
yeah the gays behind the truck it was
like twice it was like at a m in one
other time
and the one it was just a gay guy roller
it was a fish tailing accident
how did this turn into a hate crime i
didn't know she was lesbian
i wouldn't have done it just trying to
have fun that was it was it was an
accident now the
it happened the other time it was pretty
homophobic they knew what they were
doing yeah
there were no rollerblades involved
a time to kill you she's that that movie
is rough
you're seeing free carly what freak time
to kill
they're with me you're not with me i
just literally picked up on the one
thing where you could have an excuse to
do a black voice with black people in
the studio was that black boys yeah
yeah that's what happened it was like
fruit
freaking i was doing it like a mob
chance yeah yeah yeah
this is why black people don't become
republican some because of the idea is
because people like you
hey listen hodge twins i'm so glad to
see some black twins tell the truth for
once
we're gonna go have a beer after this
and you're not invited i mean that in a
good way you can't not unless you want
them vomiting in the kitchen so you're
gonna have a 40 that's what you want to
say
no i said a beer i don't think you'd be
capable of a 40
yeah i don't think so neither 40s are
banned you know why they were used as
weapons
what did you know that's not yeah girthy
yeah we were trying to get a 40 at one
point
this was in missouri anyways and these
the the clerk said no they're banned
because people would take them
drink them and then break them and stab
the next guy for the rest of his 40.
blame the black people that's the black
people started that right
oh second i didn't mention d c no hold
on they copy paste that
that's what we call projecting because i
didn't say black anything
i did you did you did yeah it's him only
black people drink forties because there
was an ad once with billy dee williams
you guys need to you know what are you
you're caught in chaffed billy dee
williams what's happening
coat 45 does it every time
you see those commercials you just did
it again i did chris rock what
not rocco what's his name now he's just
picking random black guys little black
billy williams chris rock uh martin
luther king i don't know
it was like a movie no looking like i
like denzel washington
he's a good actor isn't he boys
i'm uncomfortable for you you i think
you doth protest too
finally and then we have another story
to get to before we get to the leftist
mob and uh this never happens news five
girls falsely accused a man of a
sexual assault boy really just because i
didn't like him never yeah what
yeah the actual story the boy's parents
say he was forced to endure the loss of
his liberty and other damages
Mattress girl some feminists to this day
they still were just telling the truth
there were text messages Facebook
messages from mattress girls showing
that it was alive which of the most
famous which is the famous rape hoaxes
would you say sticks out in your mind is
the most egregious we want to get into
this here today after Kavanagh because
the same thing comes the same phrase
comes up all the time there's a rape
accusation right what do we always hear
we are well I would a little lie you
know we need to believe it's just
another way of saying it believe
survivors it's why would you sort of lie
why would a little lie about rape why
would she okay you know why because
people lie that's it lie and it will
show you people lie for all kinds of
reasons sometimes for personal gain for
Fame notoriety flow game to harm an
enemy to get on the cover of magazine I
have known people some people have grown
tits to get on the covers of magazines
people lie all the time
that's not an argument the first day of
cabin on remember right before this
happened to all the time they were
threatening if he was confirmed some
threatened social media blackouts I
don't know the rest of us we're just I
mean they we don't care please move it's
depression
we shouldn't going on that wall earlier
than all right
top five rape hoaxes that I would listen
I would love to see yours comment below
number five is six out in my mind is the
Rolling Stone UVA scandal remember this
one where they wrote in Rolling Stone
they wrote an article about the supposed
a gang rape at university Virginia and
it didn't happen
guys hear about this story I remember
what's his name right yeah yeah Eddie
Helms was speaking at their did it
commenced yeah and he had to mention it
at because it was so awkward at that
point Rolling Stone actually was forced
to issue a complete retraction but don't
take my word for it
Rolling Stones managing editor published
a note today about discrepancies in the
victims story he wrote quote we have
come to the conclusion that our trust in
her was misplaced by discrepancy east by
the me they mean lies
I mean outright lies discrepancies I
hope he'd lost his job right work in the
foodie section somewhere they said he
just they just had confirmation bias and
that was their problem yeah the
confirmation story obviously and you
look at everything the support lesson
else who among us doesn't have a bias
and it hasn't entirely destroyed a man's
life was entirely fabricated false rape
activity what happens number four this
is one I don't even know what to call it
but it was really big that the Texas
teen gang rape this is no sorry number
four did I say number one no no it was a
their name was I think it was a Breanna
Talbott but yeah yeah she remember she
broke into a church body bloodied
screamed at three black men had raped
her so you know right away did you think
the medical team found not only no
evidence of sexual assault they also
found problems of the story and then the
team confessed that she had entirely
made it all up the wounds were
self-inflicted that's why I think this
is one of the most this is one of the
worst offenses because she took time to
hurt herself and burst into a church Wow
which means again there's got to be one
you Neve talked about how victim culture
will go why would they live why would
anyone want to be black in America why
would anyone want to be a victim of
sexual assault
I'm not saying anyone actually wants to
be the physical victim of sexual assault
threat why would someone want to claim
that publicly well I asked this person
why they would go through the effort of
physically harming themselves because
they thought they would get such a leg
up by accusing three random black men of
rape there is something to be said for
it even if it's just a crazy person who
wants notoriety yeah so why would she
lie she likes it rough you looking
forward to exile she just punched
herself with it so she knew cheap xiexie
Dempster ID no no no no none her died
because she is you know she did just
things that she would yeah so you know
she probably liked scraped your knees
with some sandpaper
it's a notification bail after subscribe
to the channel on YouTube because
apparently that doesn't mean anything
anymore so notification bill and join
Michael of course get the daily show
every single day not for free show
number three the Duke Lacrosse hope oh
my gosh this is the word you me get away
from these it really is I guess it's
just a bit like late Clarence Thomas
notice it's a modern day lynching
through public opinion yeah
and the people doing it they're rich
white liberals yeah let's more just
let's put the team right College Dean
yeah crossing the hardest Ripper for a
party I think yeah lacrosse players yeah
it was a pretty much all white team
lacrosse team they were ranked number
one in the nation their season was
canceled and all of this - yes
Carolina's Attorney General will dismiss
all charges against the three young men
well that seems pretty cut and dry yeah
yeah yeah this was like let me know this
you know because you don't follow up on
these stories the the hoaxer was later
convicted of stabbing her boyfriend to
death
you thought you got away from the
stereotype for a second man oh right
back into it you know what they say
hindsight is Twenty not rape number two
mattress girl violate some feminists to
this day they still were just telling
the truth about your rape yes no what's
the story that the Pumpkinhead who still
carries his Lantern around crane is that
what it was a head of Sleepy Hollow
headless horse mr. headless horseman I
don't know what the legend the point is
they still think she's lugging her
mattress around to this day as a victim
of rape we have there were text messages
Facebook messages from mattress girl
showing that it was alive she began
carrying this mattress around as an art
project and putting his name attached to
the whole story first time and time
again it garnered worldwide attention
got her a ton of she was on the cover of
New York Times Magazine Nungesser says
that she ruined his name and his rep
variable Robin that's right to an
education Columbia now agrees with him
and in a reverse title 9 decision they
have offered him a settlement why would
she lie right this girl that you didn't
quite beat herself up liar liar stone
going to a church
she just loved a mattress around campus
for an entire semester by the way go
read the texts they're graphic it's
they're worse than penthouse letters the
dedication you've ever read any of those
yes she wanted it up yeah it was it was
it was well and actually there's a lot
of if you read the text it seems like
she was mad that he wasn't in her I was
like yeah this is getting pretty crazy
Holly does anyone know this I've talked
we've had people on the show thing was
mark Duplass in a Michael Ian Black
where they met and like no yeah no idea
mattress go Mike no mattress goes Ally
but are you sure about that are you sure
yes yes but they're doing the same thing
with Kavanagh now do you realize five
years from now we'll be talking about
dr. Christine Ford don't matter well
still be toppled like hey remember that
just like Clarence Thomas yeah this
mattress girl was really think about
this stuff the guy's never gonna get his
name back no you know the first thing
that guy's gonna apply for a job they're
gonna run a search the first thing pop
up is not going to be Oh declared
innocent it's going to be this girl
carried a mattress around with your name
at Columbia for a year because you raped
her you're not gonna call back yeah no
it's going to change your name at that
point yeah it's on you just go to the
judge too much credit she wasn't that
committed she wasn't cut you know you
want us to believe you
Carrie Asura number one the worst hoax
to me and you may not have heard of this
is Emmett Till we have a clip more than
60 years ago Emmett Till was abducted
and murdered by two men after a woman
claimed that Emmett Till who is 14 years
old
whistled at her and grabbed terrible
Brown's mother held an open casket
funeral to show the world the brutality
of her son's killing the two men were
acquitted but later confessed to killing
Till and in a book published last year
by Tim Tyson the woman at the center of
that case Carolyn Bryant Dhanam admitted
she exaggerated part of her testimony
first off this is why I hate cable news
because he has to read that story yeah
and in a published a real story this
one's not even a rape it was just an
accusation of whistling whistling yeah
whistling with intent though whistling
with intent it's actually really
important to note by the way
it was Trump CEO day we open the Emmett
Till case yes yeah justice for them the
guy who hates black guys right yeah
the guy who hates black is the one he
was with justice for Trayvon justice for
was it to me or rice okay justice for
Mike Brown hands up don't you actually
it was a more like punching a cop in the
face reaching your ears on the cop shot
but here you actually have somebody's
completely innocent who was accused by a
lynch mob of whistling Trump really not
a peep what about justice ribbit till
yeah yeah yeah man what Obama said about
Trayvon yeah if I had a son he would
look like Trayvon
that's because he'd be a dad if I had a
son he'd be me are you if I had a son
you you can bet your ass you'd be making
purple drank along with everyone else
that's what he was doing what you gonna
do for Trayvon by the bonus rape hoax
the Julie sweat Nick the gang rape three
ladies came out right I think there was
there was one with no name right was the
lady with no name is after Christine
Ford and yes Deborah Ramirez it was
Christine for Deborah Mears it's just so
hard to keep straight I was like Oh
[Laughter]
health care oh Jesus well you know it's
good for you guys because we'll be
paying for your sickle cell creepy poor
lawyer Michael I'm and he pushed the
Julie sweat Nick narrative for who
accused Cavanaugh of I don't know like
gang rape parties the allegations from
Julie sweat Nick who alleged in a signed
affidavit she attended well over ten
parties she saw judge Brett Kavanaugh
then in high school
drink excessively at many of these
parties and engage in abusive and
physically aggressive behavior towards
girls first off a couple of things now
it makes sense they say a drank so much
you guys had you don't really drink that
often
that's why Cory Booker was asking
Cavanaugh do
drink on weekdays because like to maybe
do a black person that's like whoa he's
a drum house yeah Fred testimony I think
Captain oats an alpha male why would you
keep going if everybody this came out
and if you look there was a sweat nick
story right she came forward and she
said I can't believe it I was described
when I was brave and I said four and and
now actually the claims were so
outlandish because I wanted to focus on
Ford but this was treated entirely
legitimately either way let me talk
about it the news was released at 7:00
everyone ran with it and then it was
dead before lawrence O'Donnell could
broadcast his menstrual cramps like it
was that it was that quick but now the
left is accusing a vanetti of being a
plant from Donald Trump to try and
discredit the real accusers of Kavanagh
we don't want it to be lumped in with
the one who said gang rape train
Trump put him there to make us seem like
we lie that's a deep conspiracy really
deep conspiracy that goes deep I mean
you have to believe Trump is brilliant
you have to believe Trump is so
brilliant that you know he'd be so smart
that he could hire someone as stupid as
a vanetti trust him to carry the lie
someone just said the other day you
don't know what it's like as a woman
right now to be scared you know what men
are terrified right now especially me
[Laughter]
that's going straight to Eric the true
just think about this women listen no
one wants you to be raped Jimmy do you
have any idea how terrible a crime
rapist rapist get raped in prison
ironically on principle yeah because
they're hate child molesters and rapists
do not fare well in prison amongst
criminals they're hated because we're
considered a bad crime no one likes rape
even the arsonists
okay the serial killers think that
rapists are beneath them no one likes
rape that being said it is terrifying to
be a man today because guess what when
people said why would a woman ever lie
because people lie women lie about their
way to all the time women lie about me
whether they've had work done so then
there's a there's a there's a ton of
reasons for like let's say they're
kidding right now these women coming
full with rape like Julie sweat Nick so
the caterer figured out you got a cookie
by lying you know
did you already have a cookie today
after you cleaned your room no here's
another one red all right I guess you
better take all the cookies jeez he's
had a rough childhood kid that's what
happens people live because if something
to gain from a lie again but listen
alright it doesn't really matter usually
to get some free crap that's what it is
90% of women's faces are lies take that
make up a quarter hell are you this act
like a deep wound that you need to get
out a little bit right have you been oh
I thought you hung yourself the worst
the worst part about we want to believe
you we really you just said it right
dude universally it's bad we want to
believe you can you please just give us
some proof that's all we're asking and
this is the thing Liars think about kids
right you guys have kids the worst part
is an enabler of lies that's the real
problem and parents sometimes are crazy
just don't if your parents asked if you
we gave you so many so we just say no
and so then what you have here is like
you have you have a woman who comes
forward and potentially lies I don't
know about glue I don't know about about
what's-her-name for allegedly but you
have this lie from a woman and then you
have a lie from a Mike 11 Eddy here I
don't know Gloria Allred whatever so
you've got two lies then you have a
political ally like Feinstein who jumps
on board now there are three lies so
you've got this this sort of
amalgamation it's this it's all of these
different lies into a super lie it's
like when the Power Rangers became the
Megazord only with lies it's the
Megazord of locks the point is I don't
even know that the place it is is the
lying from all sides of the political
spectrum and or the gender binary so
political spectrum gender binary there
you go
comment away I want to see that bees
nest right now it's been going on since
the dawn of mankind and the problem that
everyone has hear people talk about how
we're divided and I've seen even some
people on the right go well maybe at
this point there be some time for
healing do you think you would want any
healing do you think you would want to
unite with someone who falsely accused
you of rape just like I don't expect the
woman to want to hold hands and sing we
are the world with a guy who read a
trade honor
that's a guy who was accused of running
a trade on a woman is going to want to
unite with her
that's silly instead of talking about
unity instead of talking about finding
common ground on this let's talk about
the truth
and it happens every few months it
happens every year or so and then what
just happens when the truth comes out we
forget about it we just go out Duke
Lacrosse another friends out now she
stabbed her boyfriend we know and we've
moved on from that story it's going to
the same thing with Brett Kavanaugh why
because it's as simple as this people
lie
our entire legal system is bet it's
predicated on this idea that human
beings lie and we have to safeguard
against it and we want to throw that
away why for Gloria Allred know people
like looting you hey there youtube

follow our next guest of course at Jocko
willing his website is Jocko podcast com
it's an incredibly popular podcast last
time he was when we talked about extreme
ownership but would Jesus co-author his
newest book I want to make sure I get it
is the dichotomy of leadership he was a
lieutenant commander of the US Navy
SEALs I mean the guy is just you
probably know who is Jack oh thanks for
being back sir appreciate it
I am glue this look at this this is a
our newest employee actually smooth mani
is a huge fan of yours so I'll have some
questions from him but he I went in just
the other day and saw just a stack of
these and I said is that Mona's desk
yeah that is that this Jacko celty said
oh yeah it's a whole story because he
doesn't drink coffee and so now I why
don't you tell it to the audience I
guess who doesn't because I was entirely
unfamiliar with this for my apologies so
I guess maybe I'm a bad person because
I'm super particular about things in the
world and the way I like things and so I
used to like to drink pomegranate tea
pomegranate white tea as a matter of
fact I don't know why somebody gave it
to me at some point I really like the
way it tastes it's God doesn't have a
ton of caffeine in it so so it doesn't
make you all jittery yeah anyways
eventually when I when I was on Tim
Ferriss podcast and we were drinking
pomegranate white tea and so people kept
asking what kind you drink what kind
what kind is it and I didn't really like
any particular brand because they were
all a little bit different and I didn't
really love any of them so I just made
one that I really really liked and put
it out there and people started buying
it and then from there I put it in cans
because you know sometimes it's kind of
a pain to do the whole heating up water
or putting a bag yeah I've tied that guy
what was the 10th person is 4-hour
workweek yeah so so I put it a can and
and then I kind of did that with a bunch
of other sort of supplements you know
like I like I like I like to be able to
drink protein but all the protein shakes
were always tasted horrible I had a
bunch of junket on so I made you know
a really good protein that tastes great
and all that stuff so that's just kind
of a little something that I do
unfortunately out like I said I'm I'm
probably too particular about things I
only like them the way I like them and
so I end up having to make what I want
and put it out there well you know it's
okay so that takes me to an interesting
interesting point because you are
particular I have been described as that
myself you know we're about to cross
three million subscribers on YouTube are
incredibly grateful for every single
year or listener means a lot I you know
you can either exalt yourself really
feel humbled by people who enjoy the
show I don't know your podcast just
completely exploded it's wildly popular
I recommend everybody check it out but
you are particular I'm kind of that way
as well how do you balance being
particular getting things right you know
with not being a dick well this is sort
of what the new book the dichotomy of
leadership is about you know nicely done
nicely done it doesn't say Glee because
I can see why you have so many
[Laughter]
incredible sarcasm detector it's a skill
like anything else but okay yes I is a
genuine question though I'm sure you've
it's you have different sometimes
different types of people and especially
as you lead people you learn this
different personalities have different
inner conflict so I'd imagine that's one
that people like you myself
smooth Manny share in common type-a
personalities yeah so one of the things
I think you gotta watch out for is what
matters and what doesn't matter well
like if you get wrapped around here
particular about things but your
particular about things that don't
matter and you let those things drive
you crazy or they you let those things
drive a wedge between you and your team
because you want things done a certain
particular way and it's things that
don't really matter that's gonna be
problematic so for me I think I did a
good job and do a decent job of
discriminating between what actually
matters and what doesn't really matter
and so I'm particularly by the things
that matter and and I the things that
don't really matter okay I'm gonna let
him slide and it's not that big of a
deal and yeah does that take did that
take some effort over the years sure you
know I was a little bit more particular
about things that matter less when I was
younger now I'm a little older a little
bit more mature I grew up a little bit
but now I can look at things I you know
what I'm not gonna worry about that but
these things over here I'm gonna hold
you right but a diet coke you're not
gonna let that slide I hope
we're putting that we're all we're
categorizing them it's obviously the
newest book to the shelves like you said
dichotomy of leadership where does it
sort of fit in with your other books so
you know good gets a good question is
why did you feel the need to write this
considering how thorough you know
extreme ownership is well it's pretty
thorough if you remember the last
chapter and I appreciate you give us a
lot of support for extreme ownership but
that's that's been great it's a great
book the last chapter of extreme
ownerships called the dichotomy of
leadership and you know we hit on it we
hit on the fact that as a leader there
are these dichotomies you and I just
talked about one there's these
dichotomies that are pulling you in
opposite directions and you can see and
as we worked with leaders after Extreme
arch that came out we'd see and probably
are probably my fault probably our fault
for writing extreme ownership and using
the title extreme because people felt
like oh we got to be extreme we got to
be an extreme leader they're like
skateboarding into their conference like
Oh kickflip and then take their knee out
you're like you're 90
stop yeah I've been surance seminars
yeah so so the extremities in leadership
generally aren't that good so the
examples clear examples like as leader
you have to be aggressive right that's
gonna be your default mode you got to
step in and make things happen but at
the same time if you go too far with
that if you're overly aggressive then
you take unnecessary risk and you put
your team at unnecessary risk you put
the mission in unnecessary risk yeah
so you back off of your aggressiveness
but if you back off to too much of your
aggressiveness well then guess what now
you're not being aggressive enough now
you're at the whims of whatever the
situation is and you're not making
anything happen so that's bad so where
do you want to be you want to be
somewhere in the middle another easy one
to to recognize is like talking right a
leader has to communicate a leader has
to talk but can't a leader talk too much
well absolutely
and leader can run their mouth all the
time and now people stop listening
because they're basically crying wolf
about everything that's going on so
that's bad so you back off communicating
so much what if you back off too much
well now you're not communicating enough
and the folks on the frontlines they
don't know what's happening they don't
know what the mission is they don't know
if the goal is and so that's a problem
so where do you want to be you want to
be balanced somewhere and again as we
work with leaders you know cuz I got a
leadership consulting company called
echelon front and we work with all these
different companies all these different
teams and as you work
then we realized that the biggest
problem that leaders have is trying to
find that balance so yeah that's why we
had to write the second book and you
know of course the first book did well
and so the publishers really wanted us
to write a second book really quickly
but we put three years in between the
two books because we wanted to make sure
that we had a subject that was gonna
really hit home and teach leaders
something that's important finding
balance so it's like mister you're kind
of like mr. Miyagi with a buzz cut it's
like find the balance and then you
armbar on them
move on to hear another you talked about
your book Mikey and the Dragons is that
miking the Dragons fighting the Dragons
up and is is this published yet is it
available it's not a it's not published
yet it comes out in November okay and
yeah it's available on Amazon right now
for free the big pre-order but now can
you can you tell me off there the story
with that can we talk about that or no
no it's it's a pretty straightforward
story so I I had an idea for this book
and I actually had one of those moments
where it was pretty cool I woke up in
the middle of the night and wrote the
first half of the book and then I read
it and I was like wow this is good and
another week later I woke up in the
middle night and I wrote the rest of the
book my my daughter and my wife woke up
in the morning and I said hey let me
read you something and they were both
you know my god it was like read it
again who's she was 8 years old inside
she was a leader again and my wife was
looking at me like kind of support she
looked at me like I can't believe you
actually wrote that so yeah which I took
like a compliment you know why can't
believe your daughter orders you around
so now we know admits to who wears the
poem yes trust me so so as I read the
book you know I really liked it I shared
it with a couple of my friends a couple
of my friends kids and everyone was just
nuts about it and it teaches the kids a
very important lesson and so I just
wanted to get this thing out this was in
the summertime I wanted to get this
thing published and publishing is a big
giant well the old school publishing is
what the old school media is you know
it's like well it's this big giant
machine that works in its own way and so
I went to my publisher and I said hey I
got this book you know I want I want to
get this book published by November so
people so the kids can have it for
Christmas let me get in their hands it's
an important book and they were like
well no we're looking at our cycle and
the way thing
work and it's a big you know it's a big
bureaucracy and it's a slow-moving
machine and they said we'll get it
published next cycle it's 14 months away
don't worry about it it'll be great and
I kind of said well no I really want to
do this thing publish can you you know
let's can you help me can we can we make
this happen and and eventually back and
forth back and forth and they were
trying to be accommodating but they just
they just don't have that kind of
maneuverability and finally they just ii
mean there's their quote was there's no
scenario where this book that's
published by november okay I said okay
fair enough so I you know hung up the
phone and then I started my own
publishing company and so you quit and
then created a spite publishing company
perfect that's a good example of a pivot
there and I I'm glad to hear that you
did that because we're actually looking
at hopefully the change my mind book
getting out before Christmas this year I
don't know I don't know that we can
because we have so much work to do but
this is a initially an idea that I had
pitched funny enough back to
conservative publishers many many years
it's about us writing it that's the
issue like we ever like have it all
written the balance probably but yeah
it's about me right we have hundreds of
pages we we took out a stack actually
was it two weeks ago
of just what I had what I had written as
far as like jokes and sketches this year
and I don't know how many thousands of
pages we actually couldn't take it out
of the box it's about 15 16 pages every
single day and that's not including the
change my mind is really about research
and making sure you go back to your
original sources and the point is a long
time ago I didn't have the name change
my mind I pitched it to a conservative
publisher and it was called American
idiots because at this point Green Day
was really popular and they you know I
remember I saw them in Canada they were
chanting American Idiot and I remember I
was the only American there going boh in
Montreal and so I even remember I
designed the cover because I had this
hand with a heart and like a grenade I
remember in mind was a brain basically
the idea that they'd been lobotomized
this idea was describing kind of
different sort of people whose mind you
can change whose minds you can't change
and identifying the difference at the
time we didn't have a lot of the
terminology we do today
point isn't every single publisher
turned it down they did not like it they
were like right-wing people don't do
comedy you know if you find like a
doomsday book where you can sell some
hybrid seeds you let us know
and then there's I will say it was a
small victory this exact same publisher
came up when we got the White House
doing a change my mind secondly
and said we want to do a book deal and I
was like yeah bet you do
so we will you know maybe we will be in
touch though we do need to definitely
have someone at least proofreading it
because man I am
I'm not dyslexic just dumb someone ask
you about this the the Dragons book
Mikey mostly miking the Dragons every
time so like any my could get around
like Matthew and the Dragons it really
sort of um from what I've read from what
I also have that you've sent to me it
talks about sort of the need to be a
hero fort for young boys and overcoming
kind of basic fears and there was a book
I read one time called wild at heart I
don't know if you're familiar with it
but it talks about how every man sort of
young boy needs a damsel to save a
dragon to slay but it's answering that
you talk about overcoming fear what made
you want to write a children's book it
specifically addressing these issues
well the primary thing is I have four
kids you know I have four kids the
oldest one is now 19 years old she's in
college I got a senior in high school I
got a sophomore in high school and I got
a nine year old and so I've seen what
what it does to all I've seen what it
does to kids kids or kids get scared of
things and there's pretty fundamental
principles that you can kind of take
action to overcome your fears and so
that combined with just you know again
diving into human nature all the time on
my podcast and talking about talking
about here as a person and you know I
had to overcome fear you know through my
whole life and you know like I was
scared of the water when I was kid I
ended up becoming a seal well that's
that's that's a good way of overcome
here here you know afraid of heights
okay guess what I jump out of airplanes
hey that's a good way to overcome your
fear of a good result of what we're
coming I was gonna say is it a good way
I mean just throw someone out of a plane
like I'm scared of heights wrong so
there's actually there's actually wigs
actually enough it's called exposure
therapy which is interesting because in
my first kids book I wrote about the kid
who scared of swimming and scared the
water scare swimming and so his uncle
Jake who's a seal who's a navy seal that
stays with him for the summer comes and
says oh you're scared of the water
here's what we're gonna do and he takes
him first to prison and they wait around
in the water then they dunk their heads
in the water then they start walking out
with their chest deep in the water and
then they chart treading water and then
swimming and eventually jumped off the
bridge yes and so I put that in my fur
look like and where I got that from was
my my middle daughter was wanted to be
the star of the school play but she was
scared of scared of the crowds and
scared of performing yeah so I said okay
sing it in front of me okay sing it in
front of me in your mom okay sing it in
front of me and the rest of the family
okay sing it in front of me and the
family and the neighbors and eventually
just build it up where she could get on
stage and she got the lead in the school
play
well I put that around swimming I hope I
stayed a little softer for a glass-like
sing it sing it it's good even drinking
so much white is not that much caffeine
but if you have five of them so when
Jordan Peterson was on my podcast he was
talking about how he had somebody
overcome the fear of needles by starting
to put the needle in the room and then
you put the needle in the in the
bookcase and then you put the picture of
the needle and they hold the needle and
they talk sonido blah blah blah then
they started doing heroin
yeah it's called exposure that's what
it's called it's a real psychological
methodology for people to overcome fear
and anyways so miking the dragon is
about being afraid and what guess what
when you're a little kid you're afraid
of everything and you got to learn to
overcome these fears and so in the book
it's actually a book within a book this
kid the main character Mikey he finds a
book he's actually scared of the book
because there's pictures of
scary-looking dragons in it but he sees
in the book also there's a picture of a
little kid that kind of looks like he
knows what he's doing and so he decides
he's gonna read the book it turns out
that the village or the kingdom inside
the book the King has died he was the
guy that protected the kingdom from the
Dragons now no one wants to face the
Dragons the little prince is like left
everyone's looking at him you gotta face
the Dragons he goes to his dad's war
chest he opens it up he pulls out the
sword the sword said too big for him the
shield he can barely hold up and now
he's getting being more scared I only
sees a note at the bottom of the war
chest he pulls it out it's a note from
his dad and his dad kind of explains to
him how he's gonna overcome these
dragons and the restless' story proceeds
so her daughter was the one who really
liked this and you said reread it and
this is what's interesting because we're
often told that right they sort have to
be separate the books for young boys and
books for young girls and I have to say
listen what's what's what's good for
helping young men learn how to be proper
men is often really good for young women
as well this is one thing I was
interested can you maybe kind of share
some if you have any sort of techniques
or drills that you use to to maintain or
develop sort of the cognitive skills
that you had to develop initially I mean
you know this sort of target
discrimination ah you've talked about an
acquisition in the military
basically it sort of translates to
better decision-making under stress are
there any specific exercises or
techniques that like it is it Lumosity
is Lumosity work questions why get there
I guess there are no techniques or
louder with Crowder studios protected

safely everyone glad to have you here I
couldn't be happier leading the news of
course the White House finds a no
support and just found out in the FBI
report for sexual assault claims against
Brett Kavanaugh let's come to the New
York Times so you know it's real but
with this additional information the
White House is fully confident the
Senate will vote to confirm judge
Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and it
looks like we're actually we will not be
seeing a confirmation vote on Saturday
the more information that comes out here
the truth or less credible Ford's story
sounds people don't like to hear that if
the left had had their way but it'd be a
very different country now then can you
identify the man Tom would you stand up
please would you catch this please well
then good enough for me Oh probably
guilty I rest my case i sentence you to
wait wait mr. Fenton raped a girl
I didn't are you sure this is the man
who raped you that settles it guilty as
sin wait wait no mr. Fitch no no I
wouldn't even marry tonight you don't
even work you know this Tom do you mean
to tell me that you're questioning a
survivor
bunch of baloney and you know it don't I
deserve a fair trial
it's supposed to be innocent to prove
them guilty right black lives matter too
now you know yes one moment in time that
may have been true but now we have to
believe all women period now you're
saying this man raped you yes he does
Clarence Thomas that sound about right
yeah a little bit of a different hero
these days Atticus Finch did you really
kill Mockingbird I did why would you
question that I was I never did well I
was forced to a gun point I never read
any of the American classics look at
drawing up I realize that well that's
good you a Canuck I didn't read any
Canadian classics either I did we spend
an entire semester White House the Ken
Dryden story you spend a semester on
Karla Homolka show no it's the real one
yeah it's a horrible place Canada and
our histories very uninteresting we
spent a half a year learning about how
Canada burned down the White House and
it wasn't even a country with a column
that's just because you don't select
your friends to burn down your crap
that's your biggest accomplishment not
really all that much of an
accomplishment when I think about it
speaking of the law police are now
warning citizens about drunken Birds
this comes from the home the Duluth
Tribune chief tied to car I guess is his
name wrote that the department received
calls about birds that appeared to be
under the influence flying into windows
cars and acting confused better be fair
the main burden question is demanding a
hearing to clear his good name so he
does seem as though yeah doing pretty
well for himself
look hashtag not all pigeons okay have
you ever seen the drunken animal though
they are absolutely hilarious like when
they bite into like an apple that's been
fermented on the ground or something
like that that's falling off like I've
seen a drunken deer oh you mean
accidentally party drinking beer until
the animal can't walk you know nothing
like I think bears do that on purpose
bears enjoy the
really yeah can anyone confirm that I
don't know MIT we need community idea I
went to school up a man I should know
some about that was too drunk type syrup
the bears and you drive many times but
never made it were hauled to the forest
yes and then the bear took they took
part in the devil's triangle apparently
after too much meat which is a sexual
assault of an internationally this
German parents forgot their
five-year-old at an airport in Germany
in case you're wondering
police said of other explained officers
that the family had driven home in
separate cars and each believed that the
child was with the other parent so
spurred interest of course in a German
remake of the popular holiday classic I
leaned through the house set and that's
going to do pretty well at the box
office if you rather not originally
though it doesn't seem like the Germans
are planned it seems like these are
these the same parents that you're just
supposed to trust and be like you can't
tell me how to raise my kid is that the
kind of parents like the university suck
in my opinion yeah sort of like
Bostonian parents they're trying to work
me into this sketch I well I use this a
medikit here and let the regulars get
these shots in I can't wait in this dump
I mean I don't worry the game is
rigged you didn't know that but but
you're right that's very unoriginal a
one parent thought the other one yeah
that's the one they were trying to why
my parents used one they left me these
large Julie's right your mom had you
back in the back when I was a kid I
referenced it because they were sure I
know but you think of how expensive the
architecture was back then oh yeah I
never does like that was one big giant
commercial for the Orange Julius
worse you're not gonna build an Orange
Julius these days have you seen
originally it turned into a drive-in
theater where I was raised actually the
one Orange Julius yeah because then I
was going to play with it and drive and
see that big but no well it was it was
like it was it became the concession
stand for the driver because they wanted
everyone to see it from the road it's
very expensive real estate here's a
drive-in theater in downtown Detroit did
you know this really yeah last time I
was there's a downtown Detroit drive-in
theater yeah and went to the midnight
showing I have three night forms oh my
and no hubcaps but speaking which I just
watched Midnight Run last night when I
was secular you ever see that within
your own about 150 times yes did you
make fan love it

last week and I was reminded how awful
truly awful Al Pacino is in heat
[Laughter]
recently no he's so bad you haven't did
you remember how bad he when he was
starting to get big right he's all too
big he there's a scene literally he's
talking I come black guy goes you know

Jack Lemmon just just acted circles
around him and that oh yeah that was
great all the way around though for me
yeah yeah what a great love it we're
gonna have it man on the show soon I
would say if you have to pick someone
overall if you look at a span of the
career probably the greatest actor ever
you have to put Jack Lemmon in there I
go with Larry Storch from F Troop used
to be a space you go back to some like
it hot right you go back early Jack
Lemmon and he was just as good at that
as it was in in Clanker there Glen Ross

Cortez yeah
not Kohn exactly that's what just
happened on there that's that drop out
in eighth grade I'm glad we went back
over that oh how are you I'll finally
another story before we have to get to
the TCU follow but we talked about the
tension you follow up in a recent change
my mind and the the mental counselling
required thereafter along with a
rebuttal devoxx
before that these academics submitted a
hoax paper about dog rate just to peru
lien it'll be published in a
peer-reviewed journal and it was
published in a peer-reviewed journal so
here's a clip from the peer thank you
for your contribution to gender place
and culture and I hope to be seeing your
manuscript in print people think this is
that's that's really actually got
published and we always have wondered
this the peer review journals yeah well
this isn't the first one that they've
gotten published you know it's not six
or seven other multiple ones yeah they
vary they're all very silly yeah almost
as silly as contests at first the story
seems completely unbelievable until you
realize have actually low the standards
are what counts as evidence in 2018 I
think particularly in recent weeks like
the latest smear against Cavanaugh used
by more recently the most recent we

sixty-nine students veterans active
military or follow on the iTunes
Instagram lotto with Crowder and it'll
be a good time we did the change my mind
at TCU this Monday yeah and it was one
of the biggest ones that we have ever
done and we're very grateful accept
immediately afterward
the reaction on you it was somewhat
predictable yeah and uh let's just read
some of the reactions here that you see
please let me for those who didn't see
the video we sat down rape culture
azimuth changed my mind that's pretty
basic stuff not rape is a myth rape
culture is a myth the idea that a
society encourages perpetuates or
tolerates rape and anyone was willing to
anyone who was willing to sit down could
change my mind in a public space in a
public space away
TCU officially reacted on Twitter so
here's one tweet from this is from TCU
Nick today steven crowder chose to
challenge our students on a public
sidewalk in front of the university
while the Constitution gives him the
right to express his views the
sentiments he expressed do not align
with TCU's values I'll answer this
question go ahead I was gonna say you're
asking a legitimate question yes well
actually even making a statement here's
something one step further a rape
culture is a myth changed my mind where
I'm saying we don't live in a rape
culture particularly on campus right
throat me wrong we disagree with Stevens
view right so what's the culture on the
TCU Campbell just exactly just the words
rape culture yeah just you get that's it
you're guilty you're your wife you
outlaw rape culture if they're
disagreeing with me they say we disagree
when Steven says there's no when Steven
says there's no rape culture on TCU we
disagree we disavow that point of view
all right TC you be my guest
here's whether his views adversely
affected many members of our campus
community to health and safety of the
Horned Frog families of the utmost
importance and we encourage individuals
to contact campus resources for sport
another tweet from them in support of
survivors of sexual assault at TCU SGA
set up in front of the founder statute
today to promote the it's on us campaign
is TCU does not follow steven crowder on
twitter i'm really glad they made the
point to say that university feels now
that the public sidewalk we do not
follow steven crowder on twitter
boom our mission is to foster academic
social and personal development for all
members of the campus community weather
and race class ethnic gender sexual
orientation ability or veteran status
what does that have to do with any
at this point I think that's the first
time I've ever heard veteran's status
use like that like it's a complaining
group of people that are gonna express a
differing point of view that other
normal people in this case they mean
veterans of house parties especially
their job is to create an academic
social environment so that people can
learn unless you have a different point
of view right a legitimate different
point of view and you're not out there
saying rape is cool and holding up signs
you're saying hey guys let's have a
conversation about rape culture what are
you thinking they're like oh my gosh to
grow this sort of freaking out yeah
girls start freaking out when she
realized that she had no argument yet
I see girls in tears and that's because
of your sign you don't know who Brett
Kavanaugh is this man doesn't know who
Brett Kavanaugh is time for the latest
installment have changed my mind
unedited conversations and controversial
topics with an opportunity to
rationalize one's own position as always
comment which topics you most like to
see in the future below today's topic
you've all heard of rape culture and
rape culture isn't that okay
rape culture on college campuses an
example of rape culture March to end
rape culture that rape culture as it's
taught in academia and described in the
media only it's not real now trigger
warning for those of you particularly
frustrated by entirely anecdotal
evidence in the face of empirical data
this episode may prove uniquely
difficult to watch that's just from
people that I know I know a lot of
people on this campus I'm honestly not
talking about empirical data at all and
I don't think we should look at it I
just here go doubt it but what I'm
saying is I see people walking around I
see girls in tears it's all anecdotal
but I know people on campus that have
been raped in and chosen not to report
it okay you're told you how empirical
data is good it's not possible because I
personally know more than 10 people
anyway you get it so this time before I
even got started people were ready for a
discussion
or that I'm sorry to hear that
I've not been raped
no that wouldn't be that wouldn't be
convincing argument I I'm very sorry no
no I think I think yes yes would you
like to sit down I don't generally
consider myself an idiot but
just for her sake I'll play one on TV
this time I allowed her to assume that I
know nothing so that she could teach me
thank you what a bunch of cameras all
set what's your name Maisie Maisie nice
to meet you mate nice to meet you so you
um just yelled this idiot is on campus
and so do you first III want to we are
obviously aware of what we've done oh
yeah rape culture I guess we need to
define how do you define a rape culture
first I had to find rape culture as a an
area a general area where people think
that they can take advantage of other
people due to certain situations which
sometimes include like places like
college campuses where there's a big
congregate of people drinking and
they're not sure where the level of
consent is okay so would it be fair to
characterize rape culture as something
certainly as it's been I guess sort of
described in academic circles the idea a
societal or a patriarchal society where
rape is either encouraged or it's
tolerated um like what it doesn't have
to be a male that rapes a female like I
don't beat either way but I didn't say
that okay well what's your weapon
well that's the idea break fall to the
idea that the rape is and you sort of
echo that I want to make sure we both
agree to start with that it's a society
or culture at large where rape is either
promoted encouraged or tolerated yeah
okay yeah I don't agree can you tell me
why statistically it doesn't wear out we
we charge rapists we put them in jail
rape is a very rare crime and I don't
believe that we live in a culture that
supports or condones rape or tolerates
it but what about the fact that so many
rapists don't go to jail I know plenty
of people I've reported my rapist he
didn't go to jail many of my friends
have reported their rapists they
go to jail like I actually literally
don't know of people my age anybody
who's gone to jail who has been
apprehended there are boys on this
campus I've been sexually assaulted by a
boy on this campus who walks around and
goes to class every single day so how is
that clear for some apprehension well
there's anecdotal right and then there's
the empirical data so I want to get away
from me speaking for all men or people
who are sort of right-leaning and you
speaking for all women or sort of
advocates of a more progressive
worldview I'm gonna just your phone I
think someone's calling in it it slipped
down there I want to make sure you get a
good shot thank you
you you went from from rape it's
interesting to me to sexual assault yes
first off I think again it's very
important we define the terms there's a
delineation between the two oh we agree
yeah but would you say that like sexual
assault isn't like what part of rape you
know sexual cell is a part of rape but
someone can commit some kind of sexual
assault or sexual harassment and it not
be rape so I don't I'm probably pretty
sure you don't want to get into your
personal experience on camera if you do
we we can but again it goes back to the
question this idea that we support or we
tolerate where we encourage rape or
that's occurring in numbers that are out
of the ordinary but fortunately to other
crimes you know rapists are convicted
about the same right as armed robbers
for example do we have an armed robbery
culture a rape is a horrible terrible
heinous crime and I'm not saying that
like rape culture like I'm honestly not
talking about empirical data at all and
I don't think we should look at it as a
peer code data because first of all like
I don't know if you know how like
uniform crime reports work but that's
like certain things that police don't
report so sometimes those numbers are
skewed first of all and like sorry what
do you mean uniform crimes do you know
like uniform crime reports and how that
works maybe several times going into one
report and no it's like where the police
report to the FBI specific crimes that
occur but they are like sometimes they
don't report everything and that's how
like that's the problem
no sometimes they just don't because
sometimes it looks better on their area
and so statistics can't always tell you
exactly what happens and then there's
other forms of like
methods like the NCVS they interview
victims like one-on-one or there's like
self reporting and that shows that we're
missing a lot of data that the police
just haven't reported to the FBI so I
don't think you can base all of this on
empirical data when well I think we can
but what would you base it on because
you obviously you referred to me as an
idiot that rape culture yeah yeah
I'm basing our you and your male
privilege to so and I think I'm gonna be
on that one yeah I do I do and like my
my brother and I were actually just
talking about you yesterday like yeah
you're really something I'm I don't know
how you ended up back on this campus
because you turned into a meme do you
know that you're a meme yeah on Twitter
yeah so I don't know how you have the
audacity like come back on our campus
and say that rape culture is a myth
because that's personally offensive to a
lot of people I know actually and so
especially like the audacity to come
here and hear and speak the truth true
you know what how about somebody rapes
you and then you come and tell me that
rape culture is amid nothing to do with
what we're talking about and I think
you're told you how empirical data is
full because of you see our crime report
don't agree have you you didn't even
know any UCR crime reported do you even
know what NCVS stands for you tell me
that let's go to statistics okay how
often you believe rape occurs because I
got a rape culture we often see I cannot
tell you the exact number because as
I've said I've repeated to you multiple
times that like you see our crime
reports are simply not accurate and
there are other like methods and it is
proven that those are not accurate we do
not have all of those numbers we don't
have all of those numbers we have quite
a bit we have from the FBI we have them
from the DOJ yeah but do you see our
reports that you didn't know existed let
the record show he didn't know what a
you see our crime report is I learned
that in my intro to criminal justice
rape occurs I don't I truly I couldn't
tell you okay for you to say this
idiotic to not believe that there's a
rape culture again when we both agree I
think there's rape culture you just
don't believe that I think there's an
interrupting culture right
now an interesting culture I'm not for
me you keep interrupting me I said can
you define that for me yeah you keep
interrupting
okay okay go I'll go uh yeah so let me
finish here so for me to be so idiotic
as to not believe in rape culture which
we both agreed is the idea that rape is
perpetuated encouraged or tolerated in a
society you would need to present some
kind of data anything I know you think
empirical that is bolted that's fine
some kind of evidence to support your
premise that rape is tolerated or
encouraged the United States yeah I mean
it is totally I mean have you seen like
Brett Kavanaugh are you familiar with
that situation right now like me you
don't know who Brett Kavanaugh is this
man doesn't know who Brett Kavanaugh is
and he's gonna stay here and tell me
that rape culture is a myth he is
currently Donald Trump is trying to
appoint him to the Supreme Court and the
fact that you don't know that shows me
that you don't actually really know
what's going on in society because that
is a really big deal and that is the
Supreme Court is the highest I don't
know who explained it to me why is that
important to improving a trig function
so he is currently he is under fire for
some sexual assault allegations and that
he like supposedly were not 100% sure
but he allegedly raped women when he was
younger and he in front of a trial was
saying that like they found in trial
this is in front of this is not a trial
but it's in front of Supreme not Supreme
Court justice it's in front of Senate
Senators important people and as they
ask him these questions um they pull out
his yearbook and they find terms like
devil's triangle which if you don't know
what that means that's Oh two males and
a female and that's two males ganging up
on a female it is like you're the first
to rape and so he's out here and that's
who they're trying to a point and this
man is is Brett Kavanaugh Brett
Kavanaugh sir and so the fact that like
somebody this important that is going to
be on the Supreme Court which I'm at
this point I'm unsure of like what you
know about the government but that is
the highest position that you can
acquire and so let's replay the Supreme
Court Supreme Court Justice it's high up
there
it's high up there so um the fact that a
rapist is probably going to be a point P
I investigation but it's a biased one
because it is from the Republican side
which they want him appointed so so I'd
like to get back to Brett Kavanaugh
because it seems like this is a big case
but again that would be an anecdotal an
anecdotal story again how does that
prove the statistic that rape is
encouraging committed at large in the
United States and condoned you're
telling me that like if somebody if they
feed highest the highest the Supreme
Court if we're gonna appoint somebody
who participates in a Devil's Triangle
and refers to it as a devil's triangle
you're telling me that that's not the
standard of what is good and what is
right
so can I answer your question yeah you
can answer me question so if I'm to
answer the question on Brett Kavanaugh
and dr. Christine Ford or any of the
other allegations coming forward from
Michael a Bonetti
who represents actually the other way
you accuse him of gang rape as well
that's separate again from the evidence
it's about one a nineteen hundred women
are raped in United States according the
FBI it's about one in a thousand for
college students if you include all
sexual assault according to the
Department of Justice or Bureau of
Justice about one and 52 of all sex that
includes you know playing grab-ass with
Brett Kavanaugh you know it's
interesting you mentioned a percentage
what evidence has been presented um
please what do you need my place where
did it happen I don't freaking know I
wasn't at high school it was back when
he was in high school like lower a
journal yeah general who it's these um
if you're familiar with miss Ford
she has come forward and then I believe
one or two other women have come forward
and said this book Ford is definitely
the know she brought forward witnesses
all of whom could not cry brighter story
somewhat babe outright refuted it I mean
like this
this woman is willing to she's actually
willing to undergo intense FBI
investigations she has had no resistance
to that but he has actually denied over
and over he keeps saying he doesn't want
it and now they're giving him like a
little special little FBI investigation
I think this is something you see
there's no none of what you've just said
is correct it was work you Bruce mean
anything to you no it doesn't
that you really did you really think
that I didn't know who Brett Kavanaugh
was I really did it honestly at this
point like I'm unsure what you actually
know right yeah the whole reason was I
was I was hoping for you to sit down and
you see now if you go back every single
thing I told you I didn't know because I
wanted you to explain to me you've
explained nothing you presented no
evidence or data the only thing the only
time you've addressed evidence or data
is saying that it's - use your
words and it doesn't matter the amount
of rapes matter the conviction rates
matter what we host rapist matters and
when you come out instead of live in a
rape culture and you compare dr.
Christine Ford's allegations let's say
we have no idea whether they're true or
not zero evidence whatsoever from 35
years ago you can't run an investigation
whether who what when where or why we
have none of it - then use that as a
springboard to say that we live in a
rape culture I think it's intellectually
disingenuous and I think it does a great
disservice to people who have actually
been a victim of a horrible crime yeah
I'm aware because I've been a victim to
that crime and as you say like you
haven't and you know like like you said
you don't even know what a Uniform Crime
Report is and so maybe if you I also
said I didn't have a break and I was so
I mean maybe you do know what that is so
then how can you sit here and tell me
that how can you sit that this is all
like these statistics are all 100%
correct
no I'll let you back on this campus
that's a public sidewalk nobody invited
you here nobody invited em you can we
ask him to leave this campus is this
being handled
[Applause]
proud of it have you ever been raped No
let me ask you this have you ever had
your house under threat under threat 4
with a bomb threat you've had the FBI at
your house have to actually circle your
house and have armed guards so the point
is the point is we all have individual
experiences but that does not change the
fact of the matter that we do not
encourage a rape culture in the United
States rape is a horrible crime here's a
let's use break cabin as an example
because you brought them up look this is
really important first off what happened
to you I have no I I don't know the
story I don't want you to get into
personal details if you're uncomfortable
horrible terrible if that happened I
can't say that it has because I'm not
allowed to oh yeah I probably has it
well no legally I can't accuse a man of
something if he has not been convicted
of a crime let's say I believe you
though I believe you I'm really sure I'm
really sure it happened to you but a
good example with Brett Kavanaugh if
Brett Kavanaugh did all the things that
he accused him of for example a triangle
gang rape gang rape if he raped people
cocked his head back and left I say that
castrate him and give him life but if
it's not true
I feel probably worse for him than any
man I can think of in recent memory the
only difference between the two is
castrate the man versus empathy is the
truth and I think with all of these
arguments with all your decisions you
don't either we're trying to see the
truth like we don't have the truth so
how can you just say that that's a good
question like why is he allowed on our
campus if this isn't even like an
organizer no I am not part of this yeah
you know but if he's gonna sit here and
say the rape cultures admit that
somebody needs to sit here and say we're
gonna deal with that but you're not
helping the situation
which so you we can continue the
conversation you like or anyone else
will move forward I actually have class
to get to exist and you're telling me
one in a thousand I can tell you that's
bull what a 19-15 1,900 and in here I
can guarantee you multiple people right
have been raped and this is not nineteen
hundred people so ok how can you
guarantee that myself to this man and
this man is saying one in 1900 1900
accordion be I wanted nineteen hundred
people have been raped I can guarantee
that I'm not the only one standing here
that's been raped and weird that 1900 so
thank you and thank you and I hope you
get that hell off our campus
[Music]
which I'm certain back I'm Nick Nick
nice Michael I gotta say I kind of liked
your podcast I'm on the other side but
okay I like watching everybody well yeah
so yeah I don't I don't know how
familiar are with this but it seems like
you disagree with the position that rape
culture again is just defined in
academia with gender studies and
feminism and has only discussed in
societal nomenclature a society in which
rape is either encouraged or tolerated I
believe that that's not true I don't
live in a country is that that's the
definition encouraged or tolerated
I definitely wouldn't say encouraged to
an extent tolerated yes I would have to
disagree that also how was rape
tolerated in the United States um we do
a lot of victim blaming we don't hold
people accountable we don't really trust
the women I mean you look at the
Cavanaugh hearing all the Republicans
they kind of believe her but they really
don't care question yeah define the
victim blaming would be not fully
believing the woman accuser and striking
her down and saying oh well maybe you
got too drunk at the party maybe you're
lying about this that's victim for you I
want to make this clear because it might
be a fundamental disagreement yeah for
you is victim a synonym with accuser or
do you mean victim being someone who's
actually in the conference I mean I
would say it cause we're gonna sit in
having but you think victim isn't a
synonym for accuser well I mean if
you're the victim and then you accuse
your
your rapist or sexual assault or doing I
guess yeah how do you know they're a
victim that's what they're saying I
usually believe the woman until proven
the other way really yeah did you
believe that's how we should base our
laws and it makes it an accusation not
our laws but we should we should believe
her for the most part she had a good
testimony if you looked at the testimony
who was the one that looked believable
cause it sure as wasn't Kavanaugh
lahter with Crowder studios is protected
exclusively by Walther and hopper
uh durwood Crowder live descends upon

your tickets now and louder with greater
calm / - costume contest and private
Mudd Club after-party details to follow
viewer beware
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
that's called the poking holes in the
hearings from today it's because III
that's an hour and a half two hours
three I don't know how much of my life
that I won't get back so we're gonna go
through all of that here today sorry -
Paul Joseph Watson who won't be on the
show yeah sorry - Josh wolf we had a
bump because of so much to get to
everything you need to know about the
hearings we wanted to dissect it and
give you the the need to know is along
with what you'll probably be be told
from the media and after this I'm going
to grab a very large vessel of beer did
I say peer I mean I'm at raped someone
I do feel raped you're right yes you
look in the lexicon today we'll get to
that in a second questions day before
introduce everybody hear the expression
they go low we go high sometimes there's
a you've got to rise above it sometimes
you got to step on that in that's that's
biggie you know to talk yeah how do you
go high if you're being falsely accused
of rape allegedly comment to me where's
the line between us they go low I'm just
gonna stomp them long enough suck or
kick them all they go low
bruising with me of course we have
quarter black Garrett yeah and then we
have a Gerald Morgan I'm too pissed
about what else no one no wine today -
Matt don't have a beer we are I've got
to manage this orchestra pit here we
have in third chair Owen Benjamin huge
pianists calm and we have mike Ward has
been here all this week yes Mike Weir -
yeah and your podcast is two-drink
minimum Fridays on compo media to drink
minimum
whoa running a train ass non-stop rape
we're gonna go through not all the
hearings but also the fact that the left
they've become the modern religious
Puritans they'd be kind of Church
flighty now how did that happen equate
drinking with rape and fraternities with
with rape jokes with something by the
way I think we all agree everyone in
this room can we all agree okay that if
Cavanaugh raped as many people who claim
have raped him right life in prison very
very bad prison because what's it up to
now like 119
will claim the knees right them I mean
he must be the most successful serial
rapist ever and he's drank and 14 beers
of rape yes as opposed to our
quarterback who's drinking drinking
purple driver so we're gonna get into
that but of course we still have to do
our job because this is a news on
Wednesday before we get to everything
else before we get to what happened
today in the year not Wednesday before
this or a number of last minute
accusations against Brett Kavanaugh so
this comes from Mediaite
and that NBC News the latest of whom
before we get to the hearings she once
threatened to kill her ex-boyfriends
newborn yeah and there was on the single
condition that you identify the rapist
or serial flasher as the man called
Brett Kavanaugh I was raped by Brett cab
no I was raped by Brett Kavanaugh no it
was me I was raped by Brett Kavanaugh no
me I was raped by Brett Kavanaugh
no assume is gonna party someone else
now when was this
if nothing historically accurate that
was swedish chef in there the voice that
you hear of well of course not he's not
here it's not my cord injury but I
wasn't there and Brett Kavanaugh
[Laughter]
hilarious one of the Cavanaugh accusers
who came forward I wanna make sure I get
this correct it was Julie sweat Nick see
that must have been rough was that name
she made a sexual harassment complaint
against her former employer New York
Life Insurance guess who rep Gus erector
same fern run by Deborah Katz who now
represents Christine Ford oh that's
that's all too convenient so all of us
the story broke at 7 p.m. and it fell
apart before lawrence O'Donnell even at
the chance to broadcast as menstrual
cramps by 10 people go haul ass to the
same weight firm this doesn't seem to
really add up this whole thing is
completely become a sideshow and it's
obviously irritated Cavanaugh as you'll
see when we get to the clips but if he
can come out of this relatively on
supreme court justice which may explain
his recent statements
by the way that's why it still looks
like I have a little bit of mascara very
hard to wipe that off yeah people who
aren't familiar just you YouTube crash
the plane ultimate warrior promo there
you go it all makes sense
is it judge or justice what's the
official term now it's justice it's
justice
yeah he's graduated to justice cuz these
fault like these accusations either
break a man or clarify them yes didn't
go through weeks of rape allegations
would be called judge no no no it's at
this point who wants to be a judge on
the Supreme Court anymore this should be
a good gig to claim you raped like a
donkey when you were seven even you
couldn't bring your shirt those fresh
stains on your shirt or that it was from
a shirt I just got this shirt because I
wanted to lose shirt I literally just
got it finished no I only flew one shirt

meth like the byline is do we need to
write the rest of the story no it's not
even necessary at that point yeah
they're trying to fluff up the obvious
meth behavior yes you know I think this
also could have just been like a dude
tries to go gay with a guy that wasn't
into it maybe and then covers by
starting fires that gay no no it was a
Fight Club with my mouth I was choking
it with my mouth that was his weakest
point rape decoder ring yeah look I
think this is like if you want us to
fight clubs cool right if you want to
start Fight Club naked fight clubs
probably not like the Greeks you know
it's not gonna work again that's it's
like the Bronze Age is it cool to fight
nude yeah I don't want another man's
Donecker let's cut this is all do you
know why because we have a man whose
name has been absolutely run through the
mud here's some that's really important
I think and I want to get everyone's
opinion here and I want to hear your
opinions on the hearings if you watch
them what's there two things that
occurred one there was there's no new
evidence now by the way keep in mind
here is 0 new evidence there is ZERO
proof that this event occurred okay
nothing today changes that but all of
the news coverage is I was watching ABC
and CNN it's all about the optics yeah
well when this when this old white lady
was when this old why
man when Lindsey Graham made his
comments it's not going to pay the
American public won't look upon it
favorite but who cares
are we really doing I did we're playing
identity politics when we are ruining a
man's like them no you're saying rape
ruins a life too absolutely right it's
just crazy I believe survivors quick
question for you how do you know they're
survivors shouldn't you figure that out
first
should that be the first thing we figure
out elaborate what would the other guy
say is the door to freedom it's easy if
one of them always lies not saying this
woman is necessarily lying but am saying
that the media almost invariably
and verbally lies as it relates to
Republicans any other comments where we
get to the timeline cuz I've got I've
got some time lines and some clips for
you that you probably won't see all
right so just just to lead off real
quick I think we built this up too much
I think we built up the fact that she
wasn't testifying and now that she's
testifying all they're saying like you
said is the optics game they're just so
now that she's testifying you have to
believe her she sounded a little choked
up you've got to believe or she's
telling the truth that's it that's one
of the biggest problems is they're going
off emotion they're saying well she was
crying therefore she's right and as
someone and this is no knocking
ex-girlfriend or someone who used to
live with Golden Globe nominee christine
ricci women can lie on cue women can cry
whenever they want the girls I think it
softens it by me Lister accolade women
are unbelievably good at crying when
like if you get pulled over by a cop
like I've tried to cry to get out of a
ticket and then the cops like bro you're
not even crying convincingly you're
shopping it's like seriously like
multiple time Oscar nominee Roman
Polanski so let's go through force or if
there was Ford in the know and there was
Kavanagh let's go through the Ford
timeline a couple of things were pretty
important first off she can't member who
pushed her into the bedroom either
Kavanaugh or judge or just Kavanagh
but then she tells Diane fine C with Vic
with a very scientific explanation it's
impossible for this to be a case of
mistaken identity
which she uses to establish her
credibility as a psychologist here's the
thing Kavanaugh hasn't even said that
she wasn't sexually assaulted that's not
even
he's actually more gracious than I would
be at the gentleman but maybe there's
mistaken identity maybe she thinks she's
telling the truth
and maybe he thinks he's telling who
knows but the point is there is zero
evidence of the rape occurring let's
continue through the timeline here
she took a polygraph in her hotel room
because she was on her way to a flight
keep in mind these hearings were delayed
because she was afraid of flying no idea
you know that no that's their delayed no
that doesn't make her wrong now keep in
mind it is not our job it is not our job
to either to to vindicate her
accusations to vindicate her credibility
or to condemn it it's to get to the
truth yes yeah the whole purpose for all
of this shouldn't be hurt for the circus
for this reason it should be to get to
the truth now the truth is before this
hearing we had no evidence no witnesses
no hard evidence we didn't know a place
or a date or a time or who we still
don't those look important facts by the
way they are kind of important if it's
gonna be some regret yeah a bunch of -
she flies ok so here's something many
many different versions of the story
she's given about how many people were
present of the party the letter says 4
but the testimony today she said there
could be more she can't be sure she
didn't remember if the Washington Post
reporters ever saw the notes or if she
just summarized them verbally she can't
she can't remember anything do you
notice this team she can't remember
anything other than she's sure Brett
Kavanaugh raped her there was the one
point that she was able to say yes 100%
everything else is a blur but that
really yeah some people are trying to
say well hold on it's short like I can't
remember what I had for lunch but I can
reverse things that happened in grade
school
absolutely but this is not a question of
short-term memory wishes long-term
memory there are a lot of incidents
traumatic incidents she hasn't she can't
remember at all the only thing she
remembers not only does she remember
very clearly that he raped her she
remembers how and the manner doesn't
exactly member who opened the door it
was who was the one person who talked
about she talked about the laughing yeah
just like I remember I remember they're
laughing laughing maniacally like
literally just I'm raping so you can
remember that in graphic detail
if your friends are raped if your friend
is raping someone you're not gonna laugh
no even if you are in on it you're gonna
be like what the hell
wrong you're gonna be punching and
kicking said man yeah if you're the
friend who rapes but if you walk in and
a friend who rapes you're gonna punch
and kick said man yeah you're not you're
a rapist like I don't think the natural
response of a rapist is laughter the
only person that laugh is like Borat
with the naughty naughty but like a
normal human being this is a caricature
okay way to put it it's a character it's
almost like someone wrote down what they
would picture right right this is the
most impactful thing you can say it was
there laughter yeah it doesn't mean it's
untrue but I'm saying I can picture find
him like okay now for research before
the hearing sure watch lifetime what's a
lot of lifetime's yeah Michael Bay's
like is this where something wrong in
the movie exact someone gets pushed in a
flight of stairs and then you learn
exactly how rape happens it doesn't
matter what house the party was in
here's this is something I want to show
this this clip here because I don't
think it was a great a great decision
for the the prosecuting a sexual assault
attorney and I do see obviously that
that Deford could be seen as a
sympathetic character I thought more so
before I washed forward I thought okay
the optics actually aren't good for
Republicans here because of the way
they've gone about this but something
that was really important this was a
pivotal turning moment I think we have
the clip of the I guess sort of the
cross acute attorney this isn't a trial
this is the whole point a trial is to
determine whether someone is guilty or
not guilty the trials already occurred
Ford's life is ruined the whole purpose
of this was to destroy it that's already
done now get that thing I can't see what
do we say cross-exam at this point I
don't know this was really really
pivotal if the goal was to get to the
truth let's watch this clip don't have a
follow up clip have you also educated
yourself on the best way to get to
memory and truths in terms of
interviewing victims of trauma for me
interviewing victims of trying out the
best way to do it the the best practices
for interviewing victims of trauma know
okay she's a doctor let me let me just
stop you one second I disagree with you
I think this was a great
for her to do that imagine a white 55
year old male asking that question yeah
the optics on that are insanely bad Joe
they're having a woman prosecutor just
saying it kind of prefer the woman who I
do librarian I know I never made a noise
so I didn't really hear Anthony Hopkins
yes I would believe Anthony I mean he's
very believable right here's why that's
so important because the this this I
guess you would say prosecutor yeah she
was saying okay there is a way and there
there are criminal studies conducted
where we know the best way to actually
get to the bottom of a sexual assault
it's a forensic interview right he says
there it's typically one-on-one you just
speak they listen and then somebody else
fills in the gaps that's important to
know because if your goal is to get to
the truth if you're coming forward with
and this is where I think everything
changed if you're talking about the
truth this is the moment of clarity for
truth here's why here's the follow-up
did anybody ever advise you from senator
Feinstein's office or from
Representative issues office to go get a
forensic interview no instead you were
advised to get an attorney and take a
polygraph
so right many people advised me to get
an attorney once I had an attorney my
attorney and I discussed about using the
polygraph no one started questioning
your friends in representation if the
goal was to actually guilt go and make
sure that justice was served yeah none
of your representatives told you by the
way you're a doctor you couldn't
research the best way to actually come
forward allegations of sexual assault or
even the most basic protocol it's unreal
to me well she had that she didn't have
a very strong case I mean you have no
evidence that if you went to the police
with this today you would be laughed at
well no the point is her representation
advised her against what one is advised
to do that when making
incredible allegation of assault that's
the point here yeah does everyone around
her said no no what you're supposed to
do if you want to actually get a guy
convicted do the opposite of that right
that's my point they were telling her do
something to me well someone who's
someone very close to me was actually
gang-raped it's like the convictions are
so hard and people like this make those
cases so much more bogged down yeah yeah
you know she went to the hospital
covered in bruises and cuts and all
kinds of things and and nothing eight
months later nothing happened yeah and
it's like that that's why making a
mockery of rape accusations is so deeply
disturbing to me what it really does
shortchange women who have actually been
raped oh yeah of course it hurts
everybody hurts everybody because simply
hey so I go to the article my comments
not there yeah if we're talking about me
- we wouldn't want the woman who was
actually physically raped in there I
don't think you're gonna make the cut
glad to have our next guest on the
program this is actually she's a return
guest we've had a run before a long time
ago actually believe during the 2016
campaign you can go you can go get her
book now wherever books are sold
you'd better put some ice on that the
author and our website of course and I
ruined I ruined the the prestige but
it's Juanita Broderick calm miss
Broderick thanks for being here well I
appreciate coming on the show and
especially at this time right now your
story is as relevant as ever and I know
it's a tough story to tell I thought you
write about this in your book for those
who maybe aren't super familiar you know
some some new viewers can you kind of
explain to them how you came to the the
public spotlight with what's the Clinton
issue I don't want to speak for you
because you know I have a man and
hashtag men don't know anything Bill
Clinton's gubernatorial campaign I was a
nursing home owner I was a registered
nurse but someone asked me to volunteer
so I thought well this would be good
I've never been involved in politics and
I did this for absolutely a month when I
had a call from the campaign office and
said Bill Clinton was going to be in the
area and could he come by and visit at
my nursing home I'm so excited I mean
the whole staff the families the
residents we were all excited right and
then that pictured this on the front of
my book was from the local newspaper and
after the photo op Bill Clinton comes
over to me and starts talking and and
he's so charismatic then you know he
never loses eye contact with you when
he's talking to you yeah it's actually a
skill though he's able to make it seem
like he's making eye contact while
simultaneously staring at your breasts
that's a skill of his but yes well okay
so apologies but continue yeah with the
time
here well what a perfect opportunity
nursing homes in Arkansas were
struggling the per diem rate was so low
and we couldn't adequately feel for
instance so I just offered this
information to him and he looked at me
and you thought he said are you ever in
Little Rock and I said yes I'll be there
in three weeks and he said well why
don't you call my office and let's get
together and talk about this I couldn't
believe it I was so excited and I worked
for two or three days on eating graphs
and everything and what the cost was and
what we were being reimbursed so then
the day comes in April the 24th 1978 my
nurse and I Drive down to Little Rock
the next morning we get up and we call
Bill Clinton's office and the young lady
answers and tells me that he's not there
to give me a number to call I call the
number he answers the phone I tell him
that we have an hour for a lunch break
could I please come over and meeting
this office at noon and bringing the
information and of course it's
long-drawn saying well I'm not gonna be
there today why don't I just come to
your hotel now this was eight o'clock in
the morning so his office became your
hotel very quickly
that's pretty smooth pretty smooth
operation there I've never heard of a
not well actually that's not sure I have
heard of offices being in hotel rooms
that's notably you know when Kevin
Spacey's producing a new picture
continue you go on to the meeting and
I'll be there shortly after I leave the
coffee shop we plan to lead to meet in
the coffee shop downstairs when he gets
to the hotel he calls my room and he
says there's so many people down here
and there's reporters he said can we
just talk about this and have coffee in
your room I didn't really think anything
about it I know I must have been leery
because I've never
alone in a hotel room with a man I
didn't know I mean really yeah so but he
was the Attorney General so I said sure
an hour to coffee to the room and he
comes up and the first thing when I
opened the door there he stands in the
hall right just him but I didn't look at
I don't know who else was sweeping we
sunglasses on we're talking to dim-lit
Holloway with sunglasses that should
have been a tip-off that like I said you
could have thought it was a style thing
people wearing sunglasses back then it's
just she thought it was the sunglasses
thing I get it yeah just absolutely
pathetic so he comes in and we all know
the story that he finally he asked me to
come over to his side of the table while
I was pouring the coffee and he wanted
to he pointed to a little building that
was down on the Arkansas River you could
see it from my window and he said to me
I want to show you this I should never
have walked around that time but anyway
things really went south I mean they it
was horrible right into scream when he
grabbed me and tried to kiss me and when
he forced me on the bed and start
tearing at my clothes I began to scream
again well this time whenever I did he
would bite my upper lip and it was I
just never forget how painful that was
yeah and then after the right I was
devastated I set up on the side of the
bed and I was crying and he stays gets
out and he's straightening himself and
he just sort of looks at me real girl
wildered and he says don't worry I'm
sterile I had mumps when I was a child
my god man you just raped me and that's
what you had to say and then he just
looked at me again put on his sunglasses
calmly walk to the door and motion to my
mouth which was swollen three times the
normal size all of this just turned me
inside out and bleeding and he says you
better put some ice on that and walks
out
and that's the title of your book where
people can check it out at Juanita
Broderick calm I want to make sure one
thing here because obviously the reason
we're having you on is is because of
right now the hashtag me to movement and
we see what's been going on with with
Kavanagh you're saying I know that
people will say these are allegations we
have to we have to address that but I do
think there's a big difference in I
think no one would deny this the
treatment of your allegations from the
meeting before we get to the details
that you've had which have not been
actually corroborated from stories
thirty years ago the treatment of you
coming forward against Bill Clinton
versus every single woman who comes
forward today with Kavanagh have you
seen that contrast absolutely no the
woman that found me right she would not
have Joseph well let me ask you this
when did this event happen was built
with Bill Clinton in yourself April the
25th 1978 at 8:30 in the morning it and
where did it occur the hotel was called
the Camelot I don't know what it's
called right now
now pivotal for people listening those
are more details that have come forward
in any accusation against Cavanaugh and
we'll get to more but it's important
that people note it's not even close
some people say you're just going to it
for Ted no no we're not playing the same
game here details where when with
specificity and I appreciate that miss
Broderick they've provided none but I
remember what really really bothered me
the first time you're on the show and I
think we talked about it was when I I
looked into it a little bit more you
actually agreed to do an interview if
I'm not mistaken with with someone NBC
was at leat Alisa Meyers somewhere in
the late 90s and this was I think was it
was it the day after Bill Clinton was
impeached
it was just a few days now I have been
talking with Lisa Myers for over a year
trying to come forward and I refused
completely yes and and she sat on the
story for over a month yeah no he didn't
yes she begged them to do this and she
said she called me one day because they
they filmed on January the 20th 1999 and
it didn't get on the TV I mean it wasn't
aired until I think February 26 and more
than that right I think she called me
one day because I was upset this was
supposed to be aired during the
impeachment that's the only reason I
went on it I thought this can stop this
man and they wait till after the
impeachment but before that I remember
her calling me one day and I said I
don't want to hear from ABC anymore and
she said well listen I've got good news
and bad news
she said the good news is you're
credible and the bad news is you're very
credible now what what do I do with that
I've never been interviewed before I
didn't understand all the specifics of
what that statement yet right yeah yeah
I understand it now very well also I
think it's important to note that the
response from from Clinton Bill Clinton
when he's asked about the issue he says
well you know what counsel as a my
lawyers has a statement and he just he
never flat-out denies it as opposed to
again Kavanagh saying these allegations
are completely false hey listen public
hearing as much information and
transparency as possible to clear my
name because as a woman who's been a
victim of rape and I don't want to go
through details and have you relive it
or if ever this goes any direction
you're uncomfortable please let us know
but I do think it's an important story
and I am interested as to your opinion
on you know what when when you're you're
you have the scales what tips the scales
and the balance of you know proof versus
right now believe all survivors really
believe all claims how do you view
what's happening now in in the court of
public opinion oh it's gonna be a
different situation regarding who the
person is and what their memory is if
there
they're not going to remember anything
right well I was completely awake having
coffee about to go to a seminar meeting
completely full dressed ready and I
think she had on a swimsuit it's I was
suspicious from the beginning before it
started to crumble there has to have
been someone she would have told if it
was that horrific right yeah that's
exactly what I would imagine I want to
be clear with your story you told
several people and I think was at Norma
Norma not Norma Jean oh that's a
danielson do is get normal with a normal
Rodgers she was my director of Nursing
and thank God I was there with her she's
the one that found me within 30 minutes
we got ice for my mouth and packed up
all her stuff she said when she came in
the door and but after she'd gone to get
the ice and we were sitting there while
I was crying and she was just about
trying to well I told her what happened
she said what do you want to do I said
oh please just take me off and people
will ask you know why didn't you press
charges then at that time no Clinton
they said why didn't you call the police
there was no DNA back then there was
nothing like that and Bill Clinton was
the police there's a pretty general of
my state he regulated my businesses he
could have closed me down on a whim
right yeah well I think I think that's
important to note as opposed to again
we're talking about Cavanaugh who who
isn't there yet you know and he's easy
he hasn't been appointed yet but it is
it is kind of crazy to me this is a guy
who still has reached high levels of
government that none of this had ever
come out obviously just from an outsider
perspective you're going real only
30-something years later thirty-five
years later and very different again
just mentioned normal Rogers there were
many people in your story it with your
but with this incident who corroborated
your story I don't want to say your
story because I don't want to make it
sound fictional I don't want to misspeak
there at all whereas in the case of of
Cavanaugh after Ford came forward all of
the friends declined to confirm the
story even when she was reaching out to
build
case it's a very very different sequence
of events which why which is why it
makes it so much more chilling to me
that I mean if people want to cover the
story if the media is interested in a
story if we're talking about really
helping victims survivors of sexual
assault why you weren't given more
opportunities to share your story it's
it's it's night and day
you know I'm flying to Washington DC in
the morning I'm going out there with Amy
Kremer and the women for Trump because
we want to stand with Brett Kavanaugh we
don't want these crazy pink cat wearing
ladies try to define what we women
really are here in 2018 so we're going
to be a part of that and I'm just so
happy that they asked me to go and
something else too that you bring up as
you bring up Kevin on some women now so
you and your friends supporting him
there's no pattern of behavior here I
think something it's very important is
you weren't the first woman to come
forward with Bill Clinton and you
weren't the last so it makes it even
more it's with kavanah there's no proof
of this at all in any instance not
saying it didn't happen I'm not saying
there's zero chance but again as a
pattern of behavior as a pattern of
character we don't see it with but come
on it's former President Bill Clinton
it's his calling card it might actually
be on his physical calling card for all
I know
so again it would seem to credible as
you said it so it where you have not
always acknowledged as credible behind
the scenes was at all was that always
the case or was it later on as the
evidence mounted and then they said we
got it let's just keep this quiet you
know I have no idea of his reputation
absolutely none until the years
progressed and I would hear about these
things
and when I was subpoenaed by Ken Starr
that was the first time I told the truth
the main reason that he subpoenaed least
because I had lied in the father John
suit I saw what had happened to the
other women and I'll be darned if I was
going to come forward and be persecuted
like that but he wanted to know was i
lying because they had threatened me or
paid me off
that's not no none of that happened I
could not
and to his obstruction of justice at all
so but they never discredited me I get
so upset so the reason the reason that
you lied at that point wasn't because of
any kind of bribery
it was just be just to protect your
reputation and because you thought
nothing good could come of it because
they were Teflon and to these other
women that were coming forward then I
ran nursing I don't know sir Holmes I
was a business woman I don't want him
disarmed to go away right after I
testified after I was deposed by Paula
Jones
I mean I was angry that someone could
try to pull me into their lawsuit for
their own personal gain I know Colin out
she's a fine young lady but I was angry
and I thought you're not going to do
this to me
but the reason they call me into it is
because two of our investigators showed
up on my front porch one day and
recorded me saying I'm not going to talk
about the most horrible at the end of my
life right hey that recording back to
Paula Jones attorneys and so naturally
I'm named Jane Doe number five in that
suit and I was saying I think that's
also important to note sort of this idea
of the the unwilling hero you you you
had a lot to lose right at this point
like you said a businesswoman you this
was something that you were not
interested in taking part whereas when
we talk about Ford Kavanagh she stands a
lot to gain as we see right now and
that's a contrast I think looking into
the evidence the specifics the
corroboration is from people who were
there we don't have that in any of these
other stories the pattern of behavior on
the the would-be assailant as well as
the motives behind the person coming
forward yours the reason I wanted have
you in the show is because I would say I
would say that nearly every case yours
is the inverse of Christine Ford or
whichever crimes I don't even know what
we're up to now someone said someone
said he showed us his is doneger at a
party is another thing you know I don't
know why we throw that under the same
pile as what you experienced an actual
rape with dr. Ford this course this is
on Twitter when people go after me and I
say dr. Ford's
our
Asians are 1% of what I went through you
cannot compare this in any way it makes
me angry that they can even say these
two things are comfortable right it is
odd to mean I've talked about this
obviously as an ignorant male but it
seems to be you know rapists or twisted
people right this is their twisted they
they're aroused by rape so it seems to
me that either a rapist if you're alone
in a room and the rapist is he either
rapes you unless you have a gun as a
woman
they don't stop mid rape and all right
get out of here you little rascal so the
only story that I think was generated
from Ford was he got so drunk that he
passed out and I got away that's
something to me that was very and I
would like you were insight on that as
someone who went through this ordeal it
seems very unlikely that someone who
lives for rape and this is what rapists
love they get a thrill out of it would
pass out because he's sleepy just beyond
me you know there's no way I could have
gotten away from Bill Clinton he's a
very large man and it's time I laid
maybe a hundred and ten pounds and you
know I'm gonna say that right now
Stephen I just get chills thinking about
how he held me down and when he did to
me you know it's and like I said I don't
wanna get into specifics I don't want
this to become a Barbara Walters so you
know salacious and everywhere I'm just
trying to make you but whatever you're
comfortable with he is especially he was
a large man back then was before he was
vegan he was still eat in the fast food
cheeseburgers so he probably had a few
extra pounds it's your fault and I still
had that mentality that it was my fault
for allowing him to come to the room and
this finally went away but it really
went away in 1991 when this I'm sorry
no that's fine go ahead wait when this
monster apologized to me I was down in
Iraq again with my nurse that it found
me that
and her sister both of alarians and
someone comes to the door and they say
miss Broderick is haunted in the hall so
I think and it's a emergency from home I
in a go out and they shortly after they
follow me and the man points down around
the corner to the elevator and so I walk
down there and look around and go around
the corner and as I do there stands Bill
Clinton and he's got his two arkansas
state policemen standing back behind him
and he comes over to me and he says I'm
so sorry for what I did
he said I'm a family man I'm a changed
man I'm just not that person anymore and
I you've got to realise been 13 years
since I've laid eyes on you right I just
sort of backed up and I started crying
and I thought you jerk
to myself and then I said you go to hell
and I turned him off to my friends and
they said what did he want and I said he
the Pope's response has been tone-deaf
at best pathetic evil at worst he
literally said I will not speak an a
single word about you speak some more
words what hot speak a lot of words I
want to hear a lot of words from you
Pope Francis I'm very glad to have our
next guest we're having him back last
time him and I were disagreeing very
respectfully might I add on a convert
crowd or a weak and and and I think
today will probably be agreeing quite a
bit he's been at the forefront kind of
speaking out against really you know
corruption within within the church
period across we're been very consistent
and I wanted to get an expert's opinion
as a non Catholic outsider you can
follow him on the Twitter at Michael
underscore Voris as long as they allow
him to church militant calm mister voice
how are you sir hello Steven how are you
as long as they allow us to that's true
yes I don't think I don't think Pope
Francis will be in trouble anytime soon
with a climate change in polar bear
tweets but this interview might be
better plastic straws plastic straws in
the ocean yeah big horrible crisis the
paper straws it seems seems as though
this I'm glad that this man has his
priorities straight okay
so let me ask you this before we go
obviously this the the the sex scandal
now has been covered most people know
what's going on but a lot of people
don't really know the details
could you fill people in who don't know
exactly where where did this start the
more recent scandal I mean I know we can
go back obviously far becoming in the
church history early 2000s but what
we're talking about right now why are we
talking about this where does it stem
from the bottom line is this all sort of
came to fruition because of a series of
events really this summer it's kind of
faithful Catholics refer to it as the
summer of shame actually it doesn't
sound like a fun summer that's not a
good summer summer I sort of I'm pretty
sure that's not a Beach Boys hit but the
former Cardinal of Washington DC now
retired for Cardinal Theodore McCarrick
it was announced of about him by the New
York Archdiocese which is where he was
originally ordained as a just boldly
priest back in the 40s or 50s
a credible allegation had come forward
that he had groped an altar boy in the
rectory I'm sorry in the sacristy where
you get dressed for mass but on the
vestments of st. Patrick's Cathedral at
the time that happened the boy was 14 or
15 anyway about a year ago six months
ago
he came forward reported that nobody has
ever been able to get a hold the guy and
say why did you report this after 45
years nonetheless he reported it after
45 years the New York archdiocese
because that's where it happened
took over the case they did their
investigation at the end of their
investigation they concluded that what
he was saying was in fact credible and
at that moment the the rules of the
church kicked in and the fact that he
was a cardinal was kind of beside the
point he what he had done because it
involved a minor it doesn't matter that
was 45 years ago that had to be made
announced you know because he was a
cardinal the Pope had to be told and
then very short and what happened this
is a little more severe than potentially
drunken sex at a party 35 years ago with
tutu don't remember the place or time or
having any evidence yes it's a little
bit the root of the year right or a year
or even even the general region I don't
even know what their main mineral export
is where this happened so I do want to
make sure that you know this is that we
when you say credible because I do want
you know this obviously goes back to the
the Vigano letters kind of all stems
from this a lot of people know a little
bit about it not necessarily at under
there there's quite a bit in there for
people who haven't read it sure so it's
kind of play devil's advocate here you
just said credible so you think that
Vigano is credible you don't think that
this is just holding like a personal
grudge because there have been some
theories you know floated like that what
what determines credibility in this
instance and I'll have a follow-up to
that okay well going back to because
viado is something that comes later in
the summer what made the Theodore
McCarrick charge is credible generally
when they're looking for credibility's
they're looking for something that
substantiates what you're saying and in
a case 45 years ago what they would
generally look for is well did the 14
when
was 14 or 15 did the teenage boy tell
anybody back then are those people
around can they be questioned they
remember you sort of dig all those sorts
of things up and now while those aren't
necessarily proof they certainly lend
more credibility than then mckarrick
whose answer was I don't have any
recollection of this yeah I mean that's
that's his whole defense and the other
guy said so however they determined
these charges were credible that those
details we don't know but typically in
these kinds of cases you look for
corroborating evidence and people who
can support the story from way back when
which is of course in the case of
Cavanaugh and Ford
she has no corroborating evidence and
nobody's supporting her story except
just herself so it was not even her she
won't support her own story until
there's an FBI investigation fairly the
FBI is really they see it like I think
the DNC they see it as the Oppo research
arm look they don't realize that's not
what the FBI is for guys they actually
serve a purpose in here well I mean you
got it you got to give them some break
here Stephen that's how they used it for
eight years under Obama so you know old
habits die hard this is exactly true
well I mentioned the Vig on a letter
because that's how most people were
introduced to it because he obviously
sort of corroborated this the story with
mckarrick and he claimed that Pope
Francis knew that's where you know it
kind of goes to the top and I think
that's where where most people jump in
and have been pretty upset about it that
happened later in the summer but well
there's there's a second set of stuff
here that what Vigano is talking about
is not about the what was 45 years ago a
teenage boy in the sacristy of st.
Patrick's Cathedral
after this mckarrick sort of developed a
reputation once he became a bishop of
homosexual assaults on multiple
seminarians when he was the Bishop of
Metuchen he had the diocese Metuchen
spend Catholics money to buy a beach
house yeah high n develop that
reputation when she said that he
developed a reputation as a homosexual
there's a nasty rumor that he's a serial
homosexual assaulter okay on seminarians
yes yeah yeah it's nice all right he
we know all of this was the case because
a couple of diocese in the late - I'm
sorry in the early 2000s had to pay out
they wrote they paid out a total of 185
thousand dollars to different victims
who had been seminarians this that he
was a homosexual predator rapist of
seminarians at that beach house has been
well known by zillions of people in the
church particularly in the hierarchy for
decades and that is what vegan Oh the
former papal ambassador was referencing
in his expose saying the Pope knew about
that Pope Francis knew about that and
what do you believe that I want to make
because again I don't you know leave the
dead do I Braves me oh absolutely
okay absolutely absolutely his papal
ambassador knew if you go through sort
of the the testimony or your viewers if
they want to read it they should have
yep it's a curiosity but but in some the
reason vegan owes testimony is so very
believable okay he gets a couple of
minor things wrong I mean you see I was
working at you know a date is off by a
month here there that sort of thing but
you know the thrust of it is that this
became known that Pope Benedict stepped
in and after McCarrick had already
retired and said you know I want him to
stop traveling around and being out
there he just needs to sort of her quiet
you know quietly retired to a life of
prayer and penance he's gonna be dead
soon so you know just you know for the
sake of scandal just you know we don't
need to make all this public just retire
mop the scene and there was a big blowup
in the in the nunciature the the
ambassador's house the Vatican
Ambassador house in Washington DC
because the Vatican ambassador called
mckarrick in and told him this Pope
Benedict wants you quietly off the scene
and this huge argument blew why quietly
by the way this is one thing that does
by and as an as a non Catholic observer
let me kind of explain this to you why
to me this is my chart of you I went to
I've been to several of the different
churches and I've moved around so I've
had to attend different churches there
was one Church where a man an assistant
pastor
wasn't sexual abuse of a child or
anything but had an affair they kept it
in the dark and the guy moved on he left
no one knew why he was preaching in a
church down the road there was another
Church where similar thing happened
where I attended they actually called in
all of the elders and anyone who was a
member of that church they were as
transparent as possible moved him out
even though he helped helped plant that
church and moved on on the trail you can
guess where one pastor was able to
continue preaching the other one not
ever again so why and why I'm quiet I
don't understand this approach here at
all well this this secrecy or a privacy
thing is what really sort of you know
has a good number good percentage of
faithful Catholics kind of upset for the
same reason you just said I guess in
some cases there is a there is a
principle I suppose you could call it a
principle in canon law the law which
sort of governs the operation of the
church and share the sacraments that
somebody has a right to their good name
that you don't even if something even if
something is true if you don't need to
say it about somebody then don't
so in some cases how you apply this
depends for example the Pope just
removed the bishop of the week after he
retired just removed him accepted his
resignation and it became known from the
Vatican that the Bishop of Bishop
Bransfield of Wheeling West Virginia
Charleston Wheeling West Virginia had
had in some they didn't give the details
of what it was but it was inappropriate
sexual contact with an adult they and
say if it was a male or female everybody
thinks it's a male so they know why why
does that one this is of course what is
it always male is it is there an
authority problem or is there a Zehra is
there like a you know no cash or chicks
ever so there's a there's a gay problem
at the top of the church well now you
come into this now you come into a
historical question that's a very good
question because if you go and you look
at sexual predation abuse both of minors
and of adults so you know you've got the
you know somebody you know a guy you
know molest softball coach
molesting you know teenage players on
his team versus Harvey Weinstein so
right it's sexual molestation one's a
crime the other is also a crime but this
is like the more disgusting crime yeah
out in the world that is generally 85%
heterosexual heterosexual males
attacking you know the opposite sex
whether it's girls or women right in the
church with the clergy it's just the
opposite and the reason is because such
a large percentage of the Catholic
clergy are homosexual now we've been
reporting this for years I know you and
I have been we have been blasted by
every official Church everything our own
bishop here in Detroit will have nothing
to do with us told us to take the name
Catholic out although I didn't have a
right to do that but that side story
told us take the name Catholic research
on him call the FBI have him run an
investigation
I bet you'll find some interesting
tidbits there yeah I know I know you've
been at the front of this I don't
understand what why is why if the if the
goal here is to actually preserve sort
of the purity of the Catholic Church I
don't understand the secrecy I don't
understand the silencing of people like
yourself how that helps I understand it
from a PR perspective but I can't
understand it from a from a theological
from a spiritual perspective at this
point
yeah because well I it's just it's just
become known at this point you just kind
of another just series of just you know
gross vomitus stuff coming out again
and you know I've said it before
publicly I'll say it here on your show
there are a large number I don't know
what I don't know what's how to put a
percentage on it but there is a large
large number of Catholic clergy
including Cardinals Cardinals bishops
priests deacons people who run
seminaries a little bit who hide behind
the fact they are clerics or clergy in
the church but who do not believe the
faith
these are Judas's and you know there's a
saint who I believe it was Saint Agustin
but I might be mistaken on who it was
but there's a saint who said in answer
to the question why would our law
have picked judas iscariot knowing that
he was going to betray him long as he
knew he's gonna betray him because he
was God yeah was and that was kind of a
giveaway see it started back it started
back then Jesus like yeah what's okay I
know what's happening but did you have
to do it that you could have just you
know said him alright sorry I can do I
think it was saying us and whichever
saying it was said the reason one of the
reasons that he did that was to
demonstrate that even in the very close
circle of his own intimates those
apostles that even their one could
betray him so and and lead to his death
I mean what did what did Judas
ultimately do I mean he committed
suicide out of despair but the lead up
to that was that he was part and parcel
of deicide he helped plan and execute
the the the death of God so if that
could happen and you're right in direct
contact with Jesus himself we wake up
every morning hello Jesus good morning
I'll go cook your fish for you if you
could do job no fire Wow any of these
other bishops could do the very same
thing and the Catholic Church has been
you know if you sort of look at those
are the 2,000 year history of it it
really starts to kind of fall apart or
breakdown along the lines of very good
holy wonderful magnificent Saints and
kind of the opposite extreme of the
spectrum these horrible vicious
diabolical almost possessed in their
mind and heart haters of the faith who
also happen to be priests and I think
it's important to note he's an outlier
there and in this case at what point
does the rule does the exception become
the rule when you toss for example a
disproportionate amount of it being
homosexual assault I mean I think what
is it half a billion dollars if I'm not
mistaken or over a billion dollars have
been paid out to think the total payouts
for all of the sexual assault but not
all of the sexual assault was almost
sexual but the vast majority of it was
but the the price tag right now is very
close to four billion dollars CI and
and I was way off I was trying to take
the most conservative estimate that I
could find but I appreciate that the
Catholics giving me more leeway on this
and being transparent about it I mean
again it the question becomes at what
point is the exception now the rule and
and why do you think again why do you
think so disproportionately in the
church the the homosexual abuse again to
an outsider and to an outsider
the Pope's response has been tone-deaf
at best pathetic
evil at worse in a sense that for the
only thing we're evil to prevail we know
is for good men to do nothing so in this
case he literally said I will not speak
in a single word about you speak some
more words one-hot speaking a lot of
words I want to hear a lot of words from
you Pope Francis that's what I want to
hear right now as many words as humanly
possible how about that because that's
the ones kid out there the question
becomes why and what do people like you
you know true faith following Catholics
what can you do about it okay that's a
bunch of question I know okay the first
is why the disproportionate amount well
the disproportionate amount is directly
related to the disproportionate amount
of homosexual abuse be it to minors or
seminarians and adults you know non
minors is owing directly to the larger
proportion of homosexual men in the
Catholic priesthood there's just more of
a percentage of homosexual men in the
Catholic priesthood so the question is
okay how did that get to be the case
right and lots of research has shown
that back in the 1920s and early 1930s
particularly here in the United States
around the world but particularly here
in the United States Joseph Stalin you
know our lovely you know Uncle Joe and
you know communist Russia Athens nobody
he's never killed anybody that's right
those show trials were not show trials
they were actually real things religion
is the cause of all yes continue
that's correct
he wanted the he had made quite clear
that he wanted the destruction of the
Catholic Church and set about to do it
and one of the orders he gave that was
picked up on by a woman here in the
United States who was in the Communist
Party here in the United States that her
name was Bella Dodd she placed roughly
her own you know testimony that she
placed roughly 11
and I'm sorry Stalin had said make sure
you put in smart guys these are
communist agents make sure you put in
get into Catholic seminaries smart guys
who are able to pass themselves off as
being very Orthodox very Catholic and
the whole bit and everything but who are
homosexual so she set out and over the
course of I think it was exactly 12 13
14 years she recruited roughly eleven
hundred men who fit that bill and got
them into seminaries and as you you know
now because that's a while ago on you
know they clearly these homosexuals
don't breed so how does is it just they
have like their apprentices or they they
then appoint yeah a successor their
their understanding of going in was to
sort of you know lay the dynamite for
the destruction of the church okay
so they made sure that they made sure
that they were whenever they needed to
be networked they were networked with
each other they made you know and look
at they're going to excel 1100 guys some
are going to excel up the ranks so
there's going to be kind of lonely lowly
whatever and just sort of hang out and
the you know and the you know the back
waters and I mean you know Liberace you
guys have a lot of gold there's a lot of
pomp and circumstance it's attractive
its attractive to the gig I don't blame
them for that this fashion sense matches
up that's not a bad thing yep you
haven't been in a Catholic Church in a
while how do you see because that's not
what it looks like now well it's great
the Catholic Church is a great beautiful
hotel about the Vatican would people you
louder with crowder studios is protected
exclusively by walter
and hopper
i'm telling you at some point something
has to be done
going up against youtube directly as a
suicide mission yeah yeah
youtube i don't care the demonetizations
the restrictions the hard strikes
it's got to stop and if we don't do
something soon there won't be a mug club
left to save
i'm just glad to be here hey kid
what do you plan to do about the 310
tumblers jack
all right
i leave the 310 tumblers to me but right
now
we've got to take care of youtube
right into this world
all alone god takes your soul
live
till you die
foreign
that was me uh pointing actually to
bring in uh our third chair right away
matt matt
matt eisemann on the instagram and you
know why i was actually at a doctor's
office
cover of what is it rheumatoid arthritis
today
i'm like the kim kardashian of the
arthritis world three-time cover man i
will let you know
yeah and the lady said oh is that matt
eisenman oh i just
love him he's the so i'm huge
amongst camps
american ninja warrior america george
junior american injury junior is coming
out october 13th on universal kids
kids age 9 to 14 will be taken on the
course that sounds like childhood
quarterback yes you are in fact your
dad's black right i am yeah
yeah what's up dog yeah let's stop that
okay
i have a question yeah is this my first
time actually being in the third chair
do we get to drink the wine of the day
or do we just talk about it
what is this that's you don't like wine
even actually when we did the big smu
show and he came out and he poured it in
the glass he
leaned in and whispered said you better
not drink that this is welches
you're getting an invoice on the show
today sargon of akkad yeah
then we have glenn beck on the show whoa
and of course we're going to be talking
about kavanaugh everything that you
need to know about kavanaugh there's a
the timeline has been going back and
forth i feel like a lot of people have
been
lost they're getting lost in the shuffle
so we're going to try and clarify that
for you first though the question of the
day the left you know they say right now
to believe
all women because of it's basically a
blatant virtue signaled and
being sent out to mothers and daughters
but what about the message it sends to
fathers and sons
when the left declares them guilty until
proven innocent genuinely i i wonder
what ramifications do you see there
comment below
and why is no one talking about that i
think it's again uh
i think i think it's a great statement
to say believe all women
it's just making that leap to then
convict all men yeah it's that idea of
we certainly want these accusers to feel
heard but then it's this due process
idea of
again okay we will hear you we will
believe that this is a credible thing
but it needs to be investigated before
we draw any conclusions
before we end a career wait do you hear
that that's the sound of your tonight
show
appearance being cancelled oh yeah
i don't know what happened here i just
uh voiced the opinion about my friends
down syndrome i mean mcdonald when norm
mcdonald has become controversial
after saying specifically my show will
not be topical
yeah he sits gets get it there's no way
around it because it's 2018
but first leading the news before we get
to kavanaugh uh batman is going to be
showing off his bat tally whacker
in the new comic book wow it comes from
tmz the uncensored version of the member
only
shows up in print editions of dc's new
quote adult black label series
uh this has been all over trending that
should come as no surprise given who's
been
announced to portray batman i should say
the dark
that makes sense is that carlos danger
that's the worst but best free name ever
i actually i couldn't believe like
because i saw the image of batman's
member which first of all he he's
circumcised you don't have to click the
picture
we can read the story without it you
have to approve that no i i have to
admit that you're 18. here's one of the
things that bothers me is when people
don't actually do the research
on these things and start talking about
them i wanted to see batman's member
okay and see what was going on first of
all he's clipped
so uh okay you know this bruce wayne
could be a jewish family they know
they're wealthy
yeah but but i just thought i i thought
what is this idea of taking
these characters who are so distinctly a
part of childhood and
and trying to make this adult black
label series like well so funny we're
going to make this so dark that we're
going to put a penis in it
and we're going to give him an origin
story where his name was bruce neverwizz
also in the news by the way an arizona
man
faked down syndrome just to hire
caregivers
abc news the first victim reported that
she assisted him with diaper changes
oh my gosh baths on 30 occasions the
second and third victim took over all
said that he would become sexually
aroused as he was being
paid suspicions arose by the way when
police arrived at the scene
and noticed the suspect was not
you just lost your tonight show
appearance norman mcdonald said that
it was just rape it was just regular
non-retarded rape someone says he didn't
just say he was trying to claim down
syndrome
yeah i've worked with i work with
special needs people you can see that
yeah that's kind of an eyeball thing
usually by the way they're jacked
yeah down to the guys you're like oh my
god you do what kind of shrugs are you
doing and it's like i don't know and
they're really happy
well look i look i i don't approve of
this but if you're gonna go this far to
get bathed
okay i can see something at the end of
the rainbow there for you but being
somebody who sits around in a diaper
that's dirty all day
well that's it
that's that's the most disturbing part
of this entire thing for me you wanted
to sit around in your own crap until
somebody changed you
this was also a movie with johnny
knoxville remember that where he was the
ringer yeah
and ended up falling in love that's this
is that was also not a good film this is
not a good story so let's move on to the
international front
uh it doesn't get any better chinese
kindergarten welcomed kids back to
school
with a pole dancer that is the way to go
back
this is this is actually here's a video
this is how they greeted the students
coming back to the school
yeah this this is the assembly
look at the confusion on those kids
you're gonna be a dancer
you need is the pole for fire drill
i don't know what they're expecting when
they're getting their kids to love you
long time elementary it seems
okay i'll tell you what that day i
couldn't wait to get to finger painting
if you don't know what i'm saying you
are among the dads upset
and it's recording is he the
kindergarten teacher i don't know
that was incredible please get in
trouble i'm gonna
i'm going back to kindergarten because
there was training there
either they hired a professional that's
not someone who just got up on the pole
yeah let me just oh look
little kids i dance on paul no this is
of someone who's like super flexible
clearly they've been doing the part they
had the outfit yeah they had the out and
they were ready to go look
they stored it in the teachers lounge uh
i don't know about that look
any time we make fun of your culture
this is why okay this is just one more
reason why shut up all cultures are
equal which
uh well i was gonna say what made it
creepier that poll was actually batman's
member
that was so that's why that was for
kindergarten that was really
much easier without having his head
thank you neva wits all right speaking
of cultures we have to turn our eye now
to ion india
all cultures are equal shut up let's
every everybody let's just agree on this
and uh smuggler arrested at delhi
airport for hiding gold in his posterior
from hindustan times which almost sounds
like a fake newspaper but it's real
on detailed baggage examination and
personal search it was discovered that
the accused had hidden
nine gold bars i don't remember hiding
nine goals
bars nine bars inside
his rectum uh in his defense he claimed
he had down syndrome so again at this
point that's where we're
yeah they're not they're not thrilled i
got do you know how much a gold bar
weighs
do you know what kind of rectal strength
this guy would have to have
and size and capacity yeah i'm trying to
say gold
the other thing is i also just realized
this is the origin story
for goldfinger that was his proctologist
that's how he got the nickname
he's like wow by the way he's he's he's
an actual he's
he's a board-certified md who i am
really so that's why i never found
nine gold bars in a patient well it
would have been what did you find in
there
uh nothing uh nothing at all i'm not
super surprised with my fiance and some
of the stories she's told us about what
she's
heard yeah she should lead people's lead
with the nurse
and there's a man who literally comes in
every single year on his birthday with a
new item
i think the last one was a water hose
i'm not sure yeah it was a garden
like this is his events that's records
yeah he just he's like blow out the
candles and happy anniversary all right
we're going to see this story and out
doing with 10 gold bars finally
statistics actually show that british
police arrest
nine people not we have a female i
remember the russian
i don't remember nine people a day nine
people a day
for posting offensive messages comes
from reason in 2016
3 300 people were detained and
questioned for things they said online
in some parts of britain the arrest rate
for offensive speech
has risen by nearly 900 percent in
recent years so it started off just as
arrests for alleged
islamophobia misgendering uh
but then with soccer um
the police got out of hand where it
seems to be another piss-poor
performance for your
men sister we call you queer chester
but i'm sure you only knew that after
all was
a recent scope
250 plus years ago we gave england the
middle finger
yeah this is exactly freedom of speech
but no you you're honest to good
what amazes me though is you're looking
at these platforms like twitter
and how they talk about the censorship
that goes on in china
and yet clearly while it's not being
censored people are being prosecuted for
it and you would think
that these platforms ostensibly these
last bastions of
speech would be would be against this
would be opposed to this idea that
that people posting simple ideas that
that
would be demonstrably acceptable most
anywhere
it is it is remarkable and and what's
crazy to me too is we protect speech
that's liable
we protect speeches exactly now from the
left as long as it's
a target that they don't like but then
actual speech actual expression whether
it's comedy
to the written word to even honestly
your own in the case of kavanaugh she's
a good example move on to that here
the defamation is what they protect they
look well people are free she doesn't
need to protect her innocence which that
actually brings us to uh you know what
the meat segment for today
for those who haven't kept it straight
let's go on to this everything you
needed to know about kavanaugh but we're
afraid to ask
lion edition allegedly
allegedly i think she said i see i see
matt going like oh no
oh boy okay so let me give you some some
some macro context here for people who
don't really remember the story yeah
remember the story it's still ongoing
but by the time we hit friday by the
time we hit thursday it's hard to
remember what happened on monday yeah
that's where we are so still in news
everyone's talking about the
alleged attempted rape accusation from
dr christine ford by the way no longer
going to be calling your doctor
yeah christine for christine it's just
like
christy christie for your dr christie
all right listen by the way hit the
notification bell
join michael if you haven't already you
get the show every single day 99 dollars
annually 69 for students veterans active
military or there will be no more
crowded confronts or change my mind the
choice is yours let me just say this
of course it's possible that the
accusations here
uh could be accurate right and we're not
saying that all accusations of attempted
rape are false
okay does everyone can everyone we're on
the same page
right do we all agree rape is bad bad
bad rape bad hold on
make sure they say bad a little bit they
can't take it out yeah
but if you look at the way the story
pans out i hope we preface it now um
if you look at the timeline you have to
balance the scales of justice between
there an attempted rape some 30 odd
something years ago that someone doesn't
know when it happened or where it
happened and why he possibly stopped
mid-ray possibly drunk and passed out
or is she a lying we're going to
present the evidence to you
and you decide yes by the way i know
you're saying just me no one else in
this room i labeled her a lying
without proof granted she did the same
but with
attempted rape that's the purpose here
rapist let's see what happens
exactly um
it should be a fair fight we'll see
listen i i hope i hope people are
understanding
the point what's so funny is if you
listen to her attorney did you guys
follow this
ford's lawyer she said well my client
doesn't need to she doesn't need to
prove
the innocence of her case here's what's
been interesting to me with this
is look the statute of limitations
clearly has passed yes
there's not going to be a crime so
obviously this is just to judge is this
guy
does he deserve to have a position on
the supreme court or not and what i
thought was really fascinating was
a group of women who knew him at the
school wrote a letter
attesting to his character like 60. and
then and then and then a contrarian
group
wrote a letter saying we experienced
things that make us feel this is
believable and you realize neither of
those things
have any bearing on this it's just
people saying feelings are things there
are no facts
involved here and there unfortunately no
facts to prove this one way or another i
don't even know if this were if this
were actually in front of a court what
it would look like
okay he didn't hold the door for becky
i don't it's just the lawyer came out
and said oh
my client doesn't need to prove the
innocence of her claim no no you accused
him of rape
do you know anything about the justice
system it's not i accuse you of rape my
claim is true until you prove it false
just
watch and justice for all with al pacino
once
so let's look at this and whether this
could be a a pr
or not here are the fundamental problems
with the allegations against kavanaugh
so let me i have some sources here
because they're important i want to make
sure i get this
right christine ford not doctor i will
not say doctor and i won't say doctor
for you either matt iceman
you watch while people fall in the pools
of four foot deep water
you're not saving humanity anytime soon
sounded like my dad apparently now
they're
nine year olds yeah dunk the nine dunk
the four-year-old in there let's see if
he can swim after
being discombobulated by giant foam pads
the hell is that different it wasn't
entertaining enough
hope you have one hell of a liability
waiver matt um
so if ford has he remotely kept the
details of her own story straight and
the only person who can truly bad for
her
is dianne feinstein now i can't say
everything's truthful i don't know but
i do know that um
you had to contact her lawyers damn it
diane you had one job
just say she's not a lying and you
couldn't do that
so let me recap this for you for accused
kavanagh of attempted rape and a letter
to diane feinstein that feinstein didn't
mention till after the hearings
feinstein said two says she can't vouch
for everything whether it's true or not
four doesn't remember exactly when it
happened or where it happened her story
no one here is saying only hydro I'm not
you're not no one here saying only
nuclear I'm not you're not no one here
saying only fracking I'm not you're not
no one here saying only clean coal I'm
not you're not no one here is even
saying no solar and and noha noha wind
turbines
we're just saying it shouldn't be
subsidized but to the rest of the media
this conversation is that of two
radicals who need to be locked away and
that is concerning to me very happy now
we have a return guest on the program
it's always interesting when you have
people like our next guest because the
video goes up on YouTube and we don't do
a lot of long-form guest interviews yeah
not too often let alone for a second
time and you see this video it goes up
on YouTube of course people who are mug
Club members they enjoyed it but the
people on YouTube their split and you
see a lot of dislikes two likes and then
the ratio just hits a tipping point and
it switches when more people see it and
they actually start looking up what the
guest is actually looking up the stats
of exactly because you know this guy
he's a doctor that means we're all a
bunch of slopes but you can follow him
on the Twitter as long as they allow him
at eco sense now his book is confessions
of a Greenpeace dropout dr. Patrick
Moore thank you for being back sir great
Steven nice to be with you again well I
I'm really glad to have you back because
there were a couple of things I wanted
to talk about and I know that you wrote
an article about twelve and visible eco
catastrophes and threats of doom that
are actually fake I'd like to get to
those in a second but last time we had
you on first off did you get a lot of
feedback from urine and your in your
private inboxes or did you check out the
comments section do you just avoid it no
I generally do look at the comments
section and it was quite a lot of
comments you're right there was some
negatives at first knee-jerk stuff and
trolls but in the end it came out very
positive because I am telling the truth
and if anybody can find something that
I'm saying that they don't think is true
I would be very pleased to hear from
them so I can correct it the comments
switched because immediately people have
a knee-jerk reaction like you said they
go oh this person is this person is a
climate denier dislike until I
realized on a second one of the founding
members of Greenpeace a doctor somebody
who's actually study this extensively
and then people started listening to
what you
to say and I wanted to have you on for
for something specific that I noticed
you know I spend a lot of times and a
lot of time in the Great Lakes regions
and you know there but record-high is
right now remember dick Durbin in 2013
saying they were gonna dry up and fast
for a few years some of them I think are
at record highs and I know others are at
17-year highs and in contrast what we
talked about with climate change
wherever people line up personally the
region has had some of the best growing
climates in decades cherries are very
finicky crop that's one thing that I
know because we have family who work in
cherries and it needs a very moderate
slow thawing winter and they've actually
had to dump cherries to price fix so
right away I thought of you when we
discussed climate change a warming
climate and more precipitation have you
been following this and I always wonder
what the response is from the alarmists
regardless of where they line up on
climate change but the alarmism Africa
on a second the lakes are high and
growing is fantastic well they'll find
some reason to say that it's bad that
the lakes are overflowing etc you know I
mean because now it's become that
climate change is too hot and it's too
cold and it's too wet and it's too dry
and then they make up that there's more
tornados and hurricanes which is false
and then they make up that there's more
damage being caused by extreme weather
which is true because there's so much
more infrastructure in the way of
extreme winter today because of the
population growth and the growth of
cities and all so they'll find a way
every time to point to something that
they claim is out of the ordinary and I
have challenged these people in a
general sense that there is nothing
absolutely zero nothing in today's
weather or climate that is anywhere near
out of line with the last 10,000 years
in this interglacial period since the
ice caps melted the last time and so
they've got to say ok no there's a
strongest this and the strongest that or
the weakest this and the week is that
they can't because nothing that is
happening now is anywhere near out of
ordinary with the ordinary well that is
just there's extremes in every measure
you'll always find an extreme somewhere
in the world
going on and that's all they do is
cherry-pick them now and it's really
disingenuous of them because they
started saying it's global warming and
carbon dioxide is doing it it was very
simple what they said at the beginning
sure more co2 from human fossil fuel
consumption will increase the warming of
the earth then they changed it to
climate change which now wasn't just
warming it was also cold yes and rasa
and and and wet and every other
imaginable flooding and whatever all of
a sudden was attributable to carbon
dioxide even cold was attributable to
carbon dioxide even though the idea of
co2 being a greenhouse gas is the idea
that it would make it warmer right not
that it would make it colder and then
when the temperature stopped increasing
at the rate it did during the 1990s
wasn't we both acknowledge it was
happening was it it was increasing 1990s
yes there you go there's four people out
there's not a desire he's actually
analyzing the data we both agree on that
good this 1990s warming its beginning in
actually the 80s followed the cooling
from the 1940s to the 1970s in which if
you go to the deplorable climate science
blog of Tony Heller's you will see just
yesterday on the 10th of this month he
documented what they were saying that
now new age may be coming because it was
cooling in the 60s and 70s yes then it
started warming again and around 2000
the warming slowed down to are basically
insignificant level well I believe we've
cut I don't want to I don't want to cut
you but I believe we've covered this
quite a bit in the first interview and
it was very interesting and of course
there's still backlash no matter what my
my point of interest here is with the
Great Lakes it's moderate temperate
climate climates not super cold and not
super hot in the summers slow thawing
and record crop yields for the probe
over dumping cherries out because we
want to fix the prices it to me it is
mind-boggling but this does bring us to
a bigger point which you wrote about in
your article um what do you think of the
new trend I you know what maybe I'm
ignorant maybe it's not a new trend but
it seems as though science right now is
bowing to activism quite a bit and
that's kind of what you're speaking
about where where where science is often
used to silence
whatever contradicts its initial
hypothesis and a good example this is
right now if people are watching this on
YouTube I don't know if you're where
this YouTube now puts fat check links on
all videos about people who might be
climate change skeptics as they put them
in order to debunk them so right now it
could be appearing I have no idea what
point in this video what do you think
about science bowing to political
pressure is that a real problem yes it
is a real problem like when Galileo was
put under house arrest for his life for
saying that the earth went around the
Sun and the same thing is happening now
people are claiming that co2 is the main
driver of climate change global warming
and now it isn't even climate change
it's extreme weather events they used to
say oh that's not climate that's just
the weather when you said oh it was
really cold or read something you know
that that's sort of contradicted right
the global warming scenario and and now
all they do is talk about extreme
weather when they were telling us not to
confuse weather with climate yes years
ago it was used to actually make people
look like it make anybody look like a
simpleton they go oh you're confusing
climate and weather and of course I
ruined Thanksgiving dinner did you have
you heard that by the way the recent a
good example of the hoax academic paper
it claimed that penises cause climate
change were you up on this I did hear
about that and I looked down and could
not see any causal relationship at all
well yes it's more of it's more of a
climate detector it's a veritable
climate psychic interchangeably but it's
it's pretty funny they just used a bunch
of climate jargon to associate penises
with worsening climate change but the
funny part I don't think I'll ever will
know about this it actually was
published in her peer-reviewed academic
journal they were tricked that to me is
I mean that really is Orwellian type
scary as a non scientist well you know
at my age actually Steven any cause
effect relationship related to that part
of my anatomy would be welcome that's
AII
there'll be a different doctor who I'll
have on on a private Skype after this
but I mean how does that happen how does
something like this someone who's been
in this industry for a long time and
obviously the work that you've done as a
doctor how does something like this get
pop we always talk about peer-reviewed
papers
in a peer-reviewed journals how does
something that was fraudulent by design
make it through what's the process like
Howard it screaming it's completely
corrupted in that almost all the
peer-review is being done by people's
buddies who are on the same wavelength
as they are and and actually most of the
peer review journals have been taken
over by journalists used to be peer
reviewed science journalists were run by
scientists who had a flair for
publishing and for the language and you
know could read and write but these
these people in charge of the science
journals now are leftist journalists to
a large extent and they just have a
barrier against anything that questions
the litany or the the truth squad and as
they call themselves but they're not the
truth squad they're they don't let the
truth out squad this has been I'm on the
west coast of British Columbia here this
has been one of the biggest wild berry
years I have seen it is actually the
biggest one I've ever seen black
blackberries which are gone wild here
they're not native to here huckleberry
salmon berries salal berries those are
all native here I've never seen anything
like it and it isn't just the warmth as
a matter of fact I think the warming is
a minor component of the record crop
productions that are going on in greens
and all kinds of other commodities
around the world
it's the increase in carbon dioxide
which is fertilizing all of the green
plants around the world and making them
grow faster and yield more that's the
biggest part of it and it's been more or
less proven with satellites from about
six different research groups around the
world in Europe in Australia in the
United States and a bad fact is a bit of
a disconnect in NASA and NOAA because
there are people in both those
organizations who are looking at the
fertilization effect of co2 on the
greening of the earth as it's called the
earth know it already
a quick question I'm a simpleton would
that be directly just because of co2 s
chemical structure are you talking about
it leading to more precipitation which
would help obviously with the soil no
I'm talking about it as a food for
plants co2 is the primary food for
plants right water is it
is also like carbon dioxide and water
put together Nick sugar glucose that's
the basis of the energy for all life on
earth because we have to we eat the
plants or we eat animals that have eaten
the plants it all comes up from
photosynthesis and the combination of
carbon dioxide and water to make sugar
and this is where the demonization of
carbon dioxide is so outrageously
off-base because carbon dioxide is the
basis of all organic life on earth that
is where the carbon comes from in
carbon-based life and we are
carbon-based life and so is all the rest
of the life on Earth and if there wasn't
any co2 in the global atmosphere there
would be no life not only not only if
there wasn't any if there wasn't a
certain amount because just like
anything there can be too little of that
that's my pivotal question here because
I can hear skeptics right now saying
well holla second we're not saying all
carbon dioxide is bad we're saying that
we are out of balance now that the ratio
is too high of carbon dioxide so what is
the amount that would be optimal I guess
and and how close or how far away are we
from because I know that that's where a
lot of the nuance debate occurs and they
just claim that obviously non scientist
as myself are not entitled to an opinion
so I'll listen to yours well one of the
most concrete ways in which you can see
what the optimum level for plant growth
is is both experimentation in labs and
greenhouse growers all greenhouse
growers around the world increased the
co2 level in their greenhouse to
increase the productivity up to 40 to 60
percent of the crops in there and to
make them grow faster to come to
fruition sooner shorter time of growth
and other words and that that's around
800 to 2000 parts per million now
greenhouse growers don't put 2,000 ppm
in because there's a law of diminishing
returns at first you get really great
increases from 400 to 800 and even from
800 to a thousand or 1200 after that the
curve starts to go off but it still goes
up okay so in nature where they're not
worried about profits and diminishing
returns in nature the optimum level is
somewhere between 1,000 and 3,000 parts
per million whereas now it's
400 and before we came along it was 280
and at the height of the last glaciation
because the Seas when they cool absorb
co2 from the atmosphere it was at 180
parts per million which is only 30 parts
per million above where plants begin to
die at 150 ppm and during the last
glaciation the high elevation plants did
die that is pretty well demonstrated and
the reason they died is because the
higher you go the thinner the air
becomes and so a hundred and fifty parts
per million is occupying a much larger
volume elevation and therefore the
plants get get enough co2 to survive so
we were talked about not being in
balance
co2 has been declining for 150 million
years on a relatively steady basis right
you can the Japs are all available for
anybody to see and it's very well proven
through ice cores and oxygen-18 proxies
in ocean sediments and etc etc
Stonehenge has been declining steadily
actually for the last 500 million years
but let's just take the last 150 million
where it has been steadily declining
without any upward blips there was a
huge flux of co2 into the atmosphere in
the early Earth then when species
learned to do photosynthesis and use
that carbon dioxide to make sugars they
started taking it out of the atmosphere
but it wasn't until about 40 or 50
million years ago that it started to go
into a danger zone and it just keeps
going down and down and down until we
came along whereas the marine calcifying
organisms inadvertently by building an
armor plating for themselves a very
useful thing to do for their survival
presage the end of life on earth through
the loss of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere over time Al Gore has another
Learjet to get to I do I understand
exactly where you're what you're going
with this but here's kind of that the
issue that we run into right is what
you're saying obviously what will have
overlays for people people can look up
for themselves and obviously decide
whether they believe it to be legitimate
or not there's something that is
legitimate there's truth and then you
can choose to believe truth
unfortunately but but the issue is that
everything you're saying doesn't break
through and so
even YouTube like we just talked about
themselves will dismiss you simply as a
quack as a denier without listening to
what you have to say so I want to go
back to something you just mentioned
which to me is obviously at most
importance because it ties into a lot of
the cultural issues that we've discussed
cultural Marxism the censorship of
speech we see it in comedy now but it
really concerns me when you start to see
it in science you mentioned that a lot
of these peer-reviewed journals were
once peer reviewed by scientists and now
often by activists journalists activists
scientists or active scientists yes
journalists control the journals
yes large these days the activists
control the science of a call right when
they say climate science right or
climate scientists they mean themselves
yes they don't mean and everybody who's
studying the climate because people who
are studying the climate who don't agree
with them are considered deniers not
climate scientists exactly I'm talking
about the peer-reviewed journals like we
were discussing and you said there's
been a shift that when did that shift
occur because it for a long time again
Americans had to rely on certain systems
and power that they believed to be
truthful when would you say that shift
occurred and do you have any I guess
particularly breeds of examples that we
could mitigating thirty years ago twenty
years ago it was over by you know 20
years ago pretty well and and that's
what we've been being fed since is
basically a very filtered set of ideas
the idea that co2 is the main driver of
climate change and global warming is
this the center piece right and and it
is that is false there is no possibility
that any substance in that small
quantity point zero four percent of the
atmosphere could be the controlling
factor of the whole global climate the
Sun is the controlling factor of the
whole global climate but it is moderated
by many other and classic questions you
said as you said point four percent how
much of that is zero or per 20 or more
percent how much of that is human is men
made well that's a question of whether
you're looking at it as how much of the
co2 in the atmosphere today was caused
by humans versus
the co2 in the flux is caused by humans
right it sorts like in economics you
have a cash flow statement and you have
a balance sheet on the balance sheet
right now co2 has gone from 280 parts
per million to 400 parts per million
about a 40% increase since humans
started and missing significant amounts
of co2 mostly since 1950 has been an
exponential curve of emissions but there
hasn't really been an exponential curve
of co2 levels in the atmosphere that's a
fairly straight line and that indicates
that much of the co2 we are emitting is
being absorbed by the vegetation because
that's that's what eats co2 that's what
I wanted to get to because that to me is
I think this is kind of a bait and
the media doesn't get to tell generation
Z what socialism and capitalism is
anymore because these kids are living it
and that petrifies the left and it
should question of the day do you think
that Jim Carrey is is a clinically
insane B if he is what does that say
about the Hollywood elites surrounding
him who agree with his every word as
seen on Bill Maher when it comes to
socialism and how Americans are living
under Trump right now I always wonder
when I see Jim Carrey saying what do you
see are they just all that out of touch
or is it a touch of mental illness
perhaps I'd like to see your comments
let me know here's some context for
those who didn't see it on Bill Maher
last week Jim Carrey claims that it's
time to stop apologizing for being a
socialist and it's time to really push
it here we go we have to say yes to
socialism to the word and everything we
have to stop a posh I am here's what I'm
saying to me the socialism comments went
viral on Twitter more actually cut them
they cut them from the show as far as I
understand he cut them it you don't see
all of these quotes everywhere on all of
the platforms but we want to give you
context of the rest of the interview so
you could actually look at Jim Carrey's
claims and take them forth there so
again and left once less context we want
more let's go on to the claims so you
know that the Republicans are running
with the word socialism they're trying
to say and scare people scare people
onion ISM Venezuela Trump says we're
gonna be living in Venezuela because
it's the best example we'll probably
have true true socialism less money but
mainly because you said everyone loves I
don't think I don't think you really
wanna look at as well we said okay we'll
go along about his Weiland trail with
you you praised it all along with a
dictator other familiar socialist faces
by the way hit the notification bail
because subscriptions owe me anything
and join up at mug clubs look look
here's a proof
important forces we've had on this
planet belong is love you my friend as
an inch others 20 sometimes American
journalists talk about how bad the
country is people are lining up the food
that's a good thing what do you mean by
that
mr. Bernie Sanders necessary it's the
most important figure on this planet by
the way Captain Planet doesn't make
santos doesn't make that claim nobody
claims about superheroes regarding that
kind of importance so it's not the
republican screen people's comparison to
venezuela so left they've made these
comparisons for a long time until Chavez
experiment when completely soured the
country headed for a 1 million percent
hyperinflation people started starving
to death with citizens eating rats dogs
zoo animals to survive this is what
happened you pointed at Venezuela you
champion its cause and made it turned
around on you so you move on to the next
socialist country I grew up in Canada
okay we have socialized medicine and I
am I'm here to tell you that this line
that you get on all of the political
shows different people is that it's a
failure the system is a failure in
Canada it is not a failure in can I
never waited for anything in my life
anecdote I chose my own doctors and my
mother never paid for a prescription
anecdotal it was fantastic
untrue untrue by the way what war mold
that I fall into the Jim Carrey gets to
act as though he has the moral high
ground in combating a biased media
everyone people you've never this is
what you never hear everyone has heard
this everyone they use Canada as the
model and said it was how the United
States should model it's it's it's a
health care program you're just what
your gym you're just one in a long line
of celebrities and politicians who've
been selling this life specifically
Canada three years how does it happen
that here in Canada we're back to him
they provide only health care to all
people and I don't think there is any
debate that the quality of care here is
as good or better than the United States
ways of providing high-quality health
care that you have developed that we
need to know more about you know in
Canada they run their entire free
universal health care system federal
overhead total bureaucracy 1.7 percent
of the total healthcare budget
white-blue that's a wolf by the way this
this is a lie okay Canadian health care
is objectively worse than the United
States now we've done some videos on
this so you can go back and look at just
search in this channel socialized
healthcare Canada but difficulties his
examples which are anecdotal they have
the worst ER referral wait times but in
eleven developed countries fifty-six
percent of Canadians actually wait
longer than four weeks for treatment
compared to the US it's about twenty
four percent the average wait to see a
specialist in Canada is twenty-one weeks
at which point you don't need any more
my mom was looking at nine months for it
was at nine months for an MRI yeah nine
months for tomorrow and she got it
within about a month you have cash you
have a diamond that's how it was
socialized health care system you want
to know how long I waited 45 minutes yes
I got one new context when he says I
didn't have to wait well it was three
years when we had to find a family
doctor well I never had to pay for
prescription I said subscription I don't
know maybe they don't pay for magazines
we're taught in the face I don't know
what rules are there I have the paper
prescriptions okay for about 70% of
prescriptions that they want by the way
they don't have the same kind of
generics that you have the United States
certainly know when I was there but if
none of that convinces you if you're
still convinced by Jim Carrey's
anecdotal evidence to which he received
thunderous applause here's something for
you
the wait times were so bad in Canada it
was ruled a human rights violation by
the Canadian Supreme Court in shall we
vs Quebec to force somebody into the
socialized healthcare system well not
allowing them to pay for privatized care
as I've talked about this many times now
in Canada have you sing so in his super
hospitals as we know them in United
States hospitals dimension terminal
illness survival rates medical
innovation it's just I mean the list
goes on and on and on you know here he
goes on to again appeal to emotion there
are people who are sick but that's the
doesn't have to lose your home and as
your mother got sick only that's not
true and this is what they do they try
to appeal to emotion so know even if
lose your house because someone gets
sick but Obamacare is one of the
greatest taxes in the middle class that
we've seen in our lifetime who was left
footing the bill just have you talked
about with the housing crisis not that
people who qualify for the subsidies
paid for by the rest of America and not
the super wealthy who could afford the
skyrocketing premiums and deductibles
but the middle-class Americans who do
the subsidizing well you shouldn't you
shouldn't have to lose your house
because they get sick well should you
have to lose your house because you
actually had the right amount of money
saved for money down and you actually
got a fair loan you didn't go to the
subprime market and even go into the
health care exchange because you're
middle class and you're working she gets
screwed that way we only care about the
non-contributing zeroes amongst us why
do they get to dictate how the rest of
society lives hey I've never gotten my
crap together I don't work please next
clip nothing more socialistic than some
of the Pentagon programs that are just
jobs programs the Pentagon says we don't
want these tanks and they build them
it's not socialism in a nice way what
are they
sure enough socialists where do they go
to military war police okay there's a
difference when it come on 'ti in a
public good this is this is really
really easy police National Defense
their public goods health care college
Nestle tea commodities okay let me
explain what this means and then they
give you analogy actually you're the one
who taught this analogy Poppa Crowder
public goods are non-rival arrest
non-excludable that means non-rival rest
let's start with that that more people
can use them without any significant
additional cost
now this coudl means you can't keep the
extra people from using that good so
even free enterprise conservatives we
all agree the government should provide
public military defense for exam a
police force right things like free
health care free college aren't really
public goods because it costs a lot more
for each additional patient or person
you add to the list and you can easily
keep them from using it this is a
referee analogy that was actually given
to me by um you pop a credit the analogy
for the legitimate role of government
like hockey referee okay it's to keep
the players the citizens safe right from
both internal and external but someone
might be throwing you know a big gulp
and they're supposed to say from that or
an octopus in hockey it's incidental to
the play you keep your whistle in your
pocket we're not soccer
come on role of the government to keep
us safe okay so what falls into
legitimate purview of government of
course a military yeah of course things
like borders of course things like
enforcing laws to make sure that other
people aren't hurt by law breaking
citizens we're not saying there's no
role to government we just don't think
that everything is a human right well
it's the economic equivalent of the free
speech argument you make where these
people make their bones right and they
shut the door behind them right the same
thing here yeah let's go back to the
first point people should apologize for
so should people of South apologize for
socialism he's saying other people
shouldn't yeah you should you should
socialism and it's cousin who's aged
slightly less gracefully communism they
try to they try to separate those two
you really can't if you look at them
historically has led to insanely brutal
regimes under the USSR mile Castro
Chavez should I keep going
and all those regimes by the way were
initially praised by the same leftist
elite and academics of America just like
celebrities of Venezuela you can go back
and find the same elites praising Castro
and Soviet Russia every mile I mean a
dog recently praised Mao I think it was
like 2012 she's somebody does their
homework I you know I was I remember I
was on a panel I think with Doug's shown
on Fox News well she wasn't praising now
and I'm gonna oh this guy has no idea
what's about to happen
done praising mouth yeah when it comes
to long term endorsement the left has a
monopoly on batting a hundred for
sucking okay by the way communism we all
saw that religion communism has led to a
hundred million dead over the last
hundred years you know far far more than
we're talking about even just religion
that's a lot of people that's a lot of
there's a lot of people right they
pointed to Russia yeah I didn't work any
see what they pointed to Cuba maybe so
whatever then they put it up in as well
you just saw them recently pointing to
Venezuela and then that didn't work I
mean went back to China I don't know
what happened up here the Democrats seem
to get a plan to fight this sweat this
slander of socialism you're gonna be
living in Venezuela I don't see we have
to say yes to socialism for the word and
everything do we have to stop a posh I
am okay you want to know how I know that
Jim Carrey loves capitalism a hundred
million whoa and if that weren't enough
here's another little tidbit just just
from that very segment on Bill water I
went out today and bought me some Nikes
[Applause]
salute to Colin Kaepernick to Nike
congratulations on a fantastic Colin
Kaepernick who wants to loot the flag
with will salute Colin Kaepernick Nike
of all companies the same Nike famous
for exploiting sweatshop labor
conditions in other countries that we
don't allow in our capitalist system the
United States
this is shows you how incoherent Jim
Carrey's worldview is it's worse than
Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind I
know you all try to act like I know
what's really going on there thank you
don't know somebody fan theories with it
in Donnie Darko shut up stop trying
actually have a handle on it you don't
it's just so funny that they use right
now of all times this is why I don't
know if he's crazy he's just completely
out of touch right now of all times to
push for socialism yeah look here when
they were talking about Donald Trump
they said he would rate as a he would
rate his job performance as very good
and and Jim Carrey goes as what a
demolition man and everyone claps like
yeah what is he what our economy is not
only the best in the world it's doing
insanely well right now by our own
metrics the jobless rate lowest point in
half a century that since the moon
landing woman rate pretty low a all-time
low ever ever everyone said that Donald
Trump was delusional for suggesting that
he could even achieve 3% growth I think
actually what did the brian Stelter was
he mentally stable is that the 4.2
percent he was delusional and mentally
unstable for promising 3% 4.2 do you've
any idea how significant that is in the
realm of economic it's just bizarre to
me that they pick right now to
about free enterprise and try and push
show schools' them and here's what I
think the left is petrified of another
baby boomer generation because why free
enterprise capitalism is working really
well
as we've just pointed out we have an
entire generation of people some what
Millennials but Generation Z who had
never actually seen capitalist markets
doing as well as they have now four
years the left told
the capitalism was a failure socialism
was the answer up until now the
generations hadn't really seen a free
market right they had they had George
Bush Bill Clinton George W Bush and
neither of whom were really Republican
nothing was really all that conservative
certainly not economically followed by
eight years of Obama but now with Trump
following Obama the left is terrified of
Carter being followed by Reagan 2.0 yeah
sure when people were young right they
thought they wanted Carter a hippie
free-love and Carter he seems like a
nice guy he wears a sweater the White
House there and put some solar panels on
wore a sweater you keeps a little bit
cooler in the winter farms peanuts what
could go wrong what could possibly go
wrong and so they thought they wanted
Carter's and Reagan happen and they
realized they had more money in their
pocket and they didn't have to wait in a
gas line so the Bene one generation grew
up from pot smoking hippies into the
conservative yuppie stereotype that you
see today
suddenly generations who are sold on
socialism are now seeing the positive
and personal effects of free enterprise
in their lifetime more so more
importantly in their own lives so how do
I mean greater job opportunities for
themselves big time keeping more of
their own money for themselves the left
knows and is terrified especially
because they appeal purely to selfish
motives disguised as compassion they are
terrified of generation Z after
Millennials upon whom the left they've
had a they have footed generation Z with
a massive bill and like the baby boom
generation Generation Z which is the
most conservative generation at this
point in their lifetime ever many one at
this point in their youth they're more
conservative than baby boomers they are
going to be even more conservative once
they get older because now they've seen
the contrast between a crappy economy
under Obama and a flourishing economy
under Trump up until this Trump boom the
media was able to sell an entire
generation on the contrast of terrible
unsuccessful capitalism and
compassionate democratic socialism
that's where we've used right but now
the generation is living it they're
living the contrast of one of the worst
job economies ever for people under 30
in accessibility to health care even if
you work for a living particularly you
work for living in a Barack Obama now
it's being contrasted with more money
left in their paychecks more jobs
available more free-market options
available than ever before whether it's
health care whether it's good take your
pick more choices than ever before under
President Trump the media doesn't get to
tell Generation Z what socialism and
is anymore because these kids are living
it and that petrifies the left and it
should like this video watch another one

was credited a and I know when people
think oh this is this is a montage
edition it's like like before happy days
went away right before the jump the
shark wasn't montage but this is
actually something that we haven't done
before but a lot of people have asked me
to talk about some of my favorite guests
that we've had in the show and sometimes
there's a little bit more that's
happened behind the scenes that we just
don't really get to fill and I do have
some favorite guests some standout
guests so we're gonna give you the top
ten guests that have appeared a lot of
this matter and why they're tucked into
main and I'd love to hear from you who
your favorite guests have been or who
you'd like to see on the show comment
below we always want to hear from you so
number 10 a guest I loved having on the
show just because he was such a talk
about a gentle giant World's Strongest
Man four times in the four-time Arnold
Classic Strongest Man so eight times
really uh Bryan Shaw maybe at seven who
cares at this point the point is he's
really strong huge episode 357 he can go
reference in it for Mudd Club members a
lot of these are on YouTube but some of
them are behind Mudd Club only yeah
the full version or sometimes an
extended version and the reason Bryan
Shaw was so interesting to me was
because not only was he big and
obviously strong and intimidating and I
soiled myself but I found I've been
really fortunate to interview excellent
people people who are the matter of fact
I was trying to tell an older relative
about Bryan Shaw she's like well I guess
that would make sense how you're
impressed by him being strong like no
you don't it's not about the strength do
you understand what this guy has done to
achieve this to be the best at anything
and talking with about it you can you
can see a borderline and I mean this is
a good way obsessive personality about
attention to detail and quality and you
see this with any of the people we've
interviewed who were at the top top
level of their field and one thing for
me that really stood out episode 357
with Bryan Shaw I always wanted to ask
this
four-time World's Strongest Man was also
the runner-up more times than anyone
else against his biggest rival wrote the
drona Savickas I think it's how it's
pronounced and poor for the torch was
passed to Bryan Shaw it wasn't even
close this is a journalist guy was in a
league of his own in and Bryan Shaw
Khanna
it a little bit but I asked him you know
he finally just really was
he was as candid as could be and that
was a breakthrough moment in that
interview enjoy you went on to win four
times but like I said the victus was
your main rival and there is a moment I
remember when I was watching world's
strongest camera which year it was but
it was it was a log lift I think it was
the Austrian oak and as far as I
remember it no one else had lifted it
yet some kind of overhead lift and then
I think you were the first one to do it
and you got a rep or two and then I
remember is it victus getting in because
that was his lift listen difference from
it and he just wrapped it out like it
was a like it was a baby again I don't
say that's it because then you went in
you you came back and you won this is
not a slight at all but what was that
moment like for you because it was so
mind-blowing how how strong he wasn't
very specific facets back then sure we I
mean there was I don't know exactly what
moment you're talking about there but
there was definitely times where he had
events especially with the log because
out that's I'm he's been pretty open
saying that's been his favorite lifts by
far overall and so he had those moments
with the log whereas I had kind of those
moments with lifting stones which is
more of kind of my specialty yeah lifts
where you know he couldn't do those
things so in a lot of ways I think
that's what made our rivalry great yeah
is that he had different strengths than
I did and it was always trying to keep
up you know for me keep up with him the
best I could unlike his vet best events
and then the same for him yeah and I
think that we we forced each other to
get better which made it you know it
made it great yeah it really was an area
that was very fun to watch and I just
asked because I always wonder what it's
like to be like the world's the
strongest guy everywhere you go and then
in one event one guy is just you're like
I like it Philippians 1 one word is
frustrating I liked that it was you know
because you put all this hard training
into doing it and then you know if you
go and have an event like that where you
would do so well and I
trained so hard to be better at it it
was just kind of like man you walk away
frustrated from moments like that for
sure
still pretty strong in my book number
nine this is gonna be one that might
surprise some people the first time Nick
DiPaolo was on and this is episode 73 it
was just a big deal for me because he's
one of my favorite stand-up comedians
ever so I grew up watching him and as a
matter of fact when I used to watch him
I would almost feel bad about myself
because I thought I will never ever be
able to achieve with it I will never be
as good of a stand-up comedian as as
Nick DiPaolo huh
I did that enter know in art I would
ever I was drawing when I was younger I
would always like look it like the best
and I'd be like I'm never really go
start smoking crack it's also really
nice to Nick he was really nice I got to
know him on a personal level we spent
like an hour on the phone and he didn't
disappoint it was just bust
I got pee yourself funny so episode 73
it was hard to even pictures take your
pick Nick DiPaolo hysterical it was me
basically meeting one of my comedy idols
do you follow mixed martial arts well I
know your sports guy but do you follow
like the UFC I choked out my wife last
Hillary you know at that black radio
station saying that she had hot sauce oh
my gosh we ran with that we had that
Anna Lou player morphine drip both laugh
she was pandering everybody in the room
know it when they said what are you
carrying a purse they would have had
more respect for her if she said well
thanks to your people I carry mace you
you were right in that mix but yeah
Klein and Carlin and obviously Cosby
until you know the kind of whole rape
thing but there are people like what
happened well you know he raped he raped
the equivalent to a small Haitian
village but shook his hand after show in
Atlantic City but 15 years ago next
thing you know I wake up I'm wearing
nothing but a temple t-shirt instead
there's a bunch of puddin pop rap it's
doctor might know what all right and
clocking in at number eight and you
might think why isn't he higher up on
the list it's just hard to make a list
number two because we have to hear
George st. Pierre episode 134 not only
is he my favorite fighter of volta if I
had to pick one would probably door st.
Pierre and of course because I'm from
from Montreal and all of you their eyes
are glazing over Oh UFC fights it's not
about the sport of fighting it's not
about the UFC if you go watch a
documentary on Georges st. Pierre
there's one called I think the DNA of
George st. Pierre it's done by the same
people do all these Discovery Channel
films like about wolves very very well
done again you realize the same thing
that you see with Bryan Shaw the
consistency with people or at a very
very high level are people who are
self-conscious to a degree but confident
they all realize they could do something
great they said okay I can be the best
at this and then the level of discipline
that most people will never fully
comprehend but my favorite moment from
this in episode 134 George st. Pierre so
he was in the program he couldn't he
couldn't get Skype working so he called
in and there was a special that he did
in the UFC countdown where his
french-canadian mom in French was
complaining when the cameraman came in
saying I don't you know don't show them
my dusty basement so George senior is
known to be a little bit robotic or
stiff because he's very professional a
lot of people don't realize it's just
the way French Canadians are it almost
seems like a fake accent that's how half
of my family sounds and the moment that
stood out to me was when my mom asked
George st. Pierre if the basement was
still dusty and if you can speak fritz
it's hard to fully translate you can
read the subtitles but he relaxes and he
actually goes into talking and it's
almost justifying like none other thing
is my mom was just upset about this and
this is and it became a really personal
conversation between my mom and UFC
legend to possibly you know the best
combat athlete ever George st. Pierre
episode 134 can I ask you mama she has a
question for you in French can you take
one question for she's a superfan okay
man get up
okay so Jody Patel confess software
maja a babysitter cause the the social
calculator capability on jealousy Patna
poor basket see your finished system on
our set or jump estimate the pin-sharp
we don't a stella maeve apology no I
can't easily knows you're a punching bag
at the future
Phoebe's web political panel so nice to
discharge it's gonna be about the
basement because your mom for people who
don't know this is such a
french-canadian thing Josh knows it's
like French Canadians they keep their
houses so clean Jared you know that with
my mom she's like she can't handle it
and Georgeson peers his mom was so mad
and a special that they showed a
basement which was dusty so my mom asked
her was still dusty and George said yes
because they're keeping his a play area
for the kids right yeah they you keep it
for the kid because there's like like a
playground for the kid but if we finish
it I will make like rooms and the walls
and everything is in right now it's it's
gonna be users because we want it to be
for for the kids for the kids but but if
if maybe maybe in a few years when they
grow up we're gonna head because there's
one have to clean it up again because
French Canadians clean up everything as
you're finished eating they came up the
place they say what that's my mom we
were sitting there watching the special
and my mom's like aha she's like poor a
woman I'm like mom are you not watching
the greatest fighter of all time the
countdown is about him fighting her and
she wouldn't stop about the dust in the
basement she's like I want to watch him
is his mother's care about the dust in
the basement I'm going to watch to
support him so by the way the basement
is till dusty number seven Thomas Thomas
soul this was at 3:10 and you know a
couple of reasons why first off this was
the first of the sort of new the newer
media new school podcast to have Thomas
olan he didn't do it
he's a notoriously difficult to book and
then after he did this he started doing
some some more shows I believe and and
really enjoyed his experience he was
just really really easy to work with and
when it comes to economists you'd be
hard-pressed to find someone more
prolific than Thomas ol in our
generation I grew up on him he's a huge
part of my my worldview and how I've
learned economics and he's a huge he's
one of number one recommendations I've
talked about the John Stossel Thomas
soul of course going back to Adam Smith
okay go like that it's a little a little
bit tough it's kind of like going back
and read some old timey Thomas ol brings
it to now and it's it's tough to to pick
a moment but you know what was really
great about Thomas soul was I didn't
expect this you could see him loosen up
and he was actually he was a lot of fun
he was a lot of fun he was very down to
earth and I think we got to see a side
of Thomas well you don't often see so
this is episode 310 Thomas ol how does
it feel to be arguably the most
influential certainly probably the most
influential conservative economist of
our time I know I know you have to be
humble but has it set in I mean because
you're that guy well I I never
contradict the opinions of people who
say say good things about me it would be
impossible to be objective about what
it's why I never tried the impossible
could you maybe expand on most of the
myths that if not for discrimination
society would have equal representation
in careers income education and
incarceration because that's the huge
sort of I guess main tenant of leftism
that's taught on campus if not for
discrimination we'd all have these equal
representation outcomes you put your
finger on the key assumption on which
the holes it's like the Keystone that
holds up the whole structure and you
remove that and they don't have her and
what age is what is one of those things
but what people desire to do matters
right ah you know for all I know I might
have been born you know with genes that
would have enabled me to become another
new Rudolf Nureyev is a male ballet
dancer okay if I was it was a total
waste of genes because where I grew up
nobody it was thought of as well no no
guys ever thought about becoming male
ballet dancers so it doesn't matter what
their abilities were it doesn't matter
whether they were was the opposition or
the gates of opportunity were wide open
they weren't gonna become male ballet
dancer but what people want to do is
huge alright number six this one is what
a lot of you may not even there's no
number to the episode because this is
before remember we actually had episodes
listen it's not before we went daily
it's before this show was a show at all
even as a podcast this is back when we
were on radio and we used to tape our
calls if we could Skype people but we
didn't really know what to do with it so
we finally learned how to record the
Skype video to decent quality and we
started uploading these so this is
actually Carly Fiorina from August's
yeah August 7th 2015 you can search and
on YouTube that's the only place to find
it just Carly Fiorina steven crowder
searched the channel and go through all
of the suggested young turks video
because it'll take you a while 10 do you
realize that half of these interviews
when I was searching through YouTube as
to it my interview with this person is
not even the first thing that pops up no
it's a bunch of random crap with no
views stick everything over like Trent
they're just piling on this it's it's
like a sandwich only there's only word
just the bottom bread every
there's top bread there's a whole layer
of ham and vegetables and then we're
just we're like the saucer plate that's
to snout for the sandwiches we're the
meat no we're not we're the delicious I
mean we want to be the me but not to you
- no not you - don't say delicious meat
on this program Carly so Carly Fiorina
here's why this stands out to me so much
we've been writing about her so a lot of
credit calm a lot of people know who
just watched the show don't realize it's
the website was a lot bigger than the
show for a long time edited by Courtney
Kerr chopped and she still edits over
there wonderful fantastic writer we've
been writing about Carly Fiorina for a
long time I had seen her speak at a
private event and thought wow this
woman's really impressive and then I
watched back then during these primaries
they had the second stage debates people
who didn't necessarily make it to the
the first stage and we were writing
about Carly Fiorina I called her I think
we coined the term the conservative
honey badger and then at one point we
started calling her the conservative
spider monkey on crack because of the
way she went after Katie Couric and so
when we reached out to her people I
thought oh no she I found out she had
heard spider monkey on crack and she
loved it turns out she liked it and she
came on the show so see what she wasn't
doing any any you know any podcasts
Arkansas radio anything like that and
here's why this is so pivotal to me
because what you don't know this when
you watch this interview she gave us
this interview she was at the event
greenroom I believe or another
conference room right before 45 minutes
before she walked on stage that night
and then pulled ahead to number one in
the polls if you remember there was a
moment where Carly Fiorina just pulled
ahead and I will say was kind of it was
mismanaged a little bit by some of the
handlers but no one knew who she was she
came out on stage that night and the
whole world was talking about Carly
Fiorina 45 minutes before that this is
what you see on skype also we got Carly
Fiorina to say that other Republicans
that the males in particular needed to
grow a pair watch clarify your stance so
that no one else is misquoting on
immigration
what would a Carly Fiorina
administration do oh yes number one we
have to secure the border by the way how
long we've been talking about securing
more
years I mean to be accurate the border
has not been secure for 30 years we've
been talking about it for at least 25
it's still not secure so what does that
tell you it tells you politicians talk
talk talk talk talk and yet it never
gets done thanks to area cities you know
how long San Francisco's been a
sanctuary city since 1989 everyone's
gonna get all fired up about this
they're gonna give speeches they're
gonna pass laws and yet nothing really
changes this is why people are fed up
with the political class so number one
secure the border this isn't rocket
science it takes money it takes manpower
it takes technology but mostly what it
takes is to grow a pair and lead and I
think that Carly Fiorina if I may so I
want to say so respectfully is fine also
uh number five Daniel Cormier a lot of
ladies like like him so he's uh he's the
current UFC light heavyweight champion
another big dude
yes actually is not that big not that
big for a heavyweight the guys make me
fight as a mini he's scary no he's about
510 five nine Oh fighting heavyweights
and he fought at five at 205 and and won
the title there and then moved up so
right now he's the current lineal light
heavyweight champion and UFC heavyweight
champion and he's a former Olympian he's
one of the main commentators on ESPN it
was Fox Sports 1 I think now over there
at ESPN episode 363 I didn't think he
was going to come on the show and we've
been very fortunate to have a lot of
people who are not necessarily
conservatives not necessarily
politically minded come on the show and
in every now and then it's a crapshoot
what I really liked about Daniel Cormier
not only was he funny obviously I mean
people know he's very charismatic but he
was very vulnerable so there's a moment
there if you watch where he talks about
how scared he was before he absolutely
blitzed stipa Miocic
to win the title and he talks about this
moment of the excuses he was making for
himself
beforehand and I think it's something
you don't often see because when you're
doing the UFC countdowns right you're
trying to intimidate the opponent and
often when you're going on podcasts
I remember one of the lines that isn't
it ironic that the people who've been
most managed and protected by
governments are the poorest people in
America all right very glad to have our
next guest you know why you know why
quarterblack why why I grew up with I've
talked about Thomas Olsen people who
were huge influencers when people ask me
when I do these shows and it's
completely unwarranted Fame people ask
me for advice which I'm woefully
completely ill-equipped to deliver and I
tell particularly young people who are
either in the entertainment industry or
want to go into media the book I tell
them to read is this next man's
biography fine enough not necessarily
one of his in his books that he's
written more is it more informational
more nonfiction his actual autobiography
which is called
give me a break I think you know who it
is John Stossel calm at John Stossel mr.
Stowell thank you for being here sir
thank you remember me so yeah I don't
know if you know this but they're two
people had credited my life to making me
a conservative I know you're more
libertarian my father and yourself
because of your segments on 20/20 after
TGIF you drafted in behind Sabrina the
Teenage Witch and I was just enthralled
your father forced you to watch 22 I
know he didn't he didn't you know what
it was I remember I was a kid and I
remember just thinking your
anti-authoritarian and when you jumped
into I don't know if it was the East
River was one of your segments I was a
kid glove it was a Hudson River okay all
right just a little cleaner than the
East River and the currents are not so
strong so I don't want to claim my junk
okay but ever there's a kid thinking
this guy's effectively a professional
smartass that's what I thought as a kid
I and edit really I started looking in
to John Styles more and I used to look
forward to it and if I had to go to bed
I would tape 20 20 and they give me a
break segments a lot of people don't
know before kind of when you started
actually going in a libertarian path
where a lot of people know you now with
this audience you were a consumer
reporter where you report on kind of
scams and and charlatans explain people
who don't know the history and how that
kind of brought you to where you are now
I'm a stutterer when I first fell into
this TV job I didn't want to be on the
beat with
the other reporters screaming questions
of politicians and at the time people
thought of the news as crime politics
weather disasters right a lot of people
still think that way but that left a
huge area for me
the stutterer to work more slowly add
and snip out the stutters which was
Consumer Affairs in psychology and
sociology and science and medicine so
much good stuff and as a consumer
reporter I figured part of my job was to
police businesses the cheating people
right and I viewed capitalism as most
young lefties do and I graduated college
my professors had taught me that
capitalism was okay it brings us some
stuff but it's largely cruel unfair and
we need government controls to protect
us from the capitalists and I totally
believe that bash businesses won 19
Emmys from my peers for doing that right
gradually saw that the regulation that
we consumer reporters called for didn't
help it just made life more complex made
everything cost a little more and the
cheaters kept getting away with it
they're still getting away with it the
people selling the penis enlargers and
the burn fat lay asleep pill careful now
careful now we have we have a lot of
sponsors on the show you don't know who
they are we might have some self
lubricating pocket catheter commercials
coming up - so let's just tread no red
light see some of your sponsors maybe
cheaters and the clumsy government will
never do anything he's full about right
and I turn to the trial lawyers and they
were worse they ripped off the companies
they sued and many of their clients went
home with most of the money and I
gradually woke up and became a
libertarian I saw the philosophy that
had made sense to me as a kid didn't
make sense I started reading the
conservative media but you conservatives
seem to want to go to war with everybody
and to pull and walk the police the
bedroom I didn't lay
that either don't launch me into that I
just started I was just selling self
lubricating pocket catheters I want I
want to enhance the bedroom activities
and I don't want to go to war with
everybody personally well there this is
how it how I perceived it 25 years ago
when I was making the switch sure and I
discovered Reason magazine and the
libertarian philosophy made total sense
to me yeah I know and I know you do a
lot of great work with reason and um I
sort of came into it a little bit later
right 20 20 TGIF at that point you were
kind of on the libertarian path I didn't
know what a conservative was the ever
nurse has a kid I just knew that I liked
watching you and calling people on their
BS and I inherently was conservative you
know I start out as an actor really
young and so my dad taught me about
taxes you know when you're 13 and my dad
goes okay this is your check from
Arthur's or this is how much is going to
go to socialized healthcare you learn
about it pretty quickly and I just loved
watching your segments and then I found
your biography and then that was really
the first time that I read about
somebody who was shunned by his peers
exclusively for his point of view you
talk about that walking through the ABC
offices and how you were treated
differently once you started sort of
going after big government or the
concept thereof kinks can you explain
that a little bit to people who aren't
as familiar with it cuz that must have
been really tough like you said
emmy-winning these people loved you and
respected you and then all of a sudden
some of them just no more noble rama's
and I have one sigh that's true once I
said government is often the problem my
peers just weren't comfortable with that
and Peter Jennings when he would see me
in the hall would do one of these really
as if I was poison to the ABC neutrality
because I had a point of view yeah I are
conservative they I yeah as we well have
seen since then there's no other point
of view at ABC everyone is completely
neutral
yeah they view themselves as completely
neutral of course there should be more
gun regulation of course abortion should
be legal it's just the water we live in
in New York City and they don't view
themselves as having a point of view I
think now
that there are MSNBC Fox CNN and people
are more aware oh I guess I'm on this
side or that side right then ABC they
were all on the left but they thought
they were in the middle well that's kind
of what this Trump administration CNN is
a good example you know ABC was like
where CNN is now CNN a lot of people
thought Fox is right MSNBC is left CNN's
down the middle you and I as people who
work in the industry know that that
couldn't be further from the truth and
now they're being showcased for what
they are that goes back to ABC did you
know did you anticipate that would
happen when you sort of made that
transition or did it did you sort of
learn as you go like you did with
government corruption I did not
anticipate that I thought that they
would say oh yes you've explained it to
me I agree I sold you because I wasn't
the conservative to be a conservative at
ABC was like being a child molester that
was just yeah no no no you'll be better
off being a child molester at least you
get a you get a made-for-tv film about
you
but yeah this is gonna be edited
completely out of context I'm sorry
you've had a long and storied career mr.
Stossel let me let me ask you this do
you remember so I was really nervous the
first time we ever met and I don't know
you probably don't remember our first
meeting in person I would have said you
came up to me in a green room I believe
yes okay I did but before that I think
it was Geraldo Rivera's show maybe and I
was on the panel of some talking head it
might have been it could have been like
Bob Menendez it could have been Lonny
Davis could have been Doug shown you
know one of those people at Fox it's
like the liberal who was on there for
some whatever reason you were talking
about the housing crisis and they were
saying it's unfair for Americans to lose
their house and I said on-air I was 22
at the time I said you know what's
unfair is actually my parents spent
wisely and they saved wisely and now
they have the money to put down in a
house but they can't get it because the
banks aren't giving out loans because of
the subprime crisis that was created
through government incentives in the
first place I think that's not fair I
think it's not fair to keep those people
in the house and keepa let my parents
out and you walked before we met in the
green room you walk and you told that
person I can't refer the person was
because I was so focused on you you said
the kids right that's what you told the
guy and that was a huge
accomplishment for me that I met you in
the green room and you told me I talk
too much in that order I I have no
social skills I burned out what is in my
mind but you know what it was very
helpful you said you talked too much and
I would say and then you said yeah I
like somebody you said you Steven you've
done I've seen some of your stuff it's
interesting but you're on camera talking
too much show the viewer more show them
what you're talking about as opposed to
talking a lot of that was budgetary at
the time you know was me with just a
fact than a flip camera but it was very
blunt but very constructive and that's
been actually foundational to the way we
do this program now so I thank you for
that sting oh you're welcome do I get a
cut there's really not that much of a
cut you know that's the problem with
this the fragmenting media we do okay
but let me ask you do you have anything
that really sticks out in your mind like
we asked Thomas Sol about this which of
his books were his favorite do you have
any report that you've done at one point
that reel or two or three that stick out
as your favorites because I have one in
mind what I want to hear yours first
stupid in America piece on the education
monopoly my first 2020 special where
title are we scaring you to death I
wanted to call it we are scaring you to
death but they wouldn't let two lefty
producers quit rather than work on that
show and I thought I was fired so that
may be my favorite because I thought it
would be the end of my career but it
rated so well that it was a new
beginning for me did that surprise
people at ABC that you rated so well yes
do you think they look we don't agree
with you but we don't want to lose you
to NBC not this special okay you can
only do it if we make an extra hour
available the Nightline timeslot to have
other people there to rebut what you're
saying and they assume that people
wouldn't watch it the executive vice
president said what are you doing the
stuff you're good at like diets and
breast enlargement
and I said and then they were shocked
that it rated well and that scientists
would write in and say finally someone's
saying these things right I mean I
always wonder what they thought at that
point because at that moment in time
there was no new media like there is now
really there there was there wasn't
really cable cable news didn't exist in
the capacity that it has now for for
decades I only knew and we didn't have
AM radio by the way in Canada I would
get to pirate it from Plattsburgh New
York if I if if I was lucky
yours was kind of that sliver of truth
which was really foundational for me
growing up my favorite one I don't know
if you remember this was you did a
report on Native American reservations
on 20/20 I remember that one
I remember one of the lines that isn't
it ironic that the people who've been
most managed and protected by
governments are the poorest people in
America yes well that's very profound
but I remember your smartass remark more
when I was a kid because keep in mind
that's sitting down with this guy please
tell me you remember otherwise I want to
seem like the jackass you said you know
you he live here with sorry I whenever I
do talk of about someone I do an
impression of them it's automatic and
you said you live here with running
water and electricity and the guy said
the white man has made me live this way
and do you remember your response this
is this okay I'll give it because to me
ever the kid I about peed myself
laughing in my living room in a
three-bedroom Montreal I said white man
makes me live this way and you said but
you're wearing jeans I don't know why as
a kid I just thought that boiled the BS
down perfectly you know was this First
Nations person saying they forced me and
he was wearing Levi's and I was the it
was the highlight of my Friday was
watching your segments well I'm glad I I
thought all of America would feel that
way but they didn't we quoted that line
for a long every time we'd go past this
Native American sort of will like you
talked about it like you've talked about
and why he will don't know this they
really have been crippled by the
government it is a very I've tried to
find it on YouTube and show it to people
it's been pretty hard to find some
segments are easier to find some are
more difficult but
really did highlight the fact that like
you said people who have been given the
most help from the government have been
ironically crippled by them and I think
that was lost on a lot of people maybe
you were just ahead of your time and
then you moved over to obviously Fox
News and and you kind of once you were
amongst allies did that how did that
change your life in your career did you
feel like that you could relax a little
bit do you feel did you feel like you
missed the hunger the fight of the
conflict a little bit what was it what
was the transition like well no the
conflict sucked I said dude the wanted
to do a piece on Obamacare and I had all
this good material I know nobody's
interested in free market medicine and
school choice the movement was just
beginning they didn't want to hear these
things Fox they love this stuff so that
was great
it wasn't relaxing because now I had to
do a half hour I mean now our show every
week and but it's a different kind of
pressure
you're used to it you're doing a long
podcast but yeah I'm not winning any
Emmys certainly not I was used I was
used to short edited pieces yes and now
well you do you do them all very well
and now you do a lot of them we have
b-roll right now rolling I don't think
you can just see me of your video on
Bernie Sanders in the online Empire and
I know you work with reason but you also
have your own YouTube channel so is this
what's the relationship there exactly
there code does it all go on your
YouTube channel or some goes on reason
80% of the views are on my YouTube or
Facebook channels 20% on reason and
donors give to the charity reason which
then gives me most of that money to make
these videos and and they're very
informative and I appreciate that
someone who's had this you know 19 Emmys
you said you've been doing this for so
long is now moving into new mediums and
listen we need more people out there on
YouTube a lot of conservatives have sort
of relegated this territory to the left
a lot of social media let alone the
entertainment industry and you're one of
the few people this video I particularly
like where you talk about the Bernie
Sanders online media
we went after Bernie really hard during
the election let me explain why I
remember when I was at Fox for a long
time I was telling them they needed to
focus in the sky more because Hillary
Clinton was gonna be the coronation but
Bernie Sanders was the movement
candidate and for people in my
generation was more important to focus
you know take the head off the dragon
not many other people have done that so
what made you want to focus on Bernie
Sanders and what do you mean by the
Bernie Sanders online media empire
simply because I read an article saying
Bernie Sanders is quietly building a
Internet media empire can I listen oh my
goodness he was and wait a second that's
what I'm doing I'm trying to explain
people that limited government is a good
thing and this idiot is spreading deceit
and he's winning yeah so I want to do
one of my videos on that I'm doing these
videos because my 28 year old son
convinced me dad no one's gonna believe
what you say about free markets at least
no one in my world as long as you're on
Fox and you don't need Fox anymore
because people are cut in the courts and
you've got a million Twitter followers
this Facebook there's YouTube you don't
need a network yeah you don't and a lot
of people obviously it helps to be
backdoored in with a name like yours you
know the name recognition because people
can then search you and find you and so
it leads credibility to these mediums
whereas you know a good example I've
talked about this we had Ralph Macchio
on the show which at one point you'd
think oh Ralph Macchio that's back in
the 80s no no the number one show in the
world
it was Cobra Kai on YouTube red was
getting 36 million plays he wasn't
appearing on Fox he wasn't appearing on
CNN he was appearing on this show worse
for a long time we couldn't get people
who were appearing on prime-time
television and that's how it happens in
a moment
sometimes that flip and we have a lot of
young people who do watch what we do and
I know that there'll be big fans of
yours just make sure you keep keep that
keep the smartass NISS thats what made
me love you as a nine-year-old I didn't
have gone the route of comedy but you
were you were a big force in fearing me
there I'm easily bored and so I thought
to succeed in TV I have to do smartass
that makes people laugh absolutely did
I'm asking this are you are you friendly
with Barbara Walters or can I ask some
inside baseball questions how did how
did how did she react to you because you
know you would have to sit at that desk
and kind of introduce and toss to your
segments was it it was her and Phil
Donahue I believe and then he was
changed out if I'm not mistaken he hewed
down sorry Hugh Downs I got the name
well you know generic white guy name old
guy what how did they react to you
because you were on air with them and
they would have to grit their teeth and
bear it and know the package you were
tossing to they were friendly and viewed
me as I mean Hugh was kind of is kind of
libertarian and was sympathetic and
would sometimes say well John I didn't
know that and Barbra viewed me as kind
of a an insect that she would tolerate
would calling her I mean she's a
remarkable person
she's just could have coasted at this
point of her career yeah but she worried
and obsessed about every second video if
she had a piece on I knew my piece had
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
tell the captain's chair because I've
been watching River Monsters lately and
I've gone to the last season he's no
longer in rivers exist in the ocean it's
like you're just hot you're just fishing
for sharks
yeah in the Atlantic Ocean - bull shut
it's that way tune in I wanted to see
River Monsters and fresh water really
excited huge show we have razörfist on
the program yeah yeah dennis prager on
the program oh wow
we will be talking about the media's
double standard with John McCain will of
course be talking about the Facebook
walkout
I got winded from doing the cam here
that's that's a workout apparently I
should say that like in Jaws a captain
is where you're you're bolted into hunt
sharks
well you don't bolt that ins dangerous
though right no you're sick no otherwise
you go overboard what if Tony takes the
boat over
you're like bolted and you're going down
with it and watching tonight that's Jaws
you just said jaws no but it wasn't the
chairs problem all right we're producing
in the show is a quarter black carrot
you can follow on Twitter your quarter
black right yes I am which quarter
uh-huh on your dad say what's that the
hood pass equivalent to us being
murdered in the streets gee Morgan Jr
somehow a apparent let's real thing one
of the day I got acid eree pinot noir my
friend i wonder you see this is almost
like a naked lady on no it's not almost
like and in the third share with us
today is actually isis communications
director and senior public affairs
official Mahmood alma mood how are you
sir Noel Steven good to see you again
I am glad to see you as well you're
sounding a little bit loud to me than
your microphone but that's okay because
our sound guy's gonna gonna get it there
you were breathing into it was a little
loud for you earlier but you know I'm
used to that desert wind
yeah we're here with us today oh you
know I just want to put on a good face
for Isis you know we want you to see the
softer side that's when you're gonna
look at me you don't to look at the
camera you're like no prob where you get
your she can't not look at herself I
know you're I went to media school you
know so I see the professionals I've
seen quite a bit of work and question of
the day put bluntly how do you remember
John McCain all right not what do you
feel you have to remember not what do
you think everyone wants you to say you
remember how do you view him in his
legacy comment below we'll get into the
media's flip-flop comparing McCain to
Nazis before - hailing him as the second
coming of Christ in a minute but our top
story these recently took over a hotdog
stand on Times Square New York
this comes to us from an actual
publication the bees engulfed a food
carton were carefully removed from the
umbrella well some stray bees made their
way to the facade of a nearby cafe
unfortunately the swarm actually proved
to be fatal as some just looking to
enjoy New York hotdog were taken from us
far too soon necessarily dark my mom let
me watch that when I was 7 let you watch
anything from the West you know what I'm
really surprised is that the bee
survived the hot dog water from those
things I mean come on are people like al
Mamoon a facebook employee is now
starting a movement against the
company's intolerant liberal culture as
he puts it and a lot of people have
joined the engineer Brian I'm Mary I
think it's a marriage a I don't know is
one of things I've only read about yeah
it happens again in media only online on
sites that we read alleges that
colleagues attack often in mobs anyone
who's not left-leaning
he says they tear down Trump posters and
demand that HR investigate anyone who
criticizes Islam's human rights records
amen brother
come on so this is our liberal tech
bloggers are concerned this is going to
allow conservatives to claim big tech is
bias against them well conservatives are
concerned about big tech being biased
against them by the way jeez was the
original whistleblower try to ask you
you can't because he was murdered yeah
it's tragic for voting for John McCain
Oh whom we all love dear of course now
by the way you know the original
investigator yeah for the whole thing
was a Tom from MySpace oh yeah but we
had him burned in a cage yeah seems to
be the method that you guys use what's
it's getting cliche
and I didn't look don't worry we're
gonna we're gonna give you the update
story when they summarily fire him for
sexual harassment later on yes so don't
worry about that yeah it's gonna be a
random case from five years ago was just
copy pasted from Fox News yes
the point is someone's getting Wiener
pics from a co-host you guys pioneered
the the burning in a cage really why the
cage it seems incidental like that the
burning should be bad necessary right no
it's kind of theatrical you know there's
something about a cage that evokes
something I don't know if it's primal it
works it just works right I don't know
what about the acid attacks why that
because you know there's one thing I've
never understood you know you shoot
someone you stab someone understand it's
war you're trying you're trying to take
somebody out the acid attack I mean it
you know you're not gonna kill them it's
just unpleasant you know it's in the
kitchen of your mom
you have you have acids in the kitchen
of your mom and you know you make do you
know this is a right so it's like the
Bart Simpson's little bastards yeah yes
the foundation of many art forms really
yeah I don't think so at all I think
you're entirely mistaken but you know
listen cultural differences turning to
Canada speaking of cultural differences
Toronto is going to be opening its first
sex doll brothel oh yeah yeah Anna
nondescript shopping plaza so it's the
company's marketing director gonna break
out this quote that said that there will
be no human staff in the brothel brothel
section and goes on to say that for men
who have these dark violent fantasies
they can do something like this which is
safe for everyone they said and trust us
you don't want to bark up that tree said
Tonka the fing toy maker of the early
ill-fated 90s buddies
buddy hey fellas what's going on nothing
buddy's new from Tonga he sold
separately I don't know why I heard
about those sex dolls though a buddy of
mine but he bought 72 of them City put
off eBay afterwards slightly used that
was them yeah I don't know the terms of
service I think there was a little flag
about this yeah I can you're the worst
job in the world the IT guy we know
there's the Pratt the level of depravity
with center dolls right we know that
we've reached that level de prepped but
now we've also we've created this
ungodly amalgamation this this
combination this symbiotic relationship
of the sexual depravity and laziness
they're not even earning the sex dolls
now it's Elise I wouldn't want to be the
guy that has to go in there with the
squeegee and the wet wipes on each one
of those we've seem to have created a
real live West world thank God we needed
one of those right I just worked out so
well on the show I don't think Evan
Rachel Wood well I think there's much
sadder than well this is definitely the
questworld season to where it sucks at
the end there's no getting to the center
of the game this would make a good dirty
jobs that would be awesome you guys get
there where you are in your own yeah and
your layer it pirates you got dirty jobs
in your lair big fans of the micro oh
yeah we have the satellite oh yeah oh
yeah he's drinking from the infidels mug
over there he must be a fan now we it
with fire the contractual obligation
even know it's in here
sleep tight finally there's new data by
the way on a New York City Subway
masturbator
so the NYPD field at a total 376 reports
of public lewdness
or exposure of a person last year and
they log 24 complaints at stations
served solely by the F train of course
more than any other shows which actually
finally gave authorities evidence needed
to arrest Thomas a serial public
masturbator Tank Engine so they were
real
I knew that Grimm it was like like Al
Capone they caught him on something else
note they caught him on he went off the
rails that's what happened it's not only
hearing coming down and coming down the
coming down I think I can rape and
should by the way you should have seen
the D train oh my god Oh nobody wants to
see never caught in a train no but no
speaking of loneliness by the way
because that Trina's do you remember
shining time station am I the only one
out there please comment time station
did you ever watch reading time station
there must have been a Canadian shop so
this is Thomas Thomas the Tank is a
train and is it Thomas the Tank it's
Thomas our train it's offered Thomas the
Tank Engine how mr. Tank Engine almost
you think it's disturbing that you know
that I know I do must study ones
opponent namely six-year-old boys yes
yeah so a shining time station tell me I
don't know if this was a Canadian thing
it was a it was like a mr. kind of like
a Mister Rogers neighborhood only was at
a train station and pink pinky whatever
her name was from Greece she was a lady
who ran the train station and there was
actually a little conductor a little
mini conductor on the table people gonna
think I'm on acid I'm not a story this
is an actual show that you are on and
that mini conductor was George Carlin
and they would say uh-oh
have you ever heard the story of my
friend Thomas the Tank all aboard it'll
go to smoke and it would go to a story
of Thomas the Tank Engine and that's
where it started so I know where I see
the Thomas Tank Engine stuff every what
I'm wondering if people know we don't
call it that because he'll train it's
not a tank
shining time station was the show and
they replaced George Carlin like in a
third season with Ringo Starr I know
he'll think I'm on drugs
probably because George Carlin woke up
one morning said I'm George Carlin this
may have been a dream you had this is
Canadians out there shining time station

be doing whole shows just reading your
reading your letters and awesome solving
your problem okay so back to the story
obviously this this is this is dominated
the news this week here's here's what
really bothers me about the McCain issue
there's a pattern as it relates to both
McCain and President Trump the media of
course the excoriate any conservative
any Republican on a national platform no
matter who they are and what they always
do is they use that to enact as though
they only have a problem with recent
extremists right yeah they do that all -
all the time and a lot of people just
forget about and going oh yeah I guess I
guess so no I guess they were pretty
fair with George Bush I guess they're
pretty fair with McCain I guess I'm
pretty fair with Romney it's just it's
just Donald Trump that they don't like
yeah exactly
do they have to like make up for it in
the end they're like I we were really
jerks for this guy oh he's dead let's
let's like do an hour's worth of good
coverage that that evens it out when
everyone is Hitler no one is so exactly
well let's look at John McCain the media
has been pumping out hero stories of
McCain obviously since his death and
most of them obviously well warranted
the guy was a war hero but the media
completely despised him for the longest
time just because he was a candidate
against Barack Obama if you didn't get
any proof you
any examples haven't seen anyone put
this side-by-side so I want you to see
the exact same people what they said pre
and then post McCain death because all I
want is consistency here and I'll get to
my opinion on them a little bit in a
little minute it's going to sound harsh
but I'm not going to lie to you so let's
go to exhibit a light night hosts left
wing pundits let's look how they this is
how they felt about McCain while he was
alive and look like to say one thing to
Senator John McCain listen listen
senator you don't show up for me America
doesn't show up for you but we like
Obama because who he can lift a
basketball and and Obama can bite into
an apple and he's on the Internet and
he's on my face this just doesn't smell
right because this is not the way a
tested hero behaves you sir are
responsible for a phalanx of individuals
who are shouting fire in a crowded
theater what is what is left always go
to fire in a crowded course with the
free speech and it was ascending with
McCain everything bad isn't going on it
I can't have going through my mental
rolodex sir I've already used Nazi and
fascist and fire in a crowded do it
again I have no idea but what's what are
your folks how they feel about the
McCain oh you know they have a lot of
respect for John McCain you know he he
he stood up the torture you know
Vietnamese torture he could handle that
I mean to be honest I can't even put up
with a Vietnamese hospitality I can the
torture was positively it was child's
play compared what you guys do nothing
but then here's a thing they did but
then as soon as McCain just became a
little bit of a Bob a little bit of a
thorn in Trump's side my favorite person
in politics in American politics in the
21st century is your father by the look
at the eye line there my favorite person
is your father not awkward at all I
think he made John McCain worst worst
person in the world several times yeah
it's it's how disingenuous are at Bob's
we love McCain hate McCain I couldn't
care less just be honest about it and
Keith Oberman obviously well hopefully
he pays you guys a visit sooner you pay
him
that would be great I like the anger I
like angry Keith yes it's much better
than I've got a thrill running up my leg
Keith look I don't understand you know
when somebody dies like you're not
supposed to speak ill of the Dead I
don't know that I think that originated
like 600 BC somewhere and they I don't
know why it's not like you've
accomplished a feat this is exactly what
Freud said we give you special
consideration is that you've done
something really difficult death has a
perfect record except for it you know
that one guy yeah so why in the world do
we not just tell people the truth and
even with that one guy death had a
no-contest
well that's necessarily what to do with
McCain is exactly what they're doing to
Trump people because he's dead now
people acting's others there you cannot
delineate at all they use every single
left to strategy in the book well not
see mentally unfit racist white
supremacist Satan homophobe all of that
sound all of that sound familiar does
any of that sound like the kind of
nomenclature hearing today you hear this
obviously I were you are you hear these
words thrown at Donald Trump you know I
I do seem pretty calm and I think it's
because they're effective we do some of
the things also rocks yes you do throw
those around a lot you know it's more
effective than rocks
the IDF yeah
[Laughter]
no nonsense I appreciate that I hate
that he has the address to our studio at
least McCain wasn't at least McCain
wealth and I Nazi right like Trump yeah
because that's only a recent spear
except remember this yeah there's
something on here that's a comedy show
but it was commonly people were getting
their cars their windows broken for
McCain bumper stickers and you know my
brother had someone tear off his sign
well because if you were for McCain you
were a racist in a Nazi against Barack
President Obama actually withheld more
information spent spent 36 odd something
million dollars under the Freedom of
Information Act to withhold information
from journalists this is not does not
matter we are not going to Obama to
compare Obama's ashes I don't know okay
time for the latest installment of
change my mind unedited conversations
with real people about controversial
topics as per usual comment the topics
you'd most like to see for future
installments below this week we made a
special trip to Washington DC and parked
outside of the White House itself to
deal with one of the most pervasive
myths in the left social nomenclature
today I'm not saying that Donald Trump
is a fascist humanity is facing an
emergency a fascist regime has seized
the reins of power and the most powerful
actually the sole superpower in the
world there's no word for this Ashley
it's fascism I mean I think that Donald
Trump himself is the dangerous
neo-fascist in the mail a flirtation
with fascism in this country now this
government's a hand-in-hand with another
passage troma
i disagree do you feel free to comment
and substantiate your argument below but
we decided to put all this to the test
unfortunately turns out most people
visiting the White House actually really
like President Donald Trump
so much so in fact it was hard to get a
whole lot of people willing to sit and
have a civil disagreement at all though
we did get quite a few as per the usual
drive-by yelling
[Music]
I you the liar
but we finally sat down with a couple of
people to have hopefully a productive
discussion about Donald Trump fascism
and accusations therein as always before
you engage in civil disagreement it's
important to define your words I'm glad
you've asked let's agree to start with a
definite you want to read that from in
us from merriam-webster political
philosophy movement or regime that
exalts nation Wow and often raised above
the individual and stance or
decentralized reading that I would say
no because I don't think he exalts the
nation at all okay well hon it continued
its centralized centralized autocratic
government headed by a dictatorial
leader well I do think she's dictatorial
okay severe economic and social
regimentation no forcible suppression of
option opposition yes okay so there you
go you just made a few assertions there
based on the definition of fascism but
we agree in the definition of fascism
I'm defining it as merriam-webster okay
all right yeah you know so I'm trying to
be as unbiased of the Kenya so where
would you say he's a fascist Donald
Trump I would say that opposition that
the suppression of opposition right the
suppression of opposition okay well
let's see we just had the man's security
clearance removed simply because he has
vocally disagreed with president
ex-general or he was a military man okay
no no actually I think he'd been the CIA
director under Obama okay and he's
threatening to remove other people's
security clearances as well he also says
the press is the enemy of the people
okay okay and then okay so can we can we
great take a couple those now because
just you two okay so a couple of things
for example um probably the most severe
example is he fired Comey right that was
a big one fire James Comey so we're
talking about the investigation I know
we often go to the Russia probe or who
he's granted security clearances to or
removed
let me ask you this is it within his
constitutional authority to do that yes
okay so that wouldn't be an example of
fascism no your problem isn't with
Donald Trump your problems with the
United States law ah then you talk about
he's
he said I want to make sure I have your
quote correct that the press is the
enemy of the people what you said I
think it said oppresses in that
definition yes but you but that was a
quote that you use right he's that
Donald Trump I said the press is the
enemy of yes he says the press is the
enemy of the people
okay you know what that quote actually
comes from no I don't just darlin yeah
Donald Trump didn't say that he talked
about fake news no he's talking about
fake news as a quote that he's used
which was a leftist term I'm sure you
know was invented by liberals which he
then co-opted an enemy are you saying
himself yeah that right now currently
whoever said at first yeah is he not
currently saying that the press is the
enemy of it that exact quote is a quote
attributed to Stalin misinformed yes yes
you are man let's move on I'm
misinformed yes that's seen his tweets
that say the press is the enemy of the
people
no his television is yeah but let's move
on again to theirs rhetoric I think it's
important and there's policy so you've
talked about the press for example and I
think that's important I think freedom
of the press is very important for
example we both agree if someone sought
to nationalize the press that would be a
problem
that'd be a step toward fascism right we
both agree on that yes okay good good so
we have some common ground there what is
Donald Trump done as far as actionable
steps taken towards suppression of the
Free Press well hasn't he tried to not
allow people into the White House into
the press room he's he's trying to
dictate who's allowed to come in and not
come in that's a small amount of
suppression it's not a legal huge shirt
you know yeah he hasn't passed law he
hasn't pulled out the police he sure but
just in saying that and
in so back to the red ride the rhetoric
so not so much policy it sounds to me
you have a problem with the rhetoric
that's correct
because its policies would actually fly
in the face of that because you you were
the one who sat down you believe as a
fascist so if we talk about policy I
mean President Obama actually withheld
more information spent spent thirty six
odd something million dollars under the
Freedom of Information Act to withhold
information from journalists Donald
Trump is not matter we are not going to
Obama to compare Obama it's ashes I
don't know okay but you said with such
authority that Donald Trump is a fascist
if I may just continue along with my
point here Barack Obama used the
Espionage Act not only to spy on but
prosecute more leakers whistleblowers
and journalists than any president in
history the reason I bring this up is
because Donald Trump hasn't done that as
a matter of fact he's been more
transparent he's been more open to the
press than the previous president
I don't think Barack Obama was a fascist
and I don't think Donald Trump is a
fascist you are saying definitively that
Donald Trump was a fascist based on
rhetoric I'm showcasing you his policy
he say this than if he's so transparent
and so open and so actually wanting the
press in why wouldn't why does he say
that
why does he's because the press has an
inherent liberal media bias dishonor oh
excuse me
why how do you prove that what are the
numbers where were the studies that this
this this mainstream media is liberal
and progressive and communist and
whatever you want to say I didn't
support the left that they have this
bias one thing if you could do me a
favor I didn't put any words in your
mouth don't put words in you but you
change the argument used to which we I
thought were talking about Donald Trump
we switched it over to no mama do you
understand the purpose for that though
you're just in the firm oh no Donald
Trump is a fascist no but why are we
talking about me because Obama actively
shot to suppress the past and Donald
Trump doesn't that's how do I know he
hasn't how do I know he has his mouth
that he does not like the press and that
they're lying and that everything that
they say is fake with the exception of
one news program
a lot of what they say yes is fake why
does he also then retweet
unsubstantiated claims for people see
again we're getting back into rhetoric
could you point me to any I have no
other substantive policies I only I the
only information I have is what I can
read and what I can see on television
okay so whatever Donald Trump puts out
as a tweet that is what I know okay what
do you read and what do you what do you
watch as far as television news i watch
fox and i watch MSNBC okay that's good
I'm glad you balanced kind of two sides
I do that's very that's very respectable
and I actually appreciate that I think
it's more valuable than watching CNN
that kind of plays down the middle when
they obviously lean left and what do you
read why do you know CNN obviously we've
looked well if you look look you want to
take Jake Tapper's example do you want
to take a multitude of their reporters
you want to take a multitude people
actually work at CNN who have direct
ties to the Hillary Clinton campaign but
I don't want to get off on the beaten
path here I brought that up because you
definitively said Donald Trump as a
fascist right I'm not mistaken that was
your service well I said that looking at
that definition I think parts of it met
Donald Trump not all of it okay so he
has not made laws or he can't make laws
but he has not done things he's not
pulled up the army or he couldn't or
forces he could make to suppress people
or oppress people he has not done that
here is actually because we don't have
these laws and we've been working I
think under the assumption that some
behaviors they were just they were over
customs they were customary this is the
way people customarily did things or
customarily presidential candidates
showed us their tax returns so no Donald
Trump hasn't broken any laws in not
doing this his tax return he simply just
broke in custody what does any of this
have to do with Donald Trump being a
fascist nothing I think I was getting to
a point of that there are points in that
where I get with that definition that I
think he pulls into fascism but not all
of us so you believe Donald Trump's tax
returns as it relates to him being a
fascist are more relevant than previous
presidents and their suppression of the
press
no I was using as tax returns as an
exist an example that's why I was using
Barack Obama in the stream of the press
so I'm okay with using the tax returns I
disagree that that would make him a
fascist no I didn't say that would no I
understand and I also didn't say that it
would make Barack Obama a fascist I'm
just was pointing out the act of
suppression and prosecution of
journalists which was unprecedent under
President Obama same thing we're talking
about you know you just mentioned that
he can't make this into law well
unfortunately because of executive
orders now in precedent there are a lot
of executive orders that have made law
you know most egregiously would be daca
or title nine that we saw from the
previous administration where as
executive actions are simply meant to
actually guide current laws and how they
are interpreted so he could so a good
example of fascism would be someone who
would sign an executive order that would
actively suppress the press he hasn't
done that an executive order you know
somehow using the Second Amendment or
changing it they're up for a free
citizenry to be an armed populace or
signing an executive order for example
that might silence freedom of speech to
roundabout ways he isn't done any of
those things you know he has actually
rolled back regulations rolled back
taxes rolled back red tape he's been
less invasive into your life so I just
don't see how my life yes and he can
break laws and get away with it that's
unfortunately been the case with you
everyone here is breaking laws if you
were to I'm general Washington DC there
no no I don't live in DC I'm not I'm not
from Washington okay so he can what laws
would you say he's broken gotten away
with of the immigration okay the problem
at the border then when people cross the
border and try to apply for
what are these the people who are saying
that they are being oppressed or
have troubled in their home countries
yes I love a refugees right and so he
says he is saying there are no refugees
these are simply all illegal immigrants
and as they step foot across the border
they are now criminals yes so is he not
breaking is that a large that simply
accustomed United Nations somebody put
out and said you have to take refugees
in is he not breaking laws no he's not a
member that is United States law your
problem would be with existing United
States law if you cross the border so
you can enter this country illegally
it's me I'm not down there or saying you
can't come across no there should be
some yeah no I'm saying I'm personally
not down there saying these people are
allowed to come across but something one
could be just President Trump has his
group of people down there saying
they're not allowed to come up right
okay they're not allowed to cross how is
that fascism I'm saying well he's
breaking laws no he's not he's enforcing
United States immigration law you can't
 immigration law versus the
problem of the refugees who were coming
here and saying I would like to apply
for refugee status I would like to prove
that I've been sure and and they just
they're not giving their day at court
they've had I think there was something
report of a woman who was her day that
she was supposed to actually be in court
wasn't on a plane being sent back to
young Venezuela or Guatemala or wherever
and the judge says get her back here can
I ask you a question I want because we
like we just and I appreciate you taking
the time and I appreciate you being
civil um I think we're maybe missing
each other here can you explain to me
someone crosses the let's say Mexican
American border right does so without
any verification just does so in the
heat of the night illegal immigrant what
is the difference between somebody who
does that and somebody who does it and
seeks refugee status what's difference
being an illegal immigrant and an
undocumented refugee who comes here
illegally
I think if there were people who were
sitting at the border trying to walk in
- from what I understood that there were
there sort of government spots where
they could walk in there and say I'm
here as a refugee please allow me in
those places were closed down how do you
make it impossible for them not to obey
the law and then arrest them and say you
disobeyed the law what law is he
disobeying by not allowing illegal
immigrants I tell you I'm not sure if
it's United States law if this is NATO
if this is some bleep it's not that we
we signed treaties with people saying we
are gonna treat refugees now in this
certain way it's not what's not it's not
you said you don't like a lot it's not a
lot so because when you brought up who
protects the refugees who gave us this
that you know a refugee comes in and
says please let me in
III understand for I understand where
you're coming from a place of compassion
right these you know and please don't go
there please don't go there we're trying
to say that to me a fascist is a person
who I'm not coming from compassion I'm
coming from this position an insult I'm
coming I understand that because I'm
compassionate towards these people but
rule of law does matter your problem is
not with not allowing these people to
come in no he's not he's not bringing
why I think that's important again
there's nothing fascist about having
borders I think if we go back to fascism
we're talking about autocratic control
of government or a racial ethno estate
there's nothing fascist about actually
enforcing current immigration law what
you know what they are does anyone know
what they are yes what are they you're
not allowed to come into this country
illegally and you should be deported it
what about the refugees I said I'm not
talking answer your legal are absolutely
I'm in prevented from doing it legally
then what is that that is enforcing
immigration laws that is not do you
believe that - right that anyone who
wants to come here should be able to be
granted citizenship no okay so what's
the problem with vetting people you are
trying to twist this around you were not
addressing the refugees you're not
addressing the fact that people are
coming here from Venezuela or Guatemala
whatever South American countries
they're trying to come in sure saying
that I can
stay there yeah we've irrelevant oh you
have such compassion but it is the law
it is irrelevant of the law yes but it's
very compassionate of you to say that
it's too bad well you just know you
don't know what the law is and then I've
informed what the law is and then you
sit Donald Trump is a fascist so I want
to make sure that I understand this you
believe Donald Trump is a fascist
because you didn't force it you've
already so pressured speech
do you believe Donald Trump is a fascist
because enforce immigration you guys can
just twirl stuff around I'm not trying
to turn your life around and say all you
want pretend to be compassionate and
you're not can I say one less one less
thing can we discuss this very hot I
know it's very hot let me let me see if
we can find common ground on this I
doubt it you doubt it I think you might
I think he may be surprised okay I
actually have a real problem with
fascism and that would be the first I
would be locking arms with you against
fascism if for example it was like man
if for example man who probably the most
can I say fight in for American rights
and laws mr. McCain Senator McCain in
the disrespect he showed that man excuse
me okay well you didn't allow me to
speak but that's pretty disrespectful I
would say yourself thank you turns out
respect is a one-way street by the way
before the next interview this is a good
time to let you know to hit the
notification bail because subscriptions
don't mean anything anymore or join my
club a lot of credit calm slash mug up
for the full one-hour Daily Show not
only to get the show every day as
opposed to just the clips along with
this wondrous hand etched hand-painted
mug but most of these changed my mind's
and similar videos get D monetize the
moment they're uploaded to Mudd Club is
the only way to support at $69 per year
for students veterans or active military
try it for a whole week before you join
okay let's talk to this next guy
Alexi yes nice to meet you could you
scoot a little closer so we can get
young sorry I know I know it's hot so
it'll make me remind you about the
scooching all right good
so Alexi yeah I don't know how much you
know you just watched someone else sit
down yeah let me just kind of reassert -
sir I'm getting I think I'm getting
heatstroke after burp is it okay if we
go for it
no might just be throw up later on um
you know this is uh unedited so whatever
we talk about is it's going to be
genuine people will see entirely what
what is discussed not taken out of
previously on making a mug club I wish I
could say that none of us saw this
coming but all of us for sure did you
know was in the cards for a lot of
people we've already been demonetised
quite a bit Heda monetizes his own
videos to sell more mugs in the era of
deep platforming it's becoming harder to
know who to trust before he completely
fabricated a conspiracy
I thought Owen Benjamin was a friend so
I couldn't make sense of why it would
spread what is clearly a lie because if
anyone would tell you who works with me
I'm an amazing person who's Steven yeah
he's alright so why would own lie like
that it didn't make sense furthermore
it's well known that he has the
attention span of a pomeranian so he
couldn't have woven this tapestry of
lies alone but who else on the right
would want to take down mug club it was
time to look at motive right away
the standout suspect was David Rubin who
is knowingly harbored ill will against
my mug club and it's tremendous success
for a long time catastrophic results
that we can't prove that yet people
don't agree on this you want to wait you
want to wait till Miami is supposed to
be gone Dave to most people it would
seem odd that David a gay guy would be
so angry but few people know that David
Rubin hides a far more sinister secret
it's a well-known fact that David Rubin
is a homosexual a disease which afflicts
less than 3% of a population causing him
to have unnatural sexual urges toward
other men it was a large part of his
brand for David Rubin though not as
bigger successful as mug Club being gay
was big business but what if he wasn't
telling the truth
what if gay David Rubin was hiding
something a rudimentary search of public
records revealed that David Rubin is in
fact married to a man and is indeed a
practicing homosexual but there's
something else that's been bothering me
something that doesn't add up
maybe I've been looking in the wrong
place no Dave Rubin is definitely gay
like no conspiracy definitely really
really gay I was real what are those
real it's a valid question what the hell
is wrong with you this kindness show is
a mistake you're not I don't
[Music]
[Music]
have you on the show today back in
studio was here yesterday and third
chair is Lauren southern Lauren
underscore southern how are you I'm good
wrong pronouns again remember legally a
man this is true so you don't have to be
uncomfortable anymore what's wrong do we
use a microphone yesterday Lauren for
those who missed you our mothers came in
a beautiful dress and we all felt
horrible and so he shamed her right away
and said yeah dress down yeah so we
pretty much chose we're in like PJs yes
exact time you're on the show we don't
have money for obvious reasons that guy
has a lot going on but we do have Karen
strong boom yeah we does stefan molyneux
we all set for a minister justin trudeau
and samantha bee again yeah not exactly
producing actually doing a really good
job this week is quarterblack geared you
are in fact a quarter black that's right
I am I appreciate it show the fans to
think no trust you that's terrible we're
gonna one who's the entire black on it's
all 4% and what's the one of the day add
you Morgan even had to bring an extra
large bottle for you heavy drinkers this
is a long shadows pirouette long shadows
pier why is it an extra-large Bob what
do they sell it in that placate when it
comes to wine size really does I feel
good something I would see on Pinterest
from a mom that I don't like wait this
is really good I am only having my one
serving of wine a day mommy needs or
special jus yes I ate for dinner yeah
yeah hopefully your kids have a pool
without a fence and hopefully you're
buying wine for me question of the day
we're gonna be talking quite a bit about
me too and some of the latest frauds
involved there of a few months into this
now I've seen a shift it notices shift
in the temperature change in the
temperature toward the movement so how
do you balance being supportive the
victims of course actual victims will
not automatically throwing anyone who's
ever been accused under the bus no
questions asked let me know let us know
we'll be talking about it and I think
we'll be talking about with with Karen's
Tron actually Lauren will be filling
hosting for me with Karen strong for
this just because I can
leading the news though you'll love this
Lauren I have no idea why is a new study
on eco sexuality did you know that was
the thing mm-hm so yeah having want to
know that was it what's happening to
like you're gonna tell me anyway I am
with the earth
yeah the earth taking the earth as a
lover
raises a number of legitimate concerns
regarding non-human consent as well as
sexualities comes from sage Journal -
the Lord seems like it would it seems
like this would raise a lot of questions
I've heard of objective sexuals like
that lady who married a flower
yes there's a natural trend now because
someone I guess a tree there people now
have been falling over 300 unstable well
that's what you say so this is the new
progressive frontier this is where we
are and we actually now go live to a
press conference being held by
representative from the other side of
the spectrum who disagrees them their
spokesperson is about to take the podium
thank you for coming I am appalled
that's a lack of compassion
self-awareness or accountability as it
relates to the ongoing sexual abuses of
my Trippel without consent largely
because they cannot consent this has
been an ongoing struggle which Trippel
americans sadly learn to live with but
with the recent events occurring at
Kevin Spacey's nursery and the widely
publicized herbicide of Harvey
Weinstein's potted ficus we can no
longer stay silent because that plant
had a name his name was ficus like this
morning would he was my friend
and for fear the ramifications to my
everlasting shame I stayed quiet but not
anymore
we will be silenced no more the tree -
movement is here to be heard and here to
stay I will now open the floor for any
questions you may have
yes I don't know what they were
expecting I know what Lauren was
expecting her face is something other
than what she's hearing I think you
should have known better Laurens are you
at a point that I've regretted coming
here since the moment I said yeah yeah
psychologize so so going back to
yesterday's conversation we're exactly
with the front hull B with a train on
the earth explained context for people
who don't I said going back to yesterday
nine dollars a year which is which is a
problem which is definitely a problem
stop doing the cervix okay Lauren to do
Gerald's job for him what's the context
of the front hole I have to be the one
to explain this yeah I get to explain
front hole what were privileged with the
task of explaining well friends I you
must know by now that using the proper
terms for genitals is a very offensive
thing to do because not everyone can
have vaginas so I thought you were gonna
avoid saying it I was going to and I
realized I couldn't I was my brain was
going it was like going through words
scrolling and I'm like no this was oh we
covered yesterday want us to call them
front holes yes yeah front holes and you
know what we're probably not gonna in
other news
Jon Stewart by the way came to the aid
of two goats from the run in Brooklyn

comedian turned farmer rescued the two
row goats caught running around on the N
train tracks so the two go actually
taken to an upstate sanctuary where
they'll this is that is a feel-good
story they're gonna be taken care of
cared for well fed then groomed and
given a late-night talk show Donald
Trump is a piece of ba Michael Cohen can
suck my BA and I hope Bob I don't even
know which context those beliefs would
be necessary I know how it seems like
except when writing this program is
horribly confused between goats and
sheep or that's all we have the Wardrobe
for Thank You Lauren for tolerance by
the way hit the notification bell join
my pepper subscribe on iTunes if you
wanna listen to this audio on the go you
was a good man tebah I'm pleasantly
surprised gonna come back to haunt me it
will don't ever run for office that's
awesome but do up here in sharknado 5
that is actually I'll battle reverse
course for the only thing that makes me
feel better Coulter you and I now that's
significantly worse speaking of animals
by the way
a Chinese man was fine for release
pigeons on the highway if you're
wondering how could this go wrong let me
explain to you how so he told police
he'd been keeping 6070 pigeons but he
decided to set them free and he said he
chose the highway because it was a
wide-open space full of cars yeah didn't
know how this would end not exactly
about half of them survived but look
look let's not be too picky here this
does come from a country that eats dogs
so this is a step in the right direction
dogs and shiners at just Vietnam no it's
China that was the whole festival was in
China when we talked about it really yes
they have like an entire dog eating
festival another reason to not like them
and people get they inflate their
currency and they eat Mandy Fugees
have you ever seen those those posters
of vegans where they're like at which
point you side do you decide which ones
are food and they have a picture like a
cat dog pig cow everyone puts because
vegans are trying to say like they're
all beautiful animals but everyone just
puts the line before pig they turn junk
into bacon they're amazing vegans and
show them a fetal chart and watch them
explode like a fembot in Austin Powers
hey speaking of which I love you that
there's an all-female SWAT team well
yeah being deployed to protect the
Indian Prime Minister this comes from
msn.com they're expected to play a major
role in the security detail for the
Prime Minister's address and
Independence Day after being inducted by
the Delhi police
it just sounds funny Delhi police good
good not exactly the Hope Diamond but it
all female security to I know might seem
odd sorry about this one but we do try
to keep an open mind here lotos Crowder
handsome weather in the studio it's not
a little bit of tokenism so we decided
to look at the pros and cons in this
week's ion India
[Music]
[Applause]
so the pros and cons of an all-female
SWAT team yeah it'll be some pros there
are definitely some pros I know you you
thought this would this is not a
woman-hating club no no no we've been
pretty welcoming you know I hate when
truly I didn't get the memo oh just came
in just my only friends are gay men yes
it seems like you have a lot of gay male
friends yeah why they're the only people
that talk to me well that's questionable
with my wife she likes you
maybe she's a gay man have you even
yourself floor and that's all you need a
little secondly I I have asked in a
multitude of ways so there are some pros
for an all-female SWAT team in India up
pro for example the highly proficient in
the art of passive-aggressive dialogue
huh very useful on the bits mental
warfare another Pro they're 23 percent
more cost-effective oh yeah with a
percent more cost-effective another pro
this long-distance swimming yeah okay a
lot of people didn't know that you
didn't know that no I know that
long-distance swimming do you know that
women are better at longest in swimming
how do you not know this it's the one
physical thing you are better at than me
and you it's the only thing the only
thing as far as a sport yeah they're
like better they're better than men at
long-distance swimming women are
actually I I didn't I didn't know it I
don't know if like if I put this way if
women were better at almost all the
sports than men and then we had one
thing like we would be clinging to that
I guess you just have healthier egos
cons of course cons an all-female SWAT
team vulnerable when cold and the unit's
forget their jackets
that's one yeah that definitely is
chilly next con unit often incapable of
being able to even mm-hmm you know it
seems a little odd in the middle on the
battle for putting them at the front
lines another con unit available there
M'Vila before - six days out of the
month that seems obvious we can move on
another con pull ups
yeah pull ups is right there and the
final con is every other physical
activity unfortunate for an all-female
team outside of long-distance swimming
outside of long I mean it's just like a
water attack their goal
right but I could say sharks sharks you
gotta save the Prime Minister from sharp
sharks what is he doing I don't know I
don't Kenny not Canadians not swim or
you know I didn't say that oh you're
putting words in my mouth now well let's
see we've offended the Chinese Indians
we got time to offend everybody else
don't worry look here's the thing I say
go for it like if this guy gets
assassinated it's his own damn fault at
this point if he actually fix it all
female crew go for it prove the model
exactly he didn't have the foresight
maybe it's a trade-off he's like nice
view oh my I'll take the coin toss is
just Bollywood film star yeah before he
dies finally a Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau is now defending his
recent racist attack he I guess his he
called this heckler racist you know what
let's just before let's just roll this
clip right here and I'll explain to you
that's what that's what my entire
maternal family ever sounds like I'm on
my whole mom's side
I met them he's right yeah they always
sound wrong there you go so she's asking
them about about the refugees costing
hundreds of billions of dollars to the
taxpayer and here you go here he is he's
saying this racism plays no role in
Quebec now do you speak you don't speak
French do you know okay all right so
that was just as I was trying to Tran
she's basically saying hey what about
the cost of the asylum seekers and
refugees and he just says yeah you're a
racist
it's extremely frustrating because
you've also got the media and just the
progressive education system supporting
this and saying yes it's a racist view
to ask about taxpayers money being
wasted on illegal migrants it's a racist
view to have borders it's a racist
extremist view to want to have a
nation-state with an identity that is
completely false the extremest opinion
is Trudeau's opinion to destroy borders
to destroy a national identity if you
don't have those things you're not a
country so why are we pretending women
like this who are asking rational
questions are the extremists
it's a lot harder for Canada to because
I'm like the United States where our
identity was basically a series of ideas
Canada's identity was sort of you know
kissing the ring of the Queen it was an
app calling it was right it was a colony
that's the United States identity was
never racially tinged right it was
entirely constitutionally based people
don't understand that in Canada or
inland places like Germany for them it
was a people and so yeah it's a little
bit of a tougher transition yeah well
absolutely she said it right so this
woman actually said illegal immigrants
in her question he and originally
responded from the podium but she said
did he replied with immigrants your your
hostility towards immigrants has no
place here and then later on said the
racism immediately changed it back to
the word immigrants aren't a race
exactly
and yet illegal illegal people are
different yeah and we were talking about
this yesterday you said they get all
kinds of benefits when they go there
they get picked up and taken like a
valet service to a hotel for the only
two years of welfare like they are
heading more money than Canadians and
Canadians are paying for this of
Canadians that are struggling there on
the streets we have literally hundreds
of thousands of kids in Canada that are
below the poverty line and you're
bringing in tons of illegals from
America thanks by the way yes I know
we're sending him north I don't know we
should say would you just send them all
to Mexico you know what you want to come
there or said them all to Quebec like
French sounds kind of sexy right but
people they think of French people oh I
like say Marge M definitely Oh nuts you
head you know that's that's what French
Canada sounds like like ordering
potatoes European French should be like
je vous de pommes de terre Zulu play
button Quebec Abby that's actually what
they sound like I'm not even saying
words you understand but you think you
hear they drunk at this point is that
normal but here to give his what do we
have them here to give his side of the
story actually is Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau Prime Minister
are you there sir thanks for having me
Stephen now Prime Minister you were
recently criticized firstly for racism
in Canada I didn't ask my question I'm
sorry sorry reflexes please continue
you were recently criticized for how you
responded to a constituent during us
speech she was yelling hate speech but
the question was when the federal
government would repay Quebec for the
cost that it's incurred as a result of
the influx of illegal immigrants coming
across a canadian-us border that was the
question that she asked right hate
speech yeah how exactly is that hate
speech well I I really hate it when
people yell questions at me it actually
seems like a reasonable question Prime
Minister yeah I have to see exactly what
she said actually quarter person of
color Garrett can you roll clip see he
doesn't get to ask you that no you don't
get to ask him that I'm not of this show
you're not what about the question
though do you think that loose
immigration laws and incentives for
asylum seekers have added to your one
point four trillion dollar deficit maybe
you you know as well as I do Stephen the
deficits are not an indicator of
long-term economic viability but Prime
Minister Harper ran a surplus four years
off the backs of our First Nations
people Stephen what was what was that I
don't know what's we thought seems like
a constant ooh
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau everybody
that's not going anywhere good I still
can't believe you got the Prime Minister
on I know I know
I also can't believe we got a raped tree
yeah that was a very good get you know I
mean I think you know that he is who he
is right and offensive to you that
Justin Trudeau I've accepted it I just I
don't talk about Canada no you know it's
Canada and no I
they have no idea how good they had it
with Harper they really don't understand
how well the housing crisis was largely
avoided because of his policies and they
just never appreciated him it's much
like the Northern Europeans they get
cameras rolling sounds good I mean I
wish I could say that none of us saw
this coming but the truth is all of us
for sure did all of us for sure did I
mean we knew it was all just a matter of
time
you know after Alex Jones we knew it was
in the cards for a lot of people we'd
already been demonetised quite a bit not
to mention the the restrictions
restricted modes been really bad for us
and outright suspensions we had no
choice they forced her hand creating mud
club the thing about Crowder is and this
is a well known secret in the industry
HIDA monetizes his own videos to sell
more mugs who told you that
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
idle hips idle hips we need an idea let
me get my iPad away from the water that
came out of the mug there eh
we're just didn't Izzy has took this
this week it's been a it's been a big
week we have a lot to talk about we have
some great guests today we have Paul
Joseph Watson on the show boom boom
prison planet Infowars he's probably out
of a job soon so maybe you'll see him
here we have the great one Mark Levin
here pretty happy about that and before
we get to the guest that we have here in
studio and the topic we'll be talking
about today of course social media the
tech giant's the D platforming and now
we're gonna have my lawyer actually
half-asian lawyer bill Richman to talk
about that let me ask you question of
the day social media giants obviously
they've started another round of purges
against figures as they see it being on
the far right or as we know it just not
the far left the question is now that
now we're beyond Alex Jones where's the
line do you think they have a line do
you have a line and what actions do you
think should be taken against these
leviathans if any when it comes to
YouTube Twitter Facebook and I'm all wet
I have two fixes what else do the dance
firm Dancing with those dancing too hard
look you can see this this is disgusting
alright producing of course first week
without knocking John same around every
now and then is a quarter black Garrett
you are a quarter black I am for sure
it's only a quarter yeah I can't do it
that good my friend got a Cuban cigar
that was so clearly faked on the label
it was misspelled that was the
equivalent to that in a hood pass a huge
pianist huge pianist calm own Benjamin
is in third share with us today how are
you own it's great to be back I now
realize I do have to go the shirt store
yeah because I showed up and now I
realize that I'm wearing a similar
there's be twins you have dates coming
up in Houston right I do I got dates all
over got a huge pianist calm to check it
out and get my last specials yes there
are a lot of speaking this fing this
week knows a special guy who's but I
think we have here G Morgan Judah the
one he's buying wine today so he'll be
back next Monday but he's gone so my
half-asian whatever bill Richman is in
the studio are you really glad to baby
we're gonna be talking about Facebook
and Twitter yeah you know what I we're
helping to fix the world so it's a
better world for him to live I'm pretty
sure that I'm pretty sure Skynet will
have fallen by that I wouldn't worry
about it in other news let's get to this
first 20:18 news I should say Christine
Hall Quist could be elected the first
ever transgender Governor on Tuesday she
won the Democrat primary victim in the
first tray now this is by the way in
Vermont so whoever wins a Democrat prime
very likely to win the general and this
is prompted Vermont's own Ben and Jays
to release a string of new inspired
flavors actually quite a few so this
brings us to this week's Crowder 7+1
that's right Ben and Jerry's top seven
transgender themed items I know by the
way there are there are Republicans
elected in Vermont I know even as
governor but this is in this case in a
primary you need one that's gonna be a
size 12 shoe she is a size bill coming
in hot
he didn't know if he should say that one
what is wrong with you offer you're the
biggest stars in the world respectful if
I had written that joke I would have
stood up to deliver it yes I would have
been very proud of that I am standing up
and yet I'm still shorter than like your
father did SMU law graduation but your
mom stayed seated because she was
disappointed you weren't a doctor yes
yes and she remained seated to this day
disappointed did you know that it's
actually true what's that he has a tiger
mom and she wishes he were a doctor
being in like an awesome half-asian
lawyer isn't good enough no no not at
all no no whoa my mom's just really
happy I have a driver's license I have a
class-c license did your head as an
actor like you got hit you're Class C
for motorcycle it's a huge deal I won't
write I won't ride a motorcycle at six
seven it's probably not very prudent to
do it be like that Dumbo all right
listen number seven Ben and Jerry's top
 flavored ice creams a little on
the nose
chunky train number six Adam's apple
crisp I see what you did that doesn't
even sound very appetizing
I don't think any of these do because we
go to number five chocolate chip cookie
ooh yeah and then we've got number four
triple caramel hormone blockers yes yes
but only between the ages of nine and 11
if you listen to Julie Ray yesterday
according the dsm-5 you only administer
though is between nine and eleven
because that's the cautious approach
they can just reverse it and undo the
puberty blockers if they want to
continue as opposed to say not
administering radical hormone blocking
therapy I don't know number three mint
chocolate abnormally high suicide rate
which doesn't really seem like a flavor
that's it terrible flavor I think you
wanted AI you wanted this one you wanted
to have a crack at number two Harry
Baals SIA
admits it so much for what he deliver
look look at my eyes let alone the
audience that's intense and actually
number one was actually this was similar
to number but you know what this was
Owens in it this was Owens baby he's
pretty proud of it number one Ben and
Jerry transgender seemed ice cream Owen
Benjamin that would be the strawberry
short lifespan that's true that's we're
gonna hit letters everybody with a plus
one banana split then invert it into
your body cavity make a fake vagina
that's been this week seven plus one
that doesn't sound appetizing at all in
other news that that sucks New York
Governor Andrew Cuomo told an audience
that quote America was never that great
remember there was a point when we were
in general elections and Democrats had
to act as though they didn't hate their
country yeah that was before that
bug-eyed lady yes it was before it was
that's the Pug eyed lady the pug ID law
guide lady we talked about Nina and Nina
Pinta Santa Maria Cortez yes that lady
can you remember her exact Alexandria
Acacio Cortes there you go ooh would you
have known that bill no no I would not
have gotten that correct at all and
that's why your mother's disappointed in
you 17,000 reason he missed the bumper
multiculturalism
he's so racist I didn't believe us we
have a clip we're not gonna make America
great again it was over that great why
did he sound like the guy in dumb and
Dumberer is like there are other people
who need to use the found that guy
sounds like rarity was Ray Romano's
brother and I just I just can't believe
that these are actual people but his
brother actually for those I don't know
CNN's Chris Cuomo was overheard as
saying hello darkness miles
I thought it was pretty great I've come
that's pretty childish but it was we
just wanted to fit it in there because
he's a DNC pool boy I feel like the
Cuomo brothers are such AI buzzkills
they could be sitting in a hot tub with
champagne and they're just like I heard
bubbles they're too fizzy my name is
Neil
have you seen piglet anyway he has an
English accent I don't know how to do
accents so I just run in got the Cuomo's
that is decidedly too new yorky I'm in
for New Yorker even New Yorkers Blake
okay listen can you tone it down a
little bit yeah they're like we're not a
parody of ourselves from a 50s mobster
movie listen stop getting work club
you're not that fantastic who likes do
you think people are still voting for
the Cuomo's people we're gonna vote for
Anthony Weiner until you became more
Anthony Weiner do you realize only after
the first scandal people are talking
about form yeah cos New York has
Stockholm Syndrome that's a good point
oh it's almost are also making it so
felons can vote I want they're getting
all there they're hedging their bets so
you get to break all of the laws yep
vote on them exactly speaking of
bringing once finally a congressman
actually wants to know if the Chinese
spy staffed by Dianne Feinstein
compromised classified Intel this comes
from the Washington Examiner Congressman
Jim banks he asked we all while we all
know that the FBI approached senator
Feinstein's five years ago to informer
of this threat right now there are more
questions than ever regarding this case
I'm just wondering how the spy got away
with this for so long
it really does seem remarkable it was
right underneath Feinstein's eye
yeah Feinstein's not good at figuring
out who's spying on her I do not say it
seems to be one of our weeks but all
this and we've been talking about the
Russians that we've taken our eye off
the Chinese and they're so
passive-aggressive paper straws well
they continue with that last you know
that comes from them all of the modern
inconveniences it's clear where it's
coming from
pretty good pretty good big strong
congressman I think a copy boy this is
what you like it and it's kind of try to
so you know there coffee on your chrome
yes
Thank You Ming's very thoughtful oh yeah
ah what is this weird paper thing what
is this an official bum down yeah I
remember that bill why would the outlaw
plastic straws
I don't know why I can't eat rent made
you guys bear I mean you're brave
environmentalist did dad you oh no you
you get coffee on your shirt kill you
must be sad I don't shy about that it
American it's like drinking through a
number-two pencil today how you know
your coffee
I got it enjoy what you like I know you
need caffeine no you get sleepy it's
good I still feel a little bit sleepy oh
you feel sleepy I'm so bummed out right
now that cab all it's okay now
there's an important vote today to keep
the internet free from censorship oh I
guess you don't need your iPad for you
yeah damn it oh no it's only in 87% oh
oh you know what no you know but I only
have charged enjoyed only don't judge
people away oh no awesome
yeah America yeah I wish I loved
anything as much as Owen loves watching
himself and scales over to you it wasn't
laughing at V I was just do it all you
like you're killing me that was also a
laugh and think about the fact bills mom
is probably like why aren't you also a
spy my mom's got enough disappointment
that she's even disappointed for that
spy not being a doctor by the way
quarterblack cared no one can we all
confirm that bill was laughing the
hardest in the room at that sketch while
it was playing yeah yeah bill was
laughing the hardest and Asian's capable
of laughing this is true hey this isn't
a spirit of crazy rich agents agents are
getting all kinds of screen time I love
this is absolutely no and whenever
someone says that's right you really do
have to blame Mickey Rooney it really
goes back to Breakfast at Tiffany's and
I it is remarkably racist but we'll
piggyback off of it okay to go back to
the question of earlier so
is something we're talking about today
and I do want to hear from you guys I
know
apparently aren't that many opinions I
hate to say it it's not that it's not
that we live in a monolith but it's
everyone who's not a far left
progressive pretty much lives in a
monolith you're protecting freedom of
speech so Alex Jones obviously was
simultaneously remove from Facebook
YouTube Apple so on okay move
unfortunately a lot on the Left rejoiced
now we talked about that last week and I
think I know you weren't here when we
talked about that but obviously you know
about the story but things have changed
so now stefan molyneux his youtube
channel or see to hard strike seemingly
out of the blue we don't know what for
yet then youtube issued the the h3h3
productions a hard strike I think they
were blocked from streaming right yeah
block follow they were streaming well
what happened while they were streaming
yeah
and I think a big part of that was
because they addressed the Jones
conspiracy I have to say allegedly right
that covers me right well yes I say
allegedly I mean apparently because
YouTube said it was a mistake Edward but
the stream was taken down because they
addressed the Alex Jones story now let's
not forget since we last spoke yeah
McGinnis spontaneously banned from
Twitter who's next who's now who's next
well here's the thing social justice for
his claim or at least we should say they
they hope this comes from inverse that
we're next did you see this no Aayla
they actually they called me all right
into the three alt right jail and Julie
borovsky she's the token libertarian
chick that's her search channels name
she couldn't be less Pro Trump on the
conservative side insane it's so funny
with him it's funny when they are when
they call people like us all right
because the alt-right is way more
similar to the left they both think
white males are super special they just
differ on policy yes it's like a circle
it's like a circle it comes from like
here and then it comes back around right
here exactly how about the fact that
they accused hi Alex Jones of being
conspiracy theorist and then the biggest
companies in the world conspired to get
rid of it yes exactly
all right that's right you're all right
listen short if possible well the short
of absolutely ben shapiro i have been
the most outspoken critic of the
alt-right in modern conservatism and
that's only because he's really jewish
you can't out shapiro shapiro okay i
mean i can't i can't get as personal
with the alt-right of shapiro because
i'll be honest I've never walked a mile
in a size 6 shoes i possibly know
I've never want to had that small I
don't know what all right means I well
that's the whole point it's an umbrella
term so in case by the way there were
still any doubt as to the veracity of
these claims from inverse they spelled
my name with a pH so not exactly
Pulitzer winning research department
they're high in verse but little fact
rate it is mostly true so there's that
now the claim is is not that Alex Jones
the conspiracy theorist accusing
congressman of being pot-bellied
interdimensional them interdimensional
vampires would explain Chuck Schumer
they used the worst excuse possible and
Bill well that's why I wanted to have
you here today because you can talk
about this and offer some insight the
social media platforms didn't say it was
about Sandy Hook it wasn't about the
conspiracy theories they just use this
chilling defense Jones violated the hate
speech policies if any of you read
YouTube's pop have you read YouTube or
Twitter's hate speech policies I have
not I just accept and move just accept
and move on I checked the box and I just
go well the thing is some of their hate
speech policies aren't consistent with
other hate speech policies for example
if you just sign up and you create an
account and then you have when you
become a partner so there we've had to
go through these quite a few times and
sometimes the same company will have
different explanations but this is
actually taken directly I think from
Google support bill my half-asian one
hour bill Richmond I think you can read
this right yeah absolutely
it's it's pretty clear right there in
the paragraph there is a fine line
between what is and what is not
considered to be eight speech for
instance it is generally okay to
criticize a nation state but if the
primary purpose of the content is to
incite hatred against a group of people
solely based on their ethnicity or if
the content promotes violence based on
any of these core attributes like
religion it violates our policy well I
want to get into first off you pointed
out something right before the show I
did I did the paragraph right before
this and I really encourage everyone to
go take a look at the actual policy yeah
because just above the paragraph I just
read is a sentence that says primary
purpose of inciting hatred against
individuals or groups based on certain
attributes such as race religion
disability etc but what you'll skip over
if you don't recognize the language that
the lawyerly language is the such as
they're not saying that this is the
exclusive list right it can be used to
ban people from the platform's or take
away their monetization or take away
their livelihood
it's
just an example so in fact when you read
the literal language of the hate speech
policy it is any characteristic that
YouTube decides or Google decides on a
certain day that applies to an
individual or group that they happen to
fancy at that time and I don't think
there's a real question about which ones
they fancy and which ones they don't
yeah I feel like they've weaponized
balls just retract into your body cavity
mine did
Oh terrifying that is well it's
weaponized opinions yeah it's it's kind
of like saying mustard is a hate
condiment yes and someone being like
what does that mean it's like I hate it
so it's gone now and the relish is
clearly all trite
it's just umbrella labels hate yeah and
by the way this isn't even true now that
legal leaves that you got into super
super important because it's like when
someone says uh the Bible says the
world's gonna end in October 12th what
where does it say I believe it's
somewhere near the back another second
there's a clause in there that's what
you have in a lot of I mean there are so
many outs with with contracts like these
kept and then and everyone out there
who's signing up for a YouTube channel
you'll become a YouTube partner please
please have a lawyer look it over
because a lot of people don't know what
they're signing into but even then
they're it's not true in the application
from YouTube because people have been
banned for hate speech simply for
criticizing nations or ideologies of
course too loose definition the
application of course of hate speech
it's some of the we've harped on here
for a long time it was one of the first
ever change my minds for those who
you can't look at it in a vacuum and
just say American slaves why have the
same suicide rate they didn't have the
same kind of abuse from within their
family all right I am I'm glad to have
our next guest on the program you can
follow on Twitter at Julie ray now Julie
ray goldstein is actually a known
actress verified blue checkmark on the
Twitter as long as they're still giving
those out and allowing people to keep
those right now and has made it a point
to obviously criticize go after this
program quite a bit on Twitter and we've
been sort of missing each other but
you're on the show now Julie ray
goldstein thanks for being here oh
thanks for having me Steven I actually
really appreciate that you're willing to
have a conversation really you sound
surprised
ah no I'm not surprised I think at in
this current political environment I
think people are too polarized in one
way or another and I like actually
reaching out and looking at other points
of view so I'm kind of used to people
being a little more combative sure you
can come across coming coming a little
hot on Twitter so maybe that's why they
might seem competitive combative but
listen I I appreciate it in let me ask
you this I guess before we kind of
continue with a conversation what what
is it that you think would be fruitful
what are you open to glean kind of from
us sitting down here oh absolutely I
think the thing that interests me the
most is making sure that your audience
is aware of the actual science behind
some of the things that you've said in
the past sure um I think we both come
into it from a scientific perspective we
both want the best for people I don't
think either of us has malicious intent
in any regard but I think there's been a
bit of MIS association or
misinterpreting or misquoting Mis citing
the science okay so I just wanted to
clarify that okay well first off by the
way I did mention verified actress and
blue checkmark but I should say
transgender individual and activist sure
in case in case people didn't know
today's topic will be transgenderism and
obviously we've got into the science
quite a bit with our audience it's not
something that we that we hide from them
we certainly don't try to keep people in
the dark but yeah let's let's start with
that then where do you think I know
you've criticized me in a few different
areas in this program and it really more
so people who line up with my worldview
as a whole on the current transgender
issue
do you think it is that that we've we've
gotten this wrong well I think the first
part that I've criticized you a lot is
you mentioned you did a segment on what
was it like Timmy the bear I'm aware you
said something about how trans people
post-surgery can't experience sexual
pleasure can't orgasm and you said it at
one point with Ben Shapiro as well
that's actually completely incorrect I
can tell you as someone who has had
surgery and still experiences sexual
pleasure and orgasms that that's not the
typical response I there's actually
studies that show that over eighty
percent remain orgasmic post-surgery
and okay so that's that's one of you
well first off I do want to make sure
that we're clear on a couple things
something that's talked about with Timmy
the bear isn't necessarily meant to be a
reputable study but we have discussed
yeah for example I think on the
understood what struck me I don't
remember the Timmy the bear but I
remember in the I'm just a bill parody
it was many transgenders never
experienced sexual pleasure again now if
I've ever said definitively that no
transgenders ever after sexual
reassignment therapy can ever have
orgasms yeah that would be incorrect but
no I I appreciate that there are studies
though quite a few that show that for
example men a hundred percent of men
experience orgasm
cisgender men to use for the
nomenclature that's out there nowadays
those who transition transgenders it's
as low as 65% so it still is a 35%
decrease and the point that I was making
with that is you know listen if you knew
there was a 35% chance at that point if
there was thirty five percent thirty
five out of a hundred chance that you
won't ever be able to experience an
orgasm again would that lend to the
suicidality to the morbidity to the
mortality rates that you see in the
transgender community I know for me if I
knew that I was never going to achieve
sexual climax again I put a nine
millimeter in my mouth so that was the
point that that that we were making no
in the same here too I'm very vocal
about how I'm a huge horror nerd but the
thing that like I can't do in Hoorn I
think this is where this came out is the
sequence in The Handmaid's Tale that got
me the most is the female genital
mutilation scene and I cannot watch that
in horror even though I love for love
Eli Roth grew up with horror but it's
it's this idea that trans people have
gone through so much to reclaim their
sexuality and their
you'll pleasure that the idea of
somebody taking that away no believe me
it would make me want to put a
nine-millimeter in my mouth - if I knew
that yes but I question where you're
bringing up that 65% I'd actually like
to see the citations on that because I
actually like to look at that in kind of
what I tell people is here some studies
look at the science we don't actually
read it make up the decision for
yourself well the science you can't
really make up the decision but you know
go from there but if you're not sure
people can cherry-pick studies and
that's why I met analyses are very
important and of course the parameters
of scientific studies that's why
double-blind placebo-controlled clinical
trials are considered the gold standard
as opposed to just a general study that
says hey our supplemental formula works
go take it you know and who's funding
the studies but ya know science is
science but of course there's a way to
manipulate how it's presented through an
agenda yeah here's what we will do
because I obviously it wouldn't be fair
for me to bring up studies and do them
as an overlay as you're doing this and
you don't have the ability but we will
when we upload this video
everything that I'm referencing will be
available put them in links they're
available on PubMed so yeah it's about
65% okay um I'd actually like to see
that because the one that I I looked at
here actually it pretty much it does say
a large number of transsexuals 80%
reported improvement of their sexuality
now here's the thing majority of
participants reported a change in Oh
orgasmic feeling so it differs and
because of brain differences actually
the orgasm I this is just my feeling and
kind of on my experience the orgasm that
you have after surgery feels more right
and is more let's say it it it it's more
pleasurable and more it it it affects
you differently yeah I remember having
an orgasm like pre surgery and then you
could imagine I'm slightly uncomfortable
with this territory now I was well know
this is anecdotal you're talking about
how you feel during orgasms which I
appreciate and I hope it's fantastic I
wish you nothing but the best but I
don't necessarily know that that helps
the people watching right now so yeah
we'll get this information up there for
people who want to watch it I know I
know there are several other areas where
you
sighs me and the program is there
anywhere else where you think we get the
science glaringly wrong absolutely
you've also said that suicidality is the
same priam post surgery that's actually
just found to be false in multiple
different studies that actually use the
same methodology pre and post mm-hmm I'm
quoting there's one study here from
Belgium that a cauldron yeah I think you
quote one study from Belgium and one
study from Canada quite a bit if I'm not
mistaken but yeah let's go yeah there's
one from Belgium from 2006 that actually
shows that it drops from 29.3% 25.1% the
study from Canada actually shows 27.1 to
1% the study that actually you bring up
a lot is a doctored ahead Janee study
the one from Sweden which actually
doesn't quite say what you think it does
and this let me actually use dr.
jeannette Jenni's words herself she
actually says that the study as a whole
that she did covers a period between
1973 and 2003 what she found is that
when she divided the cohorts into two
groups 1973 to 1980 Oh on your mic this
muted on us one second oh I don't want
people to think that we're doing evil
internet overlords censorship of you we
can't hear you we lost sound oh oh now
you're back you're back sorry go ahead
okay take it from the top no and let
everyone know nothing up my sleeves it
was just an internet issue okay go ahead
no yeah um so doctor the head and he
found that if she divided the cohorts
into 1973 to 1988 and 1989 to 2003
obviously methodology diagnostic tools
change procedures change but she found
that if she divided at the differences
in mortality suicide attempts and crime
actually disappear and found no
different criminality or suicidality
than the cisgender controls for the 1989
to 2003 group there are a couple things
it's not just a suite of study though
that's an important one and it's not
exactly how you're presenting it but I
would like to before we do that because
I appreciate you talking about one
Belgian study one Canadian study this is
important for people to know why do you
think that I would completely throw out
the study you're mentioning from Belgium
I honestly don't know I mean I think
some people have an agenda I don't think
you here's the thing okay why do you
think I would throw everyone from Canada
I um I I honestly don't know I go ahead
okay yeah well the study from Belgium
and this is one thing that I think is
very important because trans the
transgender community likes to say
you're denying the science quite a bit
and what they do is take exceptions to
the rule rather than the rule so there's
one Belgian study which was done a while
ago we've done far more studies with
greater sample sizes and better more
objective parameters since then it's
interesting to me too you just mentioned
a 30-point difference between your own
studies the Belgian study and the
Canadians any couple of reasons for that
the belgian study actually I think it
was 100 something people maybe 107
people who participated 43% of the
participants dropped out meaning we have
no idea what happened to them by the end
we have no idea if they're still alive
so 43% of people who started the study
were not included at the end of the
study only 62 I think I'd have 105 or
107 I don't have it in front of me right
now that distorts the number quite a bit
of course the Canadians those who don't
know the Canadian study debate only
study only so I will let me let me kind
of give you my macro and then if you
disagree that you can so that's one
study that's where you saw it go down
from 29% to I think 5 percent is what
you quoted and then you said a Canadian
study where it goes down to 1% well
that's a testicle E significant because
the variability there if it were in one
study it would have to be thrown out
you'd have to redraw this study up
because 30% and 1% is pretty big the
Canadian study studies one year it asks
people within the last year of their
surgery if they've attempted suicide so
a study where 43% of the people have
dropped out and then a study that only
asks people about one year is not the
same as a Swedish study that you
mentioned or another Canadian study
that's more recent that actually takes a
larger sample size 300 something people
over the course of many several decades
and studies objective parameters like
mortality like morbidity like
suicidality but mainly mortality are
they alive are they dead that's
objective on like the Belgian study
which is a questionnaire and 43% dropped
out when you look at those studies that
objectively frame and the parameters and
aren't by the way conducted by a pro
trans activist group as a Canadian study
which you and I both know come on it'd
be like a supplement company funding a
supplement research paper it's 19 to 8
times more likely for post-operative
transgenders to commit suicide across
bored in all the other studies across
the board it's between 16 and 19 times
more likely than general populace to
kill themselves well let me also make a
differentiation between those Canadian
and the Belgium studies the Belgium
study actually only studied people who
had surgery the Canadian Studies studied
people who who had stated that they were
done transitioning and for some people
that's not surgery so that's also
another factor I get again we're looking
at different methodologies which we
can't say are equivalent in any sort of
way but we also have a 2010
meta-analysis we could say one is more
valid right we do have to agree which
one's more valid one that's funded by
the trans pulse project that only asks
people in a questionnaire within the
last year or one that studies over 300
people and whether they died or not ones
right well I don't think we can see that
in the in a vacuum and we can't really
make distinctions let me give you an
example we can't make distinctions based
on mortality unless we're comparing the
same things pre and post huh oh sorry
your sound keeps going on again it's not
it's the evil overlords at YouTube they
this is there you go okay sorry canal
it's I yeah anyway so here's kind of a
comparative thing if we did a study of
people with cancer and gave them
chemotherapy and measured the mortality
of people with cancer after getting
chemotherapy and measured that against
assists Jen not cisgender a control of
people who didn't have cancer sure you
would find that the mortality rate would
be higher in the people who received
chemotherapy and had cancer but you
can't use that then to make a
distinction that chemotherapy doesn't
improve the chances of sort of less
mortality of people with cancer
shrieking not if you're comparing it to
people what up kid
well first off let me just establish
kind of the premises here which we're
discussing I think we both agree the
suicide rate is high among the
transgender community the attempted
suicide rate and if I'm not mistaken a
big criticism that you've had toward me
is that post-operative transgenders are
actually far less likely so what we're
talking about here what we are debating
is the idea that post-operative
transgenders have improved suicidality
rates so that's why I was discussing
these studies I I don't think there
needs to be any correction because again
let's say you took
that's that use your own example cancer
do you compare these patients who didn't
undergo chemo these people are 19 times
more likely to die if they do not
receive chemotherapy and then he gave
them chemotherapy and afterward you said
these people are 19 times more likely to
die than the general population even if
they've had chemotherapy it would be a
valid comparison so I'm addressing your
point that you've criticized this show
that you say it improves the suicide
rates it doesn't it doesn't and the
overwhelming number of studies that are
performed objectively using objective
parameters show that it doesn't unless
you cherry-pick studies for funded by
transgender activists and I just don't
think that that's a fair way to to
compare science and certainly to come on
someone's program or tell someone else
that you're going to inform them as to
the science again all these are in
PubMed people please go research yes
both your studies and my studies yeah
what we're talking about I mean I can
also quote you a 2010 meta-analysis of
28 different studies that show that 78%
of trans people showed an improvement of
psychiatric symptoms another study of 50
trans women who received genital surgery
that found that their physical mental
health was not significantly different
from samples of sis women I mean we have
yeah that's a question there's I need to
be I need to be really clear here it's
like people this is a big thing I have
with sort of socialists on health care
this is why Cubans think they have
better health care than Americans if you
ask someone do you think your health
care is better than United States and
they say yes it doesn't mean it's better
right our mortality rates are better our
wait times are lower your greatest
chance of survival with a terminal
illness is living in the United States
but people in Cuba people in Canada
think they have better health care you
are citing studies that revolve around
polls and questionnaires and again the
dropout rate is also very high that is
not as reliable or objective as
mortality rates as medically observable
data and so I think it's important if
you are going to take on the
responsibility of informing people as to
the science to differentiate between
polls and questionnaires how people feel
and what happens as far as whether they
have a pulse or not well on that sense I
would ask you to find a study that
objectively actually states that's a
suicide Ally actually remains the same
pre and post comparing pre to post a or
goes up post I don't think you can find
any study that does that if you can
please tell me because I'd love to know
there are a couple studies that I
asked several other conservatives to
write on transgender issues to Italy you
know if you know of any please provide
them I'd be willing to read them but
there's a no study that shows
suicidality goes up when comparing pre
to post there it's never been never said
it goes up well or stays the same it's
it doesn't get much better is a point
there could be some studies that show a
slight improvement but generally
speaking it's still much higher than the
general population it's not even close I
think there you're making a qualitative
analysis ting ssin there because it does
get better regardless I mean there's
some that show less than others I mean
that's you're playing with numbers there
no not really I think if you if you say
they have a 41% to attempted suicide
rate if you have a study like the
Swedish day that you mentioned where it
goes up about it's still 19 times higher
than the general population regardless
of the information that you discussed
after 25 year follow-up there's also a
more recent Canadian study that came
from Toronto I believe where was about
18 times more likely to commit suicide
than in general population these are
post-operative transgenders so again
this matters because across it's
consistent we're ok here you've got 19
times here you've got a tee-time 18
times when you look at the mortality
rates the studies are pretty conclusive
now it doesn't mean that all of them are
going to show the exact same number but
18 19 times that's more consistent in
the studies you mentioned one of which
is funded by a transgender activist
group that had a 30% down to 5 percent
and then you said a new Canadian study
says it's down to 1% I mean most people
would look at that and it doesn't it
doesn't pass a sniff test again I think
I use that kind of language like feet
held to the mouths flames and then I
know that you talked a lot about pullers
don't you think that's adding to the
polarisation like you're talking about
Mao and you're invoking this idea of
fire serious communism isn't that a
little bit severe I don't think it's any
more severe than starting with the
assumption that I'm part of the
alt-right hey there my Kluber and/or
youtuber we are introducing a new
segment today long-form interview called
devil's advocate well we'll bring on the
four most conservative thinkers critical
thinkers and try to present both points
of view I think it was my friend Owen
who actually said if you cannot argue
your ideological opposition's point of
view as effectively as they can you have
no business holding your own position so
the purpose of this format is to argue
the left's the progressive left's
position more effectively than they do
and hopefully equip you in case you will
encounter these these arguments these
lines of questioning these specific
patterns of attack that you see from the
left so I warn you you might get mad you
might get frustrated you might want to
beat up Skylar I know that I did these
do not represent my views at all or the
views of anybody at loud or with crowd
or unless I don't know about it enjoy
devil's advocate with dr. Jordan
Peterson all right I'm your host
Scarlett Urton I was a segment where we
take on the biggest right-wing
personalities on the web out there sort
of in the cultural sphere and challenge
them hold their feet to the fire to see
if their ideas hold water and our next
guest is a very popular so very you know
noted fascist super popular Internet
personality you can take his personality
quiz I guess itself authoring calm his
book is 12 you 12 rules for life is
available at places
Jordan Peterson thanks for being on the
show sir thanks for the invitation
there's Skyler yes so let me allow you
to sort of establish with people who
aren't necessarily familiar you've made
it your main gold
an advocate of free speech particularly
speaking out against restrictions
thereof I know it started you sort of
Roseanne notoriety with Bill c16 in
Canada
tell us your in your own words why
freedom of speech is so important and
why you took your stand okay well first
of all I don't think that that's what I
put myself forward in in the main okay
I'm not very interesting interested in
the relationship between meaning and
responsibility okay and so I think that
my books and my lectures are mostly
devoted towards that I see free speech
as necessary because it's part of the
process by which the left and the right
continue in an ongoing dialogue about
how society should both maintained and
updated structures and that any attempts
to interfere without our dangerous to
both necessary wings let's say okay and
in Canada there was a bill passed a year
ago in May bill C 16 which purported to
do nothing but extend charter rights and
certain protections under the Criminal
Code to transgender people and but I
that isn't how I looked at the
legislation I thought it was a piece of
compelled speech the justifications for
doing that we're very thin well okay let
me let me ask you that so first first
off okay
meaning responsibility where they
intersect but freedom of speech is a big
component to that right and that's why
you talk about it well it's a
responsibility to speak properly and it
shouldn't be something that the
government should interfere with the
government interferes with that at its
peril whether it happens to be left or
right leading why I want to make sure I
wasn't you know cuz you made it sound
like I was misrepresenting you but it
sounds like no that's that's that it was
a big part of it so the thing of its
piece bill c16 right you say that I've
read through the bill I've not seen
anything that specifically relates to
compelled language you often use that
word compulsion of language I don't see
it in there that's because it was a
particularly treacherous piece of
legislation and most of what was
reprehensible about it was hidden in the
surrounding documentation mostly on the
Ontario Human Rights Commission website
the
government announced publicly before
they took the link down that the bill
would be interpreted in light of the
documentation on the Ontario Human
Rights Commission which clearly made it
grounds for grounds for civil action at
least and perhaps criminal action to
misgender someone despite the lack of
any norms currently operating with
regards to the use of gender pronouns
for example and it also instantiated a
social constructionist view of gender
into Canadian law which I thought was
equally reprehensible given that the
scientific evidence is overwhelming that
a substantial part of gender differences
in biology and personality and
temperament are biologically influenced
if not determined right and I know then
we can get into sort of this biological
determinism I know it's really popular
with the alt-right and that's fear but
it sounds to me like what you just said
before we move on to more Fruma speech
and the meat of some of your other
topics you discuss it sounds to me like
you're talking about a potential
interpretation of the law provincially
but that's not what the law said and
considering that's like the catalyst for
you here's this rock star on the right
do you think that's that's a little
important I don't think that there would
have been inclusions within the law of
changes to the Criminal Code if the
intent wasn't much broader and that you
know the law was only about a paragraph
long and so the surrounding
documentation is of crucial importance
and if the federal government was
playing straight with regards to the
origin of the law and how was it going
to be interpreted they wouldn't have
taken down the link that had made the
claim quite straightforwardly that it
was going to be interpreted in light of
the Ontario Human Rights Commission's
already extent policies but you
surrounded similar legislation at the
provincial level besides it played out
exactly the way I thought it would play
out for example at Wilfred Laurier
University where a teaching assistant
was held to the had her feet held to the
Maoist flames for daring to show a video
expressing my views to a communications
class now you use that kind of language
like feet held to the Maoist flames and
then I know that you talked a lot about
polarize
don't you think that's adding to the
polarisation like you're talking about
Mao and you're invoking this idea of
fire serious communism is not a little
bits of
I don't think it's any more severe than
starting with the assumption that I'm
part of the alt-right which is a real
white supremacist organization and an an
identity politics group rightly all
right I don't say you reporter the old
one yeah you did actually you could just
rewind the tape no I mentioned that it
was popular in all right circles and you
happen to be popular in all the right
circles I happen to popular at
universities and they show you know I'm
not responsible for what those
professors say I'm just saying it's your
views would you disagree happen to
coincide with the views of a lot of the
alt-right yeah I would disagree I don't
think they agree with the alt-right at
all in fact I have some very pronounced
enemies on the alt-right and they've
come out and said exactly that because
I've said in multiple public appearances
that I'm no fan of collectivists I don't
really care if they're on the left or on
the right it's equally reprehensible as
far as I'm concerned yeah well it's just
two different ways of playing identity
politics there's a left-wing way in a
right-wing way and I'm not a favor in
favor of either of them yeah so I think
any attempt whatsoever to associate me
with the alt-right regardless of whether
you know you have an opinion that I have
followers there is merely an attempt to
shore oh great what I'm saying by
association well I don't I don't listen
that's not what I'm trying as much it is
popular these are popular and alright
circle what they do disagree what's your
evidence no you're right they do
disagree with you and largely because
you're you know Canadian that's a bit
there's a split there with American
alright and in Canada but let me go back
to what you were just talking about here
sort of you mentioned biology now let's
say that we I agree with you right
biology and it's a big determining
factor in in gender let's for the sake
of argument like gender and sex are the
same thing I'm assuming obviously
haven't really ain't familiarize
yourself with Simone de Beauvoir Butler
but that's cool so you're from a well
yeah okay familiar enough and that's
dangerous yeah well that's the danger
with a lot of people they're only
familiar enough but let's assume that
it's as correct okay and that biology
determines gender I don't think we would
disagree that transgenders have been the
victim of hate crimes and a
disproportionate rate and this is the
complication that I think a lot of a lot
of right-wingers miss they see it they
they're very reductive you know
permitting absolute freedom of speech it
silences other people's free speech
because
allows people to vote bully victims into
silence and then you have freedom of
speech if it's blanket it actually
reduces the totality of free speech
because of minorities who are afraid to
speak out is that a problem that you
agree with well there's no doubt that
speech can be misused and commonly is
the question isn't that isn't the issue
the issue is who's going to regulate it
and the the answer to that is minimal
regulation because it's such a
fundamental part of the ability to think
and orient yourself in the world and so
it's perfectly reasonable to point out
that free speech can be abused and has
been in the past but then the the Devils
in the details say well it's it's being
used to oppress minorities while also to
free them we might point out the left
wing was a tremendous advocate for free
speech right up until I would say five
or six years ago partly because people
who are oppressed need free speech above
all else to make their claims heard I
mean that's always been how it's playing
out but it's not how it's playing out
for five years I don't know what the
hell that has to do on the broader
broader scheme of things you can be sure
that any restrictions that the Left
manages to put on on free speech will
immediately be co-opted by the right so
it's an extraordinarily foolish game and
then that's and there's an issue that's
even deeper than that which is well
we've already agreed that speech can be
let's say harsh and divisive and
oppressive all of those things whose
gonna regulate it who's whose hands are
you gonna put that power in well here's
the thing I think you do this a lot in
people people on the right just a lot
where they sort of acts like this
government is as far off entity who
makes these decisions in Washington DC
listen it's us right we're word
democracy here in the United States
people vote in their representatives so
the government is us I pay my taxes I
get water that comes from my tap the
same speed as I get access to the
freeways does anyone else we do agree
when we live in a society that a
government has a certain control I mean
we don't complain about other
regulations and this is where I think we
complain about any regulation that
transgresses constitutional rights and
the right to free speech is probably the
primary right
least in the u.s. okay it's all right on
which the entire government edifice is
built and to say that you can elect
elect representatives who are going to
regulate free speech ignores the fact
completely that you don't have an
absolute democracy of a constitutional
democracy all these same rights are in
charge of what can be they're in charge
of what can be said as far as libel laws
with the press so we do have a freedom
of the press but we do have actual libel
laws there are regulations on firearms
right you don't think that you should be
able to go off and own a tank so again
these are constitutional amendments of
liable laws that go discussed those
would fall under freedom of the press
the First Amendment with freedom of
speech why I think the restrictions that
are placed on free speech are already
plenty sufficient and to extend to any
degrees is a very big mistake and
besides there's a huge difference with
regards to compelled speech I should
point out that the your American Supreme
Court the 1940s made compelled speech
unconstitutional so Canada passed a law
that would be clearly unconstitutional
in the United States it was also a law
passed at the federal and provincial
level because it compelled speech that
had absolutely no precedent in English
common law because there's a difference
between saying what people can't say
so that's libel and saying what they
have to say which is compelled speech
and the Supreme Court said very
explicitly in the United States that it
was a mistake
both both on the part of restricting the
speaker and restricting the listener to
compel people to utter words with which
they did not agree now there's certain
exceptions for commercial law but there
are no exceptions in non-commercial
speech and so to bring in libel law and
that sort of thing is complete red
herring well I want to be sure because
you just mentioned red herring Harriet
you say so you're I want to make clear I
understand your problem is with
compelled speech then correct not saying
what you can't say about forcing people
what as to what they absolutely no fan
whatsoever of hate speech legislation
but that's which is which is I suppose
the logical extension of laws attempting
to restrict what you can't say right so
I think hate speech laws are dreadful
and I think they're being misused all
the time and that we've only seen the
beginning of that but the issue of
compelled speech is worse than the issue
of regulating hate speech because it it
requires people to utter words that they
did not formulate and may not believe so
it violates freedom of
conscience it violates the
responsibilities that each individual
has to only say things they believe to
be true and representative of their
viewpoint it interferes with their
ability to think and communicate and it
makes them terrified of of potential
potentially terrified of government and
other organizational intervention people
are terrified right now because the
First Amendment was written long before
social media and Facebook and so now the
speech is very invasive a used tool to
turn it off now you can't we'll come
back to that because I know we have a
lot of topics to get into and you know
as in your words you're not just now to
get a free speech with the sort of we're
meaning intersects with responsibilities
you just brought up hate speech laws so
I think it's a good transition that
Jordan do you support equality it's a
that's a trick it's a trick questions
how about you specify it a little bit
more clearly before I answer that okay
do you support equality of race gender
sexual orientation same same objection
applies define equality the quality of
opportunity for sure the quality
fragment at least again it's it's in
sufficiently defined question okay
quality treatment all right quality
opportunity for sure I think that any
any bureaucratic structure that's set up
that doesn't allow each person to be
assessed on the basis of their merits in
relationship to a particular function
like a job yeah is it is a big mistake
for everyone involved including the
individuals that are unreasonably
discriminated against so sounds like it
sounds like a long way around to say to
say no let me ask you this you've spoken
out against the problem of free speech
in regards to speakers specifically on
campus universities people being
censored on social media let me don't
see that is it's not even a question
like of speakers for example on campus
is it a question of free speech at all
is I'm not just a private entity
refusing to serve an individual whose
message they don't agree with not
hosting them well it's certainly not the
case in Canada because the universities
are public and it's all that's also the
case in many universities in the United
States so and then with regards to the
private and entities I suppose it
depends on why they're doing it and
under what pressure they are operating I
mean a typical trick now is to
is to to charge the the the individuals
who are coming to campus outrageous
security fees to prevent them from being
able to speak so there's plenty of what
would you call it there's there's plenty
of lack of fair play at work in those
sorts of situations so your and I think
universities above all should should be
cautious about restricting who's allowed
to speak on campus for ideological
reasons oh I agree I think they should
be super careful so I want to make sure
that you're so you only have a problem
not with private universities but public
university I didn't say I didn't have a
problem with private universities it's
clearly it's clearly the problem with
public universities doing it with
private universities there is that
additional element that you just
described okay so would you compel
public universities to host speakers I
disagree with define compel force them
to host speakers they disagree with I
would encourage them to leave speakers
alone if student organizations invite
them onto campus then the university
should do what it can to keep ideology
out of the picture and to allow them to
speak right so public university is
saying OK for us Jordan Peterson is
aligned because you know because of his
misgendering of people and his
anti-trans sort of speak or some of his
his whatever you want to use a
homophobic anti left-wing rhetoric and
then another universal that's a typical
example of exactly why it's very
dangerous to let ideologues determine
where the free speech line is drawn
because you know in formulating that
question you used a whole string of
unwarranted epithets that you drew from
very badly conducted press interviews to
characterize my viewpoints and so just
by formulating the question the way you
did you indicated how terribly dangerous
it is to allow Committees of video logs
to determine who should be able to allow
you should be allowed to speak and on
what topic well let me ask you this then
um first off you're you're saying you
don't see yourself as having spoken any
anti-transgender rhetoric at all no
really there's nothing to do with
transgender it has nothing to do with
transgender individuals it
to do with compelled speech okay started
it happened to involve a bill that
involved transgender people was Maura
and I would say an accident that was the
okay that was the issue that brought
although there's no hard evidence to
support Warren's claim of Native
American ancestry she has cited family
lore and not just a stray remarks about
her cheekbones like that could be in the
onion that literally could be in the
onion all right this is a special
episode here if I have to be mover here
because you can tell the microphone
assist is it a different don't don't
don't cut to it yet there I get it's in
a different position because we have a
live guest in studio a good friend of
mine actually you know I'm on YouTube
how the world works he wrote the book
was it enroll responsibly please and
earlier please enroll response them
because he's a polite little Jewish boy
and also U of M legal scholar Lee Doran
thank you sir for being back in the
program thank you for having me well you
haven't been doing the political thing a
lot lately I have not I used to be very
involved and doing those critique
fact-checking videos and kind of took a
little break this is true and it's and
he emailed me out of the blue just with
I think it might have was at 50
Washington Post fact checks from you and
you were like we might have to whittle
this down but he what was the what
spawned you just decide I read I read
The Washington Post fact-checking on a
Donald Trump speech that he gave in
Montana yeah and they said 76% of his
claims are false so I'm like well that's
a lot let me actually look at what they
did and they reviewed 97 of his claims
and they were wrong on a significant
number of their pet chicken right yeah
but okay but see now I'm not hearing the
passion I did in the phone call when you
called me you were pretty pissed it was
one of the worst fact-checking I've ever
seen and this is one thing I think
what's really important so we're going
to go through 12 today 12 of I I guess
probably the most egregious examples of
the fact check and yes sometimes it's
not just so much factoring you'll see
it's just sort of they decide to
fact-check frivolities which really
don't matter and that again lends itself
to the narrative i think what's
important is Facebook Twitter YouTube
along with the Southern Poverty Law
Center they hold these people out of the
arbiters of truth snopes politifact
washington post right it's no PolitiFact
has a meter washington who is yeah
Tokyo's the Washington Post has the
Pinocchio Pinocchio okay that's right so
um that's what's important is people
rely on them for truth and like you you
were saying just before we started
recording it it's not so much that they
they told half-truths or outright lied
it
that they felt so comfortable yeah and
they've essentially anointed themselves
you know the arbiters of truth and I
think a lot of times that you know you
may differ a little bit on this but I
think a lot of times they're
fact-checking things that they don't do
all the work on or they're not
completely competent to talk about and
then they just make a declaration that
oh four Pinocchios or pants on fire and
they know that people are not going to
actually take the time to read their
analysis yeah and those type of
headlines is what makes the news I don't
think you're wrong but you know it's a
50/50 shot if you hire someone
incompetent why wouldn't any why
wouldn't these people be incompetent and
give us one every now and then why are
they incompetent and it always stacks up
against Donald Trump or conservatives
and that's best that's true I think Adam
Carolla has made this point before that
you know if you expected someone to deal
with change you know back and forth
you'd expect to win about 50% of the
time like they were always messing up
but it seems to always be in their favor
and so that does eventually is as you'll
go through these these fact checks it's
it's pretty bad this one okay all right
so let's go through a few of these we'll
just start with your one that you sent
that I thought was pretty funny so to
keep to make this clear these were fact
checks from Washington Post regarding
statements Donald Trump made and then we
are fact-checking there fact checks
exactly it's like the inception of
fact-checking yeah
so first we'll give you the quote that
Donald Trump gave and then the claim so
the quote from Donald Trump on this one
was yes jawed test you voted for liberal
Obama judges who tried to take away your
second embed bend Washington Post
claimed this misleading right they said
it's not clear which judges Trump was
referring to but tester has an a-minus
rating from the National Rifle
Association his website states as a gun
owner john has voted against legislation
that would violate Montana and Second
Amendment rights and here he goes so
this is something they claim that it is
misleading but it's wrong what's the
truth here what Trump said is 100% true
okay Jon Tester appointed justice
Sotomayor right period it doesn't matter
what his opinion is what Jon Tester
was voted on by the NRA the question is
his judgment for justice Sotomayor right
and justice Sotomayor basically does not
believe that you have an individual
right to own a gun on a handgun and we
know this because in the Chicago versus
McDonald case all right down over the
Chicago case right where Chicago banned
a man from buying a handgun it was
illegal and
she said that this the states have a
right to basically ban a person from
owning a handgun now the Washington Post
what they actually go into this they say
well she was also in the dissent in a
later case in 2016
known as Voisine mm-hmm was een did not
go into the constitutional issues of the
Second Amendment no and they said she
was on the Descent with Justice Thomas I
actually read the case she said
specifically she did not agree with
Justice Thomas on we've covered a lot
too obviously Heller versus DC yeah talk
about the dissenting opinions we said
listen legally the dissenting opinion
here is there is no private right to
firearm ownership at all it's not okay
maybe not assault weapons it's not a ban
on magazines if you look at hella versus
DC you look at the dissent it really
draws a clear line legally that's what
the dissenting judges were saying there
and it's similar obviously a different
case but it's it's the same opinion so
they're fact-checking him for basically
not liking someone are using words they
don't like but like you said the nra
writing could not be less relevant if
you don't believe in the private right
to firearm on and they tried to obscure
the facts here because in 2008 is when
the Heller decision was in 2009 is when
Sotomayor was brought in the courts
let's say oh we don't know what she
thinks on this right well the Chicago
decision came out the year afterwards
and she literally brought Justice Breyer
gave the dissent and he referred back to
the Heller case she said was wrong
yeah we don't have an individual right
to own a handgun and she sided with him
on that case yeah so unless the
Washington Post wants to argue with a
straight face that banning someone from
owning a handgun is not taking away your
Second Amendment rights
I don't know what the heck they're
talking about I don't know either it
sounds like wordplay to me alright well
go on to number two
this is from the donald donald trump
quote we've said the suburbs and even
though we got a little surprised vote
that evening you all remember that
evening somebody came in with a thumbs
down after camp a date for years that he
was going to repeal and replace and he
was talking of course about john mccain
and washington post their claim was that
this statement is mostly false what they
wrote as Trump is referring to Senator
John McCain but complained McCain
complained about the bill had not gone
through right give us the truth on this
they bait he's talking about John McCain
and they say he's wrong his exact quote
about John McCain John McCain ran
against Ann Kirkpatrick
okay he has if you go to his YouTube
channel you can see tons of his attack
videos against Obama care about his need
to repeal Obamacare against Anne
Kirkpatrick that she's going to support
Obama
he ran on repealing Obamacare then at
the eleventh hour he comes in and goes I
have some procedural problems on
repealing Obamacare and at the last
minute when everyone assumed he was
gonna you know support right repealing
it comes in does the thumb down everyone
goes over shocked yeah and Washington
Post says Trump is wrong here I don't
know what where they're getting this
from well you know it's funny that if
John McCain had ever won the election
they'd be doing the exact same thing
with McCain it doesn't matter how
moderate you are no it's like well I'm
like hey why couldn't we have a McCain
the Republican Party now it's become
crazy they did the same thing with John
McCain yeah it was a war Hawk he was out
of his mind he was crazy he was losing
as much the actuary tables of something
that Matt Damon brought up he was likely
to die then all of a sudden they're
supporting Bernie Sanders so it is
important to note I think to the
historical context where now they come
to the aid of John McCain to try and
attack Donald they would do the exact
same thing back then well if you
remember prior when he ran against bush
and and it was he was always the
favorite of the media until he was a
threat to actually taking away their
power from our Democrats and now all the
sudden he's this evil person who's gonna
you know do all these bad things in a
war Hawk and so on but when he's in the
opposition to his own party
then we need to you know say how let me
ask you this if someone who's a lawyer
he's a lawyer when they say that this is
false Donald for president Trump speaks
out of turn we both know that sometimes
he says things that you know it off use
case the truth or just make stuff up
okay if we can give you that fine but in
this case it is accurate to the letter
as to what john mccain did why do you
think they say it's misleading is that
incompetence i think i think in part
it's incompetence you're right about the
issue of it does seem a little suspect
if they're always wrong in one direction
but you know it's so specific and he's
right i I honest I almost there's almost
no response to it they're on the DL
seriousness in this particular case we
see video of John McCain putting out
attack ads and saying why he's going to
run on doing this Trump says he ran on
this and gave us a late surprise vote
and it seems like they're only focused
on that 11th hour discussion of McCain
being like I got some procedural
problems with how this is going about
your candidacy give it a thumbs down
yeah exactly and so the the fact that he
gave a late justification when he does
any more time on this Lee see this thing
he's a lawyer he'll talk about this to
the cows come home lie
that ones we can we can shock up to the
like category come on you're trying to
be sometimes like it's in comedy he said
he was right on this campaign on this
than the last minute thumbs down and I
don't know how they say miss some of
these we can go oh why are you factoring
this it's so absurd and we'll get to a
few of those yeah but there are a few
clear-cut examples where he is so on the
right and that's where that's where it
forces people like me who were not
President Donald Trump fans and I don't
think you were necessarily in the
primary to come to his defense because
of the constant attacks when there's so
unwarned what what drives me crazy is he
does kind of extend what the truth is
all the time
and I think it's partly because he's
kind of a you know binary person it's
either good or bad and so rather than
getting a specific number right he'll if
it's going up he'll say it's the
greatest thing ever if it's going down
it's the worst thing ever right and so
when he's off by quite a bit because
isn't really care about the individual
numbers felt fat check everything he
says well he's in the same with John
McCain like John McCain's great oh my
god jabba Kate sucks you know he just
goes right back and forth by the two by
the way you appreciate it I am the
Walter away from you yeah thank you it's
not loaded for people who who know thank
you fantastic sponsor we appreciate you
author okay since the election we've
created in wealth seven trillion dollars
in Washington Post claim this is
misleading this appears to be based on
the performance of the Russell 3000
index since Trump's inauguration this
index includes nearly 98 percent of US
stocks but the market capitalization of
the top US companies is not a good
indicator of wealth gains for the
general type that's out you hear hopper
he's mad that you're not petting him
right now Justin just in case you were
wondering this is this is an on-air
unedited just two guys in a studio so
what what's the truth about Donald
Trump's statement there about wealth
creation if you listen to their analysis
they basically admit what he said is
true we created that we created that
amount of wealth and you might say I
mean even when Trump ran I think in you
know against Hillary said that the stock
market was a bubble or whatever he said
doesn't matter if you're saying the
wealth is created which it was he might
be off by point one I think if they want
to get him on the point one they can get
him on the point one but it was created
and period the statement from the from
the start of that sentence to the end of
the sentence is accurate right well
what's funny is is they try to argue
that's nuanced or even when you came to
me and you said okay I want to provide
context of these answers I was gonna law
second before we get into context let's
just go boom the truth because people
need to hear if it's true or not and
then you provide the context and I think
that's a big difference between the left
and the right the
always wants to deal in context and then
not really provide a definitive
statement whereas you do provide a
definitive statement sometimes of the
lawyer you provide the context first I
believe in providing a definitive
statement first and then the context
good example here might be okay let's
say I say I give you ten dollars and I
say I gave him ten dollars and you say
well yeah but I was taxed and I only had
six dollars left wopo can come out and
say well he didn't get sick he didn't
get ten dollars that's what they're
doing here I gave you ten dollars
but you didn't get ten dollars at the
end of the day and so they claim that
he's a liar yeah well they're claiming
that this the stock market isn't a good
indicator of the country's wealth but
he's pointing out that we created X
amount of wealth which we did right
since he's been in office now you can
argue whether the result of him or not
and this is the thing that bothers me
the most they have ways that they could
actually provide analysis back and forth
about a legitimate debate on policy and
they don't do that they come out and say
pants on fire and then they give garbage
analysis well they use those indicators
under Obama - it's well yeah if that
happened under Obama that's why they
didn't include the job participation
right so they use different indicators
when it's convenient the truth is the
number that he what we're not trying to
get into his not not make an argument at
all his policies are right not making an
argument that even the way he's framed
these things are necessarily correct but
that his statement in and of itself
which is what they're analyzing was
truthful yes okay here's another one
that they thought was really necessary
effect so he said and I didn't pay 1.8
billion by the way in cash we paid
nothing Washington Post claimed that
this was misleading this was Trump
comparing his dealings with North Korea
to Obama's dealings with Iran this is
from Washington Post the money in
question which is actually 1.7 billion
was iran's all along and was sent by the
Obama administration has settled
decades-old claim and he when they go on
they provide a little bit more context
but as to the claim itself where he said
I didn't pay 1.8 billion by the way in
cash we paid nothing that's true I mean
that's what drives me crazy from start
to finish the claim is true he did not
pay money for the hostages now the
context behind that and and there's
there so this is what drives me nuts
there's some truth to the way Washington
Post could have responded to this but it
shouldn't be part of this fact check
because from start to finish it's true
we basically had a there the Iran's
money frozen from a arms-dealing we had
before they took our hostages in the 70s
right and we kept that money didn't
arms you said you took our hostages
we're keeping the money and it's been
going through litigation for decades
right and now Obama administration says
ok we're gonna settle this because we
might lose in this international
tribunal and so now we're gonna give you
the money you make it ran sound like
it's mattress girl but yes very much and
they said ok we're gonna give you this
money and on a settlement and and then
they dropped four hundred billion
dollars and million dollars in cash yeah
airdrop too because for the left who do
they deal so much in nuance right they
don't explain any of the nuance they
just say it was rands all along to begin
with like well hold on a second why was
that in dispute could it be hostages
could there be a long-standing crisis
and negotiate they just say it was rands
all along and then go on to talk about
how the nuance of president Ahnold
Trump's statement is wrong this this
statement itself doesn't you could fact
check their fact-checking of the
fact-checking and get into the nuance
and talk about why they're wrong and why
it wasn't arranged all along it they
could actually do a good service and
actually provide some context and
analysis of that where that 1.8 trillion
dollars
I mean billion dollars comes from yeah
um it's hard to yeah exactly
exactly but they don't and what was what
was crazy is and what Trump was
referring to as we air dropped 400
million of that literally into Iran the
same day the hostage came out and they
go it's a coincidence it has nothing to
do right there's nothing to do with the
fact of the deal in fact we agreed to
give them the 1.8 a while back and so
yeah I don't people start watching paint
dry and Lou of this but that is an
important clip okay here's another one
where he says referring to of course
Hillary Clinton we need to provide the
context everybody but this is part of
the big umbrella was at 76% at which had
the number of yeah of Donald Trump
statements are untrue so let us know
what you think what percentage of
statements from Donald Trump are are
true or untrue what percentage of those
would you file under pivotal issues
would you file under non negotiables
closed handed issues versus I don't know
he gets pissed off because the Cowboys
lost the Super Bowl or something okay
comment below so this claim time a
Hillary Clinton she gets special
did you develop the cleft and the
jawline from years of badassery or did
you just come out of the womb
with this oh i got issued that once i
joined these
just give you a buzz cut like a kiss
from a badass angel
really excited to have our next guest on
because uh his book is actually a book
we handed out as a handbook here at
lotto with crowder for people and new
hires it is extreme ownership
he's one of the co-authors of this uh he
also has the jocko
podcast at jacopodcast.com you can
follow him at jocko willink
retired lieutenant navy seal more medals
than we can mention brazilian jiu jitsu
black belt
also founder i want to make sure i get
this right echelon
echelon front front front leadership
firm consulting firm he does so much
it's incredible but this book is
something that's really been uh pivotal
to this team
jacob thank you for being on the show
sir thanks for having me on
i well i'm very glad to have you on
you're an intimidating character so i
hope this goes well and i get on your
good side
um for those who haven't yet read the
book yet to be determined
yes to be determined and usually it
doesn't bode well for me
um for those who haven't yet read the
book uh meaning people not in a lot of
crowded company and i highly recommend
it can you can can you help them
understand define what extreme ownership
means
yeah so extreme ownership is the
attitude
it's the mindset that you're not going
to blame anyone else or anything else
when something goes wrong you're
actually going to take
ownership of whatever that problem is
and you're going to get that problem
fixed
and i know it sounds relatively simple
but it's actually pretty hard for people
to do
so why do you think it is hard for
people to do like what would be some
prime examples of that for people you
know
not the navy seal crowd more so the
stay-at-home crowd
well one of the hardest things about
taking ownership
when things go wrong is you have an ego
and you don't want to admit that
something is your fault and what you'd
rather do
as a human being is just blame other
people or blame the circumstances or
blame the market
or blame anything else yeah and when
when all you do is sit around and blame
other people and other things then guess
what that problem doesn't go away
it just usually gets worse right so
that's the that's the idea of extreme
ownership there's something going wrong
i'm going to take ownership it's my
responsibility i'm gonna get it fixed
and even the truth is and i think you
talk about this in the book sometimes it
is somebody else's fault but it doesn't
help you because you can't control them
and you talk about ego quite a bit and
funny thing is i i actually came to know
you
through some interviews about brazilian
jiu jitsu i don't know how i stumbled
across you but you were talking about
sort of combat arts
versus some of the uh i guess shall we
say less effective martial arts but it
was very respectful but i could read
between the lines
um you talk quite a bit about ego when
you discuss the combat sports side and
we've had
joe rogan on daniel cormier just last
week
tim kennedy they talk a lot about how
ego clouds it destroys can you
define that a little more clearly for
people who may not know when you're
talking about ego and how to avoid that
specifically
yeah well the problem with ego is if
you've got a big ego
and and i'm not talking about having no
ego because if you have ego if you're
daniel cormier
you got to think that you're going to be
the champion you've got to think you
have to believe that you can make it
happen
but you have to counter that with some
level of humility
where you say you know what i'm not the
best in the world i'm the the person
that i'm gonna be fighting
is gonna be awesome and i've gotta be at
my best game so what does that
mean that means i have to train hard
that
i means to do everything in my power to
be ready for this fight if people lack
humility
then they say oh i don't need to train
hard because i'll be able to i'll be
able to beat this guy anyways and then
guess what they get beat
yeah it happens all the time we had
george champion the show and he talked
about how he was terrified before every
fight and daniel cormier said that in
his mind
he was going through excuses right
before miocic of why he should lose that
fight you know
he's 255 pounds i'm really a
middleweight he said that he was very
candid on the show
which is something else that i noticed
with really successful people having
been blessed enough to interview people
at the top of their field
once they get there they tend to be
candid you have the exceptions to the
rule
but they tend to be transparent because
i don't know that they have a lot of
time
not to be um let me ask you this how do
you differentiate then this is a tough
question we've talked about this on the
program
how to differentiate between ego and a
realistic assessment of your abilities
particularly if you have abilities that
are greater than average
well i'll tell you right now most people
that are that end up in a position where
they're greater than average
they're not sitting around saying oh i'm
the bra i'm the greatest in the world
they're like daniel cormier saying you
know what i could i could lose this
fight they're like george st
pierre paranoid and scared before every
fight the guys that think they're just
gonna win every single fight
they're they're they're the ones that
end up getting caught earlier in their
career and even somebody that comes
across
as having a massive ego like like conor
mcgregor
if you watch how conor mcgregor uh
actually trains yeah he's training
like he wants to be the best he knows
he's got weaknesses
in his game and he steps up to cover
those weaknesses yeah there's a
difference between
selling fights and you know your
lifestyle uh
let me ask you this where do you think
the line is between you kind of
mentioned like george st
pierre fear almost a little bit of
paranoia where's the line especially as
someone who's in the military
and obviously you're afraid when you're
going into a firefight and you could die
where's the line between fear paranoia
and using it so it's productive
so there's there's definitely a
difference between fear and respect
and i i wasn't afraid of the enemy but i
respected the enemy and i realized that
they could do some things that could
surprise us and catch us off guard
and that's something you have to deal
with if you don't respect the enemy
which i guess you know if you're not
afraid of the enemy at all if you don't
if you just think you can dominate the
enemy
well then you start cutting quarters you
don't train as hard you don't prepare as
much when you do that you're going to
lose
yeah you see that with almost every
great fighter right the tail end of
their career isn't usually their age
you look at guys like mike tyson the
tail end of their careers usually they
just they get complacent
um i think a lot of people miss it they
think oh he got old and you look at me
like well actually
he was 35 he was 35 at this point not
mike tyson specifically but it happens a
lot and they just get to you know get to
a point it's i think it was jeff danaher
who said
it's hard to get out of bed at six in
the morning when you're getting out of
silk sheets
i'm like oh okay that that sort of
crystallizes that perfectly
um now the same thing happens to
businesses too you know businesses that
you know because we work with businesses
all the time and
as the business grows and they start to
feel like oh
we're going to crush the competition the
competition can't touch us and then the
next thing you know there's someone
that's younger some business than some
company that's smaller and they're
younger and they're hungrier
and they're working their tails off yeah
if you're sitting on the top of the hill
you don't think you need to work anymore
next thing you know you're getting eaten
yeah it's it's a good point it's
happened right now with late night you
know great example you've seen these
late night wars and people become so
complacent just take their audience for
granted
and then all of a sudden it fractures
and uh we draft in right behind them we
have no business doing it but
we're doing okay and i think that's
actually a big difference between a job
in the military and employees who often
might read this book in the civilian
workforce is um the ability
to ignore something if it's not on your
item list right you see that a lot if
it's not my job description well
it's not my fault whereas in special
forces in the military if you do that
you
you could die and i know you talk about
primarily leading by example
and taking active ownership and
consequences with action so how do you
balance
leading by example what you're talking
about taking extreme ownership
um being assertive with hierarchy and
respecting leadership because the two
are both they're both important
yeah they're both important and for one
thing you know when people talk about
the military and you think oh
well i was in the seal team so every
seal is just we're gonna take ownership
of everything and and
they're going to they're never going to
say that's not my job and that's
actually wrong
it's wrong across every group of human
beings in the world
they're all human beings first and
foremost and there's people that are
you know in the seal teams in special
operations in the military in general
there's a bell curve and there's some
people at the high end of the bell curve
that work really hard and are really
gifted
and they go out and kick ass and there's
some people at the bottom of the bell
curve and
they're trying to skate by and see what
they can get away with and then there's
a bunch of people in the middle
in various various degrees that that
fall out somewhere on that spectrum
so even in the military it's not like oh
you just do what i tell you that's what
you need to do is just do what i tell
you
um there's there's just they're people
and so whether you're in the military or
whether you're in the civilian sector
you've got to as a leader you've got to
recognize that you're going to have some
people that are going to be going really
hard and it's great to have
those people but there's also going to
be some people that are going to have to
drag along a little bit
and obviously there's some people that
you have to drag along so much that you
can't drag them along anymore and
they're starting to drag you backwards
and when that happens in the civilian
sector that means you know you're
probably going to have to
get rid of them in the military it means
you're going to have to get rid of them
this is actor of course as a leader
you've done everything you can to try
and coach them and try and mentor them
and try and get them up to speed
so you know leadership is leadership
regardless of where you are whether
you're in the military working with an
elite group or whether you're in the
civilian sector
it's leadership principles stay the same
yeah that's a good point and um
i think that's actually a really
important point i had a friend who was
in the marines and obviously some
friends
were in the uh the army rangers and they
said yeah you know it's it's not exactly
what you think it does we're not a
monolith and one of them actually told
me who was a i think a former
navy seat from a long time ago and he
said back then he said we didn't spend
much time on hand i can't hand combat
everyone thinks i can kill you five ways
to sunday he said
i learned taekwondo with a 50 pound
backpack he's like i didn't learn how to
fight i learned how to shoot
and i appreciate it again that kander
was oh okay and then afterwards it
became a brazilian jitsu black belt
after the military
um early on in the book you detail um
a story from iraq in which friendly fire
occurred
tough story to read about for people who
end up reading the book highly recommend
it again it's called
extreme ownership i think it's available
everywhere books are sold and probably
audiobook
uh i don't know if we can get andrew
clavin to do an audio book on that that
would be
it would be soothing it would it would
just smooth over the rough parts but as
i did i did the i did the audiobook
myself and late baby we did the
audiobook so
i i assume that you did but the really
intense parts andrew clavin has a voice
that's just
it would make it sound soothing enemy
fire and you're like oh wow this isn't
so it doesn't sound half bad
so this was a friendly friendly fire
incident and as a commander in charge
you did something that a lot of people
wouldn't
um you came forward and took full
responsibility
for the situation which to me was very
striking why'd you do that jacko
well it was it was a tough thing it was
a tough thing to come to as a tough
thought in my head and as i talked about
in the book
as i was trying to you know this
horrible situation took place there was
all kinds of people to blame whether
they were
some of my guys some of the soldiers
marines we were working with whether it
was the iraqi soldiers we were working
with we were all working together
and there was plenty of mistakes that
were made and it was definitely
a situation where i could have pointed
the finger at at many different people
and many different
mistakes that were made and as i went
through this because you know my
commanding officer they're doing an
investigation they're trying to figure
out who they're going to blame
right and as as i'm sitting there trying
to figure out who i'm going to blame and
who i'm going to tell my boss oh
you know is this guy's fault i i
couldn't
figure out i couldn't figure out who i
should be blaming for this and there's a
reason why i couldn't figure out who to
blame
because as i sat there and grilled over
in my mind i realized that there was
one person and one person only to blame
and that person was me i was the
commander
i'm over all in charge of the mission
and
if something isn't done right that's my
fault it's my responsibility
and that's what i did i went in before
my commanding officer and before my
troops and said
hey guys this was my fault and and
here's the important part
or the other important part is this is
my fault and this is what i'm going to
do to fix it
so a lot of people once they read the
book they say well if i take if i take
ownership of something then it just
disappears but and that's not true
either but if you say
yeah that was my fault and then everyone
was like oh okay great it was his fault
now we can move on
no actually that doesn't fix the problem
right you have to actually take
ownership of the problem then you have
to take ownership of figuring out what
the solution is
then you have to take ownership of
implementing the solution so the problem
doesn't occur again
so it's it's not as easy as taking
extreme ownership but the first step
is definitely a challenging one and
again goes back to ego
for me i had been in for you know 15 or
16 years at the time
and you know i had a good reputation as
a seal and i've done a good job
and i've been to combat and all of a
sudden i'm saying hey this horrible
thing happened which
in my opinion a fracture side a friendly
fire incident is about the worst thing
you can have happen
and for me it was a real blow to my ego
to step up and say hey this was my fault
i'm not going to blame anyone else but
at the same
and there's one piece of it where in
in in a leader's mind they think oh well
if i take the blame for this everyone's
going to look down on me and they're
going to lose respect for me right
but the the opposite is actually true
when a leader says hey look
here's what i did wrong these are the
mistakes i made and this is what i'm
going to do to fix it
people actually gain respect for you
because they really realize that you're
not going to shirk your responsibilities
well i think maybe that brings us back
to a point you were talking about before
were there some people who might need a
little bit of of prodding along dragging
along
and there are some people who you just
can't drag necessarily anymore so i
think at that point the people who can
be
developed they'll respect you more but
like you said the people who might just
have to be let go regardless
it may fall on deaf ears and that's a
skill in leadership that you also have
to be able to determine you know the
people whose minds you can change the
people who you can lead and
I live most of my life out on YouTube
with only a little channel handful of
subscribers mmm
I reckon they didn't like me on the
platform long bit back then it was
mostly just me uploading short videos
and me talking to my camera hmm ain't
had nothing but a bed see the camera
come for the microphones down there well
back then the Young Turks used to make
like a better sport of me they teased me
quite a bit I got to the point where I
could feed hopper cheese and biscuits
four times a week but mostly I just sat
out there making videos on my channel
well one night I was doing much nothing
just tearing that to youtube mm-hmm
searching on a preggers u video for the
Electoral College all I could find was a
nerd trying to make up tutorials and my
suggested food so I logged into my
YouTube account to see what was wrong
with it
turned out that was video didn't put in
restricted
I haven't been unsubscribed from the
ladder was crowded my favorite channel
mmm I had to reach subscribe quite a bit
but even when I did I didn't receive no
notifications and had to hit the bell
three times
mm-hmm but then I ain't see nothing but
Trevor nobody owes my suggested feed
then I just seen reading I hired myself
a higher facing lawyer some people think
he's a Mexican he's higher face mmm-hmm
got Holman little shake ties and here to
stick out straight I decide of his here
don't matter how he could it I reckon
you just buff out like that Dyke his
pitching because he's out of fun and
whatnot
hmm but I had my little build area go on
in that talk with YouTube with top
lawyers and partly with theme about our
question don't my channel but they
didn't answer nowhere to not the
restrictions he monetization
they just kept asking that to spend more
money on advertising and screaming
what'd you do bang for what you
do Bane fur mmm
I reckon that made me madder than the
whole notification business I had bill
Richman he's out fighting some people
think he's half Mexican he's half asian
I had him walk right on into Sue's
muddies Keys office at YouTube sure
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
mother-in-law to wedding sorry dad I see
it is that's it not only father's but
uncles and grant let's take at a wedding
there's some don't trust the uncles to
do that do not trust the uncles it's
alcohol you don't know it's not it no
it's not
I have teetotaling relatives huh for me
it's the alcohol open bars as well for
you it's always the alcohol all right we
have great guests today we have Nicole
Arbour on boom we have Dinesh D'Souza on
she's pretty we were going have already
lying on but uh well it didn't work out
we have them on we love art we're gonna
have them on next week obviously this
comes as no surprise
so that'll that'll probably be a
pre-taped and this this was a pre tape
with Nicole Arbour because of boobs
butts sling my what because a sling mud
club all right listen before we move on
first up question of the day have you
found that debate because we'll be
getting into this a clip from the rebel
which i think is emblematic of how the
left debates have you found that
debating with progressives has become
easier and easier thanks to the talking
points now becoming so predictable and a
follow up put a percentage on it I'd
like to hear from you we often hear
about the radical left and finding the
center what percentage of today's
Democrats would you put under sort of
the classical JFK liberal versus
perpetual victim complex progressive
today give a percentage point let me
know because I think they're a
significant majority and when you're a
majority you're no longer radical fringe
as it relates to the progressive wing
all right producer these main videos to
do as always this charity was not a fun
Twitter not could you describe the
comments your thoughts your photoshop's
I fulfill my obligations are you good
I'm good I appreciate it and we have at
G Morgan Jr the creator look at that
picture
okay the creator of Marley R so what is
that looks like the singer from corn
maybe at Brody now Brautigan is it is
filling in here temporarily you are my
first hire actually a lot are with
CARICOM yes I have seniority
how long have so how long we work
together gods I think we said since 87
about five years yes six years yeah and
people you can send him out your stories
at Brautigan he's often the one who gets
us stories going in the morning any
happened to be in town also Cockburn is
something he said I don't like that lead
in one bit I just got out of the clink
to escape the Cockburn University
researchers have barely run out of
things to research a new study suggests
that people are racist against black
household robots what comes from
spectrum Wally I guess as a website the
findings of a new study suggests that
people perceive robots with
anthropomorphic features to have race
and as a result of the same race related
prejudices is a prejudice robots well
you know what maybe if they weren't so
lippy let's say my Google Home has a
race but it refuses to play any other
Jimmy Buffett that's it there how many
times I ask for killer Mike it's a race
if it's just Margaritaville on an aloof
the race is college dropout and yeah you
know point about this product up and
kill us one day yeah yeah the t2 thing
for you right there it is I don't if
action listen that was my favorite
movies a kid don't turning our attention
to Hollywood Ryan Reynolds attached to a
revision of the film home alone this was
called stoned alone sending around you
guessed at a pothead though actually it
seems the title might need to be renamed
as to not confuse it with the Saudi
Arabian holiday called classic
wearing a woman drove by herself there
is at least a cross between baby driver
and not without my daughter and and
stoning of sir I am yes all about it's
fun for the whole family such an
advanced culture so the film centers
around a twenty-something weed-growing
loser who misses the plane for his
holiday ski trip first answer the
casting call was macaulay culkin because
he does that thanks there's look at look
at there's no way michael jackson did
not have something no no you got a piece
he touched him in a way that he will
never ever since home alone i've been
preparing for this role
ready yeah bring me back ever since home
alone one he's been pretty was locked
into the home alone yeah remember brock
turner is anyone here cuz because i
didnt does everyone remember yeah
remember um convicted of sexual assault
for those don't know his lawyer is now
claiming that he only engaged in quote
outercourse
not intercourse what is the point of
that
well okay people this is how it's
described from People magazine the
lawyer defined outercourse as sexual
activity while clothes that can be
considered a form of safe sex way to put
a spin on it the Turner quote didn't
intend to rape the victim which to be
fair I guess we're doing the definition
of is but it isn't as bad as intercourse
which of course is sex between galaxies
and then Christopher Nolan and secured
the rights to in Sept the course which
is sex within a sex within a
walls go like this and there's rape
somewhere also known as also is a
casting call with Harvey Weinstein yes I
mean obviously you're talking about rape
so I'm not making fun of that but that's
like the dumbest thing I've ever heard
outercourse what kind of balls do you
have to have to claim that it's your
defense apparently it doesn't matter
because you're wearing jeans anyway so
it's it's irrelevant I cannot believe it
this is a transcript imagine going for
imagine going forward in a court and
Blake no no no your honor
it was out of course debt is where my
client was merely dry humping her leg
against her will simple battery like if
you were to create a sleazy lawyer who's
who will say anything
you would create this yeah this is what
he'd say yes it's attorney outercourse
does it hold water I don't know what all
I did was hump a leg the question is
like the three months that Brock was in
prison
how much out of course did he get yeah
let's see if he splits the definition
early that's Shawshank core so in a
related story a man who has no penis
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
another quote one of the women believed
she was being penetrated by his penis
[Laughter]
when it comes to the work on the force
 burns no joke detective we now have
two cases in two weeks of women being
sexually accosted sir all right
better just send the son down the
Special Victims Unit there's only one
problem sir
it's the assailant he didn't have a oh
my god that means there's only one
choice we need to bring in the Cockburn
sir with all due respect coppers too
close to this sir cappers had enough
yeah but I'll tell you in Cockburn's had
enough you may not like Cockburn you may
not like the methods you may not even
like the fact that Cockburn will push
you to your limits just to find out what
they are but my god there's no one
better for this case than Cockburn
and the only reason you're still
standing here is because you know and
you son of a sir I don't think
it's a good idea not since oh I know
about Oakland don't you think I know
about that but sir Cochran's wife was
killed by this man come over here deputy
if you want to have a job in my precinct
you keep your mouth shut about
Oakland he'll be selling cigarettes out
of a bodega on 8th and wacker between
paying a hobos playtoy so fast it'll
make your head spin do you hear me I
wouldn't call on Cockburn unless
absolutely necessary my god when you're
out there with inkless monsters roaming
these streets with no end in sight and
you need the best damn person for this
hyper specific niche Millia you thank
the sweet lord jesus that someone exists
out there like Cockburn yes commissioner
get Cockburn silver dollar
we have no choice all right you can't
make these things we have to get well no
we did we did we got a real show it's
not a real film in case you didn't know
no can you imagine him going and buying
set and inanimate objects at the adult
stores and it's like give me something
that won't raise any eyebrows or it's
not clear the stories might clarify but
those objects well what do you think it
was room it could be a plastic sword the
point is with this honestly usually if
someone is sexually costing someone he
is meeting in between you know needing
oxygen if you read this story the guy
had a very well-thought-out plan to hide
the fact that the light toys always had
to be off no one could look him in the
eye
she's like here how about this one no
that I just it's a very very bizarre
crime I'm going to safety deposit box
and give them all my coins
oh my guess it's got to be the dumbest
thing that bird always gets her man you
hear partner badge heads will never get
this real story you'll never see two gay
guys trying to pull this off I mean you
really I don't think it would work the
same yeah I don't know I guess Patrick
Stewart is not gay what a lot of people
thought he was gay with yeah I thought
he was gay he was like he still does not
convinced by hammock Ian McKellen yeah
which is funny because II McKellen seems
way less gay yeah you know very if they
were to say actually whatever for
example you know it would take for them
becoming an actual gay couple just
Patrick Stewart saying yes yeah yeah
every man
they're Hollywood's hottest couple
people get mad it's like what do you
think yeah I'm saying that men are just
so animalistic and their sexual urges
you remove one part of that equation
which is a curtain yeah yeah just yeah
gay people it's just a party of yes as
opposed to lesbian couples where it's a
party of I have a headache exactly and
that goes exactly aspirin may get the
cockscomb happy sensitive I think that
goes against like for some reasoning
guys heads we think of guys and guys and
we're like ah that's it's incredibly
gross right yes and then for some reason
the general public not me
when you think about two girls are like
it seems plausible it's too hot and
that's actually the opposite of what
happens doesn't you know that's one
thing obviously to me is oh it's just
never Mattox a people like they're like
four boobs four boobs are better than
two that's with an explanation just men
like seen breasts yes come on
sorry Madison we have a girl who works
with us now in the awareness and you
know I'm pretty sure we didn't let the
cat out of the bag all right move on to
this this comes to us from the rebel I
highly recommend that you go watch the
entire clip before that by the way hit
our notification bail because
subscriptions don't mean anything
anymore
and join my club you get this full hour
show every single day lot of clutter
calm slash mug Club in live streams if
you don't you can live some every
Thursday here on YouTube at 8:00 p.m.
Eastern anyway so this comes from the
rebel please go watch the whole video
for context I just thought it was very
good it was perfect to crystallize the
techniques the tactics I left use right
now when it comes to debating and mainly
there are five and you've heard us talk
about them but we wanted to take a video
and give you a play-by-play just in case
there were any doubt so let's go to the
first but were right away this person by
the way this is after the term to set
the context after the toronto shooting
yeah not a lot of news about this for
people who don't know it was a big
shooting I think 16 people were shot
finally wow how do you know how many
people died did it I'm not sure what
lest I heard - last I heard - okay
that's why I'd hurt - because you never
know obviously some tragedies happen but
right after that one reporter for the
rebel went and spoke about obviously the
Muslim ties so right away this lady
freaks out and goes to progressive
tactic number one before the clip the
number one technique they uses
of course accuse racism she and she just
got a clip can you please not descend
into racist things right now please what
I'm sorry what did I say that was racist
sorry this is not what Canada is about
Canada is not about racism the rebel is
a racist source of news okay I love the
fact that she started with like still on
the phone with a friend yes like I have
to pull you back I gotta go on the phone
with her friend while she has kids there
with objects that could be easily
swallowed like I'm sorry I actually I'm
actually I'm doing pseudo cool my child
please the plastic bag over his head I
think so in record time too by the way
the racism and then we know this I don't
really even need to go over as a whole
but it's a tool that's used to actually
bring you into their their number two
technique which we'll get to in a second
but first here's what's important why
did she accuse this reporter again go
watch the whole video at the rebel it's
up here on YouTube or I think rebel dot
media why'd she accuse him of being
racist here's exactly why I say anything
that was racist shooter had visited Isis
websites that is not I said CBS in the
US I said CBS in the u.s. is reporting
that okay alright and the truth is the
day that this video was being filmed CBS
was reporting that the shooter was but
by the way the Muslim shooter had
expressed interest in Isis yes
by the way Isis even took credit for it
so it doesn't sound like they were too
far off base no at least potentially
right no you never know you can't always
go by what Isis takes credit for no no
that's definitely true if anyone kills
anybody Isis like is it all count over
to yeah we know what really pisses me
off about this is if you watch it from
the beginning he's very like politely
asking questions he asked a separate
question about motive and then said hey
here's what's being reported what do you
think and this lady who is absolutely
not a part of the conversation leans in
still on the cell phone oh they're
talking about some racist stuff hold on
I gotta chime in because people think my
opinions valued yeah exactly
so she's she's a horrible human being
and this brings us to the method number
two I was talking about the next thing
that she does and we see this one okay
so let's just tell you how you have no
right to speak they just try to deny
your right to speak completely we see
her do that multiple times throughout
the video don't come here
the rebel really you need you don't need
to be here right now and this you are
not my community you can leave now you
so cold medias need to not be here based
on based on whose authority you have no
business being here with your racist
crap get your racist crap out of my
community get it out now
was that the Somali pirate from Kevin
Brown a few pounds looking for a 15
gonna be in there not the hero this
Toronto needs your Toronto belongs to me
report is gone I am the captain where I
am the dark night now where's his crack
by the way this is just not necessarily
appointment just for complete bonus
stupidity and insanity this is the kind
of argument that only the insane
rant about the rebel is a racist source
of news because we're asking people
their opinion of mass shooting and the
match what is the mass shooting have to
do with a man that busily come on
come on man have to do with a man who
you didn't finish that sentence that
sentence because the sentence makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever you put
words together to make a phrase that
confuses people who are not
it's like flip microwave toaster bagel
wait wait why that why should I have to
explain have to tell you cuz I want to
know if I need to call the EMTs if you
have a stroke racist so this brings us
example it's just to let they don't want
to deal in reality and I don't know if
she even believes what she's saying or
if she's just that stupid or if she's so
dogmatic but she doesn't realize she's
that stupid it's like the stupid liberal
chicken and egg but the chicken is at
the egg she's just following chicken
liberal Toronto mayor who instead by the
way use this exact same tragedy to
immediately pivot to gun control you've
heard me ask the question of why anybody
would need to buy 10 or 20 guns which
they can lawfully do under the present
laws and that leads to another question
we need to discuss why does anyone in
this city need to have a gun at all I
know you've been answering that
won't fully eliminate tragedies like
this but even if we can prevent one of
these incidents then in my view it is a
Scott a discussion worth having that's
also bringing some window controls from
some high-profile firms who struck on
dolly

that's called the evil villain who can't
contain himself because his plot is so
evil I want to be coming collected but
it's difficult because this show was
amazing today we have Daniel Cormier yes
one of the best athletes on the face of
the planet
right now on that you could argue
someone else but it'd be pretty hard as
far as accomplishing if you don't Gavin
McInnes on the show Wow potentially a
future Senator Richard painter on the
show hello and I'm a club film review
and Dennis Rodman Wow oh yeah before we
move on with the show question of the
day because we're going to talk it we're
gonna be kind of roast in a sacred cow
today and public school teachers can you
name me how many teachers you've had in
your life who've had a net positive
impact on your life add them all up
how many stand out because that's one
thing I think a lot of us don't talk
about when we're talking about the
teacher so sort of the dialogue the
national conversation well a second what
should matter most is how many teachers
have really helped you and I can count
them on one hand yes they taught you
that just by their it's for before so we
don't know that producing with me in
video studio as always as go2 is not a
foam and twittered not gauge you had me
touch creditor with your comments your
thoughts your photoshop's by the way
we're gonna have an art contest send
them in I fulfill my legal operations or
any conclusions we good I won't be
judging because I'm not gay I don't know
what that has to do with anything that
was a horrible stereotype that G Morgan
Jr IG Morgan Jr how are you I'm doing
well sir and in the spirit of summertime
Cakebread cellars Sauvignon Blanc oh wow
really the reason brother is because you
got a discount because the season is
over
just like back-to-school sales he does
that with liquor and computer I'm good
people I'm ready with you over lace and
yeah you can send me you can fit me I
just realize I I plugged you and then
you plugged you is it man that means I
have to fire you that means nose fan can
other news to get to we're gonna be
talking obviously about Donald Trump and
Russia that's the main story of the day
but first more important Dennis Rodman
has invited Kanye West to North Korea to
create songs for leader leaders of love
here's the actual video he tweeted to
Kanye West in its entirety because you
deserve it
what's up Kanye's d-rod here man over
there now
you know Newport Beach man thanks a lot
for that shoutout man with the jersey
man
lovely work lovely stop love your wife
here's a beautiful a man I'll talk about
something this mean you do a track
together man about world peace about
leaders of love maybe about leaders of
love
you're one I'm one let's get together
baby and do this right I don't know okay
I don't know what fur stuff they talk
about coat tailing hey Kanye West let's
do a track to get it because I think
what equals I'd be lying if I wasn't a
little bit resentful that these these
are her representatives yes be like
Kanye is taking Rodman for a street ball
but naming himself captain oh yeah
exactly I kind of want to see that
though I want to see them team up well
you have to appreciate his passion what
it was just weird to you that he you
seem to really like Kanye's wife took
like a little pause they're like why no
I mean he really likes Kanye's wife see
the next video he released hey thanks
again for the shadow you made me so
happy and I wanted to follow up I love
you so much man and you're the man and
and I love your wife man and and I was
thinking this song maybe we could do a
music video that does make me so happy
man and you could be in it and me and
Kim Jong and give your wife and oh that
makes me so happy man we can we can have
your wife dance you like it in that
video when you're like going with video
with the motorcycle and and I think it'd
be great for the American and for the
North Korean people man and she'd be
wearing like like they slip so you can
you like see up the side of it and I'd
love to have it man old motor so she'd
be backwards on that motorcycle because
me and her Wow yeah we have two whole
black guys on our side and I still feel
really uncool yes pretty much
- and if you end that up with the person
who does the rants on Facebook and carry
the one two and a half - - sorry for
Alabama police officers have now been
suspended for making a hand gesture on
local ABC in the Jasper Police
Department they were suspended for
making a hand gesture while posing for a
photo they did this little thing some
people claim the circular gesture was
racist according to the city's mayor and
here's something else too there was also
some speculation the gesture is actually
part of a children's game or did you
ever play this yeah of course you get to
you get to hit the ball of them yes yeah
and fun so when years it's not really
that surprising given the other games of
department band including Rock Paper
Scissors Red Rover
induct up Jew because of the diverse
they've had and it turns out by the way
once they found out was just handed
people have been suspended for hand
gestures before mister pretty common
Harvey Weinstein at last year's Hunger
Games premiering that didn't go nor Bill
O'Reilly's new show but really if you
fits not a hand gesture okay it's like
yelling fire in a crowded theater it's
more the action that goes with it here's
the thing best-case scenario if they
really were fired for a white power as
they caught us on the in the article a
white power gesture the black power
phase is literally part of the Twitter
brain did black lives matter so I don't
be the guy points out blatant hypocrisy
but I kind of want to play I do there's
a plain connotation with black power and
white power these are the a shade this
land whale and I say this we have to
because some this person in a bikini
walked down the streets of New York to
prove a point
Cosmo and O'Brien you know what trigger
warning and what's what's fun she said
she was expecting to be quote fat shamed
instead you know but were actually into
it shouting things like I want to suck
on them tasty toes and quote from the
article
let me butter them biscuits and by the
way cuz it's gets so much worse but I
read the article in the man's defense he
was actually yelling at the Popeyes
across the street which see when you
take him on where Ana immediately went
afterwards the family meal and two diet
cokes next week bomber actually
suppresses the fact that two diet cokes
actually cancels out the carbs yes yeah
it is science science she said I was
prepared to be point of that shame I
didn't expect to be fetishized
however count your lucky stars that
somebody was into it or Al she's also
being disingenuous because given that
she sought out and performed sets done
at the corner of Martin Luther King jr.
Malcolm X Boulevard PolitiFact actually
rated her statement a size 25 pants on
fire so that didn't go over well there's
something else do a lot of people listen
once while they do they do there's a
huge difference for tell me this between
fat pride and slightly overweight women
yeah exactly this comes off to I just
there's no good way I washed I feel
pretty with Amy Schumer bad decision my
wife said let's just watch it it's a
long night ice cream - no I just anyway
it's as bad as you would think are such
a masochist I actually didn't think I
trained I thought she could be I think
I've always said she was funny at one
point I know I'm in the minority I don't
I don't hate her I don't I think she was
very funny just not anymore
so one note but I'm sitting there
talking with my wife gonna listen every
single other woman including the extras
they're all attractive the only one
who's not as Amy Schumer men don't
expect you to be perfect so don't think
that when we when we point out someone
who's a size 25 saying this is perfect
this is we don't know for a second
it's fine to be big skinny tall short
not perfect once you say you're perfect
I'm accidentally if I carry ously living
the movie through year you ready for
stars in his head now that's what we
were saying and you said it happens on
both ends actually in one's very
acceptable yeah and one is not so we're
not making fun of this girl at all what
we're saying is hold on oh no no I as a
person when she goes out in public poses
in a bikini and people actually are into
it and she said that creeped her out
more than being fat she can't win if I
walk the streets I feel like people are
looking at me because I'm a size 36 NFL
if you look at me because they were
tricked what do you want tell us what
you want what do you what do you want
what do you do by the way this goes
either way I've had my mom my mom is a
thin woman my wife sits in a woman and
actually hurt her she comes bite
honestly both her parents nor naturally
very thin yeah they've actually the
opposite problem where they've had to go
to doctors just to increase calorie
intake skittles so it's natural it's a
lot and I've had women send them like we
we only have sizes for real women in the
store to their face is she a figment of
your imagination she's right there yeah
we we don't expect women to be perfect
but when you say you're perfect and
you're a land whale how do you make it
into the show yes okay the New York
Times by the way else is right now
reporting that Donald Trump was shown
Intel illustrating that Putin directly
ordered cyber attacks in 2016 New York
Times said it so you know it's good so
Trump's be true took to Twitter this one
of course it was fake news and he said
they were trying to quote so recklessly
hard and hate the fact that I'll
probably have a good
should shoot with Putin I'm not a Donald
Trump hater but a muzzle might not be a
bad investment every once in a while
what oh oh muzzle I thought you said
Muslim or Indonesia or by are you a year
everywhere Muslims congregate
progressive right uh but here to speak
about that more he's been pretty
passionate he's been on shows and you've
seen his political ads former chief
White House Ethics lawyer now candidate
for Richard painter thank you for being
here sir that's a not happy about what
his handling of Russia if you were to
put a finer okay so then what what's
your solution American people a dog a
dog he's trying to say don't mean you
can kiss it I don't think that's okay
that's an odd reference to make I think
is it a swamp fire just put out the fire
with its own swamp you know what we
apologize to our viewers and wish only
the best for Senator perhaps senator
painter I hope he finds what he's
looking for okay moving on with other
things it'll be wildly unpopular you
know we have a fete we've offended
although you know what the truth is we
can actually get a lot of emails from
people in comments if we want going like
yeah you know what I'm slightly big and
this doesn't offend me at all I can't
stand those people yeah they're called
called everybody else on the bell curve
they occupy all of it
you're just a curve hit the notification
bell and join my club if you people
haven't yet joined welcome it's the only
way to support this show we don't we
don't keep the lights on with YouTube
and of course livestream every every
Thursday 8 p.m. Eastern it's never
changed ok so this was an article in
Time magazine called it's the only way
these teachers are working summer jobs
to make ends meet to the violins this is
going to be a little bit of an unpopular
opinion it's time for another sacred cow
cookout
we could probably that could stand to be
improved printed where you had to take
off the edges yeah so unpopular opinion
but stay with me yeah all right
I not all teachers okay I think it's an
important job I'm not saying not the
most important job but we'll get to that
I think some teachers underpaid but I do
think that public school teachers in
particular have devolved into a
professional culture of victimhood and
ingratitude this was an article but it
read very much like a dramatic 20/20
special so that's how were going to
present it here it is well done
summer break technically started in May
18th but he works every day he wakes up
and drives to a space he's rented an
office building in Lawrence Kansas
starting a seven hour shift at around
5:00 a.m. as a transportation consultant
advising on long-distance chemical
hauling before clocking out at noon to
go spend time with his kids okay if you
weren't aware of the agenda at play here
if this would actually read like a very
mild workday Wow that's it that's
awesome this is how you lead the horror
story I haven't walked a short seven
hour shift since I was 21 years old I
was probably 16 it's been a long this
hands been forced to work the every day
9:00 to 3:00
I know it's 9:00 to 4:00 I exaggerated
with one to make a point because I think
I've earned it here it's all a far cry
from Dunn's normal routine for most of
the year he's a high school math teacher
but school's out through August and his
salary doesn't cover his four-year-olds
preschool tuition or eight-year-olds
dental expanders done must supplement
his job with an income from a summer job
okay ah time for a leftist lexicon
school's out equals vacation okay let's
be really clear about this honest summer
vacation for a reason yes and and and by
the way again we work with some people
who are teachers who actually work on
this show part-time okay brilliant
people it's not all teachers but the
ones who talk on this article pretty
damn
I've had it with you uh and summer job
or as it's interchange in this article
second job really means job for
everybody else yeah we don't get three
months off we don't get to an f-1 stuff
we don't get one month off no glad you
cleared that up for everybody also the
title it's the only way can be
substituted with this is one of a
multitude of ways but I want more money
as well as three months off so I'm going
to do it this way and then about
it and then I'm gonna protest when it's
really not about the kids it's about me
making more money for working less time
than the average children really hold on
strike that your honor does it have to
be on the record you're right I already
done deal here it goes I go the more
guns not alone in having a summer side
hustle educators are statistically
thirty percent more likely to have
second jobs than non teachers okay
that's Alexa come second job equals job
and frankly I find this number
surprising when you hire I'm horrible at
math and I caught this when you consider
the average American job is 260 plus
days per year
teachers are only contracted to work 185
days per year good gig I'm surprised
it's only 30% that means that if you I'm
not good at math hold on carry the one
70% of features don't
that's called significant they get to
have their cake and eat it three months
out of the year to the 3.1 million
public school teachers in the u.s.
earned an average of only 59 thousand
dollars during the 2016-17 school year
according to the National Education
Association labor union wait did you say
only yeah I know okay
really so this is about six thousand six
hundred dollars a month okay prorate
that to a 12 months 12 months job and
it's close to 80 thousand dollars it's
like 79 thousand dollars that's 20
thousand more to the national median
income of fifty nine thousand okay
that's median by the way not even
average that's a lot of money that's
more money than I pay my employees is
that a bad thing
it is a terrible thing make the work
every day of the year except for you
know if you think about that this is not
to to to I'm not trying to tar and
feather all teachers this is one of
those subjects I think people are
getting a little bit tired of it
yes you can't it's the most important
job how about neurosurgeon is that in
there somewhere
PR doctor perhaps and we're just saying
all teachers listen you taught social
studies right okay you did creaking
that's not exactly your fame is
economically this is Frizzle no exactly
well and one of the reasons we bring
this up is because you guys go on strike
all the time for very obvious reasons
you want to get paid more money and
you're in a teachers union that then
lobbies the government to set your pay
well by the way politically we'll talk
about big money and Koch brothers not
even close
should be it should be illegal and you
you cry to us every single time it's
about the kids it's about the kids and
for most of you are a lot of you I don't
know the number it's about kids but when
you're out there asking for a 20% raise
like in Arizona we haven't been there
yet to it sorry I have to step on
something you got foreshadowing back to
2020 it's also expensive to work in
education 94% of US public school
teachers report paying out of pocket for
supplies spending an average of four
hundred and seventy nine dollars a year
again I'm horrible at math are you
serious
that's $40 less than an intern pays out
of pocket for a smart phone she had to
buy Crayolas on her own dime
I have 20 care Mountain receipts I just
have never turned in because I'm how
about we just pay them five hundred
dollars a year less and give that money
you're talking to a 20-year-old
gay mexican from texas so
get that straight and then she
immediately said okay well i'm sorry for
assuming
and i said okay well then again you you
assumed
all right time for bonus footage from
the latest change my mind that we taped
in austin you've seen some of the
conversations some of the
the heated debates uh but you haven't
seen this this just happened organically
we've noticed that when we show up and
do change my minds our location of
course gets posted and fans show up
and there's a really diverse intersect
of people and one trend we've really
noticed
is that there are a lot more gay
conservatives specifically
gay conservatives willing to talk about
their views than we've ever seen before
so
watch this and enjoy yeah you want to
sit down and just grab it
let's just talk here i'll i'll even let
you hold the mic because i'm pretty sure
you're not going to steal it
you know it is a nice looking mic there
you go yeah you can sit down yeah
all right just just give your name for
the camera and then you don't have to
address it again we just talked to you
and i yeah my name is josh
okay judge do you want me to hold the
mic or you want all the mic all right
i'll hold the mic i don't care i'll do
that okay so you were just saying so i
don't i'm not outing you right by saying
you're
right is that okay if i sit on camera
okay get so gay conservative
yep bisexual actually to
specify it which i guess a lot of people
like doing i was going to say
is that okay let me ask you this how
many people who claim to be bisexual are
actual bisexual do you think it's a do
you think a lot of them lie about it
just seem cool
i've had okay so personal story
no no actual names we'll just call him
mike right
let's let's call him mike his name's
mike isn't it mike's gonna see it she's
like that's my name
it's michael cover yeah it's clone guys
yeah okay we'll call him mike so mike uh
we were in a relationship for two months
nowadays i guess it's cool to just say
you know oh well i'm bisexual so
yeah yeah i get to do this i'm gay now
whatever and it's just like
i feel like as an actual bisexual guy
it's become a fad
and people always say all the time that
they
actually are interested in the other sex
okay
and i know i mean from a lot of
first-hand experience i know i'm getting
myself out there no i appreciate it
well isn't that that's an adorable dog i
don't know if you can see this sorry i'm
just
since this is relaxed that's the
greatest greater swiss mountain dog it's
beautiful
beautiful two good looking dogs sorry
i'm a big i'm a big dog guys so i get so
easily distracted we have two
people husky oh do you see that
oh guys the tolerant left strikes again
the tolerant left strikes again
yes but if you would like to change my
mind uh we were willing to have a
conversation of course
that's whole point is civil disagreement
okay
thank you no one not a lot of takers not
a lot of takers sadly i mean here in
austin texas there's a melting pot of a
city
you'd have thought a lot of people would
come up here and say well you know what
i disagree with that let me speak to
this guy
but do you think if they knew you were
gay they would have been they would have
said that they're probably not oh god no
oh god no dude oh god no
you do realize you get a pass to some of
that stuff they're like you're just like
hey man i'm gay like oh i'm so sorry
that's the funny thing is that people
always say to me you know they disagree
with a lot of
what i have to say i mean hence my shirt
um
it's a it's a general statement you know
but um
i have people actually someone actually
added me
on twitter uh because there was some
kind of like
nra discussion yeah and of course i try
men because
i i like you know speaking for another
side that a lot of people don't usually
see a lot of 20 year old gay mexican
kids go up to
and it was really funny because you're
mexican
dude tall mexican yeah i know right
that's i mean that's very uncommon i
know it's
true you're very tall i would have
guessed like you know spanish
but i know spanish have a bunch of
redheads too so never mind some
something like that i mean brazil is
just it's
colors yeah exactly and they're very
racist
brazil brazilians i know a lot of
brazilians are very racist sorry
so so the thing is uh actually someone
messaged me on twitter
and uh they said that why are you for
guns
now uh they brought up a lot of
statistics uh which i did too
and i brought up you know fbi cdc
something that you linked actually uh
for the
the cdc yeah the defensive uses exactly
i'm glad it helped yeah
so i brought that up in my defense and
someone called me a straight white
male that doesn't know anything about
that quote like word by word that's what
they said to me and
it was it was hilarious because i then
oh oh we have someone oh i think i think
you might disagree yeah do you mind if
we pick this up or we left off because
you know we gotta
that's the whole purpose to it all right
thank you yeah we'll see you around but
i have to follow up
mr straight white male over here and
he's not the only one here's another
friendly gay man with a mustache
or something sure yeah if you want to
get a picture you're what are you here
for the americans panel and for the uh
i'm working for the festival oh you are
yeah okay wow they must they must
be have a hard time with you well i
still i wore my
home pad during like the uh orientation
and i got a little angry
looks better whatever grab it yeah you
wanna grab a seat grab a picture i can
have uh
someone here take a picture for you what

with the festival here
well i went last year and it was a lot
of fun you know i
i saw like some of my favorite
celebrities so okay
yeah i just wanted to uh get back to
like something that helped me out
all right i'm sorry no no don't worry
i just wanted to give back to something
that just brought me a lot of joy
sure yeah yeah do you do you find it
hard sometimes to kind of
see be a part of the activism that you
see from the festival in the panels is
that a tough pill to swallow
do you want me to do this no you don't
have to i mean if you if you want i was
just kind of sitting down but i think
yeah i can hold this for you
sure all right do you want to hold it
i'll hold it i guess we've had people
try to steal it so
you don't look like the type but you
know well it is a little difficult
but um you know
i live in austin so i'm not like really
i'm not really trying to make friends
politically i'm just trying to make
friends just socially
and you know if we if we meet
someone that's like or if i meet someone
that's like super
conservative or at least like moderate
then yeah we
have a good friendship based off that
i'm trying to hit it off amazing
like okay so i don't want to be foreign
let me ask you are you
uh what's your orientation
i'm bisexual okay so but i'm not
offending you by asking you yeah yeah no
you're fine
so we've had a lot of the last two days
uh actually fighting off yesterday was a
bisexual but a lot of
gay or bisexual conservative fans come
out
cool do you feel like there's a ground
swell happening i guess maybe since the
same-sex marriage is kind of off the
table that it's like hey i can be
bisexual
and also want lower taxes because it's
surprised us
how many have shown up and been just
really friendly great great people
yeah yeah yeah i definitely would say
like there's this new wave of
conservatism now
that just like they don't give a
about like gay people it's like
if you're not killing anybody you know
yeah exactly
that's what this is about killing you
know who we believe exactly exactly
no it was funny because uh i'm on like
this group chat now and they're like
 freaking out about this or they
left
oh no well can you be our eyes and ears
and if they want to do anything violent
let us know
got you back man i appreciate well thank
you so much man i appreciate
i appreciate being in the fray i know i
know it's not easy you know
as crazy as it sounds i know white male
privilege but as a christian
conservative
white male in french socialist canada
yeah i didn't have a lot of friends
either
so uh we always appreciate and we always
we always
want people out there if they feel like
outsiders or feel like they don't have a
place
you're always welcome okay thank you i
appreciate it and uh
yeah enjoy the rest thank you very much
appreciate it stay hydrated
i know it's unbelievable that was fun
back to the first guy he had to duck out
for a little second actually that's why
it's edited but he's back now
i'm sure remember where we were uh white
male privilege
because of your nra discussion oh yes
yes okay yes so
so that's pretty funny okay as a tall
gay mexican
as a tall game mexican uh well
i let them know of past i i guess i let
them know of my past of discrimination
from my own self sure i came out of the
closet
at around 15 years old and as
much as people would love to say
everyone is so tolerant here in austin
this is austin
everyone's so nice yeah i still had my
fair share of people you know
just telling me about how they
disagree which i'm poor you know i'm for
if hey if you disagree with my lifestyle
if you disagree with anything i have to
do sure that's that's your right
yeah that's your right i i can't govern
how you think and it doesn't mean that
they hate you either
exactly you know so i i know plenty of
friends actually two of my good friends
are still against gay marriage yet they
completely support me and they
completely support my livelihood
they care about me that's just something
they cannot agree with based off of
religious standpoints which
that's what i was going to ask you about
do you feel like you were kind of
talking about this
since the gay marriage issue is kind of
off the table do you think you'll see a
lot more
gay people uh and minorities in general
become conservative because we've seen a
lot at our show
oh definitely definitely yeah the big
thing
that a lot of people love to assume
is that every single gay person that
you're going to meet is going to be a
i bleed blue democrat yeah that is
completely wrong i it doesn't matter now
that the gay marriage thing has moved
off the table and by the way
there were a lot of gay people i knew
who either didn't support it or didn't
care there was like civil union fine
even including elton john
but now that that's been removed i just
don't understand what's like
why you can't be a guy who prefers a man
over women and also not like to pay high
taxes it doesn't
i don't see the correlation exactly and
and i don't either
and especially with everything that's
been going on right now i heard that the
supreme court uh ruled in the favor of
that oregon bakery
yeah instead of the gay couple i'm for
that
i'm for people having their own right to
service
who they want and first of all by the
way they would serve the gay couple they
just wouldn't bake the cake for the
wedding wedding for the wedding exactly
and that's something that i completely
agree with if you're going over to a
private
and that that's the big that's the big
term that a lot of people didn't
understand
everyone thought it's a company saying
no to gay people and they don't want to
support the gay people because they
don't want to buy a cake
and it's just like no it's a private
company it's
it's run by a a wife and a husband
that are like pretty older and they just
wanted to say
no to making the cake for the wedding it
goes against their
religious views right i would never you
know force
a jewish person to ever or jewish uh
bakery to ever say oh you know what even
though i am prone you know neo-nazi and
stuff like that
go pick me bake me the swastika cake
dude it's hey you know it goes against
you
that's a joke right i don't know i've
seen some mexican neo-nazis
you know you never know today he's
excited he's a gay mexican neo-nazi
uh well you know i always have to be
careful cause like i said the guy who
walked off was like just the jews and
yelled it out to try and attribute it to
me
oh yeah so i always have to make sure
that i'm like that's a joke correct
some people don't like but but do you
use it you have to admit right like you
use it as a
you must use it as a pass like if
someone yells like you if you're
like hey i'm gay
do you see them clam up oh of course of
course i'm so sorry
of course i have people i i have someone
assuming
my race my sexuality someone called me
on
of course a buzzfeed twitter post
i know i know i dove into dark territory
there for a sec
right but uh i was there and uh it
someone just said well straight white
males shouldn't matter
your voice and your opinion doesn't
matter and i said okay first of all
hold up you're talking to
a 20-year-old gay mexican
from texas so get that straight and
then she immediately said
okay well i'm sorry for assuming and i
said okay well
then again you you assumed right you
assumed
does does your opinion matter now it
matters more because you're getting
mexican somehow it matters more that you
know
use it we need you i do i do
i do and i just got on twitter i've been
on there for about a month
i already have like 150 followers and of
course all my friends are just like hey
look josh you gained another 80 year old
white person from tennessee and i'm just
like no i
i gained another person that agrees with
my standpoints right
you know yeah it shouldn't matter what
they look like
what they do where they live because
when it comes
at the okay at the end of the day when
it comes down to it
my viewpoints are always for the better
of everyone
in america right in america which is why
i'm actually
or building the wall yeah because it
betters everyone for america legal
immigrants
come over here exactly legal immigration
come over here for the better
of themselves and for their livelihood
and for their families well we talk
about this quite a bit we just talked
about on the show on thursday
you can either have equal opportunity or
equal outcomes you can't have both
you know so if someone says well we have
to have a certain quota of gay people or
we have to have a certain quota of women
in applied sciences
what does that do it removes equal
opportunity for the guy who really
deserves that spot
of course you have to pick one and we're
in this era and i think a lot of
minority voters including you know using
the umbrella term including gay voters
do you feel like do you feel like um
because i know you're more conservative
and obviously your partner was more
liberal and now more conservative do you
think there's a groundswell
where minorities uh gays included or
alternative lifestyles
have realized that their votes have been
taken for granted of course
of course definitely every every person
that is okay let's say for instance
um the leading democrat right now in
austin
is beto it's beto something you see all
over austin
yeah uh like vote for beto vote for veto
vote for beto
and uh the guy i respect him as a man i
respect everyone
you know like religious political every
viewpoint ever aside
right i respect every human being and
i feel like a lot of my friends i have
one of my friends and yeah i'm going to
shout you out nikos if this is on a
video
but he is from uh jesus california of
course
he's from california of course and uh he
always says
you know oh well i disagree with that i
disagree with that i disagree with that
and i say well why why
and he says in response he'll give his
do you consider yourself a journalist no
okay
what do you under this sir I do not
appreciate the sarcasm question of the
day
where were you when you realized that
journalism wasn't what you thought it
was it was probably me with Dan Rather
forging documents that was one and now
we're talking about fake news Walt when
Walter Cronkite said I believe the quote
was you can't be a reporter and not be
somewhat of a liberal I remember that
hit me like a just a blast of cold water
because we're about to show you an
unedited interview with the writer of an
article at the Austin Chronicle I
think's Fenn computer has this as an
overlay it was an article written about
the recent Crowder confronts yep about
the video never featured the video just
just now riddled with an accuracies to
feature yes
so we tried to reach this girl and we
weren't able to reach the the author and
then she called us back so that's what
you're about to you hazing it's not
about the Austin Chronicle right I mean
I get it not many people read it what
it's about is the media at large this
has been going on I've encountered this
with daily beast with Washington Post
with Sky News you were there when we did
this was with Sky News you know it's
about the media getting away with this
scot-free for so long and we just can't
it's kind of like the crowd it confronts
we just can't allow it to continue so
hope you enjoy the phone call steven
crowder hi this is Jesse Kate hey Jesse
how are you I'm well how are you I'm
doing well I'm glad we were able to
connect finally absolutely thanks for
reaching out sure well I know the first
thing is I know you were looking for
someone to to comment from from my side
here on this story I had some questions
for you curious is to you you wrote an
article about a video exclusively kind
of a play-by-play but never included the
video what's that sure well you know
it's pretty easy to find I did include
the title and mention the platform
YouTube that it's on so anyone who can
use the Internet can find that but I do
have some questions for you actually
after but why wouldn't you embed it down
at that I don't understand because of
some of the inaccuracies I'd like to go
over or clearly stated in the video or
at least featured in the video so is
there a reason you didn't embed it well
I just specifically said that we chose
not to do that but I did include the
title and
platform that it's on so that's my
answer so if you would like to tell me
about the inaccuracies that you found
I'm just happy to hear you out and I'd
love to hear those absolutely well first
off I'm glad were finally speaking
because the first inaccuracy I mean you
didn't reach out to me at all directly
for a for a comment or for my side of
the story which surprised me considering
this is reporting well I did reach out
to see our TV and I put that in there I
have the email thread and I'm happy to
provide you with that sure well I know
you reached out to a generic page and
see our TV that you know I don't work
for them we have a partnership agreement
and you were advocated to go to my
social media pages of all my producers
their emails are there with a very quick
simple contact me page and I know you
wrote that you were not about to quote
fall into that trap what
so what trap is that well I'm not going
to use my personal social media platform
to reach out from this on this story so
I'm calling you now from my cell phone
number so that's that's as personal as
I'm willing to get on this as a
journalist I would just like to
streamline this conversation and get the
inaccuracies that you measure well
that's an act okay I'm happy to hear you
out now sure well that's right there
that's that's one inaccuracy that the
implication that you had reached out to
me because we never received word now of
course would have loved to give our side
especially if we would have known that
you weren't going to feature the video
that was in question you know a couple
of things forget to the other
inaccuracies which are which are more
obvious and you mentioned our fans doxed
this person they received death threats
any evidence of that well it's all over
the comment threads I was able to find
those people that the person that Julian
and the persons manager all of their
personal information is on multiple
platforms at this point sure so I guess
we needed to find first as you mentioned
journalistic integrity I know that's
important well what do you what do you
mean when you say daxing I want to make
sure I'm not miss construed this well
the release of someone's public and
formal information to the public their
home address in this particular case the
employee to my knowledge is
transgender both their birth name and
the name that they go by we're released
which is can be very dangerous the all
sorts of personal information is out
there now about about these individuals
which I'm sure you know I understand
from the little that I have been able to
find you know in terms of your beliefs
on these types of things that you
certainly don't advocate for violence
and I didn't know for stories it yeah
absolutely which I am very happy to hear
that yeah well I don't know that you did
mention it actually hell I don't know
that you did that's another thing I
don't know that you did mention that you
know you talked about me being six to
and the person being smaller I find out
that you went out of your way to to
mention that information but not that I
repeatedly said I am not calling any
actions to violence I would never want
violence against against you I I didn't
see that in there and that was in the
video sure I understand that I also I
mean you are 62 is that an accurate but
why would why would you list my my tale
of the tape and not my actions where I
clearly stated listen
no violence why doesn't that make the
peace but my science does well because
it's an act of aggression to go behind
the counter okay so you don't so you
think that act is more significant than
me saying I am not advocating violence
at all please just take the post down
and this will be the end of it you think
me being six to and larger is more
important than my active calls to action
which are non-violence I certainly am
NOT qualifying that or ranking them okay
mentioned at all at all I'm sorry you
didn't mention one at all okay well the
thing is here is I'm not calling you to
be interrogated I'm asking you to I'm
giving you an opportunity sure right
wrong fine I'm trying to I'm trying to
no one reached out to us for comment you
mentioned my size you don't mention that
I clearly and explicitly in repeatedly
state calls to non-violence you imply
that we Doc's them or or that our fans
did do you know who released the
information of where the juice land was
in the personal information you know who
did that right why don't you tell me you
okay in the very first paragraph of your
article you're the one who states the
MLK juice land and releases us in from
not us we blurred the name we never
mention location you did it
I also did not release that person's
name okay so if you really need neither
did we but you're the one who released
the location and the information you
understand to to imply that something to
our fans that you did it okay I
appreciate you saying that I find that
to be inaccurate but can we please move
on to the other things that you I'm very
curious about the other inaccuracies
that you said your your voicemail to me
quote said it was riddled yes well
there's three there's three and right
now you just said here's the thing if I
say it's in your article you can bring
it up right now
you mentioned where the juice land is
that's you and you say I don't believe
that's accurate
this can't be a fruitful discussion okay
another thing you mentioned alright
comedian a quick rudimentary Google
search would show you that I'm not
alright I've very fervently disavowed
the alt right and as a matter of fact
they've attacked me so can we agree that
that's another at least one inaccuracy
where's the due diligence there I don't
find that to be an inaccuracy but I why
not why not well there are various
reasons but it seems like we're arguing
semantics name one and name one no
semantics name one I say I'm not all
right
I've disavowed them hey you're raising
your voice at me I am not raising my
voice answer responding to you and it
okay I'm not raising my voice thank you
I'd appreciate it if we could just keep
this very civil I absolutely why am i
all right
other than excuse me can can I please
finish my statement you've interrupted
everything that I have to say I would
appreciate keeping this civil okay
please do not raise your voice at me
moving on why am i all right I am I'm
trying to tell you okay um I would you
like to go on or should I please thank
you I appreciate that you do not like
that term that is an umbrella term and
I'm not the only person who uses it I
understand that you do not identify as
and so I'm happy to update the story
with the proper nomenclature that you
would like me to use what is that sir
I'm just a conservative but it's not
about me it's not about me I mean I know
you you choose to use the pronoun about
you know it's not about how I identify I
am NOT alt-right that's not a matter of
editorial ization it's just wrong in
your opinion no are we talking about
reporting here accurate reporting why
would if for example if someone else
were to say I am NOT a Democrat nor have
I ever been a Democrat
I cannot stand Democrats and they were
attacked by Democrats on the record and
then you wrote about them as a Democrat
and they said hey you need to correct
this I'm not a Democrat and you said in
your opinion did can we agree that's
that's that's not correct that's that's
borderline journalistic malpractice if
you're gonna say that that's not
editorialize ation if you want to say
this as an opinion piece fine but it's
not factual
well Democrat and Republican are
recognized in a legal sense all right is
not a descriptor okay so that's how we
get around it but would you say it's at
least at the very least a rudimentary
Google search would would help
considering I've been one of the most
active people at the forefront of not
involving myself with the alt right well
I guess perhaps maybe we could just
discuss what your what your issues with
the alt right are that make you want to
be so far away from them that you're
willing to have sure yeah well I'm just
because I know sure well I know you
mentioned as a catch-all term and I know
that people at your paper have used it
to refer to people under a catch-all
umbrella including National Socialists
which I'm not I'm not a nationalist I am
not under the implicit I know the
implications that I'm a racist I'm not
that I just haven't really identified as
alt right ever I've clearly explicitly
listed my values I'm a traditionalist
constitutionalist conservative you can
call me a federalist but again I think
you know why you use the term all right
you mentioned you didn't find the
original post
I found that curious the original you
mean the original Facebook posts that we
included in our video is you weren't
able to find those I absolutely found
yours but I could not find the other
ones because that person has deleted all
of their social media accounts okay so
you know but you can find those I know
you did also again in the
video this is why showing the video when
an article the play-by-play of a video
is so important this person had made it
on camera to posting those in the video
that's not mentioned I watched the video
okay would you would you be willing to
send me the information that you have
the comments the screenshots those
things to my email address I would love
to see the originals that you posted in
the video sure absolutely I just the
person in the video in question Cameron
says that they are his/her posts okay
should that be included it's up to you
would you like me to include that but
what's the implication if you say I
wasn't able to find the original post
and never mention and never show the
video never mentioned that in the video
this person in question says yeah yeah
of course those are my posts is that not
relevant okay I suppose that it is I'm
happy to quote you a saying that you
believe that it's relevant would you
like me did you well I absolutely more
than happy to have you quote me on that
but I would look for it if you quote
this person in the video saying those
are absolutely my posts shall I send a
timecode what should you send to what
I'm sorry the phone cut out shall I send
a a timecode a timestamp to the video
where this statement is made i watch the
video I'm aware okay so why didn't you
include it I did not include the video
i've already know why did you not
include this person saying that these
are my posts your article leaves it to
imagination as though we made up posts
as though you couldn't find them as
though there's no evidence the evidence
is in admission and screenshots the
person admits in the video that is
relevant information if we're going to
be practicing journalism is it not sure
again I did include the quotes did I not
the quotes article right now the person
saying those are my posts it says
according to screenshots posted by the
Crowder camp in a YouTube video and it
goes on which I specifically mentioned
there that I've rejected that name so no
back to your
earlier statement that I released that
information I have rejected that
person's name but anyway I just just to
be clear what is redacted mean removed
the name for safety purposes is which I
write so clearly stated in the article
yes and remove now yeah which I
appreciate I actually do that you
blurred out the name just on your video
sure but again all of that I realize you
cannot you know control what your
commenters do I understand that
completely
neither can I sure we'll notice on our
on our article I mean clearly there's
nothing you can do about commenters I
understand that right but no and I
appreciate that listen I know you would
not advocate violence nor would you
would you
tasin approve of someone you know
actively posting a plot to slash tires
or was someone else you notice
firebombing the van these these go on
for a long time but it does involve in
these people again it goes back to you
do not include the quote where this
person said that they were this person's
post on Facebook so no that is not
included in there and when you say I
couldn't find the original posts talk
about how I'm six-two and not my active
call to non-violence this is an
inaccurate piece it's riddled with
inaccuracies like we said we've been
through four or five now and I not in
control my fans but I am not judging you
for anything your fans have said I am
calling your attention to things you've
said I understand and my actual
statement is we have yet to obtain the
original post and the employee social
media account appears to be deleted from
what we can gather online the following
is the basic rundown yes so would you
not deem it relevant that the person
gathering online is in the video the
person in question said these are my
posts of course these are my posts is
that not relevant I suppose and I
suppose what it is and I'm happy to
quote you on that is that yes don't
quote me quote them on it you said
you've seen the video quote them on it
them saying
of course those are my posts I don't
need you to quote me this person said it
it's on camera is that Inquirer are we
disap are you disagreeing with me on
that I'm confused here clear I never
said that I disagreed with you so then
why is it not pardon in my mouth so then
what is it what is the issue here don't
quote me quote the person in question
who said of course this is my post
otherwise its activism not journalism
excuse me otherwise it is activism not
journalism okay do you consider yourself
a journalist no okay
what do you under this sir I do not
appreciate the sarcasm
no do you of course I am
okay well I'm it was not sarcastic at
all I wasn't quite sure from this
conversation I thought maybe you were
not beds person which is totally fine I
have no problem with someone who is an
op-ed writer who's an opinion writer I
have nope no problem that if it's
clearly explicitly stated in the piece I
understand that going back to it you are
upset that I mentioned your height but
it's the entire excuse me no okay well
could I finish please I understand that
you have mentioned that I mentioned your
height multiple times so the reason that
I did that which I'm pretty sure reads
very clearly that the reason that that
is relevant is because you did walk
behind the counter of a business yes is
that is that a typical behavior of you I
mean is that is that how you choose to
confront people I know that the
confronting people is kind of your kind
of your thing no it's not no it's not
actually it's not as a matter of fact
there there are over 30 million plays
unchanged my mind segments the reason
this segment has started by the way we
were there in Austin we spoke with I
came over her name Danielle she's a
transgender woman running for City
Council male to female transgender this
went on while there were calls to
firebomb our van this occurred while
this person was advocating and plotting
to slash our tires what we were actually
sitting down doing it change my mind
segment
which is a completely unedited interview
where we sit on the street and allow
anyone to have a conversation so it's
not kind of my thing there are two of
these I think there are 10 plus of those
and this is just when people advocate
violence no it's not my thing
this person's thing is advocating
violence my issue here is not that you
list my height the issue here is that
you write an article or you say you
couldn't find the original post you
never quote the person in question who
openly says of course those are my posts
you do not show the video you refer to
me as all you refer I'm just gonna
finish here you refer to me as alt right
you mentioned my height and not my
active call to non-violence again I
state this is a piece very selectively
choosing facts if we want to call it
those and it's activism not journalism
and I would just appreciate if it's
labeled such I don't care if you less my
height if you say six-foot-two steven
crowder glistening in the Sun walked
behind the kitchen and said hey hey just
to be clear I would never advocate
violence against you I wouldn't have a
problem with it if you were to say that
we couldn't find the post because they
were deleted but in the video openly
says of course those are my posts that
changes context because if people
it doesn't have to be your main focus
and and like you said earlier you don't
have to be going after being you know
the strongest man in the world or
anything even close to that but you know
going in and having that that positive
reinforcement of training because it
just carries over before I introduce our
next guest you know this story often
with dealing into a topical news show
people have to get bumped because we
have either people come on a politician
answer people have specific issues
there's something broke that's topical
and you have someone with a book on it
so this next guys has been so friendly
we've had to move him several times
because it's a great idea let me get
this out first at Shaw strength Shaw
strength comm Shaw strength coming in SH
aw we've had to move him several days
four times world Strongest Man that's a
great way sir just piss off the world
Strongest Man Brian Shaw thanks for
being here brother Thank You Stephen I'm
happy to be here well thank you so much
for being so patient and I'm such a big
fan as a matter of fact I have to say
our research or the beast reg is a huge
fan he's actually he's a little guy but
he's got a 600 something raw deadlift
I think a 500 something sorry no 600
Watts quat a 500 watt deadlift at 1/8
he's a university professor so he oh
that's yeah he's great I just don't want
to be on his bad side so world strong
four times unbelievable you know III the
best American strongman competitor for
people who don't know well certainly
some people will argue it but I would
say ever let me have to head what I say
because people will get mad what's that
like and what did you have your flash of
genius moment to say hey I can lift
heavy things and move them faster than
anybody I know you know it's looking
back I don't know if I had one moment
where that kind of occurred to me it was
you know something growing up as a kid I
did you know a lot of manual things my
uncle had a farm so we had to do you
know farm work and that type of thing
and it was just something you did
because we had to do it you know but
looking back you know doing those types
of
things that 11 or 12 years old is
probably a little bit abnormal you know
and like half down every day I have I
have lifted cows before not necessarily
in consecutive days but have done that
so it yeah it's just something that kind
of looking back I think that all the
signs were there but I didn't really
realize how gifted I was until I
actually started competing and and it
just was a natural fit for me after I
started competing it was something that
I just everything came very naturally I
was I was able to move things that other
people couldn't move they go cow-tipping
hey we're gonna go Shh Brian lifted it
Brian what the hell are you doing the
video is some b-roll here of the Atlas
stone if oh gosh this is just it scares
hurts my back to to watch so for people
to know you now you're six eight I think
440 pounds when you started strong man
how big were you I was probably
obviously the same height but about I
would say about 330 pounds or so and
that's I mean gosh going on three well
yeah I mean if skinny is a word at 330
pounds I was skinny you know just
because of my frame you know a that age
and and it's taken me a lot of years to
put that put that weight on you know to
to just increase my lifting leverages
and to be more competitive
yeah well compact come on you're being
so much competitive four times we're all
strongest man like just took you know I
just I just I just want to go the
distance and be still standing no you
won world Strongest made four times um
it's unbelievable well you have a nine
hundred five pound squat your tire
deadlift is 11 hundred forty pounds
really don't know it's just unbelievable
stuff and actually my producer here he
he has been putting on weight you know
he had I think I'm not letting the
Canada bag you know all sort of colitis
so I had a big part of them test and
removed and he's struggled with gaining
weight for a long time and he's been
lifting like
and what what do you want to say what
you're up to I don't want to I'm up to
oh I don't have a squat machine her
squat proper squat about 200 is what I'm
up to on I mean your weight though your
weight weight yeah up to 161 which for
him is is really so what advice would
you have for someone like him who isn't
just I don't want to drink milk but
actually had you know a disorder that
led to him struggling with it because I
know I know he's curious he's too shy to
ask because he's afraid of you it's I
mean obviously that's about the hurdle
that he's gonna he's gonna have to
overcome and something that a lot of
people don't have to deal with but gain
you a time and I get that question very
very frequently you know and the the
typical question is just like oh I'm
trying so hard to eat and you know I
can't gain weight but when it really
comes down to it eating if you're really
serious about trying to gain weight it
has to be a job I mean it's you've got
to be eating whether you're hungry or
not every couple hours from when you
wake up to when you go to bed you know
so it's it's the commitment you can't
have one day of good eating and then the
next day you kind of need two or three
smaller meals and then go back to it
it's it's just something where you know
for me I would like when I was younger I
was really trying to gain weight I would
just pack an entire cooler and take it
to work with me and then I would have to
eat the the contents of that cooler by
the end of the day and then start and do
it all again you know college you have
to bring food for the whole team get
away all the reasons I've seen results
this time around just is just that it's
just being really good it's the most
consistent I've ever been with just
eating your day and I realize you work
out you just prospects a hunger you know
you you got a go suppers you eat which
gives you energy to workout so it's kind
of it's a silikal sort of fun winsome
thing 4:40 here you come Brian let me
ask you this because I'm always
interested and you know this show
obviously have a lot of a lot of
political figures and deal with cultural
issues but to me I'm always fascinated
by people who are the best in any field
excellent even though I hate soccer 7
computer knows I still have a crevice
pectoralis you couldn't pay me to watch
it
so for people who aren't maybe
necessarily following strong man and
aren't as familiar with you
you four times world Strongest Man that
is so elite was there a turning point
because he kind of struggled for a while
you were coming in third and second and
then rattled off first-place finishes
like there it seems to a viewer like
there was a turning point you know what
that was for you um you know it's when I
got my first taste of of going to world
Strongest Man I'm a to say I'm
competitive
it's kind of an understatement and I've
been that way my entire life from when I
was a kid I mean I I can't imagine how
many problems I caused from our parents
play and I mean I was wandering the
Monopoly board my god exactly so you
know for me it was something once I got
to that level and worked so hard to get
there I wanted to win very badly so my
focus was a hundred percent on a daily
basis on being the best that I possibly
could be so you know it was it's
literally a lifestyle that I that I have
to live and to get to that level you
know I mean you want to be the best like
you said of anybody in the world that's
something you're gonna have to commit
yourself fully to doing that and it's
not easy and you know you have to work
through tough days you have to work
through challenges overcome a lot of
different things but you know once I got
that taste of it that was kind of my
turning point where I knew that I had
the capability to win and that just
drove me even harder yeah I had a
question I mean obviously most of our
fans aren't competing in you know
World's Strongest Man competitions but a
lot of people like Marc Roberto talked
about how the benefits of anyone getting
stronger can can you speak to kind of
like what what benefits that people need
to know about that that just being
stronger is is good period yeah that's a
huge huge point I mean it's it's
something where I I would say that
everybody in my opinion should workout
should train because it teaches you so
much about yourself there and you know
as you go in and put that work in and
you see results it's kind of a positive
you know a positive effect that
continues to happen and then you have a
more positive self-image you know and it
just carries over to the rest of your
life yeah I mean it teaches you so much
about yourself just
raining in general you know so I I think
that absolutely everybody should work
out I think it's something that it can
be such a positive thing the measurable
progress is what we we talking about
that measurable increase of with a wait
it's a number it's a mathematical number
whereas some other things you know we
have a lot of combat athletes doing
Brazilian so you are boxing you
have some good days and bad days the
barbell the kilograms don't lie though I
will say I've never once gotten down to
my car me like I can go to work if I
just move that 560 pound rock never once
happen no it's I don't you know no but
mark reptilia who's written starting
strength and he talks about that how
you're obviously listen I know I hate to
use a term freak athlete but you always
have a genetic component you know not
everyone is six eight people can try as
they might maybe not be the world's
strongest man some people aren't very
fast some people have you know some some
hurdles but everyone can get stronger
than they were and I think that's the
takeaway that a lot of people miss when
talking about self-esteem we're not
saying you're strong per se just
stronger than you were yeah absolutely
you can you can improve yourself and and
you know it's it doesn't have to be your
main focus and and like you said earlier
you don't have to be going after being
you know the strongest man in the world
or anything even close to that but you
know going in and having that that
positive reinforcement of training
because it just carries over you know
anybody that's worked out regularly will
understand that how you feel after you
go in and work out it's just a very
uplifting feeling and being able to put
even even five more pounds on on the
barbell and lift it that's a positive
effect that you can measure and it's
something that makes you feel good about
yourself absolutely yeah absolutely one
thing about say you know and and forgive
me if every overstepping my bounds but I
think these are this is out there
watched pretty much all the strong men
documentaries out there and also the
YouTube semi documentaries on you you
have a wonderful wife mrs. Shaw who
seems very supportive and she seems to
have a very deep understanding of you
your idiosyncrasies one to give you
space when you're competing my wife is
like that you know when I do stand up or
do the show she knows okay give give him
some space here here's where I need
support how important would you say that
is is having someone like that
the complementary roles and a unit to
make it happen because you seem to have
that in spades yeah I am definitely very
lucky to have my wife you know I mean
it's something where it's a big
commitment what I have to do but having
her there to support me and and like you
said she she knows when to kind of give
me a little bit of room and when when I
need to talk or when you know when to
you know cuz I good days and bad days
too I mean I come in from coming from
training or something and I'm just kind
of like man that I just didn't go the
way I wanted it to go or something and
then you know she just kind of knows how
to pick me up and to support me and I
mean she does so much stuff honestly so
much stuff behind the scenes that people
never see you know and um I'm kind of
the guy that people look at and say okay
well you know Brian went to this contest
and performed or won or whatever it is
and you know the credit doesn't
necessarily go back to her but but she
was helping me with so many things
around the house and and making my life
easier so that I can go Trainmen and do
what I need to do to perform yeah and um
not in that support system is massively
important yeah I don't when I watch the
documentary it was very very touching to
me when I would hear her speak and
listen you're also a very bright guy in
a sensitive guy we just talked we talked
about having Laci green aside you have
toxic masculinity and I have to be big
and aggressive and you can express your
emotions I think you're a great walking
example of someone who is what we talked
about I don't know if you're familiar
with this I've talked about this in the
show a lot the term was originally
jack-of-all-trades master of one and
then it got turned into Jack altijd
master of none but the mockery has
become the colloquialism the idea was
you're not a complete man unless you're
physically emotionally spiritually kind
of in line and and you're obviously very
articulate and you people watch these
documentaries you seem like somebody
who's very comfortable in his own skin
what do you say to a lot of people who
think of strongmen or athletes sort of
in that in that millyar as meatheads
yeah I mean that's a it's it's something
you know it's just a generalization that
people make and they assume that okay
well if you're you're competing in the
sport and you know it's a very
asked you once for obviously and and
we're having to do these things and it's
kind of a you know for lack of a better
term an alpha male you know type of
sport and and you know I mean we're
going after the the the world Strongest
Man title you know it's it's something
that you know a lot of guys do get
caught up in that but you know for the
most part a lot of strong men are
actually very well-educated men that you
know maybe outside of the contest you
have to be able to flip that that
competitor switch when you're competing
but when you stepped out of that arena
off that stage most of us are very
humble guys and and pretty down-to-earth
I mean you have you have a few that are
not that way and they kind of keep that
persona and they're you know not very
nice to people and that kind of thing
but you know for the most part it's um
you know something I think for me it
kind of came from my upbringing for my
parents you know always remain humble
and be thankful and you know that's that
type of thing and and I just tried to
carry that on even with all the success
that I've had and you know going to
these bigger competitions and having
more people follow me and watch me in
that type of thing that doesn't
necessarily mean that that humbleness
has to go away or that that I need to
take on this persona of being a meathead
or whatever you know it's it's something
that but a lot of I don't do I
appreciate that I appreciate that you
don't because you know there's nothing
more corrosive potentially than humans
sold and success and obviously you're
about as successful as you can be in
this endeavor and you could easily have
come on here and been been a jerk and
you could have we could say nothing we
couldn't say anything in your opinion
obviously is as four-time winner who
would you say and there's a lot of
debate about this in your opinion who's
the strongest man who's ever lived you
can't include yourself it's not fair
that is that is a tough debate it's it's
a debate that you know you go into any
sport and you can you it's it's hard to
compare eras right of any sport and
that's that's really where the debate
comes so you know you've had several
different men that have kind of
dominated their respective era of
strongmen so you know the first one
probably being Bill Kazmaier
yeah you know I mean
he was very very dominant in in
strongman in powerlifting you know
especially in the early 80s it was early
to mid 80s little dollar than your
starting size yes it's crazy I mean he's
actually still a pretty big guy yeah you
know in in in a lot of ways but you know
the guys have just got bigger overall
you know and and it's so I would say
that on that list you have built as
learn then one of my main rivals oh oh
no oh no it's a suspense he just cut I'm
willing to base it's gonna say oh sorry
I can use if ickis is that what you're
about to say could add the dream is to
Vegas yeah okay yeah so him and I have
gone back and forth World's Strongest
Man we both at four world Strongest Man
titles so I would I would put him on
that list and then you know you'd have
to you know there's there's kind of
legendary strongmen from the past and
probably the top one of those it's Louis
Cyr you know you seems rather young
competitor Quebec oh yeah the back
people for people who don't know the
back lift chair you have to do the
longshot the back lift is where you
would put weight on here like people
would and you do this and literally lift
it like this when people now they go
back lift I'm like no you don't Louis
Cyr I said from what I understand the
record still hasn't been broken but as
far as I know it has not yeah so I mean
he's probably from all the legendary you
know strongmen at the past he's probably
got the best documented feats of
strength of anybody and I mean there's
you know one of the biggest contests we
have we actually get a the trophy as a
statue of Louis Cyr yeah so it's pretty
cool so I mean he's he's definitely held
in very high regard in the strength
community still you know after after all
these years so oh sorry my dog was
growling there I don't know if he didn't
like Lee series he walked into the
studio Hoffer but okay here's something
again and I know you're so competitive
so you don't have to answer if it's a
sore spot but again when I have someone
who's the best in their field there are
certain issues that fascinate me okay
and I can ask this now I think please
don't hurt me because you
went on to win four times but like I
said the victus was your main rival and
there is a moment I remember when I was
watching world's strongest my camera
which year it was but it was it was a
log lift I think was the Austrian oak
and as far as I remember it no one else
had lifted it yet some kind of overhead
lift and then I think you were the first
one to do it and you got a rep or two
and then I remember the Vic us getting
in because that was his lift listen
difference from it and he just wrapped
it out like it was a like it was a baby
again I don't say that's it because then
you went in you you came back and you
won this is not a slight at all but what
was that moment like for you because it
was so mind-blowing how how strong he
wasn't very specific facets back then
sure we I mean there was I don't know
exactly what moment you're talking about
there but there was definitely times
where he had events especially with the
log because I that's I'm he's been
pretty open saying that's been his
[Music]
you want to read why have you uh had an
experience with that 12 years at YouTube
but seen some pretty awful you had
any experience with that
you mean personally yeah yeah I have
it's never good I posted YouTube was an
alcoholic mean drunk she used to
come in hammered looking to wail on
somebody so I'd provoke her open she
wouldn't go after the smaller channels
interesting nights were when she just
finished watching box yeah they used to
just outright D monetize our videos
until they realize that violating public
single-party consent laws could cause
more damage and there was this one time
this complained that we filmed
them without permission at a public town
hall while he's advocating and pumping
kids full and puberty blockers
YouTube execs gave us a choice to blow
every face in the whole and video I said
we could just skip the time and have it
outright removed said shoes well I'd
have to go with just removing at the
Havana yeah we went with blurring all
the faces why because then that's why
and your account received a heart strike
anyway yeah so what is it crowd has got
some kind of rebellion complex or
something some kind of a general problem
with authority is that we have to put a
half asian lawyer on retainer full-time
I didn't know you had yeah well I did
talk about it now hey Crowder I don't
know a lot
but you see this all this the D
monetization hot strikes the video
removals the policies it's not your
fault yeah I know that look at me son
it's not your fault
I know no it's not your fault
I know no no you don't it's not your
fault
it's not your fault it's not your fault
it's not your fault it's not your fault
not me not you don't give up it's not
your fault it's not your fault
[Music]
louder with Crowder studios protected

[Music]
[Music]
that's called is the e kicking in or
zero I forget I have a Walther on me no
it's a Walther on you try the Walther
wonderful sponsor of the program we had
these custom-made actually I should
start people of Nazca or can they buy
everything yeah they don't we met we had
them made at a lot of credit shop go buy
them I go in but but they make the
firearms wonderful firearm so listen we
have a great guest say we have stefan
molyneux mmm-hmm I shouldn't say Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau we have us
mostly good guests yes and day he did I
hey day no glad I hated no gloves
I just I told that can generate from do
that we were gonna let him pronounce it
here video gamer with six million
subscribers and I don't say conservative
but on the evolutionary path there you
go as one does maybe it's trellises you
know I'm entirely sure I don't remember
the fossils the main video studio as
always is Jared was now a farm on
Twitter it not get Jeremy described as
he comments or thought your putter stops
I've got my obligations right inclusions
are we good
there's a dorm stir-fried black if you
aren't him up lemon we talked about it
at G Morgan Jr he's a simile a going for
level three apparently that's a really
big deal but no one cares what's up wow
I thought you cared Behrens your way
maker out of possible and spend computer
are you ready with you overlays I'm
worried with you or at least but PPP I
would be more ready if people started
sending me their stories that he won't
have covered my Twitter that's not
clever could seem like use mimetic
trying to help through the show yeah
sorry Ernest for about two nos was just
being a cybernetic jerk yes and we're
going to be talking about you know
question of the day this has been talked
about a lot this week where do you line
up on conservatives in their involvement
in social issues you know more
specifically do you think that
conservatives lose the the social I
guess the social sort of cultural sphere
is it unpopular for them to go after the
moral issues roe v-- wade specifically
will talk about okay not okay good
choice not comment I'm curious to hear
your thoughts on that I think I don't
have some thoughts on nothing yeah we'll
have you're leaning in with thoughts but
no thoughts no no that's at all yes
because that's NATO leaders finally
pledged to boost their defense spending
after Trump raked them over the coals
earlier than a week almost seems like
they're related almost it's just the
winning is a Brian song to win so much
they won't let me win anymore
so after Trump talked to NATO the
leaders pledged their quote unwavering
commitment to boost defense spending
signing a declaration that states they
are quote committed to improving the
balance of sharing the costs and
responsibilities of Alliance membership
we go now live to their meeting in
progress
thank you sir have another thank you sir
thank you sir may I have another if you
ask nicely so many great titles I'd
serious out intertidal team Tex thread
yeah for our video last night I'd like
to read a couple of them music about
NATO yeah these are legit we the Jews
Micah's hair fall careful don't give Tim
Cook a reason to unlock your phone yeah
 why Trump is right on I suck at
NATO my Trump is now your daddy
yeah or win Trump Cubs need about poop
hey speaking of all of those things
really stormy Daniels was arrested
earlier Thursday oh my god not
performing in Ohio strip club for
allegedly that's the key word there that
means we can't be sued letting someone
touch her while on stage hmm so a
representative Michael of NT vowed to
fight the quote bogus charges his client
faces and what he blasted as a setup and
he said it was politically motivated so
to be fair in this one he actually he
may be right considering that she's
having charges pressed against her by
the notorious touching stripper breast
is a human right super PAC she has a
different definition of super PAC she
does not have daddy issues Marvin Gaye
had daddy issues she's just a he
gets a little bit worse here so
apparently what she did the cops
actually saw her touch somebody then the
cops came up to get her and she
literally pulled their face into her
breasts and then grabbed the female cops
but at breasts bad move stormy I hope
their pension is epic they put their
lives on the line for us they just
cashed in on people on the left I just
Marvin Gaye had daddy issues she's just
a that's terrible but it will make
it they'll be like saying no no she
wasn't koshered the Mamas and the Papas
singer just choked on him because she
was just a fat beef ham sandwich
terrible place too terrible
so people the left right now News are
outraged over the scarlet johansson
playing a trans man in an upcoming movie
a blues they're not outraged over her
sake can I take by winning subida okay
Twitter tornado play odd the manga
because of the manga
so people have been following the story
let me just clarify the left is mad
because she's not really transgender
okay the right I'm mad because of the
left's double standard where an actor
should be allowed to portray something
different from their real identity but
all this is actually moot because no one
did their research clearly any more
thoughts about who you might marry to
hang in doing that again I had two
marriages it just caused us to do a lot
of money to bust them up
how did none of you catch right though
her Academy Award reads Best Supporting
Z and emotion she's doing it right she's
the slow evolution over like two dozen
films no one notices it's kind like
sneaking your car across the red light
intersection just a little bedtime you
know know what none the wiser Kevin
Spacey you always know Scarlett
Johansson's looking good I don't know
keep it up keep it up don't stop don't
stop my children ought to stop all soups
got to change just to keep up so a
mini-horse
was found on a Japanese rooftop three
days after disappearing leaf a nine year
old mayor's comes from Fox News used for
animal therapy at the life town maybe
maybe Bobby aged care facility vanished
July 6 along with her cult earth when
floodwaters opposite so they found this
pony on a rooftop it was a statistic but
you know what this was straight because
you've covered this for those who are
not among club members this is a
situation strikingly similar to what
recently happened in in Koreatown at the
rooftop we have the 911 call exclusive
okay sir can you give me a description
oh yeah kind of big and brown and yummy
I mean friendly
I mean pony show there's too much
background noise okay okay we're good
now get back in kitchen
I mean bars or I'm not I sorry about
that speaking of racism
trending everywhere by the way I get I
understand it was a stretch to take a
story that involved the Japanese with a
pony and try and tied to the Chinese it
was a weak Segway it works Korea
actually I forgot we didn't even that
was even worse than the Chinese it was
almost as cheap as a Chinese Segway so
Papa John the Chairman commonly known as
Papa John Papa John's on his driver's
license oh I think you don't like okay
John better no debit it's papa
last name John John okay it's like
Carlos Mencia who it so he had to resign
after using the n-word on an NFL
marketing conference call oops so this
is following the NFL debacle he was
asked how he would distance himself from
racist groups and he responded by he
kind of he okay
he said that Colonel Sanders called
blacks the n-word yeah except he said
the N word before insisting that that
Sen Sanders was never he never faced any
public outcry so of course listen it's
over for him he's been permanent I don't
know that he's a racist i under he just
misspoke her this doesn't mean he hates
black people but he probably shouldn't
set it on an NFL call percentage-wise
you're not playing the odds my friend
and he's being permanently labeled a
racist though really we should have seen
this coming especially considering if
you look at their controversial targeted
ad campaigns from the 90s he never makes
sauce from tomato concentrate her
ingredients repeats it about the jobs to
us
just the way I like I'm gonna start on
Little Caesars by the pedophiles now
believe they should be part of the LGBT
community and it happened yeah well I
don't know this is news it's just that
they're being accepted by some they've
always been knocking on that I know but
it's happening and if this is me on the
LGBT community isn't exactly the piggy
that makes its house out of brick
they're not necessarily straw they're
kind of sticks but there's enough huffin
and puffin in NAMBLA blows your house
and they swore to us this wouldn't
happen they swore they swore how dare
you comparison come on stop it
you knew what I was yeah stop all right
so from a Daily Caller
many blogs exist on tumblr showing
support for maps okay this is a new term
for me miners at reminder attracted
persons oh my another acronym really I
love how they had a meeting like okay
listen they made this they made it all
sound benign right pants at it okay
pro-life right gender rights okay we're
just gonna say minor attracted person
let's just go through maps and if I run
the wiser big press I like it keep the
names coming let's keep brainstorming or
just more letters I don't like it's
another ABC's they're done too old for
you should be they said they should be
part of the LGBT community
and they're tending to create a quote
safe space for them okay let me I want
to be clear about something here mmm
I'm all for tolerance and all that gay
stuff but the only normalization here
should be the normal way we lock them in
a cage
occasionally letting you out of the
prison yard with a sign that says I sex
up little kids possibly when all the
guards are taking a diet coke break
while loading the rubber bullets that's
the normal way they deal where you gotta
fire I remember we got so much yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah that's very recent for
people who don't well a few years ago
there's a history or uh none radio yeah
and this salon pet for people don't know
got a lot of credit calm salon pedophile
wrote I'm a pedophile but I'm not a
monster
right and reg the Beast helped us do
some research in front of this pedophile
was actively grooming young girls on
message boards
salons editors were not interested in at
all and so we posted you are a monster
and you need to leave the village or you
get a bullet that's my that's my view I
listen I'm sympathetic I understand it
but the rehabilitation rate with
pedophiles is not very good we can't let
you be near the kids sorry Sara therapy
do it when you're outside of the village
limits and then there was another
article the monstrous a conservative
right a coach Spang of slippery Andrew
Cuomo Governor Andrew Cuomo he says he's
gonna sue the Supreme Court if they move
to rollback row v Wade how's that gonna
work he says sure I don't want any gaps
and a woman's right to protection we
have a better legal case of the Supreme
come up okay so obviously many are just
wondering under what grounds he's going
to sue the overturning of the 19 set for
those November 1973 roe v wade decision
though many suspect he's still bitter
that it came three years too late
andrew cuomo you arcane sir all you need
is the opportunity so selfish the DFC
would have one less pull boy so justice
let's add more justices the filibuster
rule campanario let's do back with the
filibuster rule I'm gonna sue I'm gonna
sue somebody what you can't sue Supreme
Court on this I don't know how
disappointed are the comas parents that
Chris Cuomo is the less one I
don't know that's bad I don't think
they're that disappointed motion it's
you know it's walking upright well look
at his father also the governor like
decades ago Andrew Cuomo Andrew comas
yeah there I think it's also a governor
of Kanuri or Cuomo more like home oh hey
Australian gay farmers are now going
naked to raise awareness for mental
health issues this comes from ABC's no
it's real no I was hoping for a better
picture so we now know over the whole
the Swiss cheese come from cultures so
this is my favorite quote for the ABC
ago when the naked farmer came to town
looking for people to get their kit off
for a good cause dairy farmer Cary
Wilson was approached to take part the
cause hit a personal chord with a couple
and so they ended up going naked to
raise this is because this is what you
do though actually two of the farmers
friend was arrested after allowing a go
to touch them while in the field this is
something I prom yep they were brought
up that's against the law can't do that
um speaking of NATO I'm not necessarily
thrilled with our first guest but he's
open to coming on the show I always have
to give credit where it's due
so the Prime Minister of Canada
obviously a country that has not been
paying in very much I've talking about
them I think we have them on the line
you have Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
are you there sir absolutely Stephen
thanks for having me okay let's get to a
NATO
some tension with President Trump in
your country paying their fair share
yeah
Prime Minister your your thoughts yes
Stephen I definitely have them okay this
is going well let's rephrase how much
does Canada specifically paintin a doe
as part of your GDP I can certainly
speak to that Steven Seoul Indian is a
national treasure and I have been very
fortunate as a Canadian to watcher now
okay now this is this is the classic
misdirection you know what how about
give me the wrong number yes I'm
actually I've been curious about those
myself lately
let me see hold on one second appears to
be 795 Stephen SEP 7 95 what said when
he talks don't we matter here hold on
I've got to converse the American dollar
appears about 650 Stephen 650 dollars
yeah Wow is right and you think that's
paying your fair share especially with
us paying so much more like 600 billion
plus more that's a lot you see Stephen
that sounds bad
yes but fair share is a nuanced concept
it's tricky it's far too nuanced to
explore in just this medium what medium
it seems seems pretty cut and dry I
disagree
okay what's your alternative to us
paying the much higher percentage of our
GDP and tomato than Canada well I think
we should all be paying our fair share
okay but GDP is frankly an antiquated
measurement for such a nuanced I get a
nuance issue like NATO in the modern
world I'm not entirely sure the jerky
okay so what are you what are you
proposing then yes it is my core belief
Stephen that we need to base our
contributions to NATO on a more nuanced
God and progressive inclusive
measurements okay like what for example
how many blocks your country house
enough now I get it
yeah 9 Stephen Canada has 9 ok Prime
Minister Trudeau that means you actually
have less diversity there's no when you
account for population Stephen plus we
have a another shipment from Haiti
coming in as we speak
Shipman well hold on a second I don't
want to hold on any more seconds for
this one come for the incarcerated put
the counter for the incarcerated
population Canada has 6 that's enough
that's enough
also we believe the GDP payments should
factor in things like maple syrup output
that's hockey
sumption now no notoriously as the
instigator rule and how many LGBTQ on
two spirited communities and parades
that we have here in college okay why
the hell are you crying
Queens on your dollar okay no more of
this Justin Trudeau everybody wants
stupid no it's not let's just do what's
right I don't know what we keep mate no
we really should learn from our mistakes
need a bad decision better by the way
learning for mistakes hit the
notification bell I should just say the
not the I hate when people it's the
notification buff you're subscribed on
YouTube and you're watching this live
stream surgeons don't really mean
anything so here the notification bells
sometimes you don't get that either so
really the only way to support the show
is join Mudd Club lot of CARICOM /mo
Club you get the full hour this show
that you see on Thursday you get it
every single day so this has been this
has been in the news a lot this week
yeah and sometimes there's needless
drama but I do think that this is
indicative of an undercurrent that's
important not not only her we've had all
these people on the show so I want to
try and be be fair but some
conservatives I tossed their lot in here
Tommy
Leron said that conservatives need to
the head of the fairy Raiders Fox law
who in reality is a half Thai man who's
in a homosexual relationship with a
black guy is the subcultures definition
of Hitler
[Music]
I guess go through all the effort of
dancing get him show up when we go there
we go there you go there you go look at
him he's a gamer he's that he's willing
to come in and and make it up now for
those of you saying
what's happening let me fill you in this
so our next guest first up you can
follow him on twitter at master zelich's
z e L o X or for Canadians they say Zed
Zed which I've got into a fight with my
I got gotten into a fight with my
professor about that in school as you
should have correct me Zed and I said
ABCD efg hijk LMNOP QRS TUV wxy Z Zed
and the teacher said you're out you're
out about it our next guest is there's a
subculture classified as furries now I
had encountered this you know this at a
Western Michigan flea market at one
point and I had no idea what was going
on so subculture with I guess there a
lot of misconceptions I have to be
honest I don't know exactly what the
furry subculture is most people think
it's a sex thing I've heard it's not
necessarily but our next guest actually
there's there are several different
layers there because he is to the right
of center of most furries and so he's
deal had to deal with some ostracization
there so uh masters masters Alex thank
you for being here sir absolutely thank
you for having me
well I'm glad to have you so now okay
Marley was dead to begin with right
let's set the stage here I have to
acknowledge when I don't know what I
don't know explain to me the free
subculture is a lot of us think it's is
it people who dress up like animals and
go gangbusters no no that's a small
portion but you'll find a small portion
of most of anything in the subculture
actually okay
Fairey essentially is anyone who
identifies as such becomes or ten
integrates into the subculture what a
fairy is is someone who enjoys
characters that have animals with human
characteristics okay also known as
anthropomorphic characters right and if
you enjoy those characters in different
mediums movies books shows all kinds of
things then you can self-identify with
the label of furry and be one okay so
now are
masters Oxford you prefer zelich's quo
that looks is okay zelich's thank you
well we casual are you do dress like
this all the time like do you work like
this are you going to work like this or
is this something you do as a hobby this
is ah okay interesting question okay it
is a hobby for some it's a lifestyle for
others it's a aspect of being for many
okay for me I've been a fairy since I
was 12
the majority of my life I I created to
this this costume myself and I wear it
on occasion but only occasionally okay
so you sure you're not going you're not
going to work you're not going into your
day job dressed as this absolutely not
well I don't know here's what I will
tell you the weirdest thing that I'd
ever see it was afraid of flea market
okay and this was a person dressed up
like a fox hmm but the weirdest part to
me was this person was just going
through a flea and I'd never encountered
this before and not a Jerry knows the
story but he had the Fox outfit and then
he had a button-down and breeches over
the Fox up like it was the Foxes casual
Friday and I was growing yes I didn't so
so this is the Fox in work clothes is
that pretty common because we're several
layers deep into the your guess is as
good as mine at that point human
characteristics its wearing clothing
okay doesn't need to it has fur it would
be absolutely pointless and too hot it
has human characteristics okay so this
is so it seems to be like for a lot of
it this is more of a at least even if
it's a lifestyle this isn't necessarily
you're not pushing legislatively to have
furry bathrooms it's it's it's it's fun
it's it's it's dress-up it's fun some
people feel it's a release for some
people oh yes it's it's a skype ism is
enjoyment it is for many a way to enjoy
and express themselves like comic-con
yes okay got weird to me
but okay there are a lot of adults and
as a result there are adult aspects of
the cub subculture of course you get
these kind of things well you will also
find
within the subculture a far more
significant proportion of GLBT ie etc
individuals yes well that was going to
be my follow-up question what would you
wager percentage-wise people are into
the whole furry thing just for the the
kinky stuff just for the kinky stuff I
would say none okay because you are you
are focusing solely on the kinky you
have to remember there is the the
enjoyment aspect the personality the
enjoyment of animals so there's all of
these other concepts right okay so for a
would you say percentage-wise let me
rephrase percentage-wise of people who
are attracted to the sexual component to
it more than the expression of fun well
what would you say percentage-wise are
people who are out there having fun
dressing up versus people who are
primarily attracted to you know the the
furry sex parties I I can't even pretend
to imagine I could know that number
unfortunately well this is this is this
is how people perceive it obviously and
a big part of it because of the LGBTQA
IP push so I know obviously you don't
you're I don't believe here a part of
that community
you are more how would you describe
yourself conservative libertarian
right-leaning
I am a left-leaning libertarian and I
would describe myself as part of that
group actually oh really okay I
apologize I got it no that's not
entirely and it's fine why do they why I
all the hate why are people so angry
with you I mean I had to do some digging
to make sure that none of the claims
were true on us I see a Star of David
there you know Nazi crazy all right err
this is what they've said to you about
you and I know you've had some backlash
just for expressing different opinions
so if you are a part of that community
and you're left leading libertarian and
you're a furry why don't you get the
Hall Pass in the fairy subculture the
Overton Window is so far left and it was
left to begin with but in the last few
years ever since the election of Trump
it has been pushed further left and
further authoritarian as a result anyone
moderately left centrist libertarian
conservative all of these individuals
are getting targeted and told that
they're Nazis their views are bad they
need to leave the subculture okay so
they want you at what how do they Doc's
a furry do they do they figure I mean do
you all know each other's identities or
is it generally kept from each other in
the community and you only live under
these kind of pseudonyms huh how are
they able to find or have they have they
banned your furry
identity character as a word yes because
the the fairy identity in character is
you it is it is your expression or the
self within the community okay so you
couldn't for but but do some freeze to
have different furry outfits different
furry characters oh yes absolutely there
are many who have multiple open they
flip constantly but you tend to know who
they are so if you were to change let's
say an outfit if you were to build
something you think they would still
know I wouldn't want to sew looks is me
right
well yeah you shouldn't listen if you
shouldn't have to especially I would
think kind of the last fashion if say of
safe space for being a little different
it would be I'm sure you and I don't
like it but a whole lot but I would
think like they should be taking anyone
that anyone they can get
all-encompassing that's it this is
bizarre that's the most bizarre
component of this to me if you can
believe that it's has gotten to an
extreme the last year or so I would say
all kinds of interesting things have
been happening in the subculture the the
cutting back on freedom of speech and
expression that there have been numerous
individuals who've told jokes and then
from the drugs they have had their
panels in their event banned as furry
conventions and they can't present
anymore they can't run things because
they're said an inappropriate joke once
okay
forgive me here but you're dressed and I
don't I don't know what this is oh is it
a wolf sort of cut would you just write
yeah I okay well they don't need to risk
Fabri to give it a single word okay all
right so so then I don't think it's the
kind of guy who's easily finished so let
me put it this way you're dressed in a
hybrid wolf horn costume at a furry
convention with other people some of
whom are having sex dressed in animal
what Oh what could be considered a joke
so offensive that it's ban worthy do you
recall your Anne Frank
drugs video yes yes that would be it not
a high tolerance for Anne for the Anne
Frank genre of humor the furries I if
you went to a furry convention I believe
he would be called a Nazi oh no doubt
yeah the categorization of Nazis is so
extreme that there is an individual Len
Gilbert he's written the book out of the
ruins the main character of this book is
a soldier from our world he's
transported to a furry world and many
antropomorphic creatures around there
the character happens to be a part of
the world war ii german army okay in
this fictional book he is now a nazi
right he's been doxxed harassed his
works been called all kinds of horrible
things because yes like the last furry
castle a scriptwriter for that would be
would be banned ah
potentially I don't know what that think
of just boot okay let's make sure to
clear the air because you'll have people
say you're a Nazi let me let me make
sure
uh you don't hate Jews correct you know
you don't believe anyone is racially
inferior no you don't believe in
nationalized socialism to the great
nation of Germany undermined Fuhrer no
okay so okay listen listen folks I did
my due diligence I'm sure I'd be a
little bit wildered with with what's the
answers let me ask you this too because
I know having done some research and
listen I'm sure you can appreciate that
for me this is going into a dark
internet wormhole some of this stuff I
did find out that there's a no lying
thank you for your candor in alignment
with an toughie and the furries it
almost like you seems kind of with
hats and black lives matter and and and
March 4:15 it's it's this odd
amalgamation and it seems like that's
permeated the furry community as far
political activism am I getting that
right why absolutely you are in fact
it's it's not just activism it is
recruiting and attempting to prove that
they're right and it has gotten to the
point where one of the major very
subculture specific websites broke its
own terms of service to change the code
of conduct instantly without warning to
remove several groups of people and
several people who have been performing
things off sites that they didn't agree
with okay and now and what's in there
banning them because they're both yes
absolutely okay it's primarily two
groups the three Raiders and alt furry
now old furry the name is a joke it's a
parody of the Opera and the fairy
Raiders are a group of fairy individuals
who are friends or as freighters come
from I'm gonna have to call you on that
what is what's the meaning the furry
Raiders it comes from Second Life it was
founded in Second Life and they would
raid particular areas and do some
trollish type drugs oh okay and they're
all Nazis because they wear an armband
with the paw print on it the head of the
furry Raiders Fox Law who in reality is
a half Thai man who's in a homosexual
relationship with a black guy is the
subcultures definition of Hitler I don't
know what to do with that and here's the
thing usually we have some kind of a
call to like I don't think there's much
we can we can do to help you being able
to talk about this at all is assistant
okay you know like free Tommy Robin so
we just come off that was like listen we
don't I don't know the Thai guy I don't
know his gay black lover uh and I don't
know so yes there's nowhere I can direct
people absolutely okay
a good example of you speaking of
anti-fur in the fairy subculture would
again be back to furaffinity that they
have been banning people who have been
speaking out against domestic terrorist
recruiting on-site right because one
thing is true about fairies
they are mostly disenfranchised social
outcasts I would imagine yeah as a
result it's a very palatable area for
this kind of ideology to recruit from
there it sits there in an area trying to
have escapism trying to enjoy themselves
the perfect place for propaganda to take
place I would imagine and and a lot of
people gonna give me flak for this I
would imagine that the the prototypical
furry is someone who was probably a
social outcast like you said probably
very intelligent as opposed to social
outcasts who might join gangs or who
might just turn to drugs it's probably
somebody who's now cast with an overly
active creative mind and so this is an
outlet it's a way to express themselves
where they feel safe so I would imagine
that would be fertile recruiting grounds
because you're looking for people who
are carrot you know a lot of people can
become charismatic in character or in
another and my brother was that way in a
lot of comics he's to work with we're
very very nervous before going on stage
and they had these personas and they
were incredibly intelligent but a lot of
them were very needy you know and I
would imagine that's probably very
similar with a lot of people on a
practical question how do you beat the
summers because it's hot as Satan's butt
crack down here and I don't think you
would see many furries in Texas that's
true what do you do come to Australia we
have incredibly hot summers which I
believe are worse than Texas
occasionally yeah and what you do is in
the large fur suits if you happen to see
them first suits are a very subculture
specific term for the mascot costumes
designed of your character okay you have
a couple of fans and you live with it I
mean I appreciate the explanation but
it's kind of what I would have guessed
first suits meant I mean it's not like
it's not like there was a curveball okay
well alright so there
and they would probably have like a
there's some kind of a fanning mechanism
in there yes yes there's a couple of
computer phones easily in the muscle
area okay all right well listen I
appreciate what listen I would love to
have you back and I listen I first off
legislatively the second furry if furry
start pushing for different bathrooms or
teaching kids about freedom I'm yeah I'm
gonna have some disagreements and I
think you understand that we've got a
same relationship with with Blaire white
but I hate to hear that you're
ostracized from a community just for
having different views certainly is a
more left-leaning libertarian so you are
at masters ELYX
Z elo X and do you educate come back
this has been illuminating for me even
if I don't get it
even if I'm not on board with all of it
I appreciate you helping us out
understanding this usually this is the
point where I would tell you to
subscribe or hit the notification bell
up there because subscriptions don't
mean a whole lot on YouTube but if
you've been signed up now at lotto with
credit comm slash mug club for all the
daily content to support us there's
probably there's not a pitch I can make
here that'll work so let me just tell
you this I have a cat in my basement
right now if you don't subscribe it
louder with CARICOM slash mug club to
support this content I am going to kill
him if you don't subscribe this cat in
my basement will die
they wanna you wanna hug you wanna hurt
yourself i'm not a republican
i'm republican and uncle sam hog
time for another edition of change my
mind where we sit down for hopefully
productive conversations on
controversial topics and uh hear from
you in the comments section
now sometimes it's hard to find voices
of opposition willing to engage in
conversations so
this week we reserved a booth at the
texas state democratic convention
and that sets the stage for this
edition's premise america is superior to
all of the countries
changed my mind we also saw some
familiar faces
who became friends and they might
surprise you hey danielle how are you
good to see you good to see you danielle
i don't i don't look as as polished as
you i'll give you that right away i've
already had my chance at your table
i'm going to give others a chance i
appreciate it glad to see you danielle
now
for this topic this isn't just lip
service i genuinely believe the united
states to be the greatest country on
earth
what you're about to see are three
people who tried to change my mind what
was your name
marilyn mays marilyn mays stephen
crowder nice to meet you nice to meet
you stephen so
i just i just want to make sure that
just to recap here i said i believe the
united states is still the greatest
country in the world superior to all
other
countries in my opinion you're welcome
to change my mind and you said
last week maybe but this week an
all-time low what do you mean
this week last last week and even this
week we're at all time low
okay you know i'm just so
exhausted over these children these
toddlers being taken
yeah and i need you to help me
understand
why we would take babies and
toddlers because in the work i do
it looks to me like since the russians
won't give us babies
they're going to take the little
children that just came here and adopt
them out
since the who won't give us babies
russians you know the deal fell through
in trump towers
that's what you think it was about
that's a joke yeah all right well it
matters before we get
because you're obviously aware of
trump's exec trump's executive order now
i am okay so now they're not going to be
separated they're going to be detained
together so is that progress
as of this morning they still are well
yeah it takes a while but
are you happier about that i was i was
really happy about it
and then when i saw the loopholes the
loophole that right after
you know that that last paragraph at the
very end
not paragraph the last phrase at the
very end and i went same stuff different
day
yeah and then melania's jacket
yeah well let me ask you though so this
has been a week that obviously you
disagree with some you know the obama
and clinton policies the flora's
consent policy so your problem isn't
with trump it's with the clintons and
obama's but
um let me ask you this does that change
do you disagree
with the premise that the united states
is the greatest country in the world
that it's superior to all other
countries
or is it just that you're a little worn
down from the newsweek
i think we're falling in stature i think
that i mean we we've been following i've
been upset since g7 okay
i've been falling apart since g7 because
how would we do our allies like that
this man is just
dismantling america the respected we
have
i can remember last year and the year
before born on cruises
and pete just being having them
apologize
for this country i've never had to
apologize for my country
i'm a veteran i don't understand thank
you for your service
and you know it's like i'm up here
having apologize for what
because people say for trump how so
because he's a humiliation he's an
embarrassment he don't know the king's
english
okay he cannot hold a decent
conversation
i don't believe he went to wharton
school of business i think somebody else
took his test
he is ignorant because you know a lot of
people would send folks to take their
tests back in the day
yeah i had a guy who actually he would
do that when he would weigh in for
wrestling practice he had a twin brother
and they would wait he would his brother
would weigh in but let me ask you i get
that you're not a fan of donald trump
and there are a lot of things that i'm
not a fan of is either but
i probably support more policies of his
than you do but not all of them
um but again i want to go back to the
premise today is the united states is
the greatest country in the world
uh what do you apologize people for how
do you believe we're inferior to other
countries or what country do you believe
is better than the united states
i feel like like
great britain and france and canada
i feel like those countries are making
us
i mean are taking the high road and i
feel like
everything i believed in is slipping
away from me
and i've just been distraught these past
two weeks but everything i believed in
when i first fell apart is the night
when i realized about eight o'clock that
evening that trump was gonna win
and i thought okay i'm gonna work with
him you know because he's my
commander-in-chief i'm gonna try to get
with him
i appreciate that but then he just kept
being more and more ignorant man stop
you from
yes really quickly so i don't want to
interrupt but i want to make sure that
we this keeps falling off if you see it
i know this is you don't want to see
what's under here no jawline
um so you mentioned canada britain and
france so you believe they're better
than the united states let me ask you
this you said everything you believe in
is disappearing
uh you're a veteran um did you serve to
protect freedom of speech
i did so what about the fact that those
countries don't have freedom of speech
only the united states does but you know
what
that's not what i see right now you know
you only you only get caught up in what
you see
no no no no no it doesn't matter what
you see as far as when i was there well
no but
we haven't constantly constitutionally
enshrined here in canada
the uk france people are jailed for
speech for offensive things
or fined that doesn't happen in the
united states we have a constitutional
right to freedom of speech they
don't so wouldn't you say that the
united states
certainly as a veteran if you're serving
to protect freedom of speech is superior
to those countries
if only because we're the only country
with freedom of speech but it
why i'm so distraught it looks like
we're getting ready to lose
it i mean anyway he's playing footsie
with with uh
with with kim and putin and you know
applauding kim for wiping out three
generals the day before he came and
you know his people sit up you know when
i see that i get nervous because it
looks like
if nobody puts that dude in check we're
going to lose
everything and it's just i'm just sad
well i understand that you're sad and
i'm sorry
i don't want to see anyone sad that
you're feeling this way but i'm hearing
a lot of how you feel but i don't think
that's really objective reality freedom
of speech is
actually not being eroded here like it
is no not
unless the left unless the democrats
would have their way they support hate
speech laws
republicans are the ones who've defended
against it on campus they're the ones
banning points of view
because they're because they're
connected well you might need to read
some
might need to put some conservative
sites in your bookmarks so you can read
both sides because
i'm an ardent defender of freedom of
speech and as a matter of fact i've had
people try to silence me
people here who for i feel like we've
had a good conversation people
here at this very er this very
convention who threatened to firebomb me
slash my tires
just for me speaking out no because
they're liberals
i'm a liberal i would never do that to
you well then take it up with them
i would never do that to you well thank
you very much see we're more closer
friends than me and then no
yeah i mean i mean i feel like everybody
has a right to say what they want to say
but it's like when you start being
offensive and hurting people
you know that's when i started getting
nervous but but it's still protected
that's why that's why just not in the
country as you mentioned
and so it's like it's like everything i
believed in is slipping but does that
would you say that this is some progress
in our conversation it seems to me i'm
not suggesting all that you're ignorant
i'm canadian so i'm very aware
no but the point is you suggested these
other countries it doesn't seem like you
were totally aware that they don't have
freedom of speech i wasn't
so does that change your opinion no
you'd want to live in a you think a
country with no freedom of speech is
superior to the united states
see that would be just where we disagree
i think they're inferior with no freedom
of speech
i just think that we have a pig for
president and he's making us look bad
all over the world he's ignorant
and i just wish that he would
you know i know he is who he is and he
deserves to be who he is
but it just is so everything that i
thought of that a president ought to be
he's not and he's so rude and crude
around the edges and he's
well i'll tell you what i say this
respectfully because i still respect him
as a president
but for me i mean i felt that way about
president barack obama i felt as though
he didn't think he was born in wherever
that was trump lied about did you
what was that no i don't think he was
born in kenya no no no no no
i just think he was a terrible president
but i respect the office and i think i
respect that you feel that way
to king's english and he knew the law
this dude don't know nothing
i mean he's i don't even think he's a
good businessman yeah bankruptcy
we have record low unemployment record
high job participation
we're doing very well what a wages
they're growing really well we have the
highest
as a matter of fact do you are you
surprised to learn that the united
states has the highest wages in the
world
average income not surprised about that
okay so that's a good thing
about that and that's a very good thing
and i'm happy about that but
my thing is okay trump you didn't marry
american
trump you didn't um um you've got
all those immigrants working for you
most of the people that work for trump
yeah but there's a difference between
legal and illegal immigrants but i know
it but what about americans
i mean you you so pro-american let's
let's see
americans with most of these jobs and i
know it's all these jobs that americans
don't want to do
i know that i get that but it's just
that
i'm just i appreciate you taking that
i'm sorry to see you sad i
was can i give you one piece of advice
don't play so much so much
credence in one man you know i mean
you're you're responsible for your own
happiness it's not the state it's not
the government
do you have a family just destroyed
everything but you have a family
i love my folks you have a good family
yes focus on your family and focus on
your health
i do think even though i didn't like
barack obama i did notice a lot of
people right were so miserable and i
thought everything was over listen
it's one man we have safeguards in this
country
it's one man in the freedom caucus but
my point is you can still choose to be
happy i don't hate you
i don't hate you and i'm a conservative
republican i'm very happy to meet
somebody like you
and some of my good friends are
republicans you know and we agree to
disagree
it's just that this was a bad two weeks
yeah i can understand how it would be
rough for you
you know babies you know the work i do i
represent children as their guardian
and i see what it does when you move a
child and i know the parents are at
fault for bringing them here
and i know that people don't want to
clinton for signing the policy and obama
then for doubling back and not enforcing
it
exactly and so i realized that if
you've got to pay to play in the world
and sometimes you've got to invest money
in these other countries to keep them at
home
and i know that that's a problem okay
that's the first thing i learned in
political sciences sometimes you got to
pay to play
and if you're not willing to invest in
keeping those folk at home
and that's another monster because if we
get off into that our soldiers get
killed and it's another big ole miss
so i'm just saying oh i'm sorry well
thank you for taking
who want to you want to hug you want a
hug

pray for barack obama as well i think we
share a lot of common ground
i don't want him to be like me i pray
for him to be who he is
but he's just so destructive in my eyes
and i realized that we were we were
raised under different circumstances
you know we come from a different world
but i just
okay i guess you could be more like jeb
bush
that's all i'm saying i don't think jeb
bush wishes he could be more like jeb
bush he's such a wiener

this country has just gone down the
drain
how so well look what's happening donald
trump is the most
despicable i don't even have words or
adjectives
to describe this man and to see what
he's done and knowing what i came from
and how i saw my country deteriorate
under corrupt african rule which it did
unfortunately i mean there's no getting
away from it oh no i understand leaving
in their droves
it's still terrible today with their
their laws and farmers
what they're doing to the farmers and
you know i see it's not in so much of
farmers it's
just the whole infrastructure of the
country has disintegrated and my family
all live there

i've had
reasonable opportunities you know my
daughter's been able to go to college
which she would have done in south
africa anyhow
um
i cannot begin to tell you
how angry i am
with white spanish
republicans who are are not even looking
at the other side of the slate and are
now
that's why i'm here learning what this
man is doing
condoning it i mean who tears children
apart well

fundamental fundamental premise that the
united states
is the best country in the world you

with the jesus okay so what examples of
countries would you say are superior to
the united states i guess to start

it is actually a huge part of the new
Big Brother program oh yeah it's all
just a van
a San Francisco man by the way who knew

he reported that unprompted and this is
the kind of thing gives me shivers mmm

Wolfie
[Music]
close one beer rationing is actually
starting it's unrolling in Europe to a
carbon dioxide crisis NBC at least five
gas producers in northern Europe began a
plan shut down during the early summer
months to resolve maintenance issues it
deals with co2 that what is what is
Northern Europe exactly spent that way I
guess every come to that's north north
of Italy what it will be BB Germany
there will be Iowa and not Italy so the
non-greasy wants you know basically
countries that has some somewhat
financially stable yeah so they're going
for co2 this is what they're doing now
the government rationing of beer come
and take it but you really come and take
it that they can't do anything we have
no second amendment a prepper in Europe
oh yeah homeless person you not purchase
a gun to protect it if you did you
couldn't talk about it yeah distinguish
them from the hobos the grocery carts
the Scots it's got to be I can't shoot
myself I can't stab myself I can't drink
myself to death know if these little
mission cars I can't even suck on the
exhaust that just gives me okay I can't
really kill myself on the Tesla I can't
even afford both rivers not gonna be
named get let me suck on his exhaust
he's got a schedule to keep
I don't want to kill myself without pain
[Laughter]
always runnin late it's socialism
that's all quit like you live it to my
wife she shows up truancy officer with a
stick it's gotta be miserable there I'm
so glad that you get out of there
hundred years ago we repaid what we left
we've yeah we saw this coming in fact
wasn't about tea it was about beer but
from this America actually to say that
with
found sobriety Europeans woke up across
the entire continent saying wow soccer
does suck so the one guy who shows that
what the flask issue as you spit it all
of a cookie dough here's one thing we
notice when I went to Austin better we
went to Austin and we saw these puppies
billboards roll out have you seen these
you know you that's right you didn't go
there son computer it's it's a billboard
for it for HIV pills they've been
popping up across the country there's
one F without fear that's it where's
that billboard if they're not get your I
think it's in that LA that particularly
in Lawson of course it is they're not
even hiding it do you realize that if we
were to do a joke a sketch F without
fear for HIV we got more flak for a much
more tame wishbone parody history of the
AIDS HIV story exactly so we look at a
peppery so the billboards a big part of
this in Washington DC it's their plan to
get the HIV rate down they want to get
more uninfected people on prep PR EP
it's a to medicine combination pill that
apparently that prevents HIV I think
it's just a pill that you put in your
your pee hole it doesn't let the avian
it's really more of a making it I don't
know why they call it a pill why are we
spending money on that I don't know how
many years later we snow better we're
still funding those dams here's a real
estate I understand drugs after you have
it yes sure I don't think it should get
as much funding as cancer or diabetes or
diabetes or all corners like it but
we're spending money on awareness
billboards to prevent it just don't have
unprotected anal sex with random dudes
in a truck stop that's it that's
entirely preventable argument do you
guys it I always said what bothers me
most about this people get so mad
because it's politically incorrect how
often you hear when people talk about
sharks like oh you know
he's struck by lightning then suffer
stuff the spiders more afraid of you
then why are we using argument you're
more likely to be struck by lightning
attacked by a shark on land then get
hiv/aids if you're not having
unprotected sodomy in truck stops with
strangers or using intravenous drugs
without cleaning needles your chance
like it's simple what else can you do
the truck stop though wait a second you
you go to the truck stop and you just
get gas flapjacks but okay but where are
you but where do you get your heroin I
don't so you bring your heroin with you
to the truck stop and your pool Lou and
have sex with him afterward no what are
you a monk they assume the rest of the
world is just like them it's I mean it's
just it just just that's that's none of
your van HIV we don't need a billboard
we don't need a pill sorry we're the
jerks for bringing it up by the way it
says F without fear
I don't like they can say that but we
can't say it's preventable
yesterday's medical terminology is
today's hate speech and today's hate
speech is tomorrow's colloquialism when
they admit it dull is a British knife
[Laughter]
the problem yourself speaking of places
that are silly one of Canada's biggest
music festivals now is on pause because
of a protected bird it's known as the
kill dear lovely name and a burp of the
nest of four eggs that cannot be removed
without federal permission come from CNN
it says I have to say this is one of the
most challenging problems we've ever
been presented with recently the
executive director of Bluesfest told
reporters but the festival organisers
it's it's it seems silly but they're
actually really hopeful of their chances
because when you can fix the situation
everyone is everyone is happy that's
that's ideal and tell them was that they
enlisted the help of I think we have him
here to talk about the Canadian fiasco
Dennis Rodman Dennis Rodman thank you
for being there sir I'm just so happy
okay that's great but how are you
solving the problem I got so many death
threats I love this bird I'm believing
this bird right here I believe it is
been loyal he took everything I took
everybody think they could throw at me
and I'm still standing right here with
this bird
yeah no I'm not sure that's bird is oh
this bar can't even go old like me he
didn't need to go home he already home
is in Britain in Canada you know a fetus
clump of cells yeah Burt a stop stop the
festival yeah you say bird eggs Oh bird
egg you said bird day when these guys
said it's the biggest problem they've
ever been faced with a pretty sheltered
lives
[Laughter]
that's what's the realm of pain in
history well let me think uh we didn't
fight off the royalty we know but we
just we did our potato boys we had our
potato we said okay to the royalty we
kissed the ring we still have them on
felt the queen and her money one time
weren't really a country it burned down
the White House you guys were pretty mad
about that and then we had a real
problem with some bird eggs yeah yeah
that was a big one by the way thanks for
providing all the National Defense
America hey one thing actually before I
move on I was talking with this know
maybe someone out there can help me no
doctors I've been able to describe this
to me I have one extra muscle on my left
side here yeah I don't have on my right
tell you a bit of a free that's a hole
no one likes a bragger extra it's
totally non-functional and I went into
specialists or they were like I don't
know have you done anything useful with
it Jimmy I do just concern that is when
you go to a doctor you'll get something
wrong here's just a gross lie and I'm
not sure that they do a screening
actually I was told till I was age 12 by
old white people at church that black
people were faster because they had
extra muscle in their leg oh yeah I
heard that one I had a teacher tell me
yeah that's not true I had a teacher in
high school tell me that he said till 12
it was at least 21 farts not believing
she wasn't a teacher my father's teacher
in Detroit taught him and this was
taught in schools that black people had
larger posteriors to retain water and
region this was no this was this was
Darwinism yeah we're gonna see they have
those small muscles in the leg so they
can walk easier to Europe all right so
listen we talking more about
polarization kind of who bears the brunt
for most of it with with dr. Peterson
next I think I think a big part of this
we've talked about I do you think it's
exclusive to the left III just says I'm
not gonna do the cop out I don't think
everyone is copping out when they do it
I think some people are but I know it
would be disingenuous of me to say it's
balance if there's not a give-and-take I
think it exists exclusively on the left
and we deal with it all the time I think
a big part of this so before we get to
that is the polarization that people
complain about which in and of itself is
not necessarily a bad thing is how out
of touch the left is and we've seen it
this week more than ever I think
whatever in my lifetime I would say
would you say that probably something
you're what you say in your left
absolutely pretty insane right now
Jarrod would you say 7% yeah I would say
kind of we talked with under Obama race
relations where the worst had ever been
in our lifetime with black lives matters
now it's all the relations well I think
there's an out of touch and is from the
left and the rest of America that has
never occurred
I want your Freeway if you if you if you
actually understand what I'm talking
about if you sense it out there's
palpable what am i talking about how out
of touch are they with the rest of
America up this is the world they live
in a sampling I even thought hey maybe
we'll talk about Donald Trump much
tonight and then he opened his mouth and
all manner of stupid came out and I'm
not joking when I say I would feel more
comfortable if Cersei Lannister was
running this country at this way what
would you say to him no I
what Sato might say you you're probably
the worst president than any country's
ever had I know this news is very
painful for a lot of people it feels
like for the next 30 years America is
gonna change in a horrible direction in
some ways it feels like all hope is dead
nothing can bring it back in 2017 when
we had the worst president in the
history of the United States
administration officials have been
sending babies and other young children
0:03 tender-age shelters in South Texas
lawyers and medical providers
I'm gonna have to hand this off okay
they just assume people are on board
remember Oprah was talking to we
couldn't find the video clip Oprah was
terrible I know things are bad out there
right now here's those things really are
unemployment the lowest in almost 20
years job participation rate is
extraordinarily I people have more money
in their paychecks than our lifetime
that's bad actually
this creates polarization we have people
going all right here's the worst
president ever and even when they're not
being aggressive you have a lot of
Americans there they're coming home from
payday and they're Washington opening
their check with their letter over
Washington me Kimball going that's my
money that's what hopeless this feels
like Stephen that's what you more money
exactly it's crazy to me as he claimed
are living under fascism look the
supreme court was a big thing yeah
what here's what's so good about this
yesterday but I didn't think I put fine
enough a point on it quite literally all
of the major decisions that people are
pissed about ruled in favor of freedom
and choice freedom to choose to join a
union freedom to choose this doesn't
destroy unions and it doesn't destroy
Pro abortion clinics it's like hey I
don't want to have to pay a union that's
fine I don't want to join a union that's
they're mad at the yes parents I don't
want to have to promote abortion
services you can do that I want to
create an abortion clinic how this is
fascism there's no I don't understand
this you know what I think you know what
I hope dies in this country what he's
talking about is dead and pardon my
language your ideology that's what's
dead up in the s bomb where we sitting
there's fun well the thing is that the
rulings were in favor of string true
through Constitution BP and so they they
just want activists on those courts and
actually there's a slate piece that just
came out today because I joked about
yesterday sure enough they had a piece
about right now they're proposing you
know next time the Democrat is in power
maybe we could just expand the Supreme
Court you know just yeah this is great
like that is a would be crazy abuse of
the legislative process it'll be crazy
abuse of I mean most insane no wit how
many of course you're changing did you
branch of government but I would imagine
you'd have to use all three branches and
one big giant cluster screw to make it
happen I don't even know if there's a
schoolhouse rock for this there's not
there's no file but we were joking about
that yesterday and they're saying let's
fundamentally let's create remember up
when gridlock was a bad thing by the way
floor did a gridlock in Washington know
Barack Obama had the house had this said
he had that when he study at everything
in wanted he couldn't get it done why
because of his crazy policies also
gridlock is beautiful yes that's what's
but now that when a creek gridlock in
the court what we need the grip gridlock
was terrible but now the ends justify
the means well what's the ends to make
sure that you have to join a union and
promote abortion
this can't be Nazi Germany you're coming
for the gays what's next none taxpayer
subsidized HIV prevention pills what do
I have to have stop having anal sex and
truck stops with strangers I'm not an
animal
god forbid yeah not on the Iowa not on
my watch Pol Pot and what happened cups
full ratings aren't 47% on par with
Barack Obama's at this point in his
brother pretty good despite unlike Obama
you're wondering his own water on this
one which I think that's to me that's
one great wonderful wonderful thing
about the Trump residency is that it is
just diminish the power of the media
they realize they just can't they don't
have an influence member remember that
one clip we played a long time ago Larry
King talked about the media's role I
think is lurking I don't think they can
influence elections yeah they don't like
presents anymore that's why they're
getting so pissed off is because they're
realizing it they have less influence
now than they have ever had all hope is
lost I mean in this and you pull I was
about to try it but I realize I can't do
Trevor Noah's acts because it's not like
a really South African accent this new
poll that we just had with the approval
it's politically incorrect to smoke a
cigar it's politically correct to smoke
weed with this shows how sick our
society is that there's been a war on
cigars but not on marijuana all right
very glad to have our next guest as you
may know some people right away will be
incredibly offended triggered this is
one time two also can get a long shot
here yeah where we covered up our
sponsor Walther they're not gonna be
happy but they don't care they're good
sports with our next guest book of
course Exodus Exodus but the rationale
Bible we've talked with him about that's
before he's also a big cigar guy and
pipe guys so today the entire episode
he's going to teach us the ins and outs
and also mattock and the loaded could go
weird places a little bit of the
legislative fight with with cigars very
different yet the weed folks but still
very real you can follow them on twitter
at dennis prager mr. Prager how are you
sir great to be with you my friend
and I wish I could smoke with you right
now
funny because later today I'm doing my
fire my weekly fireside chat know where
a lot of thank God a lot of people watch
and I smoke a cigar the entire time cuz
I'm in my house right right now I'm at
my radio studio I just finished my my
national radio show so I can't smoke
here but I do within the house I have a
great wife who's totally at peace with
it now by so I I am gonna give you more
philosophy of cigars than you believe
exists okay well let's get it we'll get
into that but first we have to we have
to like this this puppy what are you
well because son computers in here
didn't know if anyone this is just the
standard brick house cigar which
actually for the money isn't is not a
bad cigar in my opinion my favorites are
I think I totally the the Melania I like
a lot I like the the Espanola Residence
Life you know and here haven't you heard
she's been cooped up some button
somewhere he's a but this is just
something that's a little less offensive
for people in the room because you know
sensitive Constitution so it's a normal
brick house the Churchill length yeah
gotcha so I want you to know I tweeted
this out last month by sheer chance I
came across an article
morning news they interviewed the oldest
American I think the guy's 111 or
hundred thousand black guy the black guy
is in the Armed Forces they asked him
they said look we know you're always
asked this but we'll ask you anyway
what's the secret to your longevity and
the guy without blinking just simply
said God and cigars I said this is my
man if he's right I'm going to 116 there
you go what I love about him - he
doesn't get it exactly in first up it
looks like he's smoking very bottom
shelf cigars if you wash it and he goes
thinking is about well that smoke
monster
I don't inhale I do it the healthy way
we're like well I don't know if you'd
say the healthy way but it's certainly
less harmful than inhaling yeah shows me
and he's lighting it's not it's not like
a vegetable it's lighting it on his
stove if you want yes if you watch these
like we had before we have to the first
sketch once we had no lighter with us we
had a lighted on an electric stove which
hit spoiler impossible yes so he does do
that if you watch the video go watch it
I'll send it to you after it is video I
read the article I got to watch the
video you're right he's face version of
stuff my father who passed away at 96
would have gave me given the same answer
yeah got it cigars well I don't want him
I don't want to mislead our audience I'm
not I can't make the medical claim that
cigars lead longevity but speaking of
legging letting in our stuff okay so
first off what's the proper way to toast
and light a cigar for Pilar light first
before that we have the biggest of all
philosophical questions regarding a star
what type of hole do you make on the top
yes okay so those people who don't know
it comes wrapped right and you have to
make a hole obviously you can't breathe
in any smoke right so there are three
types a hole cut which I call
circumcision it's just a hole cut right
right the whole time guillotine
yeah guillotine right another one is a
bullet hole where you get a sharp thing
and you die got here a punch right punch
it in and the third is a v cut it's
shaped like a pyramid sort of it's or
viii and you slide the thing across the
bottom it's steel and it makes a
beautiful indentation and it that's my
favorite
at least rick is the whole car yeah you
know what I have a V cutter and I like
it on bigger gauge cigars not for those
who don't know I was mainly a pipe guy
this is something that Nike Gerry myself
I've to pipe is great it is but I you
were the one who got me into cigars more
by he introduced me to some different
kinds I had smoked before cigars before
now I'm not a certainly changed cigar
smoker but I enjoy them very much I have
a V cutter I like that on bigger ring
gauges for people who don't know they're
different you know they gauge it gauge
by ring size in the United States so
50/50 to I think this is a 50 by 7 a
Churchill sized longer it would take a v
cut I typically do it on 54 or large
right to the v-cut and this is a 9
millimeter punch so a little bit bigger
than the standard punch and this I do
it's just totally opinionated a zoom in
on it can we can we get a zoom on this
the reason now I will tell you this mr.
fragran maybe you can correct me the
reason I like this is if a a punch is
sharp and long it won't realize you know
you can get cheap punches but it does
have to be sharp there's no risk of it
crushing anything or compacting
like so if you don't get a good draw
with a punch you're not going to you
won't get a good draw with any cut is
what I've encountered and it's
convenient because I can keep it on my
keychain if I go through TSA so that's
why a man is this there you go oh there
you go look he's got his whole keep
there you go okay well there is that
there you see yes I usually think it's a
bullet yes
yeah I've seen that too then I showed
them you see I twisted it there and you
could see yeah
and they go oh it's just it's just a
circular razor blade you're free to go
exactly the guys don't know they don't
know okay so toasting this because I
want to get this started as we continue
it's alright this is a very tough
question I have bought the idea that you
light it first and then you start
smoking as a soup supposed to puffing in
wild lighting I have no idea whether
that is an old wives tale or old
husband's tale as it as it is or or true
I have no idea okay I do it
now separately I somehow think it's a
waste of time but I do it anyway I
appreciate your candor so would you do
it in a 45 degree angle and toast the
edges show me here I've got the light
going how are you do you put the net
generally you put the lighter at the
angle on this cigar straight out so what
yes okay that's right
and then just realize okay man I do you
want to make it you been do you purge
when you when you open the lighters
being a little bit difficult here trying
to diss on camera do you purge at all
some people I know they do a quick purge
of it because they claim of the butane
might oh my gosh I am I am NOT in that
arena no okay all right now wait now do
it while puffy gaming you'll see how
much faster of course yeah that's
usually a so I'm not sure it's not
nonsense there you go you see look at
that yeah it may be nonsense
it could be nonsense but I really like
it is if I'm at a cigar bar and they've
got you know women walking around
lighting your cigar for you then I'm
happy if they take their time no that's
called hooters
but I will smoke I'm sure that's a
regular restaurant no no I you know you
you ever been to cigar bars where
they're there oh I have I haven't
experienced the first time I ever had a
cigar I look back and I know the person
was measurement and I get to it has a
cigarillo there so that's a soft flame
lighter there um I went there it was the
Chop House in Grand Rapids member that
jerk yeah a great a great little cigar
great little cigar lodge they would give
you half off on your birthday with steak
the best day cuz it I would go and get
the venison medallions was my birthday
I'd never had us to cut off your entire
meal your entire me or to I never had a
cigar before at this point I said I
don't know what should I do they come up
and they offer all the cuts and looking
back I want to say because it was my
birthday they gave me something fancy I
don't something with a lot of Leggero in
it which is free you'll explain to
people very high nicotine looking back
it was it wasn't
Leflore dominicana might have been in
something like an Opus it was absurdly
expensive I didn't enjoyed it all and
then they kicked us out because I said
they have a party coming in so I'm
driving home I don't nothing like and I
have it basically hanging out of my
mouth with the wind going by because my
wife doesn't want this
our smoke in the car like a snorkel
breathing through it non-stop and I got
home by the way I don't I don't smoke in
the car even for me it's too suggested
or under an arena well I like it I like
to rule like you're sitting in now
that's perfect this is what we do we
have some air exchangers in here so the
studio is good long story short I did
not handle that cigar very well the room
was spinning and I got very sick and
then I learned later on about the
different kinds of cigars so yeah I've
been to a cigar lounge once now let me
ask you this we can get into cigar
philosophy and I want to continue with
that one thing I've noticed for sure
though if you're at lounges for example
I was in Florida there's a cigar lounge
or even in northern Michigan it seems
pretty consistent across the board in my
experience anecdotally that you find a
lot of conservatives in the cigar nose
right why do you think that it's because
it's politically incorrect to smoke a
cigar it's politically correct to smoke
weed which just shows how sick our
society is that there's been a war on
cigars but not on marijuana yes this is
not tampered with our brain well with my
pilot smoke the cigar the entire flight
I would be thrilled feed the entire
flight I would not be thrilled smoothest
landing your ass well it's true I think
about every great every great piece of
fiction of the last several centuries
almost all of them nicotine or caffeine
assembly no I'm not saying people should
go out and light up cigars though they
are no no cigarettes will kill you
hourly kill one third of cigarette
smokers according to the Lung
Association die eventually of lung
cancer and I believe that but two-thirds
don't that's also significant too but I
would not smoke cigarettes remember and
this people don't understand that it
drives me crazy when they say war on
tobacco tobacco's not the issue
inhaling is the issue you are not
inhaling now you are bringing the smoke
into your mouth for a taste right not it
to your lungs for a nicotine effect this
is true something else do I actually
have this up in front of me the FDA
finally released and I'm sure you know
about this but I have to talk about us
for audience the FDA released a study
where
finally eliminated people who smoked two
cigars per day or less handmade cigars
because all the previous studies
included people who are smoking swisher
Sweets and basically cigarettes that
look like cigars at at gas stations and
they found that people who smoked two
cigars per day or less the increased
mortality risk of cancer overall is
statistically insignificant
statistically nonsignificant that's very
rare for the FDA to say something like
that I did not know about that when did
that come out I want to brought this oh
darn it well you know what here people
have already a chance to mention my book
there you go Dennis pretty well think
I'm actually a CS Lewis all of these
guys always over piped her cigars back
and they would philosophize they would
get into theory they get into - what's
the word I'm looking for here the real
depth of the sea of life feel at
theology ology I'm not a good ambassador
right now look nicotine makes you dumb
you should smoke weed it's a smart drug
Exodus God slavery and freedom the
rational Bible highly recommended I've
been very much enjoying it here's a
question for you how often are you
supposed to what's the recommended
amount of before you you you you tant
you know tap the apps' great taps the
ash Dennis before it falls on you I feel
like the therapist in that Annie Hall
the important thing LV is to enjoy
ourselves while we're here what's the
point
he wouldn't do his homework no this FDA
study hold on let me bring it up I
believe it was 2016 and it was actually
they finally eliminated they said okay
and a big reason for this is because
there's been a lot of new FDA
regulations people don't know this work
you owe me a favor
seriously sent it to me okay I will and
we have it here as an overlay for people
watching and again I'm not advocating
that people go out there and just start
chain smoking cigars I'm just saying it
is incredibly rare for the FDA to do and
the reason they did it is because of the
obama legislation they wanted to get
tibet cigarettes out of the hands of
children which we agree with but they
included all cigars it turns out kids
aren't smoking $9 cigars and people pan
you know cigar makers that you have long
long storied history with family cigar
rollers and pipe makers that we
shouldn't be treated the same as
marlboro so
the FDA did have to come out and release
that study of two cigars per day early
date on that study I but well what they
do is they examine their studies and
then eliminated those variables let me
bring it up right here I believe it is
2016
the author's reviewed 22 perspective
epidemiology studies and cigars so if
the FDA acknowledges there's no cancer
risk greater risk then I would argue
that for many people it does bring
longevity because of the calming effect
that it has not the marijuana calming
right just the relaxation with its with
a yummy if that's why we do it I do it
for it's because it's yummy
it tastes great I love the taste that's
why I like a pipe I'm sure looking at
your pipes there yeah yeah because I
love the taste of tobacco tobacco is a
yummy thing I can't I don't i've never
inhaled in my life I'm not Bill Clinton
I would happily admit if I did but I
have it I can't I would I coughed my
brains out if I ever inhaled anything
smoky to my lungs
now what God you started into cigars my
father was a cigar smoker he smoked all
day I lived in 96 as I noted to you
mm-hmm
and when I was about 16 he said I said
dad I'd like to taste one he said fine I
know it's a non-issue he said I think if
I'd have said it at 12 he would have
said fine yeah
so I did and I loved it and that was the
that was it so I've been 16 my daddy was
a smoker and his daddy before him his
granddaddy before but he'll be a pipe
smoker dude you will be a pro smoker -
it is well it's migrant for I felt so
guilty because my mom smoked cigarettes
and quit the day she found she was
pregnant and ever again I'm in French
Canadians they every all of them smoked
cigarettes was a huge culture of smoking
cigarettes my grandfather than hand
smoked a pipe and then he moved on to
those cigarillos later on in life when I
was and you know maybe about nine or ten
and I remember I thought it looked so
cool cuz my my grandfather right he's a
coolest guy and it was in the ashtray
but my parents always told me never
smoke never never smoke if you're
offered and I just took it to look like
my grandfather and it was still lit and
I didn't realize and so a little smoke
one in my mouth I felt bad for years I
felt like I had lied to my parents and I
was I might as well been a smoker but on
to me for
haunted me for years but he didn't live
long because he had up he had a blood
clot and he refused to go to the doctors
but he was up until the day he died
close to 80 was super spry and healthy
so how often would you say you you smoke
a cigar dennis prager whoa I spoke with
everyday and I but it's one a day I very
rarely smoke more than one a day i smoke
one a day then I don't also smoked a
pipe full a day so but when I'm writing
which is all the time and when I'm not
broadcasting or flying or speaking yeah
that's that's it's it's my companion and
I and I love it and a lot of people by
the way like cigar the smell of cigar
smoke yeah I do
a lot my wife does she can't stand
cigarettes can't stand them but she
really does like this by the way your
point about the cigar lounge in every
city virtually every city there's a
place to go and smoke cigars right
excuse me and I go all over the country
constantly and the first thing I do is I
go from the airport I rent a car and I
go to a cigar lounge and you know most
of the time somebody they will know who
I am which I'm not looking I'm not
wanting it happens but the beauty is
even when they don't have a clue who I
am they're so friendly yeah is that the
it's such a bonding male experience
cigar smoking yeah
that's what the guys just talk to each
other it's very and it's it's it's a
great experience the whole thing is and
if there's a young guy there I buy his
cigar well that's right well just make
sure to just follow you around the
country that I'll have the padrone 25th
anniversary mr. Prager would you say is
a mark of a good cigar place what do you
look for when you go to a different town
find a new spot oh well I like that it's
that it's not tiny that you know you can
sit down in a very plush chair have it
have your smoke you could be private if
you want you could talk to people if you
want and you could plug in your computer
I do a lot of writing and cigar lounges
so I I just did an event for my Tampa
radio station and in the hand of a
gigantic I mean truly gigantic allows
the you know campus
a big cigar city yeah and they I there
were 200 people there in a cigar lounge
for me to talk to them and of course
they gave out cigars and so on I do a
lot of cigar events around the country
that's I've looked at some of your old
archives like back as far as 2008 and
there's you broadcasting with your
laptop from a cigar lounge and I thought
that that looks like a lot of fun and
it's becoming increasingly rare places
where you can go and do this but it does
seem like the quality establishments
stick around what what in your opinion
is the mark of a good cigar for people
who may not know want to get into it the
the theories really there are only two
answers to that if you like it it's a
good cigar if you don't like it it's not
a good cigar and and that's true for you
know I mean I'm into audio equipment you

were designed for a purpose yeah but
it'll start though I'm so sad and what
will cheer me up though is if people
find a way to be in follow me yet so no
see what happened there question of the
day before we get to NATO topics listen
with the situation with the deportation
of the families the border and Trump
being blamed for it and Facebook and
Twitter the average of politicians are
we supposed to assume that nobody now
has
anymore to actually know where this cop
from where this policy stems will talk
about this with ben shapiro will give
you a brief timeline after this I am
amazed tell me I want to hear from you
guys what you think because a lot of
people started off the week when I can't
believe President Donald Trump did this
and said oh this is effectively been in
effect since 97 what's happened these
pictures are from 2014 what's wrong also
second question do all Asians look alike
I contend that not all but most oh yeah
the vast majority we actually covered a
story that said that I'll talk to you
better in a minute yeah we're gonna talk
about a minute it's part of the funniest
story I've seen all week aside from the
dumpster fire
so to start off with a little good news
a lot of people say sometimes a little
bit dark when you start the show so some
of the sliver of light today Peter Fonda
was ripped from his Beverly Hills home
and shipped to timeshare with Kevin
Spacey so that's a good way to start the
day there we go
Spacey looks a little too happy to be
surprised it's appointed it's not good
for him well I think there's at a
certain point you're so old that you're
young again no it's like high-waisted
jeans fear you're to lose your eyesight
only with confetti so this videos gone
viral this week Democratic US Senate it
you said it at Senate guys got some
Harun no I can't pronounce my words the
Democrats gave a democratic whatever a
Senate a candidate for this US Senate
who's a Democrat Minnesota I've got to
say my name say my name got that one
Minnesota uh this is not a joke Richard
painter
this was his ad in its entirety take a
look
some people see a dumpster fire and do
nothing but watch the spectacle some are
too scared to face a danger or they
think it will benefit them if they just
let it keep on burning others shrug and
say oh all this talk of a dumpster fire
it's just fake boobs there is an inferno
raging in Washington but here in the
land of 10,000 lakes we know how to put
out a fire
hi I'm Richard painter and I approve
this message
so before you get mad at us he has not
had a stroke he is not how no no he's
definitely not out of stroke II there
was an interview may have but he
personally denied it that's that's what
Atticus says when you said interview he
said I was going to bring it up oh we
could say he looks like a Clint
Eastwood screwed a Ron Perlman
then have a stroke yes I'm trying to
think as bad as that ad is apparently
the taping of the the ad was actually
way worse and you know we get our hands
on exclusive foot we have a lot of
plants here at levels Crowder and we
actually have some some real some b-roll
or somehow it takes of some exclusive
footage from that ad some people see it
dumpster fire do nothing but watch the
spectacle some are too scared to face
record low unemployment Rick and a job
participation a booming stock market
intervene the pundits survey three or
four Asian American cities are plagued
by Dempster fans only you can prevent
dumpster fires by voting for me so
dumpster fire is a term that all the
kids are using now it's thermally okay
it's cool the nerd the seed I took a
dump in the fire
Donald Trump took a dump in the fair the
fire it was always burning when trend
started turning
temperature first can we say kirbridge
fear it's easier for me to save and
dumpster fare the buyers the land of a
thousand leaks here in the land of a
million leaks we have a lot of lakes
here in Minnesota at least we used to
the fur all the dumpster fairs is it as
simple as that America I think so when
you think Richard painter Hey
dumpster fair Richard painter for US
Senate because only he can prevent
observers that's why I'm always change
my mind I've talked about this I am the
least objective person at watching
anything that we do that isn't
character-driven yeah I have to trust
you guys in like listen just i can't
watch myself please let me know how this
turns out he had no one around him to
say no this is a disaster zone and they
just got done capitalizing on
embarrassing conservative ads and then
their own team does and i noticed they
do that the leftist blogs has never show
the video they just put on quotes it's
only in quotes they don't want to show
you yeah it's just it's like woat lee
screenshots because they want they've
been cast the film before they've had a
live read speaking of these lines ringo
Fleming by the way the BBC has a new
report on the Arab world's quote only
gay radio station station plays music
and issues are discussed in depth but
LGBTQ contributors LGBTQ they haven't
added the QIO a little on the they don't
identify themselves as sexually active
on-air come to the roof so really um if
you actually listen to radio it's it's
just gay karaoke with the lyrics changed
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
like okay well I'll just have to take
your word for it if I'm not tuning in
for it's not getting my heart to radio I
don't care they've gained everything I
don't want none of your mailings tell me
I was coming the bagels pooping is
dangerous and creates the same pain as
childbirth for sloths I knew this is
just a it's a sloth only release their
bobbles once a week the act of pooping
occurs in the forest floor which can be
a dangerous place for sloths as
predators lurk there and matters are
made even worse when they reach sloths
digest so it's about half of the sloths
fatalities occur doing this rich know
they refer to as a ritual I just thought
I don't know like this just goes to tell
that the endangered species list is
 yes it's complete another crime
of looting if we stopped hunt I don't
know if anyone's hunting sloths but if
we stopped all of it tomorrow half of
them would still die from pooping 50%
chance of dying they say at the toilet
or actually 100% if you're famed rock
star sloth sloth Presley or Elvis la
flee to the animation he's still alive
but I'm like with childbirth you'd have
to hear the sloths complain about
constipation for nine months oh it is
true lots of constipation that I I read
about the annual pony festival yeah it's
just happened it's not what you think
where people compete in events and
classes just the same as real horses
this is where and these events are very
competitive just like a regular horse
show we end up people go down over and
jump you failed at a pony festival sir
this is that's what I watched that clip
look you failed at a human foot meeting
okay let me put this in a context
there's normal society okay
superior by the way to Pony fetishists
in every way okay then there's a long
layer including ventriloquist social
justice warriors an X Fox News hosts
soccer players and finally there's Pony
fetishes and then there's you even
Carrie is looking down from heavens
think that's kind of embarrassing
Macaulay Culkin was like what do you do
with your life they say this comes from
the only kid Michael Jackson I think it
was just a genius move I love how dear
old wasn't saying anything today
Oh quiet well he's grieving this next
one's right down center plate for you
two people were arrested in Oklahoma
City for having drunken sex in the
middle of an intersection well nothing
would sound out of the ordinary until
you see their mug shots look at the mug
shots woman pleaded not guilty to charge
the bestiality in the great state of
Oklahoma includes but is not limited to
the rock eater from the neverending
story what your face looks like a your
face looks like a cliff you know you
must have a huge I get laid in an
intersection I don't care how drunk she
was but Your Honor in my defense I was
so wasted I thought he was the nothing I
was buzzed he looked like a tray you we
made some bad decisions oh what a good
movie I regret all the things mostly
living in Oklahoma no but I'm fortunate
to have the child in my life oh my gosh
giving her it's gonna be painful come on
a passing the biggest kidney stone ever
so Dale Altman's now a marijuana farmer
was cut off by the erupting a Chloe
volcano he refused to give up on his
dream claiming that it's his main source
of income and that quote we are not
stupid we thought this out
he says if you look at that image with
the LOB there's nothing left but he has
no power left yeah we're all sitting
here laughing but he actually comes to a
long line of experienced narcotic
creators and distributors like his
brother actually who grows opium poppies
in the tornado Valley so he's a good
there you go
yeah and his uncle who built a meth lab
next to the lair of Godzilla yeah
insights 20/20 hindsight is always 20/20
and I pick about our spots I mean
there's Walmart parking lots everywhere
I will not leave my pot plants even
though I literally molten lava acid
ranges the skin and air that burns your
lung cavity but I'm not addicted anytime
I want realized even this big farmer
suppresses the fact that marijuana cures
Milton arms yes yes yes its topic pharma
created the volcano which by the way
doesn't exist because the earth is flat
and it would go like this I've seen the
video let's just go through this real
quick because what will really quickly
will speak with ben shapiro about it
trump by the way didn't separate
families this is a whole bunch of
misdirected outrage let's just do a
quick timeline to clear this up okay
sometimes actual journalism happens
first off even it's family
Jason point Britt Baldwin called out I'm
like at her board for Tammy Baldwin over
the blatant hypocrisy look at the clip
so many people in this country are
certainly outraged by the cages and the
thermal blankets and the facilities
housing these kids you know they were
all there in 2014 under President Obama
and my question to you senator Baldwin
is did you speak up against them then
you know on the on this issue that we
trying to I was just lucky that
Broadmoor that's a bold question
actually everyday I'm not joking in my
prayers I ask that he'll come on the
show it's in 2018
that's a bold question are you serious
it's for CNN I mean she just saved come
on this cheenu shouldn't have the answer
take zero balls to ask that question
okay for you she has no balls well you
didn't have to say it this is so the
floor is consent policy by the way was
signing the law under Clinton okay in
1997 direct quote prohibits the federal
government from keeping children in
immigration detention even if they are
with their parents for more than twenty
days okay
that's when the New York Times it's not
fake news okay Republican all right face
book pages from the New York Times your
own sources yes these are your own
sources the Obama administration
violated this policy of course they
angered immigration advocates saying you
detain mothers and their future release
okay so this week agencies began
enforcing the immigration law with a
zero tolerance policy has been increased
yes and parents being detained of course
and children being released into these
what they call tender care facilities I
know I'm not a big fan of the name
either it's amazing what happens what
happens to statistics when you go from
0% enforcement to 100% exactly 100% if
you go from 0% to any person to any
percent and yesterday of course Donald
Trump signed an executive order to end
all this because you can't you know the
polls yeah children live them from 2014
just so you know so that's what we'll
talk about more anything else that I
missed I just think we've lost our
ability to have rational thought with
this this is crazy it's a no-win
situation on both sides 14 Obama's crazy
for doing it now Trump's crazy for doing
it it's like you can't win can we just
build a wall please and be done soccer
team on the border I don't know what is
just so stupid about this Bibi is that
the executive and the transformation
administration is blamed for executing
the law I know it's a legislative straw
to change it yeah but the only acting
like Trump as a guy
he just recites what is being done
exactly well did he decide to
unfortunate yeah these agents decided to
start a four songs laws but exactly it
is the law that's the issue now if you
have someone who doesn't respect rule of
law it doesn't mean that the rule of law
is not a thing that it's a figment of
your imagination and it doesn't mean
that it's a human right to be a citizen
of the United States that was the big
thing we did the change my what changed
my mind I build the wall people said why
did you pick this as like a struck that
really were there repeat was Austin
there were professors there was no one
who had any kind of a coherent argument
it was just the walls kind of mean so
we're gonna do it again and hopefully
get something a little bit more
substantive from people but it was
really tough it was hard to pick which
ones to run because no one made a valid
look at like a really competitive
argument no I could nothing convincing
we can paint some cartoon on it then we
gate we gave you the best if we gave you
the cream of the crop yeah what you get
back pac-man all right so another story
that I think is the funniest thing I've
ever heard in my life
south it's the true story I'm gonna be
asking it could do all Asians look alike
or is it racist to think that so South
Korean coach of the soccer team I'm on a
show Shin Taeyang Shin tae-yong I don't
know I have no idea it's he's good he
admitted to pulling a little switcheroo
mixing around the jersey numbers recent
training sessions and warm-up games
because he believes Westerners find it
difficult quote to distinguish between
Asia yeah she did it more specifically
to confuse the Swedes during practice by
the way Snopes it refuses it check true
zero Pinocchio's we'll all right I do
have to be careful with this maybe I'm
gonna pull it back a little so here a
comment action on the controversy now is
South Korean soccer coach I think we
have a right shouldn't a Shin
tae-yong thanks for being here he's so
happy
yeah there's no way it's going to go
well so mr. Jung explain to us why
you're at the center right now this
controversy is jersey around just play
no danger okay right so you had players
exchange jerseys but why and do it to
mess with the Swedes this is another

I know I know I was just off there she
when I can see him I can't hear them
because since this is our first meeting
mm-hmm and I know we've disagreed on
issues in the past and I think we agree
on some issues now I think let's go
right into it you can follow her on
Twitter at Go Green 18
of course you probably know her YouTube
channel Laci green TV MS green thank you
for being here
hi Steven how you do it I'm doing well
how are you I'm very good yeah this
doesn't need to be awkward or weird I
know you've met a ton of more right
leading people now and I think I just
heard you speaking with mr. Reagan over
there who's a little bit in the center
yeah my boyfriend I wouldn't describe
him as Center but okay you know whatever
funny chick but I'm glad we finally have
you on the show thank you for coming on
I appreciate it
it was one that was really requested by
a lot of fit by the way not to be
confused for those looking at the plugs
as glozell green no noted Oh Lord now
Laci green oh well no no we don't want
to short you little obvious you never
know if they search it you know noted
feminists and actually has one finally
degree in a bathtub full of fruit leaf
role of fruit loops probably not you
never know you never know
there's a bright YouTube future ahead
where I'm bathing in cereal you can just
make it a patreon bonus if someone pays
enough they can watch you bathe in Froot
Loops and apply chaps and there would be
someone who would do that I guarantee
you let me ask this it was really
requested by a lot of fans
you were a noted feminist I think we did
even some rebuttals a long time ago
don't hold it against us with some of
your videos that were very popular and
then you you mentioned you know taking
the red pill and obviously this has been
documented a lot of people are familiar
with it but for people who aren't can
you kind of set it up and explain to
them what does that mean for for Laci
green what was that
like well I was that video was mostly
just me saying that I was willing to
talk to people who consider themselves
red pillars I would not call myself a
red pillar right any way but yeah I have
always really you know I come from a
really conservative background I have
family members that voted for Trump and
they're very religious and they live at
the middle of nowhere you know I am NOT
like insulated liberal in any sense the
word and they started talking about some
of these things on my youtube channel
and how important it is to just sort of
like sit down have a beer have a chat
with people who see things differently
than you and to really understand where
other people are coming from and I think
everyone should do that and we should
all be open to changing our minds about
the things that we believe in learning
more and growing so I made this video
you know just not really thinking much
of it that I was going to oh that's a
mistake on the youtubes yeah yeah well I
there were lessons learned yes
especially namely don't read the comment
section but I appreciate that the
hutzpah that it took to do that anyway
yeah yeah so yeah I mean I I got a lot
of flack for that and continue to but
whatever you know I'm not why though I
don't understand why I mean what you
just said right now what you just
expressed seems entirely reasonable
that's something that we believe on this
program we have an open invitation to
anyone and we'll allow them a platform
to speak I understand why you leave
polarizing right how how is that pot
what kind of Fleck do you get for that I
think people from across the spectrum
who just have really hyper partisan
opinions feel that you know what
regardless of where they're coming from
on the political spectrum feel about
talking being willing being willing to
listen to someone else and try to hear
them out and understand them is sort of
like conceding how you see things or
like agreeing with them and maybe I just
communicated it poorly or maybe people
are just so polarized and tribalistic
online that it just sort of created this
spiraling frenzy
but it's stupid I mean it's really
idiotic you know yes it obviously is you
see across the spectrum so I know you
mentioned you've talked about how people
on the Left feminists sort of thought
you were a turncoat and you had had
death threats against you I heard about
your story in a parking lot because you
would accidentally used the word
when quoting quit Chris Crocker who used
it himself and they said you led to the
deaths I don't this is this people watch
your videos I'm not I'm not hurling mud
lacey has talked about if it sounds
absurd it sounds absurd to me as well
but what kind of flack would you get you
know across the spectrum on on the right
for saying hey let's have a conversation
how are they mad about that a lot of
people saw me as trying to like just do
it for abused or accusing me of trying
to trick them or you know not being
willing to have the conversation
themselves because they felt that I had
hurt them in some crazy way you know
like you've done so much damage there's
no way you know anybody on our side
shouldn't talk to you and it's just
people are just crazy across the board
like everyone just needs to chill out
you know just have a conversations you
know I think the part of it though was
maybe like I didn't see the videos you
made to me but like some people made
some videos that I would say we're
pretty inflammatory and close-minded
themselves ours probably were you
needn't watch them but that's the
majority yes okay cool well noted you
know I think that that sort of attracts
the type of person who isn't really open
to having conversations or learning more
they just want to hear things that
reinforce their own worldview yeah no
III agree with you and we talk a lot
about you know I've worked at Fox News
for four and a half years before I
founded that no yeah it was not a fun
experience no not very cool as a matter
I think it's the opposite of cool when
at commercial break and I'm on a panel
there selling self lubricating pocket
catheters I don't think of it I can't
think anything less cool than that Lacey
but I walk in bathtubs appreciate so you
know I will say though having been you
know I was raised in a socialist
province in Connecticut there is no
conservative there's liberal and liberal
separatists so like you I was not raised
in a in a far-right insular bubble there
no right-wing it didn't exist I came to
the United States to learn about it that
being said I've definitely in my
experience having been in Quebec and
been here and with with speech laws in
place like Canada which much more
closely mimic Europe I've really seen
the right here to be more open to it to
a dialog this is a matter of fact you're
kind of a rarity for people on the left
many of them won't come on the show many
of them don't have conversations at all
yeah yeah yeah that is an interesting
thing I thought so I don't know like I
can't I don't like making
generalizations but I feel like maybe
this is something that is being
exacerbated online because most of
people that I'm friends with like in the
in the real world are down to have a
conversation but one thing that I've
noticed happens online a lot in on the
left is people have this idea kind of
like what I was how you about before
right where if you talk to somebody who
has views that you believe are abhorrent
or hurtful or harmful or whatever but
that is giving them power it's giving
them a platform this is what all of the
feminists youtubers sort of disowned me
over right they said that I was like
empowering yeah right or whatever like
empowering the people that I disagree
with by by simply talking to them right
and and not only is that their that idea
but anybody even you know like myself or
anybody who doesn't really see it that
way they're fans will come after them
right so there's like this huge risk
that you take and nobody wants to you
know piss off their fans so yeah I
understand we've I've seen a small
portion of that for example we've talked
don't agree with Alex Jones on much of
anything but I've done a show several
times his son's a fan and his son you
know given him merchandise and I've been
on his show and told me I disagree them
some conservatives I said well you're
you're enabling some of this
conspiratorial views and pretty clear I
mean I've been on MSNBC and BBC and Sky
News that being said it was a very very
small percentage of people it seems in
comparison to the reaction to you from
feminists where what you're saying what
you're saying isn't that inflammatory
that's the thing yeah I don't I don't
think so but some people do and they
still give me you know so post about me
every day which is like
what do you do it ya know I mean to me
it's like if you have if there are real
problems in the world and real problems
in your life why are you obsessing over
what people on it like random ask people
on the internet do but doesn't really
have like much write effect on the world
yes and I do think a lot of people there
focus on that that's why when we do this
show we've we've always tried to focus
on for example if I disagree I don't
want to strum and we use clips and
quotes in policy from Bernie and Hillary
and Young Turks and we say here the
mainstream views that we disagree with
because anyone can find the Westboro
Baptist Church and your act as though
there are more than 14 members with
flippers you know or a bread yeah and
the same thing on the left but you know
there's some mainstream views for me as
a conservative on the red on the left
that I find disconcerting let me and he
said you wouldn't consider yourself a
red pillar I understand that it sounds
to me like the main thing that's changed
is your view on having a conversation
maybe maybe freedom of speech open
dialogue a little more is that kind of
really when you say was red pill that's
the fundamental difference between pre
2017 Laci green and post yeah I think
that's the main thing but also I I
sympathize and understand some of the
criticisms of the feminist movement that
are made online and I agree with a lot
of them so maybe that's if you want to
call that red bell you know I I think we
don't need anymore our thoughts I think
people get the picture if someone's
already condemned you for being on the
show I understand it's like it's like
consumers like not a Nazi not a Nazi
heard the audio only version yeah that's
probably enough not a Nazi but I think I
think school vouchers might be good he's
a Nazi I knew it so then let me ask you
this you say sympathize what would be
different
what views would you say have changed in
in pre 2017 Laci green in post so you
say sympathizes let's start with that
you know I have always thought this
stuff and I've talked about it on line
many times because I myself have been
victim of really vitriolic mob attacks
online yeah many times so you know I've
always growing up on the internet and
being someone who just kind of like
shares their opinions online have seen
the dark underbelly of the the movements
that I am aligned with and I feel like
I've seen all the dark
your belly a spear I'm in and that so
much and that's your job and it's pretty
horrible but yeah I I would say the main
thing is just feeling like there are
some aspects of the feminist movement
that are just really toxic that had been
really toxic to me that have been really
toxic to people that I know and you know
I have always felt that way it sort of
talked about it it was kind of scared to
poke the Beast but now I really don't
give up because I really think that
there has been a tipping point where it
has become so toxic that it's actually
hurting the very causes that I believe
in okay what elements I guess when you
say Tom when you say toxic of feminism
specific um yeah well there's a lot of
things but I think one of them for
instance is like the Mott but the hate
mobs when somebody says or does
something problematic you know that that
is do you not like there's the eye out
for those listening audio she's doing it
again she's doing again people listen to
audio sometimes and they go what why did
you I'm like no no you missed it so okay
just but I appreciate it I just say but
you know I because I hate that word
problematic like what is that
I don't even that's a change because he
used to use that word I always use that
word in sort of ironic sense and if you
like go back and watch my MTV videos
people didn't really pick up that I was
kind of making fun of it they thought I
was serious because you know I guess
that's a legitimate mistake turn based
sort of a feminist Tony Clifton you
played them and that's that's okay I
respect that
yeah I also just think people get so
like hyped up about words like triggered
or problematic it's like everyone just
you know it's like a buzz word that
people lose their minds that but yeah
but this coming back to what I was
saying sure use this idea that like if
you do or say something that is steam
problematic you are now a horrible
person who deserves to die and lose your
job and you you caused all this terrible
stuff you know you're you're responsible
for the violence against all these
people just for like maybe having kind
of an ignorant or different even opinion
not something and I think that's a
really toxic mentality that makes it so
that people can actually have a
conversation about things and they can't
actually hear each other
or respect each other because nobody is
going to be this
like image of ideological purity there's
all these purity tests right and as soon
as you've been deemed not pure enough
for the left you're just done they'll
throw you in the trash and one one thing
that I like in a line with some of my
more moderate to right weighting friends
is this idea that we're still human
beings and we should still be able to
like see through our differences and
work through them in a respectful way
you know and I I really value loyalty
I'm a very employable person and I find
more of my like politically I find more
of my moderate to right-leaning friends
are at the end of the day even if they
think I'm like a crazy nutjob liberal or
whatever right they aren't gonna just a
bit up and leave me and you know stop
talking to me like many of my liberal
friends have you know I've never been
abandoned by my right-wing friends over
my views left-wing absolutely that isn't
that is interesting you know I uh I
guess never really thought of it but
having had left-wing friends like Sally
Cohen in the show and when people kind
of doggie piled on her I'd try to say
listen I disagree with her but she's a
very decent human being that being no
you know what you're absolutely right
now that I go back all my left-wing
friends from Montreal none of them like
me anymore
they all hate me then again they might
have just been looking for an excuse so
um many do how would we say so
something's you talked about quite a bit
since I have you here and you talk about
sort of respectfully either finding
common ground or disagreement like toxic
masculinity you talked about quite a bit
and it seems as though you've
transitioned a little but certainly in
your explanation of how it's often
perceived or described how would you
describe your view then and now if it's
if it's changed I don't think it's
really ever changed I have always felt
that there are elements of how we raise
girls and how we raise boys those gender
roles that we you know uphold so highly
in our culture that there are some roles
for boys and girls that are hurtful to
them and could be toxic to others and
when we're talking about toxic
masculinity that pigpen take in
particular and one of the big issues is
telling boys to suppress their feelings
and
deal with their upset and their emotions
with violence you know I think that men
should be able to express their feelings
and when we shame them and call them
boys and being a little girl or whatever
for having feelings that that is a
really tough thing to do to a human
being yeah
because men are humans too and they're
gonna have feelings sometimes you know
sure yeah I don't I I don't think anyone
would disagree with that though I think
what I would disagree with is the
presupposition that society tells young
men to deal with their emotions through
violence you know that's where I would
say you know biologically young boys
tend to be more aggressive young boys
tend to be more hands-on more
rambunctious
and a lot of them are frustrated because
we put them in a public education system
which is designed for women not young
boys and we tell them not to be not only
not to be violent but sometimes not to
be young boys which is a bit rough and
tumble yeah I think I think you know I I
will agree with you that boys because of
testosterone and you know that's a
generalization but in general they do
have a lot of aggressive energy or a lot
of energy in general and that's why I
think that we need to have positive
outlets for boys like you know I think
sports is a great great outlet for
people's energy and girls have that
energy to sometimes you know it really
just depends but sports and healthy
competitions ways to get that energy out
in healthy ways that doesn't hurt people
I don't think there's ever this message
that like well sometimes there is but
usually it's not like you should go out
beat someone up but sometimes it is
sometimes it's like oh you're having a
problem with someone at school you
should like show them who's boss
you know you should take them down and
not put up with their crap because
that's how you show that you have
self-respect as a man and I think that
that is like not a very productive thing
to tell boys my dad told my little
brother this all the time like you
should just you know beat him up and I'm
like maybe not though yeah maybe we can
say yeah I've never ever heard that in
my I wonder how much with with I guess
sort of modern third wave feminism is
this perceived societal conditioning
versus what's happening in actuality
because if you look at any public school
any public program any intramural sports
they punish severely any outbursts
of violence and I've never heard anyone
personally tell a young boy to be
violent I've heard them say defend
yourself my dad told me that I almost
think that telling young boys they
shouldn't be the way that they are with
checks and balances is more toxic than
trying to create outlets that maybe
aren't the most conducive toward
actually like you said sort of expending
some of this this aggressive
testosterone Laden energy well I don't
think that anybody I mean I think for
one thing intramural sports is different
than how boys and girls are socialized
like there's no doubt about it that we
[Music]
he arrived in America he conquered
Austin he was promptly banned from
Austin and YouTube they tried to stop
him but now he's back yeah at this point
they forced my hand be people you look
like you had a few too many fights in

Robinson situation particularly as it
relates to social media or the World Cup

just make it to Hawaii crash into the
ocean but you can track my flat path oh
I'm Twitter thing is making everyone
sneaky Hey so we're gonna be we actually
been official statement from kim
jeong-hoon later
he's been relatively quiet and it's a
little conflicted but we have news of
the day to get to first so Jim Acosta is
an insufferable prick let's lead with
that here he is caught in the hot
microphone justifying shouting questions
at the whole Trump Kim summit listen to
the smugness
all day all day baby
all day all today all day long entitled
s which is ironic though actually
because all night long is actually now
Donald and Kim song just love I just
love how spend computer is unable he's a
little holding a depiction of their
nuclear program looking forward to
seeing looking forward to seeing your
full full sting come to fruition on
Monday I'm looking forward to it a lot
and just are you just forgetting to turn
on your microphone I just know you're a
 man I just don't yeah but I
don't want to make too many North Korean
I don't know I won't make too many
noises at this launch you from a carrier
if my life depended on I wouldn't I'm
just gonna fail on the ramp BPI question
what do you do the adoption processes
from North Korea UV Trump's got me luck
I think you just chase around the
Jillian with loopholes I think you just
chasing her with a piece of cheese and
you pretty much get whoever you want
yeah I think they taste you around forth
and kill Dear Leader's speaks directly
into their mind like Charles Xavier
huh no other news of the day the UN is
officially blamed and condemned Israel
for the recent violence in Gaza this
comes to us from Washington Post of
course it approved the Palestinian
backed resolution when on Wednesday
blaming Israel for violence in Gaza and
deploring it's quote excessive use of
force with no mention of the fact that
Hamas who had the destruction of all
Jews was in their charter until very
recently yeah you and also the minute
that the 36 accusers be charged with
quote stealing all of Cosby's pills so
they're in yeah I'm increasingly
convinced that if Hitler were around the
day the left would ensure him a victory
but un un un on the Left I mean come on
yeah the wrong people I feel like if
they went back and looked at the
Holocaust to be like yeah you guys kind
of had it coming yeah
well you know what you don't think that
Hamas would carry out the Holocaust they
could tomorrow
absolutely they're just Holocaust
deniers who beat their wives yeah the
fun fact is that the person in yeah I
just said that like a few weeks ago that
most youth reduce social behavior that
the Holocaust happened PPP so that's the
position that they do to theirs
due to their social behavior of dying
from inhaled toxic fumes can you believe
that those Jews they're there so be on
the brink of palate like here's what
even if you think that Israel as an
occupant put this way in any other
situation if you thought someone was
occupying a land but the land consisted
of people who wanted to wipe out an
entire race with people oh thank god
they're occupied thank god they're no
longer running the show doing that
speaking of running the show Netflix
film crew they're now banned from
staring flirting or hugging under the
new rules I'm so happy
[Laughter]
Whoopi Goldberg strolls on I so sale
Rodman coin I think yet we've coin or
something
so Netflix they've banned film crews
from looking at anyone for over five
seconds other rules include not asking
were pals phone numbers and they're
urging staff feeling pestered to yell
quote stop don't do that again so this
isn't bonds to me to and it's not this
really a bad response but it's it's led
to some changes for Netflix prompted
them to actually halt production on Bill
O'Reilly highly anticipated directorial
debut the biographical Roger Ailes
picture The Chronicles of crotch cam
yeah also the production of the highly
anticipated sequel to a Spacey Jam that
was one fun fact about that one Spacey
was not supposed to be a cameo but he in
his audition he blew everyone he blew
everyone away here's your chance
do your dance at the at the space at the
Space Jam stop I didn't write it also no
longer available is the notorious Bill
Nye saves the world episode dry humping
the craft services table that one almost
seems like it was it almost seems he was
toxifying the world Bill Nye
but he taught you how to make your own
ketchup afterwards I'm not
happy you tell you that that Hani was
b-bar feel like really honey I didn't
know that I guess it's okay thank you
hump the the the the the Quiznos
catering hey Elon Musk's boring company
reportedly just won a bid to build a
high-speed underground rail in Chicago
even muster you know you love the Elon
Musk's there's fun computer so this is
actually quote we're really excited to
work with the mayor and the city to
bring this new high-speed public
transportation system to Chicago the
boring company said hopefully it's
faster than a speeding bullet set up all
of Chicago let's train to go everywhere
yeah I think we never are Detroit would
be calling the Chicago PD a problem no
but it's more powerful than a gun
confiscation I'll take it I take it
that's good I'll go I just submitted
still 15 minutes respond time yes the
Troy 15-minute 5858 response rate is 11
I think Chicago is actually good on them
it's like six I think I just don't
believe it to like yeah there's no one
left to kill in this I got crazy online
too alright a little hyper a little
hyper the US House just approved a ban
on Wednesday by the way on the
importation employ almost like I would
say in poor taste the importation and
trafficking of this is an actual spent
computer there's an actual story rights
nectar so yeah okay I want to make sure
because people say you're just making
these up to four like the Anne Frank it
was a real story traffic an anatomically
correct child sex dolls and robots that
quote normalized sex between adult and
minors the proposal was approved in the
house and now it moves on to the Senate
but if you make child sex robots see
illegal people will be forced to build
their own sex dolls and back alleys
argued NAMBLA dan only the child sex
robots will have them oh the first
models by the way we're nicknamed r2d2
year-old and c3 this many had a rough
get in the vent you might have been the
best the senator who votes no on this I
know there will be one I'm convinced oh
in a decade from now they'd just be
considered forward-thinking ahead of
their time yes salons are you on board
senator Sanders you're running for
president but says here that you voted
no on ban
anatomically correct child sex robots
have all of them issue we have okay so
we do update to a story here we had this
guy's manager on not long ago
and if you've been following the news
this is not to get sued but it is pretty
sure so let's just set this up Kay
Marley was dead to begin with the UK no
longer has free speech well talked with
star Ghana but it doesn't exist you've
heard us say it time and time again plea
there's no I don't even think anyone is
trying to argue anymore they're trying
to argue to what degree they limit
speech I'm saying okay we're going
forward in a kind of authoritarian so
before we get to tell me Robinson what
we and the hell if I'd go to the UK no
those fools are crazy I can't speak even
though I can't speak I can imagine well
so you don't chip things so people like
like Lauren Southern that's not how they
work and Britney had they've been banned
from entering the country count dank
EULA of course you remember fine for
making the pub to a Nazi salute which
sounds worse than it actually is when
you see the video meanwhile though
flying the ISIS flag in London you're
aces yeah apparently that's not a
problem
and obviously Tommy Robinson is still in
prison we talked about this we had timed
Robinson's manager on I thought was it
two weeks ago now two weeks ago yeah and
the concern is now and he talked about
this he's been moved to a new prison
that's allegedly significantly more
dangerous with a higher Muslim
population now there's been some
confusion over the exact details right
so I don't want to spread any
misinformation here's the most recent
update from his manager Kalin Robertson
himself there was some confusion
circulating on Twitter there may be some
people try to say was seventy percent
Muslim the prison yeah some huge number
yeah and it turns out that that is not
correct at all and they may have just
flipped it and got in a mistake but then
there were a lot of other sites that ran
with it who didn't factor and this is
what I want to make this clear before we
get to Tom I want this is why I
absolutely despise the conspiratorial
right it's it's true the fake news
exists not just exclusively on the left
okay and it makes it much harder for us
to do our job
or for you to go out there and be
properly armed with information when
people are more interestin clicks and
they aren't telling the truth inflating
the number to an increased number of
Muslims that is not the accurate number
which had to be I believe it was I
believe they took it back if I'm not
mistaken I believe they retracted it
yeah I think they put it down what it
like yeah they moved into a prison with
a higher Muslim population where it's
more dangerous that's enough yeah when
we get to what's happened on YouTube and
social media tenders it's enough the
truth is enough the truth is always
enough Inessa double-edged sort of of
the new age of digital media is that
right comes with the extra set of
responsibilities once once my time I
think I feel like even riots were a
little more genuine because people were
on board with it's more of a singular
yeah narrative of news
now you can anybody can from any blog or
from anywhere in the world can throw
their own spin on things and be taken as
legitimate so yeah you gotta be vigilant
no matter which sites you're on no
matter where here's the thing you know
what's crazy we just we just had kim
jeong-hoon in donald trump singing all
night long okay this is not the epitome
of journalism and we do the work and
some and we've come out in issued
retractions we've gotten some things
wrong when new news has come in these
people who are out there trying to
convince you that they are real news by
the way don't watch this is your only
news source we're a late-night show okay
but we are meticulous in trying to be
correct so it's not by accident that a
news organization or a right-wing blog
that employs three four five times as
many people as on this show gets it
wrong that's by design yeah spend
computer yeah I mean it really just
hurts your cost BP because now the
left-wing media and leftist they can
just point at this and go like look
they're lying rights trying to inflate
this and that makes people like us look
bad too because they were gonna be
associated with those people as well
look at her I do with the alt right it's
like all rights like Ben Shapiro was a
notorious Jewish net shut up it's just
really done yeah they're handing out
tiki torches that they are and so you
can binge yeah exactly and that being
said there is something here something
we do know okay and it's just it's just
concerning a video that time Darwin made
it was titled I won't be around for much
longer was taken down from YouTube
because it violated Community Guidelines
so this so the fact that this coincides
is is is bone-chilling ly scary the good
news is a lot of people did their due
diligence and took the clip downloaded
the clip before was taken down so we
have a montage of some of it here they
want to remove me to silence me to
discredit me
they have tried to stop me in every
possible way I don't want to take away
the final thing I have my voice
I don't doubt one day they will wipe me
off social media completely forever the
media will be able to tell you whatever
they want about me now I have no way of
responding if they can do it to me they
can do it to you and what do they do
they removed it immediately almost seems
like he was a prophet he is
foreshadowing acts of violence and
censorship committed against him and
he's the one in violation that video
predicting that he would be found in
violations for non violations was
removed as a violation get your head
around that these people it's scared
because at the point where they don't
care that you're watching yeah they're
not trying to hide anymore and that's
what's scary well people aren't really
stepping up and fighting stuff like this
I think or they're trying to but they
don't really have much of a mechanism
what do you do if Twitter bans you get a
half page and learn and build rich yeah
exactly hear his name in the hallways of
Google and themselves and you know what
I'm talking about yeah but how many
people can do that right and so it comes
down to people like you having the
ability to go do that for everybody else
a lot of people can you just have to be
the pig who bigs it build his house out
of straw builds is outside of out of
brick as opposed to the brothers who did
straw and wood wood stick strong wood
sticks but you know must have pissed off
that one see this coming late for right
next to it
take care about the environment it's not
that expensive right down the block just
let you know some of these organizations
that went out with this myth of the 70%
Muslim population but they have far more
money than we do yeah where do they
typically do they often just tend to
 what's happening on YouTube listen
we and we try and make it funny
that's why we created mug Club it's what
allows us to be sustainable and we try
and do sketches to draw awareness to it
but we have bill Richman number 10 we
have also his firm on retainer and we
are a thorn in the side of social media
believe you me we've planned for this
and you will know about it if we end up
having to fight to a higher degree than
we are right now so here's the thing the
UK courts and social medias are working
together and not just a silenced Tommy
and to put him in prison but but to
silence any reports of their actions
against him that's what's crazy right
now and this is how the Left operate
some people were yeah I am making the
grocery generalization because this is
this is exclusive to the left they
portray the aggressors as the victims
and they and they have and there's no
one who can call on us they paint Tommy
as the villain and is reporting
as a crime against the poor Muslim rate
gangs the poor the poor migrant rapists
all he did was rape a kid they
technically are a minority so they do
have the immoral and that is true mommy
Robinson might have uh named the jury by
reporting about how this man raped a kid
don't you understand how we don't can't
we find common ground probably not um by
the way here's something you know same
things happened to us before so good
example is very recently why people
don't know this and actually spend
computer you did some research with with
reg the Beast here we found some things
out yes just today right before the show
right before doing this we did a civil
non-violation change my mind video last
week in Austin right
we had a sit down with us there
you go there's a violation for you just
find a reason so antiphon and the like
they actively and repeatedly called to
firebomb us to firebomb us to firebomb
our table you can see these pictures
yeah so I actually posted this to
Instagram saying like hey guys keep an
eye out and it was removed as a
violation we're saying this person wants
to firebomb us so if you that make sure
we don't get firebomb isn't this is a
violation here's the crazy thing
do you remember Charles Hermes a
professor at UT Arlington who's still
there who said it was a Nazi who posted
fake names and he's saying gas the juice
and never took it back this person who
they talk about trans people intersex
people that used to be referred to as
hermaphrodites which is a phrase that
that we don't
prefer anymore we find it to be very
triggering and offensive because of the
one that has been used historically
okay but it's always like that medically
i don't like the n-word right like
there's a certain
well not kind of like the n-word wasn't
hermaphrodite a medical term
welcome to another installment of there
are only two genders change
my mind unedited conversations with uh
people on the street usually we do this
on campus but during summer break that's
kind of hard to do
so before we start because this is a
long one i wanted to show you how this
conversation ends up
with our second person who who claimed
to be intersex
and got a little hostile and the reason
for this
is because of the length of these
conversations if you ever
feel like we're talking around in
circles or getting off in the details
you'll see that they come back later on
and they matter that's key when having a
conversation
and finding common ground so this is
about the end point
well no no no no no no no no the
biological makeup of a brain is not
societal the biological makeup of a
brain is right that's what i'm saying
right so what i'm saying the brain that
you call the male brain or the female
brain
you did not me i'm saying is closer to
that brain that that you were referring
to as a male brain
you referred to it that way so i want to
make sure i'm correct that you believe
there is a male brain generally
and a female brain generally when i'm
explaining my answer when i'm giving you
my answer
okay my answer is what you are referring
to as a male brain
is more i didn't you did that's why it's
important you brought this up male brain
and female brain i'm trying to
understand what you brought up i didn't
bring up male brain female brain
so that context matters because we are
going to rewind all the way to the
beginning
where you can see that intersex girl
works for this person who approached me
uh transgender male to female danielle
skidmore actually running for austin
city council
in district 9. how are you would you
would you like to to change my mind i'll
try okay
thank you very much i appreciate it
i've heard about your show so i thought
oh great thank you very much yeah right
appreciate it
what's your name danielle danielle
danielle absolutely so
uh stephen um and uh if you're familiar
at all with the show this is just where
we engage in civil discussion dialogue
and issues that are usually pretty
controversial they result in talking
points with a lot of people and
you know i can see full-length
conversations so i believe there are two
genders
okay you're welcome to change my mind
i think that uh i think human biology is
really complicated
and i think that gender identity is
real and intrinsic and i think that
i don't think there's a mindset sorry i
don't think there's a binary for
anything
you can ask are you transgender i am
actually
okay um
this morning and that's okay no that's
funny literally i was walking down the
street and i was like oh my gosh this is
a sign right there
right conversation so um
what what do you believe is is wrong i
guess about my state you said there's
two genders yeah
i think i've come to realize i'm trans
right yeah and uh
that uh why
why we are the way we are like what
makes our
core humanity right is
beautifully complicated so like my son
my son's got a genetic disorder right
he's missing an enzyme
that lets him metabolize two amino acids
right
why that is you have no idea like it
wasn't a biological variation sure right
it doesn't diminish
his humanity right but it is
fundamentally different
you know like why i'm trans to be honest
with you
i don't know right now it took me 37
years
to stop fighting what i knew to be true
from the earliest ages as a child
to work my way through the social stigma
of my reality which was that i know i'm
different
i don't understand why i am i don't know
why
i would you know go and hide in the
bathroom
or my sister's clothes right like when i
was
seven right like yet
it all got wrapped into the expectations
of society
okay so i want to make sure i'm just
kind of unwrapping this uh carefully
um you said the truth of your reality
yeah that you are a woman a transgender
woman
okay um how do you know that's the truth
how do i know that it's true yeah how do
you know that you're a heterosexual i
presume
heterosexual cisgender man okay it's
presumptuous
right no well that's okay that was that
was presumptuous but correct
okay uh well i think this is obviously a
big component to lgbtqai
community that uh preferences sexuality
preferences as far as i'm attracted to
women that's that's a that's a
preference obviously so
uh it's in eight i was born i like women
and uh biological i was born a male
because uh
i have a penis in the hormonal profile
and chromosomes of a male
so that's why i know that it's true to
state that i'm a male that you're
the male because you're you're a male
because like you're ex-wife
i didn't simplify to xy a multitude of
factors i have a male brain
i have a male body everything from bone
density to my hormonal profile
to yes my penis all of these things
pretty clearly
uh would file me in the cabinet under
mail biologically like in the spec
in like the spectrum of biological
variation you're in that big collection
of people that
have all of those things in alignment
yeah depending on the
interactive people right like
two-thirds of one percent is the best
number now right that um
are transgender based on you know what
we know
of that which in texas is like 130 000
adults right
who uh for reasons that are still
unknown are don't have
all of those biological components that
you described
don't align as cleanly as yours do
okay um well you say you know unknown
um again this goes back to you said your
truth that you are a female
you asked me why am i a male i i hope
that i've answered it as clearly as i
can
right so i would return that same
question to you because i think we need
to start with the presupposition there
needs to be the same amount of validity
to our arguments
as far as us rationalizing them you said
the truth
that you are a female you were born a
male
how do you know that's the truth i was
born a transgender woman
okay and how do you know that's the
truth how do i know that's the truth
uh like
in what biological context is it like is
it validated is that the question
yeah how how do you know that you're not
uh simply a man who believes he's a
woman how do you
like why do you so why are you if you're
heterosexual why are you attracted to
women
well there's a lot of biological
mechanisms in there namely to procreate
uh since the beginning of civilization
is attractive
sex attractive
i'm a gay man do you believe that that's
not their intrinsic reality
well again it's a sexual preference and
i think that's very important because
the sexual preference is different from
uh biology right and this is what i find
also pretty
interesting to me is right now they're
teaching that you know obviously you're
born gay
uh but gender is a choice
and that to me i don't i don't i don't i
just don't agree with so which one how
do you know you
you say that you're transgender you were
born a transgender woman right but i
would assume on your birth certificate
it said male
right so at some point you made the
decision to
live the way that you live right now
correct it's something yeah at some
point i made the decision
um it was almost a decade ago to
to unpack all of the guilt and shame i
felt for being different
right and at some point i made the
decision to
to unpeel guilt and shame right about my
truth
and to start trying to reconcile it with
the rest of my life and to reconcile
with a
society that is still
[Music]
pretty hostile to people who are
different so
it was a question of no longer fighting
fighting against myself yeah so and then
even after i did that i spent
another six years desperately trying to
not to not accept that
he accepted the truth and i'm like how
do i reconcile with that i'm an engineer
a civil engineer i'm a parent
congratulations
right like how can i how can i be who i
knew i
am and still function in society so
it took me years and eventually i
realized that i don't have a choice
like you know we look at the news this
morning right and
uh with tony borndane you know taking
his life right
right so 40 percent of
transgender people attempt suicide can i
pause you right there really quickly
just first off i hope that i haven't
been hostile i know you're talking about
you've been hospitalized
even this is a great okay good um
because i know we disagree but i
certainly don't want to be disrespectful
to you personally even if i disagree
with you
yeah i don't know that i don't find that
we disagree actually okay okay well i'm
glad that uh i'm glad that way because
the last thing i want is for you to feel
as though you've been sat down and it's
uh it's been a you know
sandbagging um and and you've brought up
you know anthony bourdain you brought up
the suicide rate i think that's very uh
important you know
it's about 41 it doesn't get better
after
uh hormone replacement therapy or even
actually doing the
full sex reassignment surgery so here we
are right i will
disagree with you okay i uh i think the
data shows
that when people are able to live their
lives as themselves
and are accepted in their community in
their social networks that's their
friends and their family professionally
in their city
when they're not stigmatized when they
don't lose their job when they don't
lose their housing when they aren't
ostracized or demonized right
like our state legislature spent the
best last spring and then called a
special session
essentially to demonize my existence
based on somebody's
you know i i don't honestly sincerely
held religious belief i'm not sure why
but to basically challenge my very
validity as a human being
right then yeah people can be frustrated
and scared and terrified and hopeless
and then kill themselves
but in my community when people are able
to live their lives and are accepted and
able to
you know aren't discriminated right then
their suicide rates fall
dramatically the single best thing you
can do for somebody who's lbgtq of any
sort but especially trans
is recognize their truth and accept
their humanity
well i would disagree with you there um
and first off i think you made a couple
yeah let me explain why you made a
couple of presumptions maybe they're not
uh
trying to uh demonize your very
existence maybe they just disagree with
you maybe it doesn't come from a
christian perspective maybe it comes
from a scientific one
maybe it comes from a perspective of a
medical perspective for example at
johns hopkins oh no that's okay i think
we're okay having a conversation you and
i right now right
yeah we're good we're good thank you
though um and the suicide rate
statistically anecdotally i'm glad to
hear
that that that your your group of
friends do better because one thing i
definitely don't want people
attempting suicide in a 41 percent not
just my friends i mean the data from the
national center for trans equality the
equality texas
hrc it's not it's not like my anecdotal
sort of
group of friends the scientific data
shows that when people are not
discriminated against and
transgender individuals who are able to
live their life whether
they you know just transition socially
or have hormone replacement therapy or
surgery whatever when people are able to
live their lives
their mental health is better
well statistically it's it's an accurate
statistically the suicide rate doesn't
really improve after
i you know sex reassignment therapy but
so maybe that's something we can follow
okay let's assume it's comparable let's
assume it's slightly lower let's let's
go with that i've seen the studies that
you're talking about and it might be
slightly lower it's not dramatically
lower
but i think this is predicated on the
idea and i don't think it's an
ill-founded idea
that because of discrimination because
of societal pressure because of feeling
like an
outsider uh people have more mental
health issues people are more prone to
depression people are more likely to
attempt suicide if they feel ostracized
and isolated
right yeah if they're treated as less
than human i would i would agree
um but the fact is minorities generally
commit suicide or attempt it
far fewer numbers for example white
males are two times more likely than
black men
the transgender attempted suicide rate
is higher than american slaves or jews
in concentration camps
are we to believe that um they have
they've been treated
more poorly in modern america than
american slaves or jews and
you're asking me to joshua you're asking
me to compare trans
of transgender individuals
to uh know the statistics the
statistical reality that nowhere else do
you find that suicide rate outside of
some serious psychiatric disorders
including those who have been enslaved
which might suggest again that this is a
this is a
not a truth as you said um people may
perceive it as a reality but
it may not be um it may not be ideal to
treat it just telling people that
that's the truth that's a reality when
it's in conflict with biology and their
hormones and their
brain and their biological makeup
because it can have catastrophic results
and how many genders are there because
now we're talking about non-binary right
i know
genders are there i don't i think gender
is a continuum
i think part of our so like this is my
take on it right and this is my
own personal opinion and how i've come
out how do you identify just so i make
sure
you sign up as a woman transgender woman
so you say transgender
woman but like you know i'm comfortable
owning the fact that i'm trans
i don't know that any of us has a
responsibility to own
anything about our own individuality
like i don't think
you anybody needs to walk down the
street and say hi i am a heterosexual
man or i
am a homosexual woman right like i
but for me i'm comfortable being visible
right
sure i'm lucky that i get to live in
austin and i get to be visible
and not suffer too many consequences
now the reality is i am a very small
sliver of
the trans population right i weren't
quite a professional right
my murder rate if i were an
african-american transgender gentleman
i'd be 30 times more likely to be
murdered than i am
so african-american men are much more
likely to be murdered than white men too
so a big part of that is right not
necessarily true this is real right and
that's that's
by other black people
race is a component of every all of our
interactions in
society
our gender identity who we are in our
brain from birth
before before we're talking about any
kind of hormonal replacement okay
yeah is varies across all of us
that i like i'm at peace with i honestly
think the science will prove
that fact there was a study that was
presented
this summer in uh i forget the
researchers i think we're belgian or
dutch and it was presented in
spain barcelona like a month ago that
doing imagery studying right so
functional mris
on brains of transgender children before
hrt okay so this is there have been some
studies that have done and the most
famous study was the remedy study what's
the
uh was done with folks who might have
been in transition or post-transition
yeah and this study has been
children who identify you know yeah at a
young age pre-puberty many
[Music]
turn this off anyway no no not that way
you know it keep going keep going
[Music]
love's lift us up where we belong
where our frisbee it's fine
from the margins
[Music]
louder with Crowder studios protected
exclusively by Walter
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
it's June which marks louder with
Crowder's third annual cultural
appropriation month where we take you
across the globe learning and
appreciating all the great cultures this
planet has to offer this week allow us
to transport you to the oft persecuted
what ass-kicking culture of Israel
[Music]
they do that so Israel
thanks to Dolan broadened by the way at
dole broaden for the idea of Israel
culture appropriation my really
interested third year in a row it caught
on and we're going to be looking at I
think seeing the best live costume every
week this this month before ultra to see
see who wins a cultural probation
contest costume contest mighty dapper
over there my friend you're looking like
I look more like Mary Poppins had sex
with Dustin Hoffman and hook siddik was
the goal on the show he's gonna be
thrilled with the get-ups no I'm not as
angry as Sally Kohn last year with
Sweden about razor sores on the show and
let me talk about Samantha bee we're
gonna be talking about the Forbes top
100 apparently no athletes there were
women but I think behind cultural
appropriation months people who don't
realize is to appropriate is to
appreciate one that's and so we always
want to Israel I don't know here's some
little facts from Israel our brilliant
researcher the beast reg as we call him
Israel is actually home to the city with
the most chess grandmasters in the world
mmm I would have thought they'd be Asian
if Israel thank for actually it looks
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had no
idea a little pissed off now that came
to us from Israel but again they put in
nothing but Asians in those suits I love
how it's like Jason Billy the black guy
and then once again suits it's all just
14 year old female Japanese gymnast yeah
and a little-known fact also is really
only functioning democracy in the Middle
East
oh that's awkward
we'd take care of it but we know we'd be
in the nightly news so please always do
is not a foam on Twitter not gay Jared
made us cry terrific how much I thought
your photo shops again your costumes and
your suggestions yeah uh what would you
like and also who would like to see for
long-form interviews by the way we have
some coming up we have some changed my
mind's coming up next week some hidden
camera segments a long-form with Dennis
Prager obviously Jordan Pederson but who
else we're always looking for people you
want to hear an interview with an hour
for FM family obligation historian
conclusions we good I apologize for
ready player one yeah wasn't that bad it
was not that bad also Jurassic Park to
I'm surprised you took that one on I
know at G Morgan Jr IDF resident in
chief thank you right I feel so powerful
in this yeah from our Jewish bladder
feel that way that's better
a Jewish wine I think it's a Jewish name
right thanks for doing your research it
actually I looked it up spend computers

overlays you already get it right I'm
ready over here you can follow me on
Twitter don't sweat it I'm gonna form
you at Elon Musk enstein you think he's
wearing black because of the outfit or
easy this was very difficult for you the
tough one to be here and I don't think

what his what his people that I think
he's mourning this episode good good
okay so news of the day listen now
president Donald Trump has now this is
trending invokes the War of 1812 not
really the war but the fact that you
know English colonists colony and Canada
burn in the White House had a call with
Justin Trudeau this comes to us from CNN
Trudeau press Trump on how he could
justify the tariffs as a national
security issue and in response Trump
quipped to Trudeau
didn't you guys burn down the White
House referring to the war issue of 1812
and let it go yet of course listen
there's been a long-standing tension
between Trudeau and president Trump's
it's not a secret and we actually have
exclusive footage of the phone call I
believe that is needlessly insulting of
course we do what about much we are okay
this is how it's gonna go okay you're
going to stop the tariff and you're
going to start up all the your end of
the deal won't be pushed around by the
likes of you oh the guys you burned out
the White House excuse me Oh White House
you put it down at 1812 was a bold move
okay caught us by surprise but that's
just because don't expect their friends
to burnt out their British colonies okay
you're sticking Jumpman did I remind you
about the Revolutionary War the Mexican
American War the spanish-american war
the Civil War freed those guys okay
Persian Gulf War World War one to seek
if you don't buy the appears acute
there's gonna be a three quote oh that's
right I forgot because you guys bet over
for the British I looked at people who
fought about to become the greatest
country the world has ever seen frankly
the greatest your people bent over and
took it at the okay frankly that's why
you still have that old hag on your
buddy
we have Washington Lake and great men
frankly the best man they're gonna make
a Koi to be okay it could have been coy
with Trump with my face at the side of
it you know it should be on the other
side of the coin no be still be back in
Europe it's almost like he takes it the
most is is he so transparent with his
schedule like you know he doesn't he's
not aware of it but you know exactly he
was probably Wikipedia himself that
morning stumbled a product cut across
the page Oh 1812 and like I'm gonna work
this hey hey do you believe this not in
my house do you think it's Fox and
Friends obsession you just know you can
know exactly where he's getting points
this is like breaking news for him you
know it's good the National Institutes
of Health are spending three hundred
fifty thousand dollars on a new study or
I guess they spent three the final
lesbians are using the right form of
contraception leading researchers Jenny
Higgins an associate professor in gender
women's studies as a surprise the
studies examining quote unique barriers
lesbians and bisexuals key word being
bisexuals have to adequate contraceptive
care just so you know the massive study
began with a questionnaire beginning
with are you a lesbian and ending with
them collecting a check that's it and it
may sound absurd some say this study was
simply meant to parlay funding actually
into their next study regarding the
vexing correlation between gay men and
fondness for breasts looks like that's
correlate correlation does not equal
causation yes
and another side another what another
quarter million to uh to deliberate over
the new FAA rules for Penguins so that
was enough but who also happened to be
gay I should have clarify these are
getting into the spirit right Stephen
can't get their backs the more it sits
lesbianism is not linear it's it's it's
a sphere two circle it's a circle of the
spectrum so the more lesbian you become
actually the more susceptible to
pregnancy it's impossible million
discovery I love what they tossing
bisexuals like we're gonna study
contraceptive care I don't think and
bisexuals cut the check I cannot this is
this is a true story right this is a
true story yeah indeed I'm like I'm like
certain passenger history I take that
back
no no he's only think about for this
violation of the German constitution
literally is we did over that time we
were doing a veteran remember that not
dated and it was a great guy kind of
hilarious I can't say that I would never
be able to go back it's an actual
violation of the German constitution
this part will have to be scrapped from
there yeah exist part will not be
scrubbed from the episode so everybody
better keep rolling those burns
speaking of angry raging lesbians at
least they seem so Cecil Richards CeCe
you'll reach Richard he'll feel not the
lion the bad one Planned Parenthood
Planned Parenthood same she sparked
outrage I hate to use it when she but
she tweeted the Trump administration
policy of taking children from their
families is immoral we as a nation are
better than this hash tag families
belong together so I want to make sure
you understand this yeah Cecile Richards
president of an organization that
profits off of literally dismembering
babies and sucking them down a tube is
expressing moral outrage over deporting
illegal immigrants yeah I just let that
sit in yeah most of the time when Adolf
Hitler told Winston Churchill that he
was being a total dick or Mao accused
the Chinese citizens of senseless
violence and scratching my tanks you're
going to wear well
I just bought those white Wow hey you
what can't use cha clear this is this is
she later explained yourself that after
seeing all those born alive children and
tweeted her expressive tweet all that
money down the drain that's really what
she was upset speaking of expressing
herself and also likely a raging angry
lesbian who knows I know she's married
but I would love to meet that husband
Samantha B apologized and just as you
would think it's the worst apology it's
the worst non-apology it's it's not even
a non-apology
it's just bad you know a lot of people
were offended in angry that I used an
epithet to describe the president's
daughter and adviser last week it is a
word I have used on the show many times
hoping to reclaim it I never intended it
to hurt anyone except Ted Cruz many men
were also offended by my use of the word
I do not care about that I should have
known that a potty mouth insult would be
inherently more interesting to them than
juvenile immigration policy if you are
worried about the death of civility
don't sweat it
I'm a comedian I am I'm really sorry
that I said that word but you know what
civility is just nice words maybe we
should all worry a little bit more about
the niceness of our actions okay I agree
with that but guess what her actions are
her show her words are her actions
that's all she does so first off let's
go through that real quick shed her
words never were intended hurt anyone
what about Ivanka well no you have taken
in contact okay
you called her a feckless in which
context was that designed to be anything
short of an insult then she goes I don't
care about them because men aren't
allowed to have opinions on someone
else's actions even if you're calling
said man's wife to c-word I guess then
she blames the news media cycle it's
true listen the media absolutely sucks
the news media the cable news outrage
cycle but so does she she's the one who
feeds into that she sources from
salon.com so she's kind of lost her leg
to stand on
then she closes it by putting on the
comedian hat which used to bother me a
lot about Jon Stewart and even even
Warren Trevor know even more when
Samantha B does it talking about how
matter more than words these are her
actions and here's the thing she hosts a
show in which they do nothing but feign
outrage I notice that right do you see
the irony here yeah absolutely terrible
and everything that she does apparently
can't even do this correct not that bad
about when she comes to lying about
statistical realities home
she's effective that's a really good
jacket for that one
they're brilliant to the left they owned
the media so they can just always go up
there and cover their own tracks just
like Bill Clinton is you see Bill
Clinton on Colbert where he basically
teed him up to apologize for all of his
comments about mama Liu I know that's
apologizing well she talks because I
know it's more interesting than Donald
Trump's asinine immigration policy
oh yes because samantha bee clearly
you're in the minority when it comes to
the media berating Trump over his
immigration policy you're the one
swinging you're swimming upstream right
that's what's happening here
you're risking it Samantha this is what
they always hold themselves out as
martyrs it's maybe you are the news
cycle you're a part of it's TBS I think
it Turner Broadcasting is if I'm not
mistaken as a parent company isn't it
the parent company they're us I think
Ted Turner
yeah he's riding on a bison giving money
with VNC and all this show constantly
demands apologies from people well now
they're providing a non-apology apology
so here's how an honest apology would
have been and I don't want an apology
from Samantha but no are using either
apologize or just be honest okay I got
caught I called the president's daughter
c-word yeah it was intended to be
hurtful I've done in the past I thought
I could continue to get away with it I'm
wrong sorry to those I deliberately
aimed to hurt or just don't apologize
either would be fine
offended I'm a little clueless here too
that she sucked at apologizing and she
said she wanted to reclaim the c-word I
don't know that's another thing what
does that mean I don't know even if it
meant you want to make that word cool
again was it ever cool well never how
much flack I got into not gauge when we
did that poster of Hillary Clinton
and we said is going to be the new
enemy down the back from fun
yeah I'm starting a lot of flack yeah we
still got a lot of we had the
picture of Hillary Clinton like the
Obama blue and red you can go back and
read the article great photos too
election was fantastic and we said this
election is going to be the new
n-word they're going and everyone who
was racist will wake up and all of a
sudden be considered a racist be
considered a sexist I apologize and
whose phone was that whose phone was
that Nightline oh you know what that was
Nightline that was that was my phone
anyway moving on from Samantha B let us
know what you think Seattle's homeless
10th mansion if those aren't that's the
term that's been coined is been growing
so much Department they even added a keg
party April and even though it's an
eyesore to neighbors and tour City
officials have said that the multi tent
encampment is a low priority for sweeps
so they felt comfortable enough to bring
over a keg to the site though they did
warn residents to not share beverages
also they posted a notice to those who
used the homeless tent mansion jacuzzi
should probably tested for AIDS really
you're being tested for not AIDS because
if you use the homeless tent mansion
jacuzzi and dodged that bullet we want
to know how sometimes you hold the Cure
identification is a good thing that's a
scratch that it's rate it's a great it's
expensive have a keg you get a rent the
machine like the equipment who's in the
tent city this homeless has money to go
get a keg who's prioritizing that to go
get the keg methadone yeah or Bud Light
Lime you know its craft don't bad Joe
give me that things I don't like feral
peacocks they're now attacking luxury
cars in British Columbia I think we have
some b-roll of this don't we have these
actual peacocks look there they've been
attacking it actually comes from CBS
News the Mustang not TP fowl they're
saying are taking property damage to a
whole new level they've been running
rampant throughout the town attacking
cars attacking buildings and some
thought this was actually due to the
peacocks mating season some actually
were blaming it of course in a clash
with urban sprawl is to see a lot until
the peacocks started hashtag peacocks
wives matter and now we see what their
true motive was I don't know how else it
could have ended up there organized they
her peacock deer a they're more they're
more organized than Shaun King yeah
alright more going on for them to better
funding yeah I still can't believe right
cuz about pocketing half of it movie an
Ontario teachers license by the way was
suspended for two months after she told
the student to okay I don't even I can't
even necessarily read this she told the
student quote lick me where I I'm
paraphrasing flatulate yeah she said
this teacher had her license young
student to lick me where I fart on my
way said Kevin Spacey
oh so happy I don't have this kind of
windows that's created though you got to
give her some credit this is a sweat
true story right Sven computer this is
true story from Mac well I mean but
here's the funniest part of that story I
didn't I I read through the article a
headline like it doesn't what doesn't
get any worse than this does it no no it
gets better among other things who
complained it quote she told another
student it sounds like your cheeks are
too close together the hallway don't
bother me she only got two I got papers
to correct I didn't get my star but we
thought it was funny to analyze this had
actually been an ongoing problem Dennis
it's a condition oh I mean it was always
difficult but when she brought out my
condition that was crossing the line
I've suffered was gluteous constructive
itís my whole life to be teased by
students there's one thing you know kids
are clean they called about a teacher
like that it's beyond your taste but the
student in question was diagnosed with
gluteus constrictive itis at age six and
despite all the teasing claims he was
beginning to make peace with it how
would I describe it um it's kind of like
an overbite for my ass to get fired in
in socialist country I don't understand
like what if that doesn't get it I don't
know what does well her license was
revoked I said but for like two months
I mean she's having the terrorist watch
list of probably the fastest way to get
a vacation is tell a child is a snack if
he should be offering to unlock her
phone this is somebody who no longer
cares an insult no here's the thing you
know this isn't the first most person
used it oh that's a go to your ass cheek
sound like a too close together like I
said it's great it will give her points
for that conehead
going to we're gonna have razor fist and
then Governor Mike Huckabee so here is
the the other outrage of the day because
this has been a jam-packed week for news
and then it's slowed down come Thursday
thank God for cultural appropriation
must go ah the Forbes 100 highest-paid
athletes list came out and there wasn't
a single woman on the list q outraged
well this is disappointing for the first
time ever no woman made Forbes list of
100 top paid athletes topping the list
were unsurprising names like Boyd
Mayweather Messi and Ronaldo okay so of
course instant complaints calling it a
damning indictment you see from leftist
and journalists this is gonna piss you
off a little bit because the highest
paid or soccer players and I thought
louder with Crowder studios protected
exclusively by Walter
[Applause]
shut down his channel you have a problem
with that not gay Johnny goes insane no
notifications

attitude but I will admit policy was I
think I was wrong I think the last week
I've been pretty damn good to taxes so I
want to know at what point do you admit
that you're or do you say that you're
wrong or what you think about President

you later I'm ready with overlays I have
a big announcement regarding my social
media and that is that I
oh yeah that's healthy and I mean you
can check if it's still there and if you
check it by the way today we're gonna be
getting a lot of people asked after the
Venezuela video with John Oliver the
rebuttal
daepung is sort of myth of the Nordic
socialist are successful so we're gonna
do that today I'm gonna get into that
because we'll be talking about news with
Nigel and Lauren and Owen so look into
that Evergreen segment there but there's
other news of the day a new
whistleblower now claims that Steve
Bannon allegedly used personal data to
try and suppress the black vote this is
a quote from CNN says mr. Bannon sees
cultural warfare as a means to create
enduring change and the American palate
the one thing spent computer you you
notice that this was the headline but
you and I both went in for a quote the
guy doesn't say that Savannah use it to
suppress the black vote there's no where
anything about black vote no there's no
where nothing I must have misread that
no no I didn't miss me at all
they got it wrong because the dad
actually showed that would have been
just as effective
okay Steve Aidan hiding in blind
people's closets that would have worked
better at this scare me also by the way
really quickly this is the whistleblower
for those who don't know in question I
am concerned that we made Russia aware
of the programs that we were working on
and that might have sparked an idea that
you know eventually led to some of the
disinformation programs that we've seen
in the interference that we've seen from
from Russia in American elections holy
crap it's a male lesbian feminist how
even possible a Canadian hipster one no
less I feel like a cosmic wormhole was
creating a parallel socialist
basement-dwelling universe and I I think
you heard
want want want want want suppress black
vote yeah and there's some where you can
watch the whole thing I encourage you to
ya know I go back to bed think I had a
friend who chats has his wife for heaven
or irrational fear of sharks and I said
that's not irrational at all it's a very
rational fear no she thinks they're
under her bed oh yeah good chance I
think that is irrational it's hi there
show there's a good chance to Bannon is
in your bed yes suppressing your vote
right and yet sometimes he puts on a
shark outside the realms of possibility
he puts on a shark head because he likes
to laugh but seriously the
whistleblowers Bible can be a real pain
we've actually we've had problems here
with the in yeah spend computer not good
joke we're okay that's not exactly okay
I appreciate it yeah thanks thanks for
reading on your fellow lighters good wow
Soros have you learned nothing hey hot
lines for that alright dot Elon Musk by
the way he's back in the news that's
always a good topic to cover we don't
get anger with that because Thursday
Tesla data confirmed that the wrecked
Model S was in fact an autopilot when I
hit a truck at 60 miles per hour first
quick to brag on it was Elon Musk
himself tweeting what's actually amazing
about this accident is that the
month-old s hit the fire truck at 60
miles per hour and the driver only
broken ankle at an impact that's but
usually it results in severe injury or
death timing Elon timings he went on to
tweet and especially when taking into
account that it was a female
oriental AI robot the hands via for
which we have uncharacteristically low
expectations come on for our little
robots eat no touch the petal I robot me
log fee while you find my feet a robot
my shoes are slipping in almost almost
seems senseless I mean kind of shooting
out of a learning computer well I
do Shawn did that hide the car I go six
per hour just because is my favorite
story of the week a man at a local news
story almost God is purse stolen and he
made really clear that he was not going
to be giving up his Louie Vuitton bag
hopefully we get him as a guest role
give me your bag and I was like you're
not kidding my Louis Vuitton I worked
very hard for this I got my bags you
could pry it out of my cold dead hands
the confidence is actually well-earned
when you realize he's a black belt in
judo so yeah he looks like the guy who
killed Versace for people who don't
watch it you solo the batting back if
the next words alles mouth were I love I
identify as I hate I talk about such
deep meaning no it just means expensive
it's expensive so you get to be caddy
with other gay guys but I would like to
have him on the show absolutely if
you've got a person that's loaded it's a
weapon so Russia by the way because it's
in the news we have to because you know
it's a show news Thursday for billion
dollar Crimea bridge but they finished
it they fidget but Vladimir Putin Putin
I said this is gonna be I mean I'm gonna
get so much hate mail for this Putin
he's a great man he's country you
believe in the western brother he's real
chill he wanted to be the first across
the bridge but he was beaten by a cat
cat got to it first so that cat by the
way was never seen again
Tilly was fingered action as a
ringleader in Capra channel it occurs
Russian data collecting cats scandals so
that's yeah yeah it's almost almost like
he's he thinks that he's above the law
12 hours is not nothing there's no doubt
he used yes yes hundred percent chance
at the very least he was on EPO there
they actually called Jared to come take
care of the problem he knows how to kill
pets this is true that cage area has a
long race killing gluten
hey speaking of killing things 25 year
old Texas man is in serious trouble
after he was posing as a 17 year old
high school student in order Olivia's
glory days in the basketball squad it's
like high school musical meets rape so
the real story from Dallas news Sidney
Bouvier Gilstrap portly that's also
that's a bunch of names Henry Schmitt
his name was my date underage girls
began the school year at Skyline High
School let make sure I get this right
because a lot of moving pieces there he
enrolled claiming to be a hurricane
Harvie refugee so necessary a little
eight months later transferred to
Hillcrest High School where a dated a 14
year old classmate and joined the
basketball team of course he would
yeah it makes you feel good that that's
in your own backyard in the United
States lest you look down your nose at
other nations of course I was is highly
illegal and once it was discovered to
school was preparing to expel him pursue
legal action so we just slept on a pair
of tights and and went on to win the
female state wrestling titles so all is
well that ends well the dude could still
be dunking on today see that in
the first place you just gotta do a
little think about this no trans ageism
is far more rational the transgenderism
I mean at one point uy is 17 it's true
and you can have a young kid with a high
IQ or an adult who has a fourth-grade
learning level so it's far more
reasonable at one point he's experienced
it he did he never he's never had a
vagina I don't really like the path were
going down it almost seems as though
we're excusing this how stupid do you
have to be to see a 25 year old man and
think he's 17 I mean it's like I'm not
Jake Garrard kind of they're probably
watching too much of the CW network
washing it were 35 year olds play 18
year olds and recruit for sex cults they
were looking at state championship use
for basketball sweet arrow reruns this
is this is Australia everyone I was
vetoed in the pitch meeting we haven't
suffered a Canadian woman has now been
detained and that seems remarkably mild
when he has a rest of the story has been
only detained after getting angry the
Tim Hortons defecating on the floor and
proceeding to hurl it at the employees
so usually we would withhold judgment
from these kinds of stories say you
alright wait till all the evidence comes
in works like a ledger words like
allegedly but in this case we have we're
very damning footage and look yeah make
sure we got we have please we have to
borrow this for the I know you know what
[Laughter]
what I find so crazy about that is sheet
for those who are listening the audio
version she picks up what she picks up
the feces she throws it and then she
grabs a paper towel and because there's
no you
is that like a sling and then she throws
a paper towel so this is the not the
first time he's done this and by the way
for those who haven't seen the clip and
I know we had to blur
that's some serious philosophy on that
drafted said the rebooted Montreal Expos
curveballs and sliders have a whole new
meaning yes I don't know I don't know
how that applies to curveballs that must
be you because there's no call them that
one alone yeah I'm mad you have to be to
take a crap on the floor though it's not
so much yeah that's a good pour hot it's
not high do you have - it's about intent
pooping spitefully is very disturbing it
takes a minute she popped that out
pretty fast I mean like it's like she
can do it on command like like it's just
it's like it's anger poop yeah morons
isn't even that great by the way but the
doughnuts are the oh come on now you're
given your Givens you're given us all
work that's okay we're better than all
right so uh about you I think actually
here to discuss we do have to discuss
what happened to Jane Goodall yeah movie
by the way Congo sucked which was
loosely based on Jane Goodall that's not
true none of it is true I just wanted to
make sure we have enough time to bring
on our next guest actually to discuss
this issue it's a prime minister of
Canada where I was raised I I think do
we have him here Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau are you here sir yes thanks for
having me Stephen I I think what's most
important for people stateside to
understand is that this is not in any
way representative of all the citizens
of Canada I don't I don't think any of
us thought that it was representative
although citizens of Canada no I don't
think that see well at the same time I
want to extend a hand of grace and
understanding to our oft maligned and
misunderstood throwing community and I
said I think that a vibrant and rich
addition to Canada's people kind I don't
think that's an actual subset that's not
a community at all
I found that contrary to your approach
in the United States here in Canada
conflict is not our our first course of
action but and I don't know the
upbringing of this young Canadian lady
in the Tim Hortons and until I've walked
a mile in her steamy shoes no see that's
a big could not be less relevant her
from this is why what yeah
I failed again see all right listen
Prime Minister Trudeau this is a crime
I'm sorry story here okay what's the
mouth get rid of all right prime
minister justin trudeau everybody that's
enough we shouldn't have him on the show
anymore Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
he's also very difficult to frame
properly predictable in this responses
bizarre arms too as well for wine that
footage for those who missed it find an
easter egg
we apologize there we go okay so no
strong opinions on that and the flinging
feces no all right okay so let's get to
this we got a lot of feedback on this
we've talked about this for those who
are not among club members in The Daily
Show quite a bit this idea of the Nordic
socialist model yeah right we hear this
quite a bit and this was used well they
keep moving the goalposts and that's
what's important here we hear
socialism's work so now we hear well
place like venezuela didn't do socialism
correctly right even though they were
being praised not long ago by Sean Penn
and Paulo everybody in the London Bernie
Sanders so they keep moving and they see
boho second the Nordic countries are we
should model those and if don't take my
word for it socialism I'm not looking at
Venezuela I'm not looking at Cuba I'm
looking at countries like Denmark and
Sweden is it really possible for someone
who calls himself a socialist to be
elected president United States well so
long as we know what democratic
socialism is and if we know that in
countries in Scandinavia like Denmark
Norway Sweden in those countries health
care is a right of all people in those
countries college education graduate
school is free in those countries
retirement benefits child care are
stronger than in the United States of
America okay a couple of things we're
gonna get to actually the danish prime
minister who said that's not true I
think it's important okay Marley was
dead to begin with it's people need to
understand these scheme and even
countries they don't they don't owe
their success to socialism they actually
became very wealthy first off under free
market economies and then later imposed
by the way in some forms so in some ways
they're certainly further to the left of
the United States but in other ways
we'll get to like corporate tax rates
not even close but later on after they
built their economy imposed some high
taxes and large welfare states so for
instance 1870 through 1936 Sweden was
the fastest growing economy in the world
but after 1975 when as we assured expand
the welfare
state its economic growth starting to
trawl after that Scandinavian countries
begin reducing the size reducing the
size of the government if you look at
you look at okay gross
alright implemented welfare state yeah
and then standstill and they start
reducing it so since the nineteen ninety
is a total taxation of the Swedish
economy is a percentage of the GDP has
fallen more than five percent yeah so I
wanted to interrupt real quick on these
points like we're a lot of people will
believe this a lot of people will
believe what Bernie Sanders just said
right and so it's all of our
responsibility it's not Steven hey great
job you go get them everybody tune in
pick out these points and be able to
tell your friends because they're going
to believe that this is true because the
media won't call him on it is very
common that anywhere else so you have to
do it we all have to do it with us too
we'll have these sources up you can see
the overlays here on the screen I want
you to call us on this okay
yeah I I don't don't just nod your head
with what were saying this is the
opposite of Trevor Noah saying as
audience we want you to watch what they
say entirely and then watch what we say
and if we're wrong call us so much I'm
sure I'll get something wrong today so
one thing to these these places it's the
pure it's the purity they try to argue
like well it's not real socialism
Venezuela you think that a place like
Sweden is more socialist than Venezuela
the prime minister of Denmark just
recently said again the Nordic model
still isn't socialist okay Bernie
socialism involves abolishing the free
market return that means production to
people's government like in Venezuela
that's what social so this is one thing
that people often do this is the bait
and switch right they go they go well
it's worked in Nordic countries where
they have socialized how c'mon think
that's not that's not socialism if
there's one thing right and certainly
not if you're saying well it didn't work
in Venezuela it didn't work in places
like Cuba because they didn't it wasn't
some of Travis's programs could have
been sustainable if he pursued a sound
economic policy but what about is
question of the day would love to hear
your feel what example would you use if
you're an advocate for socialism for
successful long term socialism to which
country would you point I'm curious
because John Oliver released this videos
we talked about the Venezuela video here
and he talks about how important it is
and there's there's there's nothing new
here really does end I really want you
to go watch the entire video what is it
about 19 about 19 minutes I encourage
you to watch the entire context we're
going to try to do our best to get to
the factual information presented there
is less and less with each done Oliver
video let's go clipping has been hard to
keep up with events in Venezuela due to
the hurricane that we've all been
dealing with here although if you follow
conservative media at all you might have
seen it frequently painted as the
inevitable dire consequences of a
socialist government for a case in point
just watch this Infowars reporter
quizzing an extremely chill Bernie
Sanders supporter your honor a majority
of the country is currently eating rats
while their politicians are drinking
champagne on a daily basis if Bernie
Sanders were president right and he
wanted to bring the same ideas as social
for socialism into this country why
should you dressed like Donald Duck do
you think that we would benefit yeah but
I just told you Venezuela is getting
rats I'm screwed Sailor Moon but I just
want build-up health care I don't want
like worms in your brain and honest
what you do up there is a nice
distillation of the current level of
political discourse in America to people
who don't really know what they're
talking about condescending to each
other nonsensically until one of them
lands a sick bird do you think I
actually agree with almost everything
you just said except for the sick burn
part and that's what's important air
we're gonna get to the examples a dad of
the facts and all of our sources in a
minute but if you think I just I just
want free health care you people have
worms when your head is a sick burn no
facts data or analysis thereafter and
this piece here can convince you all
right I just wanna make sure because we
just have to we disagree at that point
by the way it's a classic strong memory
he sits there and talks about two people
who have no idea what they're talking
about if it's if it's so lowbrow why did
you choose this example you could have
taken an example of Noam Chomsky and Sam
hare is talking about social you could
have this is what you pick but what is
happening in Venezuela it's not just
extremely important it is absolutely
worth paying attention to because this
is not just a story about socialism
there are plenty of socialist countries
that look nothing like Venezuela it's a
story about epic mismanagement but you
repeat yourself see the entire criticism
of socialism the entire reason that
conservatives the right-wing what do we
want to call us oppose a path toward
intrusive government is predicated on
the idea the concept as worth of
mismanagement for which we are roundly
mocked sums that capitalism designed to
prevent yes it's almost those designs do
management it no your the thing you
don't even have to believe that
capitalism is correct to agree with me
when I say that conservatives and
capitalists fear that socialism we
believe socialism to result in gross
mismanagement even even the United
States by the way so socialist but
socialism or government bureaucracy plus
time equals mismanagement equals failure
see examples and healthcare Social
Security education and banking gen
Albert goes on he goes on to say there
plenty of socialist nations we said in
that clip I think that looked different
from Venezuela implying success
now I thought and we've talked I thought
he's going to point to the the Nordic
model yeah as so many left us do even
attempt to do that or a little while it
looks like it's working until you run
out of people's money until the danish
prime minister says we're not so sure
yeah bernie sanders please shut up you
can call it democratic socialism you can
call it national socialism there
is no good socialism that's the only
constant and it always results in
mismanagement let's see and I've said
this before when we've covered what's
going on in Venezuela it is not one
thing it is not just the fact that it's
a socialist country it is under factors
that played a role in the economic
downfall of the country I'm not saying
that we all live in communist you know
the Soviet Union or China terrible
terrible things happen there but that's
what we always we always revert to you
know we say well is there not is it not
possible that we could for a start they
didn't do it properly they ignored it
thank you everybody says but no one's
ever done it properly
inevitably point you to the next brand
of socialism which will work or the next
leader who will do it better that's all
we've seen all of our current leftist
leaders and I'm not about extremists I'm
talking about your political leaders
we're all stars a platform representives
for the DNC praising all the previous
socialist and communist dictators who
end up being awful terrible people Fidel
Castro they forgot that he educated the
kids gave them health care totally
transform the society it would be wrong
my state that in Cuba they have made
some good advances in health care they
are sending doctors all over the world
fund AIDS they have made some progress
in education they can send doctors
wherever they want right if people don't
want the doctors that's like I could you
know I could go to the the Tokyo
Superdome I could say I perform at the
Tokyo Superdome but I didn't sell it out
I didn't sell out anything on raft and
the ref is this desk chair we're gonna
get out of there and you saw of course
we have the Beatle here of Obama and in
front of Che and the whole revolution
over it's just like oh my gosh let's
let's be reverent to a man who said
before the UN that they would execute
without trial and by the way hated black
people thought they were lazy and
deserving of death again you look back
they were praising all these socialist
leaders right in people it was actually
more talk about Castro but let me
matter-of-fact guess who found himself
amongst the figureheads worthy of praise
and his country is it possible maybe he
is one of the most important forces
we've had on his planet from my very
American
of my friend as an inch of is it is only
possible to be so inspiring as he is
sometimes American journalist talk about
how bad the country is because people
are lining up fools it's funny we write
these shows every day and we sit down
and when you really put it on time like
this
it's even more damning than I thought
they try and distance themselves from
the results yeah right that's what
happens here's the thing Bernie Sanders
didn't come out and say I was wrong
about bread lines it turns out there's
not free next day shipping he didn't
have a flash of genius moment he's still
a socialist he just slapped Democratic
in front of it and by the way they've
praised these peep this is again
mainstream leftism please go watch the
whole video you can go back and find
clips of John Oliver saying things of
the same effect so much it's so
embarrassing that John Oliver himself
even has to hedge his bets in his own
video and acknowledging how much the
left kind of loved Chavez to the fans
each others many of his social programs
were initially effective during his
tenure the poverty rate was nearly
halved and to this day many Venezuelans
revere Chavez to a dramatic degree
halved okay let's let's go to poverty
how well it's easy to cut poverty in
half when you use taxpayer dollars and
cease production just for a little while
if you just take all of all of the
monies and all of the things and you
know what you could also completely
unlimited unemployment if you forced
everyone to dig ditches with spoons you
could it doesn't mean it's a real
economy it gets propped up North Korea
did the same thing for slaver only works
for so long before you fall off the edge
and you had a point about that right
spin yeah I mean beep if they didn't
have oil you know they would have had to
build a wall around that country and
stuff their own people don't know how
good it is outside what happened what
they did you know what's great the left
has never called out on this crap this
is the problem with social him it's it's
like one of those things you get the
dollars with like a bar of soap it's one
of those party tricks that keeps
slipping through your hands
they're never called out Joe Biden was
talking about having meetings there when
he was running as vice president with
people he never met diners that didn't
even exist
right number the BP oil spill left lemon
an to talk about this afterward to talk
about the 18 billion dollar lawsuit that
occurred versus Chevron let's turned out
to be fraudulent they never get called
on the scrap because george w bush said
nucular because because because
president donald trump has a bad
comb-over you guys we're all praising
venezuela for years for years we can
sure we only have so much time on the
show and you were wrong you're always
wrong and the media never call how nice
it must be to never because i predict
just yesterday and supporting the
embassy called out for apparently taking
shekels from jews and Illuminati
no one's gonna call any of these people
out on praising chavez and bread lines
in venezuela you are on the left is
always wrong and i'm saying that an
absolutist yes absolutely as it relates
to socialism and no one calls him on it
i am amazed next clip now Chavez could
act the way that he did because
Venezuela was oil-rich and over the
course of his presidency he took more
and more state control over their
national oil company enabling him to
fund programs benefiting the poor and
when that company protested some of the
changes that he was making he responded
by using his TV show to address its
executives directly there Peter I'm
firing the following people mr. Juan
Fernandez you are fired from petroleum
of Venezuela Eddie Ramirez thank you
very much
you were fired
also Mariano Rodriguez you are not fired
but if you don't stop talking to your
boyfriend on speakerphone you absolutely
will be on the outset he's praising it
yeah watch the full video the full
context because you'd be like nobody's
gonna counterbalance it after him he
never does he literally takes an example
of one of I would argue one of the most
horrific displays of socialist
authoritarianism and he never dresses it
as horrifying yeah I think the words
government took control the state could
took controls oil companies then fired
executives can only generate one of two
visceral reactions disgust
freedom-loving disgust or admiration
we're saying the exact same thing you're
saying the state took control of the oil
companies and for executives I'm
thinking the state took control the Oh
companies in fired executives like I'm
saying listen you hear this the state
seizing control and firing executives
one of two reactions all right
disgust or admiration now now this isn't
a rebuttal right here okay I'm telling
you this we're not gonna find common
ground if you hear that and you're okay
this isn't a rattle it's a litmus test
right you have to figure out where you
line up next clip some of Travis's
programs could have been sustainable if
he pursued a sound economic policy and
run a tight ship but not only did he
stop saving oil revenues in a rainy day
fund he also oversaw a government that
transparency international found to be
the most corrupt country in Latin
America but what about is there is no
mention of is if he run a tight ship ha
yes the tight the tight ship policy this
didn't work with Venezuela okay if now
you're taking a big if with countries
that aren't rich in oil they were
starting off halfway through the foot
race as far as a head start all
Venezuela had to do was mat fumble it's
easy to see what Maduro has pissed
people off because he has managed
Venezuela's economic crisis in the worst
possible way he's doubled down on many
of Chavez his most unsound policies like
unrealistic currency and price controls
while attempting to make up for missing
revenue by simply creating more money
and as a result inflation has exploded
they're hedging here he used a lot of
hedge words is unrealistic okay
you guys remove that and just make
everything that he likes price controls
Democrats damn and I'm just saying
liberal progressives Democrats okay for
people out there like I'm on a classic
liberal no you're not
Democrats have actively supported price
controls for college for years Bernie
Sanders calling for price controls on
pharmaceuticals unrealistic printing
walkers printing war currency Obama's
economic economic philosophy was based
on quantitative easing
this is from Obama the feds mandate my
mandate is to grow our economy and
that's not just good for they say that's
good for the whole world so or thing
could happen in the world counties we
end up stuck with no growth at our very
listen the guy the left has caught you
look at the Federal Reserve understand
what that is under look at people the
most radical right leading people they
want to go back to a gold back standard
right this is something that
conservatives have been openly mocked
for opposing for years printing of more
cash it's a fundamental premise of the
left right as far as Keynesian economics
um by the way I learned Keynesian
economics in college never one shred
Adam Smith maybe John Oliver and I went
to the same College probably not alright
next clip and those shortages have had
some terrible consequences yes this food
shortage is widespread over the last
year three-quarters of the population
has lost an average of almost twenty
pounds look how fat I used to be this is
how many holes I had to make in my belt
on the Maduro the Maduro
diet that is actually now a commonly
used phrase in Venezuela and it's a very
healthy sounding term for a truly
horrifying situation okay I'm on a
second I'm that guy looks not bad he
must have been really fact picking the
wrong examples again yeah
starvation okay the years where we can
find common ground right we all agree
starvation is bad there we go but why is
there starvation why are there food
shortages what the government do with
food fix the prices that's textbook
social we just talked about fixing
prices we just talk about the left
opposing what they call price gouging
raising the price when there's lower
supply this results in chronic shortages
because the price is set to live he
literally after this just goes on to
make fun
Maduro and attack him for eating an
empanada honor it's a 19 minute video I
highly recommend that you go and watch
the entire thing there's almost no
continuation as far as critics easy to
find SATs top of the tourney it's at the
top of the tournament as far as
continuation of the policies any any any
criticism now why why is there no
continued criticism on the policies it
goes on to talk about what a jerk Maduro
is because the policies are either
identical to us we have Chavez or far
too similar to policies of today's
current left supports including John
Oliver so go watch the video see for
yourself it's on 19 minutes I want you
to watch it okay I want you to come back
and comment I want you to question our
sources I want you to get as much
context as humanly possible and make up
your own mind that's what I want you to
do and I see this with John Oliver more
and more and more and more you know I
used to start off where we would have to
go through a 12-minute video and go
through each source we scraped this
video for every single piece of factual
information he presented there's very
very little and I don't want to
fact-check jokes I don't want to jump on
a guy for telling jokes I think some of
the bits in there are funny but that's
not what this was about this has three
million places at the top of training
this is at the front page of HuffPo
because people like what he has to say
so we wanted to see what it was that he
had to say
and I think that you need to get as much
contact as possible make up your mind
because like I said okay if you think
the statements like I just want free
health care any of worms in your head if
you think that's a slick bone or if
you're hearing that the state seems
controlled production and fired
executive if that statement warms your
cockles there's no middle ground for us
ok this is something important a lot of
people's all we wants to be a leader no
I don't care as much about civility as I
do about honesty and we need to get to
the truth we find common ground starving
is bad we find common ground we don't
like poverty that's great that's enough
common ground we don't need to act as
though we're finding common ground on
economic policy that is evil you see the
results time after time after time after
time and you'd think it'd have egg on
their face because they praised people
who were evil in Castro in people like
Shabbos and I'm pretty sure you could
probably find them praising Maduro at
some point too because I mean really
we've we have clips of them praising
bread lines it's not too far-fetched to
say somewhere down the line Maduro got a
pat in the back from Bernie Sanders so
there's no middle ground here if you
just find those statements to be
heartwarming I disagree with you and

you've lost your say comment I'd love to
see what you a genuinely I must have
asked this question before no arse never
know I never asked it thanks
for saving the entire world well we have
to move on to more important news before
we get to that Roman Polanski apparently
came out and he dismissed the hashtag me
too movement as mass hysteria from NBC
News is an interview with a Polish
Newsweek the director said the me to
reckoning is an example of quote
collective hysteria that occasionally
grips society leading people to react
mostly out of fear yes responded to
throngs of underage girls he sodomized
on quaaludes Roman Polanski was Bill
Cosby not available I couldn't get Woody
Allen on the payroll quaaludes money'll
millennial rape victims are so spoiled
yes of all people hashtag shut up like
listen you managed to avenge us you
managed to avoid arrest
shut up take the W and go away okay it
could get a lot worse if we don't report
this I guess real news I get an op
nights Diller who speaks out on gun
control now
yes exactly I'll be stay tuned a woman
on Huffington Post but I don't know any
other way it's hard for me to explain
this in a way yeah this is interesting
that provides content I'm gonna do my
best so at HuffPo this lady is now
saying that theme parks fat-shamed
guests when they don't let them enjoy
all the rides this is a direct quotes as
well safety is often the given reason
that fat people are excluded it's clear
that companies are actually just keeping
the general public safe from our fatness
I refuse to take on the additional guilt
of not having gotten into Harry Potter
until I was 35 okay first off those
Muslim terrestrially I want you to think
of the words that I just spoke in the
order I spoke them to form that sentence
kill yourself because it's worse than
Stephen King's the mist you don't want
to be here for the rest of it slow this
girl was right this was the person who
was banned I guess from Harry Potter
world for being sofa I've been on those
rides by the way yeah they're not very
girthy yeah okay I've been I was next to
a girthy person there so I'm surprised
if this person couldn't fit then it must
been really bad but then a person
Huffington Post was writing about it
chiming in like like velociraptors
communicating over their fatness and she
wrote I'll admit that despite the
annoying JK Rowling versus Nate
people scandal that I doubt you've heard
anything about but I followed because
I'm native so this is the author at
Huffington Post right right to the fat
Native American victim card so I guess
this needs a smallpox tarp okay I
am so I mean I just I cannot read enough
an impost who I can't stand right about
people who I can't stand for you because
you can't be bothered because you don't
want to read up and in post I don't
blame you if you think that's like
somewhere deep in the article no she
lied she that was the lead I was the
lead which is funny you know you don't
even really think of indigenous people
as fat generally but this writer HuffPo
she claims to be a part of the I want to
make sure I get this right for fear of
HuffPo writers claims to be a part of
the Minik Apache Tribe which actually
from its native tongue translates to one
who requires the north wall to her
apartment be broken down when she has a
stroke a peaceful journey into the
afterlife young coronary
may you be kept safe till you see the
great red chief Ronald Weasley oh fat
are you that you couldn't make it to the
venture through Hogwarts another story
people are gonna like this a flaming
rabbit has now been blamed officially
for sparking Saskatchewan wildfire this
comes from my home so for those dopes
land fire was carried out by a fire
department at beardies and oka meeseeks
Creek nation unfortunately after a
controlled burn was conducted and
thought to be extinguished a rabbit on
fire lit another adjacent section of
bush they should have never let that
little prick volunteers tribute it's in
the name what did you accept it what did
you expect the statue I you know do you
know how pissed smokey the bear is made
you famous like a brother to be the
fight is flame flowing rabbits hey a
Texas school is now making headlines is
this and we're gonna get to Iran North
Korea trust me but it's it's it's been a
long week
they're making headlines for their
tradition of birthday spankings yeah
it's comes from a CVS local station in
Texas it's been a tradition for eight
years at Alvord elementary school for
principal Bridget Williams to give
students quote birthday spankings until
recently when parents complained calling
it inappropriate kinda many parents
defended principal Williams of parents
saying parents like Heather redder
saying they're not used to a small-town
community and that's what we are people
that move you from the big city they
don't realize they're not used to this
because a lot of people are moving from
the big city and the Texas for the
economy so it's truly and it's changed
the culture the practice has since been
exchanged with birthday quote light
joking and putting your hand in its
mouth so that's it's almost like you're
exchanging one for something worse so
what are ya is like can I go back a
major in that drop your egg see
the guest lecturer cuz uh I'm an expert
in the field and we have guest lecturers
at grade schools listen they give guests
bankers though apparently that's right
would you like to spank our children and
then listen I thought I think we're
Panza fied and you and I read this going
like oh geez birthday spankings Wow Wow
it was a guy someone someone someone
searched that principal's office because
I guarantee you there's a poster on the
wall like Shawshank we're gonna carve
out a hole and find a sex dungeon in
there
in other news principal different New
York mayoral candidate Cynthia Nixon
came out and said that pot could be a
form of reparations in black
neighborhood that's good
so nation on Saturday told Forbes yeah
we have to make sure that communities
that have been harmed and devastated by
because because sometimes people say
you're afraid to do the black lady voice
because of political crisis I just don't
think of it you're welcome have been
devastated by marijuana arrest get the
first shot at this industry it's a form
of reparations and Reverend Al Sharpton
I kid you not came out and tweeted quote
let's bring this you have it send
computer let's bring this up I'm
legalizing marijuana and I like Cynthia
Nixon but putting pot shops and our
communities is not reparations what the
black community needs most
moment or teleprompters to build a
movement of resistance but resist we
much we mum goes the dynamite
note to Cynthia Nixon when Al Sharpton
calls you out for race baiting you're
too hot it's too I you bet you have puff
pass put away you gotta respect the game

managers read man speaking of the
chronic dr. Dre just lost a trademark
battle with a gynecologist called dr.
Dee Rai dr. Dre yeah this comes from the
BBC the cases first 2015 is on the case
for a kid first came up when
gynecologist Dre on and Burch tried to
trademark the name dr. Dre the other dr.
Dre this sounds confusing objected
saying the similarity could cause quote
confusion especially as is near name
sake you wanted to sell audio books and
seminars under the monitor hey okay
listen let's not what dr. Dre you're not
a real doctor and you're also not a real
Dre Dr Dre should now be known as
illegally unlicensed charlatan Andre

a real dog but surprisingly is a
proctologist
yeah likes to snoop them dog yes get
over there
do some time in prison there I'm yeah bu
TT so vape pens apparently now it's who
are exploding in people's faces a
pandemic exhibit a story from this week
this guy this is Idaho car salesman
Andrew Hall formerly an enthusiastic
vapor but andrew has vowed to quit
smoking for good after his vape pen blew
up in his face motion House of the
weekend when Andrew was enjoying a few
don't know quell getting ready for work
and you wrote on Facebook that he was
vaping in his bathroom ooh now that's
good I see you Facebook and then posted
from the ICU who is thought to be a
faulty battery though a new scientific
investigation ex is a common it's been
happening a lot throughout the country
really reveals that it's actually a
chemical combustion that occurs when
nicotine reacts with too much douche you
drew me in there punk what did you see
yeah what does it take to start a
national conversation about vape culture
I don't know did you see the explosion
by the way for people who are listening
audio or people go what go look at the
picture there's like the drywall is gone
there's soot all over the what was he
vaping an ACME firecracker
what's the roadrunner in the bathtub
with a plunger beeping aah Oh an
Instagram it's so bad the explosions
beep oh anvil lost his teeth everywhere
I kind of hate vapors anyway and when he
was asked to what's the crazy thing when
he was asked if he was concerned about
his teeth as much as the the damage to
the wall and what bothered him most he
said I know it wasn't so much concerned
about his teeth quote as much as my flat
build semi sideways baseball cap which I
wear indoors because I never had a dad
though he was no stranger to actually
losing teeth due to quote people always
punching me in the face for my flat
build semi sideways baseball cap that I
wear indoors because I never had a dad
[Laughter]
this is why father's matter yes this is
why I don't know I don't like papers
they feel like they can do it anywhere I
had person do it in a wine tasting I
don't really care they'd rather your
favorite other vape explosives they
better do it the Croesus surplice vaping
population I say don't change a thing
hey speaking of things that people are
gonna get mad about Elon Musk I know you
guys all he's your darling he's better
known for Tesla someone saying SpaceX is
now starting a candy company he tweeted
out that he's starting a candy company
and it's going to be amazing when people
thought it was a joke he later went on
to say quote super serious so um you
know this is a topic that's been
capturing the public's attention and we
wanted to talk with him about it I
believe we have Elon Musk
do we have a Miss line mr. musk thank
you for being with us sir thanks for
having me Steven absolutely so Elon the
first question this begs candy industry
why why would you the canned industry is
one of the few that has been stagnant
for decades as a matter of fact in our
lifetimes the canned industry has
remained almost completely unchanged in
merit but agriculture and industrial
revolutions let alone digital uh-huh I'm
having a little trouble direction and
which is what I plan to disrupt with my
new confections theme you know you keep
saying that I'm not entirely sure with
that what are you what are you doing -
soda pop rock delicious and renewable
yeah I'm not I don't think that's
exactly going to catch on mr. Ilan I
don't think that's going to be a well
Osby complimented by our new wind
turbine fields man hi y'all gummy see I
don't think that your target demographic
namely six-year-olds are gonna be overly
concerned with with that with renewable
energy bodies ring pops yeah which can
launch into space
that sounds in expensive of course
subsidized ah well of course mr. mr.
musk um what do you say to critics is
just a move to distract from the fact
that you may be removed as a chairman
that a test was soon that this could be
a little bit of smoke world will always
have critics to them I simply say come
with me this is incredibly a world of
pure imagination take a look and help me
okay Elon yeah yeah I think that's
enough with with your singing and I have
a flair for showmanship but a trance do
you think we'd have more common ground
on this then you would expect okay all
right I'm willing to listen house
make paradise simply open up your
wallets anything you want to do it want
me to change the world just a few
billion yeah that's pretty much what I
expected that's enough Elon Musk
everybody I don't yeah I don't know I
don't need to think about it
come on cut him off I don't think we
need to have Elon Musk on the program by
the way ever see use fan and Elon in the
logically how do you argue it goes from
day 39 not a life day 40 alive men and
women literally cannot understand each
other around this when life agrees with
me and every woman who works on this
show so let's go let's go let's say you
disagree with them listen to me I've had
two kids okay listen to me but you just
said men and women cannot agree my wife
and I agree and every woman on the show
men in women can't agree you and I don't
really glad to have her next this is a
return guest actually uh because people
with whom we disagree often don't come
back on the show despite us trying to be
as respectful as civil as possible it
doesn't matter sometimes it doesn't
matter it matters not so our next guest
very happy to have her back I read some
of her literature in college I believe
it yeah when I wasn't much so I've known
her for a long time it's like I've been
I've been peering she's been in a
fishbowl and I've been watching her for
a long time back in the college a so you
can follow her on the Twitter at me mayo
me are wolf and her website is daily
clout dot IO daily clout dot IO MS wolf
thank you for being back thank you so
much Steven I'm really happy to be here
well I'm glad I appreciate you coming
back and we were just talking before air
and you said that you got some positive
feedback last time even though we
disagreed right yes yeah no it was
really really nice I appreciate your
audience and I appreciated the
conversation there's so much polarized
kind of staged left versus right combat
in this country which is already divided
enough and your audience kept tweeting
me saying you know I didn't agree with a
lot of what you said but I appreciated
the the open dialogue you had with
Steven so that was cool yes it is very
and we actually we've invited actually
you're actually I hate to say a
replacement because you were busy when
we invited you I think recently and then
we had Maria del Russo invited back on
and should know and actually I think she
even got more positive feedback at the
end because it was her first time on air
so you never know sometimes people just
don't like a disagreement I've always
tried to be straightforward about this I
don't care about civility as much as
honesty but I try to afford it to
everybody but truth is what matters most
this bill in California now that would
force public colleges I think what is SB
I have it here somewhere on moment I
don't know there's a bill in California
I don't know the exact
people will fact-checking on it there's
a bill that will force public colleges
universities to provide abortion pills
up to ten weeks afterward to women now
there's been a lot of controversy about
this we've covered this on the on the
website and you actually in your site
which I which I very much admired had a
pro-life feminist organization post an
article and I know you've talked about
it in subsequent videos and podcasts
Senate bill three 20% it bill 320 there
we go yeah I was gonna get it wrong it
was 420 and then we're gonna get what no
now you have that wrong and then you
talk about even though you yourself are
pro-choice to use the term um what what
inspired you to do that um well so daily
clout is a platform that has gives
everyone the ability to search bills
like really just described and find you
know a whole set of them of I'm sorry of
bills by you know by by state or by
subject and then embed the actual live
bill in social media you can tweet this
bill for instance to you know your
networks in California if you want to
support or oppose the bill tweet the
bill sponsors so it's a way for all of
your audience and I really encourage
your audience to go to daily cloud IO
and use Bill camp to became become
lobbyists themselves and the reason I
wanted to showcase the president of
feminists for life talking about this
bill is a were nonpartisan but be you
know she has very powerful things to say
about why in her view this bill is not a
feminist bill and you know we welcome
anyone from any any political background
writing an op-ed about you know bills
that they can find in bill camera they
bills at the federal level or the state
level that they they want to lobby
around her position was that if we
really supported women you know we would
create conditions where no woman would
have to choose abortion so I'm pro-life
I don't agree with the policy
prescriptions that she what did I just
say oh my god
I'm technically pro-choice okay I was
confused and my follow up was about to
entirely change I'm pro-choice but that
was an interesting slip I really respect
the position
feminists for life because they are
unusual they really are feminists and
that's why you can't reduce feminism to
a simple set of positions they really
say all life is sacred they oppose the
death penalty they oppose you know
euthanasia
they are absolutely in favor of
everything that that supports life and
sustains life so they are very coherent
critique of abortion and you know their
view is let's make it if we really
cherished women and children women
wouldn't have to choose abortion yes
well I obviously listen shocker I'm
pro-life so I don't want you to feel
you're being sandbag I disagree with
their ideology their I think they're a
litany of reasons why I would and
particularly this bill but I would like
to for people who don't know know know
I'm pro-life I'm pro-life um so but I
would love for you to express your views
on abortion because I've heard you
express them I've seen you write about
them and you you do if I'm not mistaken
I want to make sure I understand it and
I'd like you to express it to the
audience because I do have some
questions you do believe that it is the
termination of a life but you are a
pro-choice but you want to reduce
abortion than you think it should be not
mistaken less celebrated than it is by
today's sort of progressive left if I've
gotten anything wrong please let your
views be represented by yourself sure
thank you so much so I mean it's such a
hard issue to talk about without being
reductive I did write an essay called
our bodies our souls in 1995 that was
very much taken up by the pro-life
movement in which I mean kind of this
argument I said and and I wrote it after
having been you know been pregnant and
had a baby and you know I'm still put
ice but after you are pregnant and have
a baby and you know you get to that
four-month period and the baby's like
leaping about there's literally no way
that you can pretend there's not a being
mm-hmm right and so it was a very
nuanced essay in which I basically said
the language
we're using an approach choice movement
around this issue is the wrong language
it's very reductive it's not just a
clump of cells it's not just a choice
it's a much more you know many women
experience it as a tragedy you know
where a lot I'm not saying they have to
but but just that is woman's experience
often and I just thought that the
discourse around the pro-choice movement
it was quite soulless and yeah you have
to face the fact that it is the
beginning of a life you know you can't
if you're pregnant and you're at six
weeks and the you know obstetricians
like oh the baby's doing great you know
if you don't want it's a condom so you
know we can't it can't be just dependent
on can I ask a couple of questions
because I find this I find this very
interesting I don't I don't agree with
you but I do find it interesting a
couple of things it sounds to me like
your position is much more that of
classical feminism which was abortion
should be safe legal and rare that was
the term we hear that was the what we
had heard repeated a lot and now it's
abortion on demand taxpayer-funded
period and you actually see people with
those signs that is the platform of the
DNC Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders may
but not yourself you cannot find anyone
in today's DNC who does not stand on
that position period they would be
considered an extremist whereas your
view seems to be more in line with
classical feminism so when that's the
position today when that's the policy
today when in places like Colorado
abortions occur up to 26 weeks but when
you see it seen as a travesty even in
Texas up to 20 weeks we're like well ha
a second this is a violation of women's
choice first question is when faced with
that what if we believe it's a life
what's wrong with being reductive if
it's a life it is reductive like okay I
said beginning of what will be a life if
it continues to you know the pregnancy
continues let me step back is you what I
really hate as a woman and and I'm just
being honest and I know you like it when
people are honest I really hate these
moments where especially a man says yeah
you have to choose you have to choose
right what's wrong with being reductive
and and whatever I'm asking a question I
don't know what's wrong with being
reductive when faced with the idea of
listen I believe it's a life so that is
that the argument is reductive and
that's not a negative thing it's a life
in my opinion and I'll defend it I'm
trying to say is if wherever as a
country gonna have really good policies
around the issue of unwanted pregnancies
we have to be a little more patient
because what women will say if you
really listen to them about this issue
takes a little longer and is more
nuanced okay though in my view I really
believe that categorically a woman needs
to be able to control her own body even
if that can lead to a very tragic choice
sometimes right she has to I believe
that in the first trimester there should
be no restrictions on a woman choosing
abortion on demand you know and that's
the situation in Europe and in most
civilized countries and it is
taxpayer-funded and also contraception
is taxpayer-funded and you would have
very you'd have half the number of
unintended pregnancies
if contraception was readily available
paid for by the government as it is all
over Europe in every same society we
have gotten off the libertarian beam so
let's make sure we're clear and that guy
was assuming we were starting from the
same premise now we're talking about
taxpayer-funded abortions contraception
so I I'm talking bear with me I mean the
most humane and enlightened pro-lifers
that I've spoken to you also want
contraception freely available
you know they it's much they see freely
I sure as much much morally better than
you know abortions right I mean they do
and I have to agree with them you know
really available of course I would never
restrict anyone's access to to purchase
contraception okay so whoever pays for
it I mean I personally think if you're
gonna have roads and you're gonna have
schools
you should have free condoms and
contraception but that is that you know
that would make so much of a better
society and a better planet but whatever
you're eating at that aside in Europe
after the first trimester it's much more
difficult to get an abortion and so they
don't have the passionate emotional wars
that we have here over second trimester
abortions right but what they do have is
a lot of support for them
there are a lot of options a lot of you
know government support if you are
having a baby that you can't look after
that you you can't afford okay um and so
to me that's a humane and and
libertarian you know solution because
you cannot have a society in which you
Steven
tell me Naomi that I can't control what
happens to my body you know within a
reasonable amount of time okay may I
respond to that
sure well no I just I don't you you you
you you you're you're very you're more
verbose than I am and I want to make
sure when I ask the questions that I can
ask them clearly so that we can get
clear answers and and and counter
answers um a couple of things I don't
think you can have a libertarian Society
where you Naomi force me to pay for your
abortion or contraception on the issue
of you know it being irritating when a
man forces I'm not forcing you to make a
choice an ideological choice here you
know my wife volunteers at a crisis
pregnancy center five days a week so and
I've done it as well this is but a
pro-life crisis pregnancy center so we
discuss the issue of choice there are
quite a few other choices we're off
there are five choices
there's abstinence there's contraception
and there's adoption and there's
motherhood
the only choice we're not okay with is
that that we believe to be and a lot of
course if I were talking in the case of
the mother because used to mention it's
freshening when a man explained so I'm
talking about from a mother's
perspective I absolutely think that we
should be encouraging young men to be
fathers and stop being deadbeats I think
that every child would benefit
tremendously from having both a positive
role model of a mother and a father on
that I'm sure we we can we can agree so
the question comes back to then at that
point we talked about nuance I it is
reductive if you believe it's a life so
my question I guess then becomes I
appreciate that you want this to be more
rare I appreciate that you don't
celebrate abortion as many people do
today and you understand that but I
don't think that it's intellectually as
tenable a position as the radical left
who believe taxpayer-funded on-demand
period unless you really clearly define
when is it a life and and that's the one
thing that I don't understand I don't
necessarily maybe
not informed on your argument when do
you believe it constitutes a life well I
guess there I don't have a simple answer
for you I mean Catholicism with no
disrespect to Catholicism has really you
know made this an either/or conversation
I'm Jewish and in the Jewish tradition
you have 40 days before it is a life and
that's true in Japan as well there are a
lot of cultures in which you have 40
days before that's considered even a
fetus you know and you've been pregnant
twice I can say that in the first 40
days you know whether its nature whether
its maternal instinct I I I'm glad I
never had to but I could have terminated
you know what was happening in the first
40 days and after that I couldn't you
know and that's a very subjective answer
but I do absolutely believe that you
know the first trimester especially you
know women really were supported in
finding out after they missed their
first menstrual cycle that they were
pregnant then they could have you know
terminations in the first six weeks and
that is by far the least I'm not saying
it's a great thing sure it is it is not
the same as carrying a baby in my mind
you as a mother it's not well but most
women don't know necessarily that a
pregnant was in the first 40 days so
health care for women they would find
out and you know before the second
menstrual cycle you know so that's the
first six weeks or eight weeks okay so
you believe we don't have health care
that's that's high-quality enough the
United States for people well I think
what I want to do Stephen yeah obviously
so a lot of women don't find out because
they're not seeing doctors they can't
afford doctors you know and a lot of
them are teenagers or a lot of them are
on you know I have drug issues or you
know
alcoholism issues uh or are homeless you
know and they find out very late or they
you know I'm talking about the average
one even an average healthy woman I mean
again listen we can we can get to these
extreme examples but if we want to find
common ground on the issue of abortion I
want to make sure that I'm clear so for
in your point of view forty days is the
cutoff am i understanding this I mean
I'd like to live in a society if I were
making policy right but this is just me
having traveled all over the world I
think a humane situation and one that
respects women's need to control their
own bodies their own reproduction which
categorically I believe in is is
Europe's where abortion really is you
know the after the morning-after pill is
readily available to women everywhere
for free it really is and failing that
and condoms and and free contraception
are available to everyone all the time
for free this is not a little thing
I had my commentators on daily cloud who
are in their 20s talk about a bill that
would make them pay for condoms and
contraception on college campuses and a
lot of even middle class and affluent
kids really can't afford to have
contraceptive sex it's really expensive
you know and so I'm sorry I can't I
can't this is especially can't go with
you in that prep premise you can get
condoms for 25 cents at a truck stop and
you can get countless generic birth
controls for under $14 at Walmart yes my
wife works at a crisis pregnancies there
are so many options this is why there
was the outrage with Hobby Lobby they
were offering offering I think 16 to 18
covered forms of contraception they just
didn't believe in the abortive again see
I I don't believe that I don't believe
that if you're having sex in 2018 and
you can't afford or know about
contraception that it's because of it's
from it's from a lack of trying
especially seeing women who come into
these crisis pregnancy centers most the
time it's just actually responsibility
statistically I respectfully you would
have liked my essay because I really do
believe that we all have to be
responsible for using contraception male
and female yeah but where feminism it
would be helpful to you right now is I
think you're not grappling with the fact
that a lot of women can't get their
partners to put on condoms and no I
don't think you're right that women can
find reliable contraception for $14 you
know where it's $14 you know a week
gravity let's round up to 50 let's run
up to 50 a month what but why are we
making it up if we know that the pill
can cost more than that we know that we
know that the pill can cost thousands of
dollars depending on what you're using
and we know that the pill can be as low
as four dollars or eight dollars with
generics you can go to Walmart right now
and get a generic birth
control pill for $8 12 if I'm being very
very generous you need you need a doctor
to prescribe it for eight a lot of women
can't afford to see doctors look how
many Americans don't have medical
insurance $50 cash $50 to go see a cash
doctor who can prescribe it and very
inexpensive I just don't go I just don't
go along that argument people tend to be
sexually or just like I don't go along
with absolving people responsibility if
you're with a guy who refuses to toss on
a rubber I believe that a woman should
be responsible enough to not be with
that guy and I believe that guy is a
germ he should be responsible enough to
put on a condom
she should be responsible enough to make
sure she's not with a guy who refuses to
put on a condom but again the this that
we're kind of getting off the track but
I want to see where we find that's okay
you're not getting off the track this
was another issue is the issue of life
and my question is which I find because
this is pivotal and we can't find common
if we care about the children how about
constructing gender in a way that
doesn't result in record depression
suicide anxiety isolation unhappiness
regardless of lapping off your tests
today's question of the day by the way
for those watching on YouTube and who've
hit the notification but are you
receiving notifications we need to know
about half the people who've done so
have been complaining that they haven't
been receiving them you guys have been
getting these tweets so please let us
know comment below and today's rebuttal
comes to us from the borderline child
abusers and the four million subscribers
teaching children the concept of gender
at the YouTube channel cut let's get to
it what's like stereotype of a boy it
stays this obnoxious I'm sorry but we'll
have some very valuable information for
you so an immediate theme you'll notice
of this video is the open and negative
stereotyping of the male gender well at
simultaneously trying to be inclusive to
non-existent genders it's important he
didn't say hey how should a man behave
it was what would be a negative
stereotype of a male don't worry no one
does as you'll see later in the video
next clip Riley do you know what gender
is I'm trying to member how to answer
this but I don't get into trouble at
home for hate speech see you're in the
ballpark
yeah that's an answer no six-year-old
gives unless they were coached by an
angry pansexual lesbian mother and they
still key still can't get it right for
fear of the afro lesbian pansexual
beating her I like to think I underst
and a little bit of it do you know what
makes a boy a boy and what makes a girl
a girl
what are boy things couple of things the
boy is innocent States what a boy wants
to be right and maybe what we as a
society would want men to be strong
fearless she then let me squash let me
swap that down with the anecdotal in
armwrestling a five-year-old could you
imagine if this had occurred with a
child who created some painting or is
trying to expand his creative realm and
apparently said that's stupid get it out
of here kids think I want to be strong
I'm gonna arm wrestle you and she feels
proud of it so that doesn't so that
doesn't or that to my highlight reel I
beat you at five really mom how about I
give it a shot
fifteen gender difference at that point
you want to know the real biological
differences in gender let's line up one
hundred males within the average
reference range okay within a hundred
miles here of this lady and have mommy
arm-wrestle them by the way rule I
should have clarified none of them can
be five years old next clip what does it
mean to be a boy twerking I wonder where
this child could have possibly learned
that girls should twerk mom but let's
all love the negative traits of men
rights they're rude and angry but what
if we said what does it mean to be a
girl and she said you act submissive and
agreeable how would they react I can
tell you exactly how they do that how
they would react because when Jordan
Peterson sites just that scientifically
people lose their minds and call him a
figurehead of the alright out of context
mind you the point where they actually
have to re-release the interview because
it was so misleading let's go to the
next clip they used to think of the only
favorite colors girls could have was
pink and purple but I've never
right no no mom no mom not a thing
no one ever assumed or forced girls to
like only pink or purple colors that was
never a thing into having one preferred
color instead of instead of this just
chose to show you that this video and
we'll get to more statistical realities
here that are really striking and what's
dangerous about this a lot of ailable
why are you just talking about the Iran
deal this is the corrosion of Western
civilization right here when we start
targeting children and teaching them
scientific biological observable
falsehoods in the name of political
correctness
that's when you know society's jumped
the shark and the mom hears instead of
saying right because it's not right
should have she should have screamed to
that child strawman no no sweetheart
that's incorrect
I want you to agree with mom and
everything but I want you good mommy
understanding the facts we never
actually had any kind of systemically
instituted preferred colors for your jet
that wasn't a thing next clip on your
body what do you have that I don't have
[Applause]
[Music]
in this video you provided the only
correct answer cuz it went out my nose
don't drink champagne straight from the
bottle
by the way keep spoiler alert
that's the only correct answer for the
entirety of the video next clip so it's
a person with a wiener says hey I'm a
girl
what is that person a girl boy a female
behold gender identity that older boy
space is priceless right they're like
behold gender identity as though it's a
thingy hold my both and the mom laughs
although she's teaching her children
nuance that's what this whole video is
about right but the thing is they're
just trying to unseat your children
scientifically observable biology in
favor of a social agenda as we said
Moroni said that they weren't coming for
your kids yeah they're here keep it
Garrett I mean that's the that's the
moment he realized his mom was an idiot
I suspected I didn't think you were
unintelligent but I I thought you might
be a bit of a when you arm
wrestled my five-year-old brother to
embarrass him on national broadcast no I
just think you're also fundamentally I
don't because you're a woman just just
because you're you next clip maybe 15
minutes after you were born but oh no
and I'm learning that was just the sex
you were born that doesn't mean this is
not this isn't a trick I just know you
just know
think about it twice no but what if like
Janet is telling you you can't if I was
always just you can't be a girl you
can't be a girl your whole life you
think you would be like oh I see there
are two Christmas miss shoe Christmases
in that family there which makes sense
because at first I thought this was
gonna be the gay dad yeah but now he's
what twist I've locked with these are
the same people who will be losing their
minds when you tell your kid tell people
you take your kids to church I know you
are indoctrinating how dare you
indoctrinated up I know well here's the
thing first up couple clarifications
gender actually isn't assigned at birth
it's recognized by medical professionals
doctors because contract how a child
feels in the hair-dye aisle 15 years
down the line okay with mommy doctors
actually need to identify the sex /
gender to determine immediate care and
treatment for example the boys have
higher mortality rates during the first
year do a weaker immune system they need
more care and they cost more money and
the example that this father loses sleep
this beta male uses the exact opposite
buy this isn't a reverse now is like one
of those things you can't be a girl you
can't be a girl when the fact is it's
biology telling them sorry but you're
not a boy it's the opposite of what the
dad is saying and of course again two
Christmases which stands to reason next
clip when I was little people used to
call me tomboy and that didn't really
fit because it wasn't something that I
called myself look I felt like a little
boy when I was little hmm and then when
when I was 12 and I found out that I was
supposed to be a girl and that girl met
certain things it was kind of scary to
me because it was a box that I wasn't
ready to be put into no no no no no one
put you into a box you have one now
here's the thing
how did you feel like a boy this is
where it starts to unravel I felt like I
was a boy were you rude annoying because
that's the only example we've had of man
he remember what would you think of rude
and annoying thinking they're cool
aggressive violent we've only heard
negative male stereotypes and then she
said I felt as though I was a boy how so
how did you feel as though you were a
boy and they used to society tried to
force me into the box of being woman
doing that society tried to force you to
be what what would be the aunt in him
too rude and annoying
answer him for those don't know it's the
opposite of a synonym could it be polite
accident cordial shaming society is
forcing you to be polite and cordial
which would be considered feminine
qualities I don't understand this then
again science next clip what if you
forgot if you're a boy or a girl there
are people who don't really identify as
a boy or a girl
oh no they're in that middle space I've
real deep yes yes they're in that middle
space oh I know this one mom do you mean
like the intersex people who only make
up I think about point zero one eight
percent of the population many people
today's progressives called intersex
actually they have conditions they
really aren't confused about their
gender at all at all but they actually
have predominantly male or female
characteristics and they end up living
under one gender or another entirely
guilt free and without biological
complication is that one is that what
we're going with this mom are you
talking about intersex to a very extreme
and small example oh no next clip people
should call you your actual gender say
them should see him or not okay first up
smoke yeah yeah the two girls or none
really two young children who refuse to
acknowledge biology and now claim that
they have no gender okay who just so
happened to have a blue-haired lesbian
looking androgynous mother what are the
chances
kids you rolled the dice and that came
up snake that came up both makeup that
came up fake blue contact lens neck eyes
to match the lesbian hairdo what are the
chances as you'll see it's actually not
just happenstance because we've got some
more statistics next clip this is myself
I identify as trans non-binary so the
surgery that I'm going to have all of
this is gonna be gone how do you feel
about that
mmm got you're a psychopath perhaps mom
but she gives an answer and I actually
really do appreciate the the the earnest
answer that follows still I still have
an experience don't like feelings little
bit scary a lot scary yeah what's scary
about it namely lopping off your tail
namely that you're going to be I mean
there are lots there's a lot mother but
chief amongst them is that you will be
chopping off your tips there are many
reasons the complications the 41%
attempted suicide rate that doesn't get
any better when you have the surgery
again where you're chopping off your and
consider that American slaves and those
and internment camps never actually had
the average populace suicide rates that
were that high compared to the
transgender community
I'm I'm actually I'm actually a little
fearful mother that my mother might be
mentally unstable
biologically I mean a chemical thing
also you know the lopping off your toes
I don't want to gloss over that did you
ever want me to be non-binary when you
were litoris I just wanted you to be who
you are with
having to choose because when I grew up
there was just boy and girl
how many genders are there infinity yes
I was like is this confusing yes I have
no and betters death by this that's the
this is the point no one has ever been
able to answer when they say listen
misgendering someone this is a big thing
on campus it's an act of violence
well how many how many pronouns are
there no one can answer the question
this is a video by the way designed to
both ask and answer questions please go
watch it in its full context I think we
pretty much ran the entire video it
doesn't answer any of them because they
don't know the answers they can't even
play by their own rules and something
that's really important and this is why
this matters and I say it's actually
that it will be the downfall of Western
civilization notice anything in this
video I'm a Hmong stall of the would say
non-binary trans black lesbian even know
what you fit that into you're not trying
to identify with anything at that point
other than a psychopath um not a single
positive rail mobile no got the entirely
the nails anything else by the way they
exclusively cycle through negative male
stereotypes so what if instead of the
negative male stereotypes they actually
went through there if he said hey listen
sweetheart what do you think would be
the ideal how should a man act and then
maybe the girl goes I don't know maybe
it may be a man should be kind and
loving but firm and protective and able
to provide but also able to lead when
need be and also understand when to
submit to them I don't know that's a
good question dad and I I wonder I think
you fulfill a lot of those qualities
what if they did that instead and what
if when this made this girl disrespected
I mean I'm gonna go to mommy's house dad
you don't know anything right what if
instead of him just going take it take
it along with the alimony what if when
his girl disrespected him there on a
national broadcast what if the one man
in there said hey hey whoa hey
sweetheart watch your mouth don't talk
to dad that way
that's not how you speak to adults
that's not respectful and instead
started teaching her how she should deal
with Authority taught her how a people
should interact sociologically and then
how women should act and then how men
should treat women to properly what if
instead of all of the things they did
they did all of that and said and by the
way
what are the chances anything else you
notice what are the chances that these
kids outpace the average as far as
gender non-binary kids by like 100% the
odds are very favorable and something I
don't understand that and hopefully we
get someone to know we had a dropout
tomorrow for a long-form debate if
gender is a societal construct as which
which is the presupposition of this
entire video gender societal construct
how about if we're going to acknowledge
that and we're going to say please do I
have to get rid of this hat please do it
for the children right please do it it's
a societal construct let's well let's
care about the children let's create
videos like this cut okay if we care
about the children how about
constructing gender in a way that
doesn't result in record depression
suicide anxiety isolation unhappiness
regardless of lapping off your toes
chief amongst some reasons for you being
unhappy that you cut off your tips
mother if we're going to say it's a
societal construct and we know beyond
any shadow of a doubt statistically that
the transgender community both pre-op
and post-op have record rates of
depression suicide anxiety why don't we
construct something if we're cuz we're
teaching our kids something anyway as
you're trying to do here if we're going
to teach them something
how about teaching them a way of life
that we know leads to not only better
health for themselves but for the rest
of their families subscribe watch one of
these other videos or hit the
notification Bell well you should hit
that if you subscribe anyways because
subscriptions don't mean anything on
YouTube anymore now you have to get

also making money off these videos
anymore because YouTube decided why they
just said we're not going to and when we
said why they didn't tell us why exactly

we're just not gonna renew his work visa
and hopper camp question of the day
before we move on what do you think
about the Kanye West situation we're
going to be talking about that more so
about the idea sort of black Democrats
as a monolith at large and the backlash
from the media question number two how
many people out there are a long time
enough listeners that you remember Kanye
as our bump music and here's a link just
to confirm what was the bump we use one
specific Kanye about our the last
segment before the drowning dance before
we went on YouTube and then we got hit
with the Capri right Felisa Nomura Khan
you have always said the guy's an ass
the very talented emcee yeah not bad
alright well listen top story Bill Cosby
was found guilty oops the sexual assault
retrial comedian Bill Cosby is comes
from HuffPo just because we can take the
story from anywhere don't kiss early
trust them
don't take it as a vote of confidence
found guilty on three felony counts of
aggravated indecent assault really the
indecent and that seems he was retried
on three felony counts of aggravated
indecent assault for drugging in
basically is there a decent yeah what
would that be I don't know I'm sure that
must have been all now if you drug
himself in that one or any people are
see often did that's the thing he
drugged both of them he just had a
higher tolerance it was like a game of
chicken with a bug through it
don't play with Roman Polanski so many
are saying that this is a landmark case
obviously for victims of sexual assault
now some are arguing that it doesn't go
far enough and punishing the sort of
pervasive mail abuse of power
however with unilateral agreement that
the ruling will definitely hurt
pre-orders for mr. Cosby's dating tips
it he's so old at this point is he
really like is he really a troubled
threat to society at this point he's
gonna break a hip in the shower he's
gonna be a rough go someone will break
his America he's going to jail for this
I'm just like ah what the doctor knows
America's dad it was a fight with your
family doctor doctor Huxtable yeah he
was a family doctor but imagine sending
your kids at that die everybody well you
saw a lot of pregnant women too so I'm
just saying made a lot of pregnant women
too oh they just weren't aware hello the
British Veterinary Association by the
way is now warning that dogs cannot get
autism as the anti-vaxxer movement is
now apparently spreading the pets this
comes from the Telegraph the BVA said we
are aware of an increase in anti
vaccination pet owners and us who have
voiced concerns about vaccinations that
may lead to their dogs developing autism
like behavior but there is currently no
scientific evidence to suggest autism
and dogs or a link between vaccinations
and autism
well tell that to my dog who will
exclusively fly Qantas ok and of course
this actually might put a damper on
Disney's new Christmas release Air Bud
19 buddy places for that the special
olympics
oh this explains a lot of behaviour to
me you know extremely loud necrotic loss
may have been a serviceable film if it
was a dog dead of that annoying kid
throw
Dean Cain you got a classic I just
wanted to swallow Tide Pods 13 semis big
trucks lined up on a Detroit freeway to
help a man who was considering suicide
so I think we have a clip right you have
a clip yeah there was a man on top of
the bridge authorities believe he was
about to take his own life they start to
grab semi drivers and troopers standing
there and were able to line these semi
trucks underneath that overpass
so it's kind of like a safety net to
make sure if he moved anywhere there was
a semi their valiant effort
unfortunately their valiant efforts
proved futile as Detroit has actually
just installed the suicide lane on their
freeway so he helpful the mark those
there's so many flat holes in this by
the way fun fact for Detroit faster than
the police response time it seems now to
people committing suicide is the other
guy at the end of the CB radio from joy
rock Detroit's a city incumbent we have
loads of burning coffee houses and
inspiring art districts the answer rain
washes everything no one in the pitch
room aside from Johnny boy had seen joy
Ron is true that the candy cane yeah
yeah okay point in some days you just
you just pick the wrong bridge in
Detroit every bridge is the wrong bridge
to nowhere it's the bridge to rape which
is another bestseller from kolakozhi
suicides the fastest way fun fact to get
out of choice well you know if you're
looking for the bus just just don't it's
just much easier to walk into downtown
without a bulletproof vest that's the
easiest way by the way breaking news
it's hashtag lesbian visibility day this
has been trending all over the place
because it's a slow news week so the
pink news they released their list about
you know their lack of visibility for
lesbians and how to help them how to
raise availability visibility in society
for lesbians and then of course some
people aren't necessarily as capable at
spotting lesbian so let me let me
consolidate the list for you simplified
version if she drives a Subaru
out back wait I tried to date a girl if
there's if there's more than one bumper
sticker you know she's it's not mark
yeah more than one bumper sticker on a
Subaru Outback also if she eats it out
back careful I'm gonna drive my shooby
to get price I am I have been so I have
to shave a lot when we do a lot of these
costs when we do costume my stuff so I
have to get razors that I can shave
quickly and change my hair and I gave
Jarrod my old trimmer when I got a new
trimmer recently and I'm excited about
it and I gave it to him I was like hey
man take this as a it's been a great
trusty trimmer to me and the problem is
I got I didn't realize a new one just
totally gnarled up my face yeah and I
wanted to ask Jared if I could trade him
the newer more expensive one because I
have like hairs that grow if I can trade
but I felt so I didn't want to be an
Indian giver that I spent like a hundred
and fifty dollars finding one from
another country of the old version the
first operation because it's the
titanium blades they don't do it anymore
well here's the thing you better be glad
he didn't give it back he does his
manscaping with the one you gave him I
made a mistake and regretted it Hey
a transgender inmate sued a prison to
practice a North Carolina prison who
practice witchcraft I'm trying to think
of the way to set it up that provides
context so you can and I can't Maine a
man says in her his handwritten federal
lawsuit that Landsborough Correctional
Institution is blocking the practice of
her his spiritual beliefs which happened
to be rooted in witchcraft though some
are saying you know listen if you've
seen orange as a new black some people
try to work the system and actually
there's been a recent special with an
interview from some of this transgenders
inmates who questioned the story welcome
I know I've heard of no damn worker
what's that witchcraft man oh damn
witchcraft man oh that damn screaming I
have a cadaver bush pulling you down she
was doing
oh look at that hey you rooms this won't
you turn that nice sweet yours into some
nice hot whip I need some nice sale yeah

I'm going first what you know what
they're half white I would not want to
run into them in prison you never seen
prison throw more more into
anyways yes sir burnovich trapped there
just tough you know what I mean like a
grandfather was jailed after servicing
himself in front of his podiatrist this
is a story comes from Salle's break
we're Salsbury son computer where is
this Salsbury Connecticut I think it's
in Britain Britain
oh is it written has to be thank you
very much you should know these things
and write these things a grandfather who
service themselves comes from the
Salsbury journal in front of a
podiatrist while she treated his
veruca's I think that's the thing
varicose and cut his toenails denied the
indecent exposure but admitted
pleasuring himself during a foot health
appointment and it's Dick Morris ah
why specify grandfather that's that has
let's say like uncle pee-wee Herman
service himself in a theatre line if it
weren't yeah I know the grant for that
it adds that extra layer of oh she's
touching my feet oh it's the umami of
clickbait hey by the way hit the
notification bell if you're watching
this on youtube up hopper can he's
getting up he decides he wants to leave
right now right as we're doing all right
like screw it done I hit the
notification bell because he's huge
docks and apparently by the way people
aren't getting notified even if they
have enough even live elsa hit the bell
the rhuebottom's news and make us go buy
a west and kind of explain the whole
thing but a massachusetts preschool has
now banned kids from using the term best
friend this comes from ABC 7 after an
incident with the four year old Julia
Hart well the school explained to Hart
well that the term best friend can lead
other children to feel excluded and it
could ultimately quote lead to formation
of cliques and outsiders and the school
encourages students to have a wider
quote group of friends was explained to
the transgender kids from the
transgender principal from the girls
bathroom
let's get rid of best friends this is
the front we're the best teachers and
best schools and best principals as well
writing but the fact is that's why
teachers unions exist it's show yes yes
sure if he a good teacher we don't want
him just put him in a trauma room leave
him alone truth is without exclusion who
safety that's the only thing that's the
only sentient for kids not to be giant
a-holes ya need you need a little
exclusion it's all social pressure well
you know that very well because you were
homeschooled in but I was not no he was
no he was and his mom wouldn't
breastfeed her uncle Wow and it was a
footlocker shih tzu what the podiatrist
in there go it was a private story so
Nebraska by the way has finally stopped
horsing around from this headline and
it's actually legalizing massage therapy
for horses equine massage therapy thanks
to a newly signed bill Nebraskans no
longer need to license themselves to
massage cats or dogs or horses the bill
was actually spurred on by Karen Hoff
who began massaging horses at her farm
in central Nebraska as a way to become
financially more stable after being
issued a cease-and-desist she was forced
to shut her business down she then
pushed for the new law which has now
just been passed this now a lot though
some suspect ulterior motives at play
given her notorious business partner Sal
the horse groper people thought he might
have been impure I'm confused people
didn't want to massage horses and cats I
guess an example of red tape I mean he
can massage it as long as she's
massaging the cat like under water for
about 30 minutes just make sure did you
imagine that can you picture a in asian
massage parlor for horses I an Asian on
a horse have you ever seen agent which
do you know or not I didn't think about
today they don't even need a train to be
talkies they could just dominate that
market it's written that's true just put
him on a show horse let him go let me go
for it awesome I'm loose we're terrible
Knicks Apollo is definitely not getting
his job back no no no by the way we have
you de Paula we have to Paulo on four
okay
looking for an having to pull one so
let's talk about Kanye West again the
question what's your opinion what's your
read on the Kanye West situation for
those who don't know Kanye West through
the media into an uproar as he tweeted
out positive things about conservative
pundits any support ideas like freedom
and thought these are his unbelievably
controversial tweets now one thing
they're they're little eager to embrace
Kanye is their new thought leader which
I don't think is the best idea ah here's
the thing think whatever you want
III really don't care if you like Kanye
I've always like we used to use them as
our bumps I think he's a talented MC
he's not someone I would look to as some
kind of a new philosopher but you know
what I'm glad to see someone making some
progress and I hate to see the pig pile
on anyone for making them yeah I'm a
little concerned though I don't the mo I
swear the moment that I go in and I'm
like yes Khan is that tweets gonna come
out be like ah I was kidding man yeah
one thing that's not a joke is of course
how the left reacted and lost their mind
so that we know let's go to clip a Kanye
has lost his mind being in the lobby at
Trump's house I saw that was cool in the
new game we're starting here on Friday
Conan for cash he's a total and utter
 he's one of the dumbest guys in
the country so dumb he's trumpian in his
level of intelligence just to understand
buyer beware Kanye West is a selfish
conservative prick he should do you mean
idea how much how quickly he would go
after anyone else for saying buyer
beware about a black person yeah Jake we
got to go after Kanye and of course the
media has been calling him a member of
the alt rights that's what's been going
on lately kanye west by the way they're
only mad at him now saying this is the
man who said he was the black jesus yes
yes so the fact that he said oh you know
what i like what some of these people on
fox news have to say this is what sends
them around over the bend you don't by
the way you don't have to defend
everything Kanye's ever done just to see
the dog pile was taking place keep in
mind this is the same guy who did say
this George Bush doesn't care about
black people
live television
anyways it doesn't matter how
inconsequential you are
everyone knows Connie is a psychopath
everyone knows like this this is the
same guy who literally married a
Kardashian is interrupted countless
Grammys and names as kids after
compasses exactly you don't know you
don't have to defend even his opinions
or or whatever he's saying you just have
to defend his right to express his
opinion freely and by the way it is
brave I will say there is some bravery
yet player because if we want to talk
about bravery slapping on a pair of fake
rubber tips well you have a still have
your penis to do a spread for Vanity
Fair
that's not brave in 2018 okay coming up
anything other than a far left
progressive is career suicide in
Hollywood it let's be honest Kanye
whether you like him or not Kanye is
still a hot ticket item in the hip-hop
community yeah so I do give respect to
the guy for going against the grain you
imagine though if someone and more
consequential came out like it like
could you imagine it's like the left
being mad that never was an bar if she
stepped out a lot well III gotta say
that bring this up like how many how
many people do you think are in that
industry that would have the same views
as Kanye but won't say it because they
know they'll just be out of the industry
right right so maybe this opens the door
for a few more people
he's just stupid you know be on a bender
who knows no and the point is I'm not
gonna condemn any conservatives who want
to embrace the guy right away but but
I'm not gonna condemn people who don't
either I'm certainly not my opinion
hasn't changed to them I do respect
someone want to take it unpopular
position now here's one thing we'll talk
and Nick DiPaolo about this I do
appreciate the lack of apology because
when you see cases like Shania Twain
apologizing for simply saying wow an
impromptu interview that she may have
voted for Trump it legitimizes the
premise that merely voting for Trump is
an apology worthy offense or jay Feely
apologizing for taking a picture with a
gun was that was a prom picture yeah
the first rule finger off the trigger
finger off let's check it yep
figure out the trick finger off the
trigger it's changed my mind time for
this week's edition we not only
revisited the ever relevant topic of gun
control but we decided to mix things up
a little bit by taking the very students
we discussed the matter with to the gun
range to learn the basics of firearm
safety shooting in the process of
actually purchasing a gun one thing
we've learned with the change my mind
conversations most people simply don't
have all the information how would you
define assault rifle like like an
automated weapon that is capable of mass
shootings like I don't think a pistol is
capable of what like an assault rifle
fifteen can do there should definitely
be more like restrictions on how like
you can get one like there are people
out there as you've seen like that
aren't fine that can do the same thing
that I can do you know so like okay so I
don't mean think she's probably unaware
of the process do you think you can just
walk in and buy a gun no you need like a
gun license right no no you don't need a
gun license you need a gun license but
you do need the driver's license a bad
ID and a lot of paperwork and there is a
background check I knew there was like
some restrictions but I don't I didn't
know I knew there was some but I still
believe there should be like more I just
don't know what okay like what if I were
to tell you that half a million to over
three million innocent lives are saved
each year at one simple fact
defensive use of the firearm how many
people have corner of the CDC a minimum
of 500,000 potentially over three
million and by the way that's really
hard to just that doesn't take into
account many times the firearm saves a
life just by brandishing it and the shot
is never fired I always encourage women
if you can to at least go learn how to
shoot and protect yourself responsibly
and then consider purchasing a firearm
do I have you own a firearm no but a
friend whose dad has a law and she has
one too and have you ever shot firearm
I'm never but she yes she neither one of
the times Jonah and Tara yeah okay would
you be willing to maybe in a follow-up
we could do a segment on this go with me
to arrange shoot for the first time and
purchase a purchase a fire okay they
didn't know every about firearm said
that's okay enter the twist on this
week's change my mind where we took
these gals eager and willing to learn
the range for the first time
all right so this is how we're gonna
start so the first thing before I do
anything with you before I do anything
with you is the first rule and we had
our last will see if you do better than
the last came in first I'm just finger
off the trigger so don't be afraid
because you know it's not loaded so hold
it firmly and so the one hand push that
button push that out check it
have her check it and then push your
back yep
just always keep it aim somewhere yep
[Music]
now feel this kind of that's the reason
that figured there's a it's safe but
also kind of pinch it with your thumb
here is you're kind of pushing into your
hand and you're squeezing your fingers
together so that it holds it as stable
as
this is probably the least it's most
people least intimidated gun reform kind
of we talked about there or your school
no one really is even talking about
these yeah yeah
[Music]
[Music]
that seems pretty far doesn't it that's
only seven yards that's where most
attacks most self-defense situations
happen within seven yards seven yards so
to give an idea when people say like
comma of myth we'll go through is like
couldn't you shoot them in the leg or do
you have to shoot them you know to kill
them picture a person at seven yards
that's you know it's actually you'd have
to get it in one in the in that white
circle while the person is moving so who
wants to go first it's already loaded
that's the semi-automatic so same thing
when you're ready just squeeze that
trigger even that Center breathe
stabilize it you know all the time in
the world good
that was just to the to the right on the
red finger off the trigger if you're not
shooting just line it up and just
squeeze that trigger and you should be
fine it's definitely hard to control a
little bit longer trigger but same thing
one shot one yes yeah basically for
self-defense didn't we speaking about
this and this is the revolver equivalent
to the nine-millimeter which is what
we're gonna do next the 9 mil it's the
exact same gun as a 22 a 9-millimeter
platform when people say shooting the
leg no a police officer is gonna use
something significantly more powerful
than that and see how hard it is just to
once you get into a level of
self-defense to control it just it takes
practice which is why typically I don't
know if you know this concealed carry
holders are actually six times less
likely to commit crimes than even
off-duty police officers and that's
because typically we tend to practice a
lot we go through the courses you know
so this is gonna see who's gonna be a
louder but it's actually easier to
control than a handgun so I'll show you
first I'll just take a shot and you know
what AR stands for
no oh and another thought
it stands for Armalite Armalite yeah
it's fully semi-automatic it's just like
y'all the other guns at you okay don't
be shy coming up I'll walk you through
it believe me it's it's not it just
sounds loud because it's a there's a lot
more so finger always off the trigger
haha sorry
that's more sound than kick right I know
there's not that much kick it's easier
to actually hold and shoot than the
handgun it's just loud in here there you
go good alright let's take a break you
have us a break it's really not that
it's just the wait it yeah cuz it's
heavy
there's substantial ease but would you
say it's easier than say even the
revolver as far as controlling it yeah
there's two there's three numbers four
one two three four so this is just
really simply just loading it put it in
underneath take your pardon
this one doesn't you can buy it it's
that's a part of the assault weapons ban
so this is perfectly legal oh it had a
magazine or is it all magazine loading
shotguns or is it just magazine okay
that's a good example as to what's
banned if this is a semi-automatic it
can't have a magazine this is illegal if
it had a magazine no now that were
semi-automatic like the AR it definitely
couldn't be a lot of magazine now it's
just if it's it sometimes sometimes it
entirely depends if it's detachable as a
matter of fact to give you an idea this
same gun would be illegal if the grip
were a pistol grip
that's the assault weapons ban and the
whole purpose of it was it wasn't to
make people safer you want to tell me
that me holding it this way or this way
it's gonna stop a school shooting it was
just to disrupt the firearm
manufacturing industry and make it hard
and you know it's a PR battle so good
once you're ready you're gonna pump it
it's not it's not chambered so you're
gonna pump this back and forward and
then just aim and shoot this one's
pretty simple does have some kick for
sure but just so you've done it once so
really make sure yeah there you go pump
it forward and back finger off the
trigger you okay that's artist one to
shoot back now forward all the way there
you go it is ready get it get it right
in there
that's sorry get right in that okay it's
gonna give you some kicks to hold a firm
grip on it
you okay yes you want to shoot another
one you're good
okay ladies good job but the truth is a
shotgun that's just a 12-gauge shotgun
you've heard most no anymore no one ever
talks about it that's one of the most
common hunting guns but certainly as far
as if you're just talking about the most
damage that's why actually shotguns a
lot of shotguns have been used in public
shootings that they just modify because
that thing is I mean it's hard to
control but it really is I mean that's
lug that you fired would go through
Jarrod mark both of you and the drywall
yeah
where's the ar-15 would not but it just
doesn't look because it's a pump and no
one thinks it because they've grown up
with it and so no one really talks about
it so if the goal is really to make if
we're talking about removing guns that
could damage people that would be that
but no that's not another purpose did it
surprise you at all that of the firearms
the ones that people don't really even
talk about I mentioned like banding and
all is that last shotgun yeah okay
and it makes a much bigger hole
yeah so would you shoot again oh you
would you would you you seem like you
were the most eager to get back up there
after shooting out of my way if if you
were to buy one for yourself what would
you get the 9-millimeter ppq well let
they have that here so let's go through
the purchase yes you guys over 21 can we
still see the profit yes well you know I
can it's still over on the background a
22 platform okay yes but you cannot buy
a handgun I forgot about that even that
was it's been a while since I'm 21
yeah are there any of these that
interest you that you would you like to
get the you sounded like you were keen
on that handgun yep this is wait till
you're 21 if you want to get one of
these you you can but if you like a you
know feel how about we just go through
the background okay let's go okay so
let's let's do it as they're gonna get
that yeah but let's do the background
check yes actually that's kind of
interesting because we were just gonna
go through so you would learn the
process but you can't really go through
the process for the gun that you want to
do what any one be allowed to buy it so
this is the process any firearm that you
purchase that you go through everyone in
the this state legally yes whoever comes
in here has to purchase the firearm for
themselves because they have to pass the
background check there's something
called a straw which should be like you
were to come in here and I get the
feeling that you're buying a gun for her
but you're doing the background check in
your name
go to jail if I sell you together those
things like we've actually had to do
that we tell the gentleman I hear the
conversation I'm like wait who's this
more than they lie to me when they turn
on talked about it right well I'm not
gonna say the gun right this isn't like
a gun registry so like just paperwork we
fell out doesn't go anywhere we put in a
filing cabinet the government doesn't
know who owns what yeah there's more
guns here than our people so it's not
there's no way to track down where this
gun goes after you leave the store with
it some of them they come here and we
say hey didn't they have to know your
name say did this person buy a gun I can
tell you what gun you bought all right
so this is your apartment you filling
out it's called a 4473 and it takes all
your information you got to put energy
exactly as it appears on your license
here capitalized who capitalized it
there's one thing that people mess up is
where it says County they blow through
and they put us a nothing yeah if you
were in another country you would be
able to buy a gun actually so it's
County so make sure you read everything
all this stuff is laws that you need to
know when you buy a gun another one
where felons are you know I don't think
yeah I know what about domestic abuse no
you know slap your boyfriend around no
they wouldn't know I haven't you heard
it's as easy as buying a toothbrush a
firearm I'm honestly scared of the
shotgun oh oh really
no she was very good with the firearms
oh she had really good figure you know
trigger control huh yeah
okay yes so I take all that information
a tattoo a they go on the computer to
FBI and put it in there or I can call
them on the phone just sometimes we have
to do the computer system is all backed
up which it is a lot of the time so
we're gonna find out if you've committed
any crimes right here you sure last
chance to turn back yeah pretty thorough
questionnaire there huh
that surprised you yeah
and he's putting it through the database
right now to the FBI let us know if
you've lied about any of those questions
yeah that's going everything so license
to carry the whole different process so
this is just you legally on that firearm
but you know it's different state to
state so for example Bernie sander state
Vermont you don't need any license to
carry at all but that's it but in Texas
you have to go through a course and it's
basically a full Saturday course they do
a little bit more of a stringent
background check then it takes about six
weeks to three months to get your card a
concealed carry card so that's that's a
different process and you have to be I
believe Molly I have to be 21 to do that
so I need your signature here
and then for two years 2018 and I'm
gonna go back call the FBI I'm just
gonna do it on the computer all this
information in and then usually it's
almost like the same thing that a cop
sees in his trunk you know exactly the
same thing but the same thing goes back
instantly usually so so last chance no
none of these interest you you weren't
you were I say what if you you have
John's info if you were to call John
let's do this we'll go through this link
but if you at your birthday call John
you're like I still want to buy that
Walter will take you back and we'll get
that one yes but two years your 20 I'll
call you okay
you can call me absolutely call John
just barely got a 62% yeah no sorry I'm
taking you ever been in trouble physican
right back she's a good person at this
point we saw you the gun so yeah so you
pass the background check what would you
say about your first experience shooting
after going through the process and
feeling comfortable with it it was fine
especially like the first couple of
shots but I don't think I'd be out
comfortable we didn't go through the
whole life right yeah your demonstration
oh yeah we were both pretty good after a
while you both got the hang of it you
actually both good good first-time
shooters did it surprise you how long
kind of a background check took yeah and
I he like one through last guy and stuff
I know that he do that because there was
one thing you brought up when were you
TD that's a big reason why we wanted to
come here was he talked about sort of
background checks and so well there
already are background checks and that's
kind of that's why there's a disconnect
we're talking about in the conversation
and people anyone who's purchased a
firearm legally when they hear someone a
new say we need background checks
when you talk because you know it goes
your notes every time has your
perspective changed at all kind of like
when we talk about sort of gun control
or common sense gun reform yeah because
there were so many little things about
each gun that could make it like illegal
and not leave a like so fast yeah the
the the basically yeah would be a pistol
grip as opposed to right about you
something that I was like thinking about
from our previous conversation back that
you to be was remember how we're talking
on Mental Illness like how people with
mental illness and that's not being able
to get one what's the line not a good
question yeah
very astute that you asked that question
because suddenly you were thinking since
we last spoke about it when I see that
and I see on television I see
politicians in the talking heads talking
about it for example semi-automatic I'm
normally don't know what that is or they
don't know that there is a background
check
same thing with mental health we feel
good sweeping legislation basically
gives the government power to determine
who's mentally unfit like I take
medication for my anxiety so does that
like what does that mean like does that
mean like you know yeah that's where you
the conversation of rights versus
freedoms are we okay with that or do we
want to give the authority to the
government to say you have a
prescription for anxiety I don't trust
you with a gun and you say yeah but I've
never and they got doesn't matter you
can't have a gun and that's where you up
to decide for yourself you know that's
why I'm Pro secondment because someone
doesn't necessarily know why I need to
carry just like I don't need to know if
you have a prescription for anxiety just
like you don't need to know if she's a
crazy ex-boyfriend who wants to kill her
why she has a gun by her bedside that's
why I err on the side of freedom
especially considering how like you said
you know a lot of people act as though
it's a Wild West to do you think that's
changed where you thought maybe people
were we're just purchasing firearms
really easily once you could once you
commit a felony or anything seriously
violent against them yeah that's when
you forfeit your rights because we want
to sorry you weren't able to purchase a
firearm I didn't know you weren't about
21 but if you make that call in two
years
yes we will get with we will cheat well
there you go thank you so much ladies
appreciate thank you all with a plan
absolutely we appreciate you coming on
out hey if you like this video subscribe
by clicking the button that says
subscribe
if you didn't like this video you should
subscribe anyway because then you can
watch the next video and what you can do
is down vote it and leave a comment
that's really negative you know
particularly if it's something like I
don't know maybe anti somatic even
though I'm not Jewish or something about
my hair or something about my weird nose
just leave a really negative comments
that everyone else around can act like
they care
I had the police come to my house a full
cook in the morning and they said here
is a government it's called an Osman
morning an Osman morning is when there
is serious intelligence that people are
about to kill him then it goes on to
read what you're not allowed to do
you're not allowed to get a weapon what
am I supposed to do put a little chain
on my door all right guests long form I
want to have this guy we've been having
them on we've been having him on for a
while now it's been a while and now he's
just he's just blowing up poor choice of
words given the fact that many people
want to kill him and that's their
preferred method of taking somebody out
you can follow Tommy Robinson dot online
his twitter is there's a story behind us
I'm sure at Robinson parity so I'm sure
there's some kind of perma ban that
happened there he's everywhere mr. Tommy
Robinson thank you for being here sir
how are you I'm good absolutely I'm good
now what's the what's the story behind
Robinson parity do you look did you lose
your Twitter account yeah that's not me
well I don't know why I had it removed
first of all they give me a week-long
ban because I said that 90% of grooming
convictions when Muslim men grooming is
the gang gang raping of young children
in the UK now that's actually a fact 90%
are Muslim men 20% are called Mohammed
yeah they banned me for a week for that
and then they removed me for saying
Islam promotes killing people well it
would seem as though the statement
unfortunately aligns with statistical
realities and that is the problem with
the that's a trip with their algorithms
if you'd have just said you know for
example Tommy Robinson is a Nazi I think
you'd be well within your rights well
you've been here so first up before we
get into some some of the very specific
stories recently you you have gone
completely independent tell people what
that means and where people can best
find you and support you for a year
where I learned to see that the future
the future is bringing people or
bringing people I want people to see
what I see I want them to experience and
see the places and the problems that I
see the people
I talk to I wish on a four-bit 10 years
ago I wish I'd have been like everyone
else but I left rebel media I went on my
own so that I'm my own boss I'm in
control of the stories I run people can
follow me on Tommy Robinson's not unlike
I have plans to build a studio like the
self
I have plans as well to build to get a
double-decker bus a double-decker bus I
want to turn one side of into a TV
screen and I want to travel the UK
showing people what's happening in those
towns and seas so I'm making mini
documentaries about areas go into those
areas hopefully get out from alive but
show people truthfully this is what's
happening on the ground yeah well it
sounds like it's a super secret that we
have been building up here for for
stateside from we do the live shows at
schools because there's so much
equipment that we have to bring and
these live shows that we have to put on
a good idea if you can get that done a
double-decker bus did billboard for
death its Robinson well hold on before
before I continue I want to show this
one clip this is a recent video for
those of you who missed this a little
run in that he had with a Muslim man who
was threatening his life and we'll see
how it turns out
[Music]
now tell me when I watch that clip I saw
it
what struck me most is there as an
officer there right that looked like
there was a police officer he didn't
even have a problem with it because the
guy was running out threatening you like
this even in the UK it seems as though
you're well within your rights to do
that specifically he was going to kill
me I had been warned about going to that
area you know I went to Italy for the
elections and I spent an hour
researching what's happening in this one
scene and what I found was just I found
a Somalian man who went into a hospital
and whilst an Italian woman was in a
Hokkien bed having labour giving labour
up her baby he climbed on and raped her
I then found that an Eritrean man had
chopped up an Italian girl just two
weeks before murder doe raped and I
chopped her body up and left in a
suitcase
I found that 75 year old woman had been
raped just a mile from where I was
standing
Boyet by a Sudanese man I found
unbelievable stories horror stories the
only source story she'd would have
previously read about in Africa or in
South Africa or in the Middle East right
here in Europe I found one case one case
where a man a Polish man was with his
partner and a group a gang of Muslim
migrants see him up and then he mate
they made him watch as they gang-raped
his wife on a beach for hours they made
him watch and these were stories that
again it's just this is Europe now these
are stories that are commonplace in
every country in Europe I'm asking you
because some people say well why are you
focusing if you just go out looking for
a stories of Muslims who happen to
commit crimes
you'll find them statistically that's
not the norm and it just had their
election and the lega have gone from 4
percent to 80
percent the left had been completely
booted out of politics this was a
political revolution in Italy so I asked
why why is the country swell ladies
let's see what problems there are that
have resulted in the next coalition
government the leader of La Liga says
that Islam is incompatible with their
country and they will probably deport
six hundred thousands so I wanted to
know why they won the election let's
look at the problems let's look at
what's resulted in this and that's where
I started to find unbelievable horror
stories that were unthinkable crimes
that you haven't heard of on the shores
of Italy this commonplace yeah and then
we found a journalist a female
journalist who live on screen was
violently and sexually attacked and
dragged down the street noise what
report the news life by Muslim migrants
these are all migrants and and that's
the story that shocked me was oh for
those instances I just told you yes oh
for the pen convicted had been refused
and should have been deported from Italy
but they weren't so all of this was
failed to Simon's cases but they were
allowed to stay so all of these victims
could have been saved if the laws would
have been enforced and the guidelines
would have been followed but because
they weren't and that is why the Italian
people licked it a government a new
government that will remove the people
in power who have left their women at
Prague
it really is unbelievable that you
haven't heard of these stories the
people stateside certainly every but you
would think in Europe at least you think
it may I don't know at least the chyron
on BBC not at all not at all and you're
painted as a racist as a Nazi one thing
I think a lot of people don't realize I
mean you were raised in am i pronouncing
it correctly Luton yes just like when I
watch double-oh-seven
they say double-oh-seven why don't they
say why don't they say why doesn't why
doesn't Judi Dench say then I'm confused
they invented a language
so you're raised there and pretty
diverse area so a lot of your friends
growing up didn't look like you your
problem years with an ideology in the
systemic political corruption that
allows it to victimize people I've been
watching you for a while I think this is
your fifth time on the show when Pete
would come on small Han Tommy Robinson
he's erased do you know anything about
do you know where he was raised do you
know who his friends are
he just hates Islamic rape how is that
controversial Lukens one of the most
multicultural diverse towns in Europe
yeah if you if you've got all of my
friends together all of us are the sons
of immigrants
my mother was an Irish immigrant but
then other image would be solution
Jamaican all over the Caribbean Italian
Bulgarian Polish we are a town full of
immigrants but there's one problem in
our town it doesn't come to relax or
country of heritage the problem is split
ideologically through religion we've
never seen motional tensions we only see
religious tensions so yeah so when I
talk about these issues people say about
racism I've simply been used and I'm
glad that after 10 years now or 15 years
of combat in it people don't usually
associate that anymore people now
finally say he's against Islam right so
they pivoted to Islamophobia right but
they've tried to make that seem as
though it's a form of racism right now
especially state tuneups Islamophobia
race in wroclaw ii Islam is not a race
we have Johnny jihad over here from
state in the United States we have women
in the United States who its head jabs
blonde hair and blue eyes that people
convert to it it's the most converted to
a religion in the American prison system
why cuz it's going hey you hate and you
want to commit evil here here's a book
justifying your acts of violence that's
another big lie people don't talk about
that it's the fastest-growing religion
it grows it's exclusively by birthrate
and through the prison system that's it
nowhere else and for some reason people
on the news even there's a talk one of
the fastest growing religions in the
world but you also can't leave it that's
a good point so I like the Episcopalians
you're like all right well we'll still
see you at the potluck yeah I'll see you
at the potluck I'm just an atheist now
okay yeah you're gone if you don't
convert in prison you least you get a
nice pair of teeth on the state it's
true
exactly well I mean you did prison time
a long time so I mean this is one thing
I do want to and give you credit for to
an unbelievable degree a lot of people
out there hold themselves out as ballsy
people and I'm doing the stuff that
people out there won't do Tyler Robinson
was beaten within an inch of his life in
a
in the UK we've talked about that go
back to that interview he's out now and
he's been confronting people on the
street you did a video which I thought
was incredible
really merci yes real-life poker okay
Jame Robinson is death wish you found
this kid who had sent you death threats
and and confirm each oh the video here
and you confronted this person I just I
just foreshadow I said kid but I don't
think we didn't know as a kid when you
found him let's roll this clip and we'll
come right back
can I ask you what what is I've said or
done yeah they even if you didn't want
me murdered what what is about me or
what I've said that you so feel so
strongly against just just don't agree
with what you do can you give me one
example of what I've said or done that
incites hate well just just being a part
of the I do is a street protesting
against the whole of of Islam what
education you have on Islam now it
struck me Tommy first after do you know
this was a kid wait how did you find him
no so basically anybody talks about my
children that changes it yeah so I saw
these videos that he put online saying
I'm going to kill your family I'm going
to slit your mother's throat I'm going
to kill you okay I'm gonna rape your
door and then all of these things I said
said those yeah yeah made all of the
references he made we're about taking
the property so all of it was
religiously in point right what he was
safely which for me is a worry
especially with my three young children
so I then called the police my video the
meet with the police I said are you
gonna take this seriously they have
showed me they were they told me how
many different units and organizations
would what all over this so I said okay
fine I then went home but I was
uncomfortable sitting at home because I
knew what he said and I'd spent I put a
thousand pound reward up on Twitter to
say anyone who gives me your identity of
who this man is
I paid him a thousand pound I had seven
children who went to school with him did
you you about seven thousand pounds
Oh guys addressing when I met the police
I said here's his name here's his
address I've done your work well they
might not be so primed to help you I've
done your work I've done your job love
to do but it's true but it was it was
incredible I'm amazed knowing that that
context how civil you were with the kid
it really didn't seem like you were
trying to teach him a lesson at that
point
and not just be an aggressor I don't
think this kid knew what he was doing he
had no idea as to what it is that you
talked about that was so striking to me
we had the same thing at SMU kids
holding up protests protest signs that
weren't theirs and they couldn't tell
you a single thing I'd said do you find
that a constant when you confront people
who have this idea constantly with this
kid
I realized within seconds that he was
mentally ill within seconds of looking
at so I this could have turned out so
different i sat outside his house for
six hours watching his front door when
he's door open at 6:00 look in the
morning for him to go to prayer that's
when I caught him but then I was shocked
that 24 hours after I've sat down and
talked to the police who he is and he
pursed statement house ain't gonna go
kill an English lady he could have
killed an English lady he could have
killed my kids and they they got nothing
and then when I then it was very
apparent that he was a victim as well
was open about what he said he was a
mentally kid who has been used
and abused that's what he was he had the
minute I say he had them in late my
daughter's 10 I get more sense at my
door
when he asked me for an arm wrestle mid
argument an arm wrestle so it's very
clear that he did he had serious
learning difficulty seriously yeah but
he had a mental age for me whatever and
I asked him that the first one I said if
you got learning the police and he said
yes and it was clear that he did yeah
that's why I rang in an ambulance but
and if you look we've had free terrorist
attacks in the UK they've all been from
people with mental rickman mental mental
mental ages of young children yeah a
used of you sent out a bomb well I think
that's also important no because in the
United States we're talk about the
Second Amendment they just go mental
health mental health I'm Gohar psyche
and there are a lot of people with
mental health issues who aren't
aggressive but if you combine that with
an idiot
that actually encourages aggression just
like what's the prison system that
justifies actions just because someone
is depressed doesn't mean they lose
their right or weed right or weed well
good example I would imagine probably
with the prison stint that you had there
are probably some times where you felt
pretty down pretty depressed you could
have been diagnosed that way but if we
were what was that no no no I know but
you know maybe yourself but um the point
is that but you know you had a hard go
but in the United States you don't
forego your rights because of that in
the UK with no second Amendment right
how do you protect how do you do this in
in feel secure how do you protect
yourself at least in the United States
someone like yourself would have that as
a feel so if you keep your head in a
swivel but they can protect their own
and so can their family
you can't they're genuinely what is that
like I had the police come to my house
in the morning they woke me up and they
said here is a government it's called an
Osmond morning the Osmond morning is
when there is serious intelligence that
people are about to kill you they gave
me an Auslan morning and they said
al-shabaab
a terrorist group from Somalia Somalia
who two weeks prior had massacred
hundreds of people in the Kenyan
shopping on our Shabaab have main dudes
be caught killed all costs what you're
not then it goes on to read what you're
not allowed to do you're not allowed to
get a weapon
you're not allowed so basically what
I've said to them is what am I supposed
to do put a little chain on my door yeah
just told me and the police have given
me six of these six of these series
friends I had six Muslims who were
arrested in a car they had guns bombs
and IEDs suicide notes on the way to
kill me and I'm not allowed to if you
watch my videos for the past ten years I
walk with my hand on my back so when I'm
in a situation I did it in Rome and I
did it most recently against an Tifa
because I'm fed up of having my face
beam so but but I constantly have to be
not just not mom I not only have to have
a weapon to protect myself but I'm also
fully aware if I try to protect myself
I may end up in prison right for
fighting against for being a racial
attack right constantly not just
cautious of all of that I'm cautious of
all of it
I know only the Mayor of London just
cause for knife control just called for
knife control in London I don't eerily
guys already do have knife control I
mean what is it I have this right now
someone just just gave this to me as a
gift which would be totally illegal it's
just a stab myself that night yeah I
know it's strong spring yeah you know
now they're saying knife control I'm
going home on a second one when people
say it's just an assault weapons ban I
think we'll actually just it's just a
semi-automatic ban and they go well
actually it's a mental health issue well
actually it's a universal well actually
it's a gun registry then it will stop
well okay with your straw man woody you
think there's gonna be knife control it
sounds so absurd because what can you do
people have kitchen knives unless all
cutlery is plastic knives and forks
there is no way to implement knife
control on a general populace all of
light all airplane cabin right exactly
exactly all the life is near flame cam
yet that's what they've been calling for
in London I why why and how have they
not been learning from the mistakes
Tommy I watch it from here I first off
I'm very concerned that it comes here
the United States that's my concern
and I also cannot I genuinely I try to
understand people who disagree with me
so at least I can understand their
arguments I'm at a loss man maybe it can
help me well I've got three children
just bed every night and I'm aware that
people at some point are going to come
to kill me and I'm aware that I have no
way of defending my son and that is a a
gut-wrenching terrifying and also a sad
feeling there's nothing like it and
that's just so forget about going out on
the house I can't even defend them in my
house - and we have no way of having
weapons we're not allowed them you know
the noise you just pulled out yeah I go
to jail yeah I know something in Canada
by the way this isn't any more dangerous
millions women in this country are gonna
lose their healthcare access not to
abortion services to basic family
planning
you know mammograms I do not have
mammogram machines at our health centers
and we've never stated that we did it's
almost as though you're a pathological
sociopathic serial killer with babies so
before I get to John Oliver's recent
video on crisis pregnancy centers have a
question of the day are you pro-life or
do you consider yourself pro-choice now
here's the key if it's the case that you
consider yourself pro-choice and a lot
of people do do you still at this point
kind of have to acknowledge that the
pro-choice activists today are merely
pro-abortion can we all kind of agree
that it's just assumed you're on board
with abortion the kind of laws that you
see from the DNC debbie Wasserman
Schultz you see in Colorado up to 26
weeks I mean it's it's gone a bit around
the bend it's hard to say it's
pro-choice with the kind of messaging
being pushed out so John Oliver went on
his show today or not today sorry this
weekend this is this is his latest show
to take aim at volunteer crisis
pregnancy centers now if it sounds like
it doesn't make sense
well let's make sense of it tonight
we're gonna focus on the exact opposite
of an abortion clinic something called a
crisis pregnancy center facilities whose
primary purpose is to talk women out of
terminating a pregnancy something they
don't often make that clear instead
looking ads like this we're certain
where you make the decision about a
pregnancy that comes at a
less-than-perfect time get jelly on the
belly come to sunrise woman's clinic
early so I want to make it clear you
have problems with pro-life centers
running friendly act you find that
deceptive you find that deceptive as
opposed to ads from the benign benign
named Planned Parenthood we help you
find the birth control that's best for
you deliver life-saving preventive care
local cancer screening is an
authorization for your most personal
moments so you're prepared most
everything it all happens here I
Planned Parenthood every year we offer
trusted affordable care to 2.7 million
Americans so you're empowered to take
control of your biggest decisions and
lead your healthiest life Planned
Parenthood care no matter what unless
you don't want to kill the baby that's
true you gotta admit the luck that has
the branding down and he looks better
Slyke planned would you like to watch a
fetus be torn to pieces in 4k what you
do is you suck it up babies you chop
them up saw them up and then set them
down a tube we're gonna talk about this
could easily be considered false
advertising because it's called Planned
Parenthood it's not planned and you're
not a parent if it's going to be honest
advertising it sure he told oh wait oh
it's a kid we don't want to be parents
Kayla kill it kill it kill it that
should be the title of your ad it's not
planned you're not a parent next clip
one of the early pregnancy options that
you won't get at sunrise women's clinic
is an abortion but that can be hard to
do actually happens a lot with cpc's
take the center for pregnancy choices
and it was founded by a woman named
Barbara Bevers once you're inside her
CPC you'll find if you say you can kill
your baby and it'd be good for you
that's just deception I agree not true
it doesn't voice doesn't register with
reality mamas women are not made that
way women are made to protect them to
garden to to to die for their babies not
their babies to die for them holy Sh I
know right it's almost as bad as this
the abortionist uses this clamp to grasp
an arm or leg once he has a firm grip
the abortionist pulls hard in order to
tear the limb from the baby's body by
way one by one the rest of the limbs are
removed along with the intestines the
spine and the heart and lungs all right
it gets way worse they crush the head
and suck it down hood that is how
abortions are performed so you may take
someone who has a southerner and I
understand it if you take anyone who's
not from the south and you throw a
southern accent they're not gonna
believe a single thing that person says
her period you know hey listen this guy
is blue I think I think she's wrong
because of the way she said that what
do you think he was reacting to the fact
that she said that Mama's would actually
prefer to die for their babies and
babies for their mamas if that is I'm so
glad that you asked because the
empirical evidence would suggest she's
right the fact is women aren't built
that way study in Finland found that
women are possibly six times more likely
to commit suicide after an abortion okay
but how often do we hear about in the
animal kingdom when do take a mammal any
mammal including by the way human beings
yes okay when do women become most
aggressive when protecting their young
and we say it as though it sounds absurd
women are designed to give birth and
protect their young that is true
they aren't designed to have it chapped
up and suck down a tube it doesn't
matter how many times you say it what
the loath in your voice that's it we'll
get to that we'll get some more
statistics regarding abortion and
Planned Parenthood the services they
actually offer which John Oliver is
completely misleading about but that
let's start with that Marley was dead to
begin with let's go next clip there are
now 2,700 pregnancy centers in America
compared to less than 1,700 abortion
providers and the described as one
abortion clinic and thirty-eight crisis
pregnancy centers so here's a big
difference for two most crisis pregnancy
centers do not receive government
funding while Planned Parenthood
receives over half a billion dollars a
year now I am I'm personally attached
just those are some of the researchers
good my wife works at a crisis pregnancy
center she volunteers at a crisis
pregnancy center I know what they do
it's an entirely volunteer army they
have to do fundraising twice a year with
these banquets to make sure that they're
still in business and they compete
against a never-ending supply of federal
funding I know no money goes to
abortions but really that's the
moneymaker to Planned Parenthood which
is why they try to upsell you we'll get
to that later this is something that
people need to understand it doesn't by
the way you can have as many saves a
children with cleft palate centres as
you want if it's a volunteer center
planned parent receives it see that's a
pivotal difference by the way I thought
there are all just women's health
clinics why do it now why do we
differentiate now between Oh
providers and crisis put so many more
volunteer abortion doctor we need more
volunteer portion doctors step up to the
plate be a minute clip if you believe
abortion is immoral you are of course
allowed to set up a center dedicated to
convincing women about what is happening
with cpc's is that way too often we
with unplanned pregnancies or being
actively misled while trying to access
healthcare okay first off that's it's
not correct actually in a matter of fact
Planned Parenthood doesn't offer any
kind of educational programming if you
look at other than educating you on how
to be up sold to the abortion I find it
so fun if you haven't you want to open
up volunteer that's fine as long as you
provide all the services I want you to
provide she's bitching that these other
crisis pregnancy centers which provide
contraception which provide count you
know they provide consultants there they
provide counseling they provide they
help with nannying services they help
with single mothers option they even
help you by the way they're not all
conservative organizations they even
help you with with with welfare programs
and what you're eligible for he is
saying that well that's not really okay
because they don't provide the abortion
so let me make this clear
we're allowed to have our opinion
according to John Oliver and the
pro-abortion activists but we're already
paying by the way for your Planned
Parenthood with our tax dollars and now
these people are volunteering their time
and money to offer women other choices
and that's what you're upset about
they're double-secret paying paying with
taxes to Planned Parenthood then paying
with their dollars and volunteering
their time to provide alternatives this
is what pisses off the left are you
cpc's seem happy to have women confuse
them for abortion clinics just was
misleading anti-abortion activists watch
addressing a conference for one of the
largest CPC organizations we want to
appear neutral under said let me outside
the best call the best client you ever
get is one that thinks they're walking
into an abortion clinic okay those are
the best clients that could ever walk in
your door or call your center the ones
that think you provide abortions Wow yes
Wow indeed why would that be misleading
do you know oh yeah that's right you
weren't even know we've had Abby Johnson
on this show she's not an anti-abortion
activist she's a former director of a
Planned Parenthood
okay never he may never mentions it ever
and by the way she's talked about on
this show and in her book how to Planned
Parenthood she talked about how they
would try to sell women on abortions who
didn't even want them and they would
impose abortion quotas because it was
their most lucrative product so she in
the context here a former director at
planned parent
Hood said the best customer to walk into
a Planned Parenthood is someone who will
get an abortion who doesn't know that
they want an abortion and then context
the best person who would walk into our
crisis pregnancy center now which offers
everything but abortion contrast with
Planned Parenthood is someone who thinks
they want an abortion
that's the context former director
talking about context plantings next
clip the efforts to conceal their true
intent takes many forms starting with
the name many cpc's have the word choice
in their names like choices women's
center and while it should be easy to
get terrify any misconceptions with a
simple phone call that can be difficult
just listen to what happens when one
woman called a CPC for information and
keep in mind when you listen that the
center absolutely under no circumstances
ever provides abortions humanity that we
just so cpc's can lure women to meet
with them on false pretenses so that's
horrifying that's no it's not there's
nothing horrifying about by the way
what's misleading by using the word
choice when they're offering and
educating women and assisting with four
choices parenting adoption abstinence
contraception hmm what they mean when
they say pro-choice and that's why I say
you're an abortionist you're not
pro-choice
parenting adoption abstinence
contraception you say that we're anti
choice if we don't just provide the
fifth one the killing floor for the baby
well your anti choice well we're the
four choices not really we don't agree
with the abstinence okay so to you it's
less extreme to advocate abortion than
it is for abstinence I'm getting this
correct i'ma get this am I getting this
right because the star goes right
because you watch an episode of Glee
can't believe that this happens all the
time another marketing anyway they tell
you to click here for a price Oh call
one of our representatives so that we
can talk you into where the CPC actually
wanted to inform a woman here this
crisis pregnancy center of her option
all the or she went through with an
abortion this is something else too
again the left oh he says well I think
abortion should be limited in
it's horrible but you know if someone
really need well know right now this
person is just saying hey let's inform
you of your options yeah before she went
through with what we would all agree
even if it's not murder it's probably
not the optimal result so while we're on
the topic of false advertising how about
all those things that Planned Parenthood
does to trick people into coming into
their offices right like falsely
claiming they providing hammer grams hey
let's watch this this is great what's
gonna happen as a result of this if this
bill would ever becomes law millions
women in this country are gonna lose
their health care access not to abortion
services to basic family planning
you know mammograms I do not have
mammogram machines at our health centers
and we've never stated that we did it's
almost as though you're a pathological
sociopathic serial killer with babies
it's almost like you just said they
would lose basic health care services
like mammograms and then say we don't
provide manna brands we've never said
that we've had I don't understand don't
follow and this is why it's so important
to because they say basic health care
services whereas John Oliver just said
you know these amount of crushes
pregnancy centers and only these amount
of the bull shouldn't clinics because
that's what they do that's their hot
ticket item that's their Tickle Me Elmo
circa 1996 Sorna was a hot Christmas
item that you know exactly what I'm
talking about don't fact-check me a
turbo man
you're probably someone had an abortion
by the way also falsely advertising
prenatal care at Planned Parenthood they
can't help was that they're not capable
just as they don't have mammogram
machines I bet you a lot of people
watching this are surprised by that
because you've never heard it before
which brings us onto some more points
let's go next clip they often locate
themselves as close as possible to
abortion clinics this woman who we
aren't identifying speaks candidly about
the difficult decision she had to make
after becoming pregnant after a rape I
didn't want the baby it was a lot on my
soul eventually she decided to seek the
services of the Hartford GYN she
initially went for counseling and she
can remember how the clinic's neighbor
Hartford women's health
tried to offer unsolicited counsel as
well they was trying to tuck me over the
air then I was like you know like you
making me feel bad so now clearly that's
absolutely horrible
no it's not absolutely horrible what
okay first of a couple things that they
do they take an example who was raped
let's take them at their word here less
than 1% of abortions performed again why
for suspending women coming all the time
they know about contraception why
because it's 2018 it's not a lack of
education they just don't care they're
irresponsible and they often go in
thinking they want an abortion and then
they change their minds and we'll get to
that in a little bit the ultrasound
that's why Planned Parenthood charges up
charges for ultrasounds so unsolicited
advice is what they're talking about
something else even though they blur the
face I think we can all kind of agree
it's not races say seems as though she
might be a person of color people of
color aren't or doubt is likely to be
aborted today as they are to be born in
the United States that's by design by
Margaret Sanger notorious racist hated
the blacks so unsolicited advice these
clinics aren't assaulting women they're
offering them free information on a
pregnancy even with their story taking
the most extreme 1% take them at their
word rape victim right minority all they
had was she was tugging on me trying to
get me to go in like like and maybe it
made me feel bad bad I'm sorry I think
you're so out of touch that abortion is
the baseline that you think that's gonna
horrify your audience and most people
watch that kind of reasonable I don't
know next clip
I think Reese's can't get a physical
location right next to an abortion
clinic they have another trick up their
sleeve and that is buses that can
literally park outside and try and tempt
women in many cpc's operate mobile
clinics once cpc's have women inside
their building or van they can employ
every tactic in the book to try and get
them to change their mind every tactic
in the book like science and information
so here's the thing again the but keep
in mind this is why that the context
matters to these but volunteers right
volunteers most of these places these
are people who volunteered their time
and their money everyone knows what
Planned Parenthood is everyone knows
where to find them okay this is because
it's what's discussed when people talk
about women's healthcare they're talking
about Planned Parenthood when you have
people going out there was a sandra
fluke or Lena Dunham they talk about
Planned Parenthood they don't thought
most people don't actually know about
other crisis pregnancy centers that it's
really really hard to compete I'd like
if the government funded coke and you
had an alternative soda
but everyone knows what coke is yep and
it receives half a billion dollars in
funding so that's all but they think
Planned Parenthood is their only choice
no one talks about crisis Bernie Center
probably because they don't get that
kind of a funny so Oliver here is
complaining about them using their own
money to advertise that they can simply
find their clinic think about that for a
second the complaint now is not only do
these places provide these other
services not only are they informative
not only do they provide services the
Planned Parenthood does not provide but
they use they use vans I may have people
help with the SEO call next clip heart
beat international which has 1,400
affiliates in the US has this handbook
with suggested scripts featuring some
nonsense information it suggests telling
pregnant women that 35 percent of
suicidal behaviors among women may be
attributable to abortion which is bull
it also says that abortion almost
doubles the risk of breast cancer which
is also bull okay so a couple of things
here notice Oliver never dismisses he
dismisses he without really actually
providing any kind of a rebuttal right
ah now some of that information is wrong
and I'll get to that it's like yeah but
he's taking one example of a crisis
pregnancy center that provided
information that was inaccurate now it
wasn't as inaccurate as say telling
everyone before Congress that you
provide mammograms and then saying you
never said that you provided members
because you know the Machine it's not
that bad because the first thing about
suicidal behavior is actually correct
we're gonna go in a macro level it is
correct that comes from a study
published I think in the British Journal
of Psychiatry that found women's risk
for depression went up by 81% after
having an abortion and I think the there
was a direct association between suicide
and abortion which increased by about
35% so that was what now was misquoted
by this individual abortion individual
CDs CDC CPC yes then the staff they're
referring to I think it's a Chinese
meta-analysis 36 Studies on abortion for
breast cancer or increased the risk of
breast cancer to be fair that's not
really an accurate study to go by
showing a link there's no control group
just play it smart out there tonight
boys okay we got Thomas all on the night
one the most brilliant economist in the
world
YouTube's just itching for a reason to
monetize I so want to see a lot of hard
work out there okay crying out loud we
know how to bring the laughs let's just
play it smart cloth tickle now we need
this win denied come on let's play heads
up out there
man for man we're better than a 4z yeah
all right z4z we're burning in late
night show in the world
[Music]
[Music]
you know what Dan said is back to the
Hawking ah so good to have you that's
the sound of the weekend the last show
of the week and I couldn't be more
grateful
unbelievable showing up today Thomas
soul is on the show oh look
discrimination and disparities accounts
with the change my mind
red and white they're one of the minute
one of the men I want to have on the
half on one of the men I've wanted to
have on the show that's a great start
I'm sure but you just appeared on this
program I talked about in said before
since I met you even wanted him on the
show
yeah I've really wanted to have him on
the show which actually it leads me to a
question of the day who would you most
like to see on the show as far as you
know great minds who do you consider to
be some of the most I guess formidable
minds of our time I would certainly say
Thomas Sol on there and then in the
comedy realm nor McDonald so we're
holding out hope and then a second
question have you noticed the incredibly
odd coverage of the YouTube shooting
which we'll talk about later
and finally does anyone else have
allergies I feel as though an entire
field of dandelions just decided to line
up and flatulate right in my eyeball I
don't know anyone else out there who's
gonna be in video studios always a Jared
who is not gay following on Twitter not
get you to meet us cry with you how much
it's not your Photoshop side fulfil my
league obligations during conclusions

speak into the microphone or adjust your
volume statue computer are you ready for
the overlays beep beep I'm ready and
also I'm not kool-aid on Twitter I know
you were telling me that you were very
concerned about its cult followers
already know on the show by the way he
was I guess I'll be I don't know if he's
been completely removed from Twitter we
just we just he was I just write some of
these jokes this morning yeah and then
after that he was just perma banned yeah
I think he's probably man I don't know
this is a good device to book I see when
people to holes is my host or like this
book are you gonna throw it at asleep I
get why all these leaders like you know
anybody well Oprah has her face on the
cover of every magazine since right
exactly

their local tourism campaign detroit zoo
come for the animals leave was a little
piece of Detroit for a taste that's Pure
Michigan theme song it's terrible is
right behind it it just it just makes
anything sound good yeah yeah slow
motion yeah this address rules its Pure
Michigan genius watch people who live in
Michigan shiver love that people who who
don't have no idea what we're talking
about it's a tortoise exactly and Tim
how nobody makes fun of Tim Allen on my
name that movie liner I guess sort of
series line by the way hey here's
another strike a woman said in
ancestry.com DNA test told her that she
had a different father who happened to
be her parents fertility doctor the test
showed that her DNA matched a sample
from a doctor more than five hundred
miles away at the time Rowlett was not
aware that more than 36 years ago her
parents had struggled to conceive
there's a twist seeking more information
mr. Elliott had her older sister take
the same test only to discover DNA match
with the milkman her younger sister
matched with the mailman and
unsurprisingly her youngest brother who
wears a leather helmet matched positive
with the hobo who pees down the elevator
shaft claiming he's Jesus it's always
the crazy person who claims these Jesus
from 2018 oh yeah by the way I'm Jesus
really good know I've been this weekend
my contact information these explains
why every doctor's visit was accompanied
by chocolate and roses and Astroglide
perfectly
you were saying this technically
technically the fertility doctor did his
job you can't take that away from him
all sales are final
I think the bed to the mother
rationalizing that do you do you know
where your good genes come from now
here he charges I don't think this was a
redneck family and I actually I resent
that presumption
yeah probably Arkansas if standards
let's get lighter because this news has
been so heavy let's watch this Russian
postal drone smash into a wall in its
inaugural flight roll clip our mail will
be a sight to behold for entire oh
[Laughter]
goodness is in Russia it's a flat rate
for next day killing ha ha ha in an
unsurprising turn of events the drone
turned out to be manned by the only
Chinese drone pilot in Russia so I know
someone's gonna stacked up and say
they're not pilots if they're Manning in
drones here's the thing we don't care
know some people saying that's racist
maybe a japanese couple apologize for
ignoring their work pregnancy timetable
by conceiving quote before their turn
this comes from The Telegraph Japanese
work her I don't think we have I don't
think we want to break the name because
you know she deserves her yeah yeah
that's the problem she needs to worry
about
she's been reprimanded by her boss for
selfishly breaking the rules after she
became pregnant before was her turn the
couple formally met with the director to
apologize about the pregnancy in person
and they actually did it before that by
phone and we have the exclusive audio of
that call people ask me you get these
exclusive calls but why don't they speak
in their native tongue it's always in
English so is English it's it's just as
Vexen to us yeah my way yeah yourselves
the same thing I'm super Titus said they
have all the same freedoms of Japan so
yes they do don't let this story the
idea we'll talk about the YouTube
shooting and just some overall startling
statistics that are ignored by the media
people should go and watch the John Lott
interview yesterday but a great example
is this this idea that controlling guns
will reduce suicides Japan has I think
some of the strictest gun control in the
world the highest suicide rate in the
industrialized world I believe that's
because I have to have babies in turn
yeah you once told me that if you were a
judge Quebec separately as its own
country as opposed to a province that I
would have number two I haven't been
able to find sources on that if someone
can send that to me a desk router I've
heard it I cannot substantiate it but
I've heard that multiple times in
Switzerland as well like really high I
have never heard of that I thought it
was spend computer do you know if that's
true or not they're pretty close we
can't annex them he's thinking about the
next war speaking of an acting said the
rest of the world it's time for this
week's eye on India segment

why do we single out India because it's
a terrible place visitor and also
because people like to act as though
it's not they go there and spiritual
quests so you know what we'd like to
warn you this is why would somebody
storm India every time we do it we're
global we're globalists when it comes to
news according to an Indian professor do
you guys read this article yeah this is
great and a doctor from what I hear
women who wear jeans give birth to
transgenders and autistic children India
today
Rajeev Kumar a botany lecturer so he's
staying in his Lane accolade Eastern
kara college said on television a woman
who dresses up like a man a woman who
dresses up like a man what will the
character of the child she gives birth
to be these children are called
transgenders or nipple Khan Comstock
come see he he also later added that and
the women who wear miniskirts should
call me if science very self-serving
toll-free it what's funny is he was
adamant about his opinion we have from
the same article speaking on a TV show
recently he defended his remarks
doubling down saying they were based
quote on science and years of experience
which in his defense we believe stems
from the recently published double-blind
placebo-controlled Wranglers make
study I can search that one on PubMed my
eyes are still in question me yes faded
glory why are you picking on India that
story right that's exactly what I'm
making it too easy India he's on
television although they probably look
at our country with this next story and
say you don't know to I say okay you got
a point because Robert DeNiro says that
there's no use in reaching across the
aisle at all to Trump supporters though
in a recent interview he said the people
that I care about all those young people
who demonstrated their the future they
know they say we'll remember November
they're the ones who feel the way we do
not the way the gun lovers and the NRA
do with all that idiocy to the point of
absurdity he then said we're at a point
with all of us where that's beyond where
this is beyond trying to see another
person's point of view there are ways
you can talk about that or at a point
where the things that are happening in
our country are so bad and it comes from
Trump he went on citing examples blaming
Trump of course for a lackluster economy
political divisiveness as well as rocky
and Bowl
Winkle Stardust analyze that
hide-and-seek the family grudge match
the intern the big wedding dirty grandpa
Meet the Fockers Little Fockers his
entire post 2006 catalog aside from
silver linings playbook and alimony
slash child support to two ex-wives you
you're a bad president I don't think
that's a yes it is it's the bad
president at best I've heard people
describe intern as cute yeah which is
the last review raving review any
director wants to hear also the first
time Anne Hathaway has been associated
with anything called cute yeah yeah how
do you feel about the Godfather it's
cute cute that's right that's what we
were going for personality yes alright
speaking which we have to move on to our
dive inside the YouTube shooting it's
odd isn't it that we we're not talking
about her at all yeah it was as quickly
as it came it went Keyser söze it's just
gone like if I didn't win her so
everything everything we know like that
like the pollen in my eyes oh I don't
have a watch people are saying um coke
[Laughter]
fix the Danny Lyons everything yes to
fix it that's that's everyone knows it's
the antidote it's add to cope with you
fly antidotes in the most surprising
places like stake snake venom needs just
a different different kind of snake
venom pollen cocaine plant
it's another plane it's natural right
that's the look it's natural men what's
those cocaine I don't fool around with
anything synthetic just cocaine for this
cowboy
none of that methamphetamine I don't
know where that's been pure coke uh
everything we know about it
okay know some Dom xxx Adamo my
pronouncing that cred correctly there
spend computers at the pronunciation I
think so yeah there we go
yeah great I feel great that I go I go
to you for my information to make sure
that I'm correct I think so not really
sure my mind was somewhere else I was
thinking about how he screwed up
throughout history we really haven't
gotten the Trier replace him with Google
home yes wipe our history 39 years old
Iranian heritage PETA activist vegan she
wounded three shot herself as we call it
a happy ending
so uh happy she shot herself uh and also
by the way forensic scientists believe
the damage could have been much worse
had she had any b12 in her body or if
she were a man women aren't even good
masters so here's a mamey mess you does
you haven't and by the way for everyone
wondering what what happened here
there's there's a there's a lot of
evidence strong evidence that this
shooter had a problem with mental
illness don't believe me two ears tail
the tape
hello FBI I have a yeah she looks like
Michael Jackson in transition I and when
she looks like Michael Jackson after
it's a transition in a parallel universe
where the surgery was conducted with
nothing more than spent up garbage parts
from a salvage yard us so one thing that
really struck me and this is why I'm
really curious what the rest of you have
noticed is the difference now the media
covered this versus other shootings have
you guys seen this they're still talking
about parkland no mention of Sutherland
Springs no one mentioned the YouTube
shooting at all it was the biggest the
second biggest tech company I guess the
first biggest tech company because it's
Google yeah but YouTube right behind
Facebook I think the biggest website is
Google than Facebook and then YouTube I
believe number one two and three so
barely shooting at the number three
arguably number one tech company no
headlines already gone two days look at
the HuffPo in the last story on MSNBC
you can see this here and as something
that I loved about Huffington Post they
said look they go motives still unclear
notice one thing it's the police officer
they don't even show her mugshot they
don't even show her picture anytime it's
a male shooter white male shooter it's
just Dylan roof it's right up there this
is the faith face of domestic terrorism
now they just show the cop because like
let's show the white male involved in
our reporting as well because every time
I go to a comic book movie now I just
assume it's full of mass shooters
because they they'll look like they all
like the mass shooter yeah it should
mean you don't see many of this uh
what's her name miss Sam AG dham dham
probably not gonna be in Avengers age of
Ultron oh she did um or didn't have
energy as something else it was also
really striking I didn't notice a lot of
people writing about this Mashable let's
see if you can spot the difference here
between the actual picture and Mashable
yep yeah well that's that they lightened
this again and her eyes even the face
get the skin is one thing that's like
okay maybe that's just a filter maybe
there's Instagram that bad boy but the I
colored I the filter they took their
iphone wand and put it that was the
whole one that was meant to remove
redeye now we're just gonna change the
actual Tanner for us it's very
reminiscent a miss Stacy her name is
Stacy now and she transitioned to Stefan
white male terrorist reminiscent all of
this I think of it remember the Fort
Lauderdale shooting I don't remember
this I was beside myself
Esteban Santiago's who's labeled a white
Hispanic I don't know what that means
oh my god white Hispanic and of course
part of the reason for this difference
is that it didn't for the narrative of
the white male shooter which is what the
leftist media loves to claim is the
trend this doesn't go with it another
clip oh you know going up oh it's like
that dancing baby gift when the internet
first started combined or the child's
nightmare was about it makes me feel so
much better about this show production
buddies way up here it does you said you
had something you wanted to say on this
well I didn't this happened in
California I mean correct me if I'm
wrong but strong gun pretty strict gun
laws there in California also by the way
YouTube Google not not a hotbed for gun
culture which is also just even more
damning because you sent a woman into a
virtually gun-free State and she still
couldn't come up with anything she did
injure three people yes but she shot
herself yes
UH one print by the way no listen I it's
always sad when someone knows his life
but not equally sad when you gotta be
one one yeah when you shooting at other
people it's like I mean this way if I
had the power if I could do that what do
you call the pot is it ESP what's the
power you can actually control people
with your minds if I'd the Jedi that's
if I were there at YouTube that's
exactly what I would do if she were
shooting at people I'd go the breaks
Thomas all coming up after the break one
trend is that we do see is that just
like the parklands shooting for aurora
we are looking for actual trends police
were warned beforehand yeah but did
nothing now to be fair they claimed that
they didn't have any reason to detain
her and that's that's obviously if you
can't just detain someone for no reason
so again tail the tape
[Applause]
yeah I mean what does it take for their
house and bring him to the quiet room
with the white jack and the arms crossed
let me get her an intern or something
and for crying out loud the standards
have become so stringent in a long time
ago you know you said the fridge was
talking to you they put you in a pool
and gave you electroshock therapy this
frauds uploading like it's her job I
can't do anything that is a hard balance
though obviously people you can't you
can't infringe on people's rights just
because someone says she's crazy Fred
listen I don't know a whole lot about
Iran this could be the norm for all we
know she could be batting a hundred for
non-crazy Iranians I have no idea I know
about her and achma dinner John and
Annie Cyrus and she seems normal so I
guess that's the only contrast the real
trend and we'll talk about this trial
was with Thomas so after this whoa
what do you think this had it what it
wasn't white male no it wasn't politics
wasn't religion what do you think this
has had in common with other mass
shootings ninety-eight percent of public
mass shootings in fact gun-free zone it
was committed in a gun-free zone also
something else that we don't talk about
do you know you know another another
commonality here notice that it was
there was a case in Detroit this person
is explained to compatriot why he had
picked one of the largest churches in
the Detroit area to attacked and this
church had banned anybody from having
permanent concealed handguns on church
property and he explained to his
compatriot that that made it easier for
him to kill lots of people before
anybody could arrive so this man is
actually written the book the war on
guns so you can imagine why we would
want to have him on right now I can
follow him on the Twitter at John our
lot l OTT jr. mr. John lot thank you for
being here sir
it's great to talk to you thanks for
having me on
well we're super glad to have you on so
I know listen I mean we've talked about
guns quite a bit and you and I were just
talking off air about how it's a
surprisingly winning issue with younger
people and often a lot of people on the
right aren't aware of just how much of a
winning issue it is we've we've had to
run ins with Vox and I know that you
have so let's start with this right now
obviously this gun debate is being I
mean so much of it is just it's it's a
quagmire let's start separating it piece
by piece with you sir the expert Vox
wrote a recent article America's unique
gun violence problem and you basically
deconstructed it point by point how
about you take us through that and what
that experience was like well they've
had I guess the post with like seventeen
charts where they go and they claim that
the United States has is unique in terms
of gun violence that were unique in
terms of the rate that people own guns
in the country and obviously they draw a
connection between the two indicating
that we could only get rid of the guns
we'd end up reducing the level violence
in the United States there's so many
kind of different levels of problems
with it I mean people don't even
understand that there is a difference
between murder and homicide right they
don't they use data in ways that just is
not kosher that you know academics
wouldn't go and use and I can happy to
talk about it but you know so for
example murder and homicide most people
don't know
that the difference between the two is
justifiable homicides homicides are
murders plus cases where either police
or civilians use guns to protect
themselves and so you know in a typical
year recently you would have had maybe
about 8,000 firearm murders but you'd
have maybe 12,000 firearm homicides and
they don't know how large of a share
that the vast majority of those fire
armor ders are gang-related right what
do you think they don't know at this
point I mean you're an academic and some
of them at Vox can be argued are
academics do you think they don't not
like a bomb on the MIT on the wage myth
yes it's like President Obama on the
wage gap you're going or is he trying to
push a message do you really think they
don't know at this point or they're so
entrenched in the agenda that they have
to continue with it because I know your
research shows the opposite might be
true which I'd like to get into right
well I mean it's hard to get in people's
heads to know what's actually motivating
them on things you know there are lots
of prominent cases where numbers are put
out where I just know they're fraudulent
you know so I suppose one of the more
prominent examples there's this guy
named Adam Langford who has put together
data
he says mass public shootings around the
world claiming that the United States
makes up about 1/3 of the mass shootings
around the world but only 4% of the
world's population
I've been asking for the guys data since
they got attention in 2015 I mean when
it came out he had the front page top
above the fold of every major newspaper
in the country and most the minor ones
yeah he got coverage in at least 30
different countries that the man would
hold in in the back your iPhone 4% know
your apps you know it's funny that you
bring that up because we've done this
quite a bit and they don't send their
sources but I've not heard that one
before I know it's false right away
because of the research we've done when
you look at mass shootings in places
like the Honduras and South American
countries and let's see here's the
so they look at mass public shootings of
four more people right in the United
States you're going to get all the cases
but you know so he's looking at data
from the 1960s through 2012 does anybody
really believe that you're going to be
able to find all the mass public
shootings in in Africa or South America
or Central America in the late 60s right
in the 70s I mean it's not like jeepers
yeah it's not like their newspapers were
even online at the time yeah and half
the archive you're not alone away by
Kony in Africa there's no way to get it
I can't imagine and and no one called
him on his claim well the thing is the
media doesn't care about it I just been
going back and forth with some people at
the New York Times because they just a
few months ago ran a huge full page
showing graphs that he had from his data
the thing is the graphs are unusable to
try to figure it out because they don't
label the dots and the vast majority of
dots are kind of all scrambled together
so you can't figure out what the with
the number he's claiming for individual
countries so I'd like to get information
on the actual cases that he has or if
that doesn't work which they won't give
you at least tell me the number of cases
he's claiming by country but they won't
do that yes and in the reporters they
don't care they won't they don't ask so
the thing with the New York Times that
Langford had told the New York Times are
told us that he had given the New York
Times exclusivity now you're dealing
with the media exclusivity with you on
gun violence it's not a scoop right
nobody even if even if somehow you had
giving them exclusivity it would just be
to let them run it first right you're
not gonna go and say well I'm gonna give
the newspaper exclusivity for five
months or for you know perpetuity after
that right and then when we contact the
New York Times they said well you have
to get it from Langford that they
weren't gonna give it out to us I don't
know why but they you know it just
that's afraid I have to protect my
sources what do you do if CDs like it's
a CD
except it's not so anyway just there's
so many things out there and well let me
ask you this you know lately what would
you say the most the most repeated false
point in the gun control narrative right
now if you had to zoning unlike on one
and we can go to number two and three
but what would you say is most important
for people to know I suppose maybe the
simplest thing is just how do you make
comparisons across places so you'll see
people say we'll look the United Kingdom
has very strict gun control
very few guns are owned and yet and they
have a low homicide rate compared to the
United States and and they say therefore
that means that it's the strict gun
control that's causing the low crime
right there the problem is is that if
you look before they had the gun control
laws they had an even lower homicide
rate right that when they passed the
different gun control laws their
homicide rate went up it was still lower
than the United States but given that it
was even lower before they had the gun
control laws it's hard to go and say
they have a low homicide rate because of
the gun control laws there's obviously
other things that vary across countries
and places that are accounting for the
difference there I feel as though
they've moved even away from that you
can correct me if I'm wrong but again we
deal in this world quite a bit with with
Vox and with a you know HuffPo and of
course they points the Australian
mandatory buyback they don't tell you
it's a mandatory buyback you know
because no one wants to take your guns
away by the way in case you were
paranoid but um they've moved away it
seems from from for example gun homicide
they've moved entirely just to gun
related homicide because the violent
crime rates are actually worse in a lot
of these countries with strict gun
control we see yes and so I mean a lot
of countries don't report murder rates
right and also one of the things is that
there's a much bigger difference between
homicides and murders in the United
States than there is most other
countries we have people defend
themselves more here in the United
States and so you have you know a bigger
gap that's there but you mentioned the
Australian stuff the Australia stuff you
know I don't know hoax or whatever it's
just complete missing for me
so I'll just give you a simple example
they'll go and they'll say that firearm
homicides were lower after the 96-97 by
back then they were before but and
that's true but the thing is it was
falling for 15 years prior to the
buyback and it was falling afterwards
but at a slower rate right and so you
know if it were falling at a faster rate
or there was a kind of a big downward
jump right at that time it would make
more sense but if it's falling before I
mean if you have a straight line and
it's falling over the entire period you
could pick any year right and the after
average would be below the before
average you wouldn't take that as
evidence that any of those years were
somehow crucial for changing the levels
that were occurring there in terms of
firearm homicides the other thing is
that's never mentioned it's true they
had this big buyback about a third of
the guns were bought back in 96 and 97
but people were then able to go out and
buy guns again and by 2010 the gun
ownership rate in Australia was actually
above what it was prior to the buyback
so if if they're right about this what
you should have seen is a big sharp
immediate drop and then an increase over
time and that's not what you observe wha
we've written about that quite a bit and
isn't it also true that you see the same
trend in New Zealand which would be the
most comparable country as well during
that same period of time and they didn't
have the mandatory buyback well you
definitely exactly where you don't see
it in terms of the mass public shooting
I mean you see you see the same trend in
terms of mass public shootings look New
Zealand actually had a bigger drop in
the rate of mass public shootings at the
same time than Australia did and yet
they didn't pass any laws that would be
related to this exactly Hobbit trilogy
was released so people were on you know
it's across countries a good example of
that as infant mortality rates you know
we've talked about this with health care
quite a bit when people try to bring up
socialized health care they said well
these other countries spend less than
better really the only the only
barometer that's used when they're
talking about that are our poll is
polling data by subjective measurements
where they ask people are you satisfied
with your health care and people say yes
but if you look at wait times in
emergency rooms the United States is
better if you look at mortality rates
from serious illnesses objective
empirical data empirical data would say
yes which isn't necessarily the realm
sometimes of our political opposition
when they're dealing with these topics
have you have you find it hard found it
hard to find someone who's willing to
step up like you said with these sources
but to have a conversation or debate
because another New York Times just ran
today a piece saying how to deal how to
have the gun control argument today I
don't know if you saw this in the
opinion page and I was going on a second
you didn't just have an argument you
just wrote an op-ed you still have yet
to have an argument yeah look I'll tell
you the gun control people have an
agreement among themselves not to debate
me and the you know I think there are a
couple reasons for that one is for TV
shows they'll usually want to have
people from both sides and if everybody
from the different gun control groups
don't want to debate me I mean I can't
tell you the number of times they'll get
a call from CNN or somebody be driving
into the studio and I'm like five
minutes away from the studio and I'll
get a call from the producer saying well
we're gonna have to go a different
direction you know none of the bloomberg
people when we told them that you were
going to be on the air by you know said
that they we had to get somebody else
they said they'd rather wore a guy who
was a former Republican and supports
sensible gun control measures that's a
better conversation we're gonna go with
that one
let me ask you this since we can't
compare across different countries and
I've talked we can we can look at things
across countries but you have to do in a
particular way so for example I'll give
you a simple question that is can you
name me one place in the world that's
ban guns either all guns or all handguns
and see murder rates fall or even stay
the same every single place that's
banned guns he had seen increase is
often very large
increases in in murder rates and I would
say deadpan that's the example they
often use and I know the answer but I
figured I'd toss it out there right well
the thing is with Japan you want to look
before and after they have the gun
control laws
Japan's had a low murder rate as long as
we have numbers from them and they've
had very strict gun control laws since
the 1700s only samurai were basically
legally able to go and own guns so you
know you want to have something where we
can say you know like when the UK banned
handguns and January 97 their homicide
rate went up 50 percent over the next
eight years you see similar increases so
you look at island nations because gun
control advocates will say okay well
it's true but murder and violent crime
went up in Chicago and in Washington DC
after we had bands but that's not really
a fair comparison they'll say because
people go and get guns from you know
rest of Illinois or Indiana or Maryland
or Virginia the thing is that doesn't
explain why it went up right people
could buy guns from those places
beforehand it may explain why I didn't
go down as they were predicting though
if they really believed that that caused
it to go up to be kind of nice if they
had shared that secret with people
before the bans were passed right but
but even if you look at island nations
that can't go and blame a neighbor you
see every single time that you've had a
band murder rates have gone up often you
know five six seven fold after bans have
been placed and turns out they say
murder as opposed to homicide I want to
make sure we're getting well I mean both
murder and homicide depending upon how
the place measures it not everybody
measures murder but you see an increase
in both of those and and for most
countries murder and homicide are much
more close to each other than is true in
the United States right but you know you
think it would cause gun control
advocates some pause you know usually
the response you'll get back is well
we're not talking about banning guns but
but the one is I'm not I don't believe
that I think they would like the banned
guns if they could but to the point
stands for other laws you have to ask
yourself who is most likely to obey the
different gun control laws that you have
the reason why murder rates go up after
bans is that it's the most law-abiding
good citizens who turn in their guns not
the criminals so much and to the extent
that you disarm law-abiding citizens
relative to criminals you actually make
it easier for them to go and commit
crimes in it that's true for gun control
generally so I'm not to mention the
moral reprehensibility of forbidding
someone their god-given right to protect
themselves it to me is immoral to say
well this woman has never had to defend
herself because David Hogg was on CNN
once but one thing I would like to kind
of hone in on here we just talked about
different countries but something they
bring up I know they bring up quite a
bit no Vox has done this I'd like to ask
you do states so now for stateside where
we have obviously a consistent
measurement homicides murders do states
overall you just listed Chicago but
states with stricter gun control laws
can they argue that states with stricter
gun control laws have lower gun crime
overall or oh yeah no the opposite is
clearly true what you have to do is
essentially deal with the same point
that we dealt with when we're talking
about the UK you have to deal with what
were the different crime rates across
these places or murder rates before they
had these gun laws and to see how they
change after they've adopted them so you
want to kind of pull out kind of the
pre-existing average differences across
places and as soon as you do that you
see in fact that the places with the
stricter gun control laws have I have
much higher murder rates that are there
much higher homicide rates much higher
overall gun deaths you know even if you
include suicides in there well what
would we use as examples as far as
states or cities with those kinds of
laws and high high of violent crime
rates well the point is how it changes
kind of before and after if they go to
the post that we put up on responding to
the box then because you're right that's
one of the things that they put up there
we have a diagram that basically
uses something from the Brady Campaign
which is a gun control group every year
since 2001 they put out an index of gun
control laws in different places in
different states and you could see very
clearly that as states have had their
you know number of gun control laws
increase you'll see an increase in the
homicides or firearm homicides or
murders however you want to break it
down the lucious outlaws in the country
live alone knows is Vermont Vermont two
are the losses Vermont is the one place
in the country I think maybe Arizona now
but you can purchase a firearm from
Vermont in Vermont then you can carry it
open or concealed try and open artery
verse all that alright yeah but that's
for optics yeah I up until literally
just less I guess now Vermont has had no
other state gun control laws on its own
the only gun control laws there are the
federal laws that are there but you have
fourteen states now that have similar
types of concealed carry laws to Vermont
where you don't need to have a permit to
carry within those states they're twelve
states which are exactly like Vermont
where you don't need to have a permit to
carry any place in the state and then
there are two other states Montana and
Arkansas where you don't need to have
permit in the vast majority of the state
but in some places you do and you know
most these states laws are fairly recent
but you know just like little concealed
carry to begin with there hasn't been
the types of bad things that people been
claiming and you know the big benefit of
this is is who benefits the most from
caring and my research indicates it's
basically the people most likely be
victims of violent crime and that
overwhelmingly tends to be poor blacks
who live in high crime urban areas so
you have a state like Illinois they
allow concealed carry now but it costs
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
hey
hey i saw you on the twitter thank you
all right thank you very much
good all right how you guys doing
geez uh this is as you probably know
this is not the show we expect

what do you have to say about you guys
thank you so much
this is not the show we planned on doing
we anyone here see the smu show last
week
how ridiculous was anyone want a show
like that yeah
well we couldn't because your uh your
campus officers
actually wouldn't show up so hold on a
second there's one who did show up today
there's one who showed up let's give it
up for officers still uh sillerson
one who showed up and uh there are some
private security details out here who
are off-duty officers and just so you
know the same lieutenant who told them
that noah would show up because there
was no credible threat told these
off-duty officers you can't carry on
campus
well he called someone above the
lieutenant's head and he said what that
guy what's he do
you carry and i quote you carry your
 gun
[Applause]
and a lot of them are amongst you who
you do not know um
so thank you so much there was a mix-up
obviously we couldn't get out here and
do the show that we want to do it's
going to be kick-ass we wanted to do
this whole like smu
but instead we loaded all of our misfits
into a bus
and shipped them across country against
their will gross violation of labor laws
we said we can't do the big comedy show
we'll come back and do it but we can do
one hell of a change my mind cause all
we need is a table some coffee and some
good conversation are we right
right huh
thank you guys and one guy just yelled
and weed what was that and a pin
all right first off i can't see while
i'm in here is there anyone out there
who disagrees and would like to change
my mind on the idea that's the premise
that socialism is evil
okay now by the way okay we see one
person all right let's uh let's bring
one person in to start
hold on one second hold on no no no hold
on hold on hold on
we got to pick one person there's two
hands going up are you an actual
are you okay one second here one second
one second all right and this is why
this is why we had to downscale this but
by the way i appreciate
we actually have the ability to see any
leftist organization in the country
and how many people show up and just so
you know every time there's an antifa
protest
unless they're stabbing ben shapiro with
an axe pick uh every time there's an
antifa protest or occupy and they post
something
we can actually say that on average
about eight percent of people who claim
they'll be attending attend
whereas here this is the last minute
there was a cancellation we said hey
guys we're gonna be in the quad
and i think it's actually two to three
times the number of people who said they
were coming so you guys actually show up
and i know that's hard because many of
you have jobs so um
so that's we're gonna be talking about
tonight for those who don't know this
isn't a comedy show
i know some people were saying well why
don't you come here and do a lecture be
like having alice cooper play
jazz piano at carnegie hall i don't do
lectures it's not fun
but with this the goal here is not to by
the way just to argue it's not ad
hominem it's the opposite of cable news
if someone disagrees with me i want to
sit down and we use a credit method to
rationalize their position now i know a
lot of you won't be able to see me or
hear me so i wouldn't blame you if you
walk out like i said this was last
minute planned we appreciate every one
of you who is here
but i would love to sit down with
someone who disagrees with me and
everyone here by the way i know how high
energy you are
but make sure you give respect to anyone
who sits down and disagrees and give
them the chance to make their argument
so hopefully we can be productive not
get jared uh who do we want who do we
want to grab who's grabbing who
people keep saying messenger bag so mr
messenger bag hold on one second come on
out one second come here come toward me
we're gonna have someone pat you down
real quick
got one person who can pat him down not
gay jared there you go
i fulfilled my legal obligations
all right listen what's your name sarah
ian ian in brass balls come sit down
appreciate it give me your out of the
hand
[Music]
a round of a hand i don't even know what
that means all right
what was that actually by the way
by the way because i know many of you
here are still reeling from your
rejections from northwestern
um oh
don't insult or ban up come on that's
asking a sparrow not to sing
urbana champagne as we call it the gates
of hell
you're like detroit without the balls to
follow through all right
we're kidding but depaul actually has
rescinded their decision and we will be
going to depaul
sometime next semester and i'm kidding
urbana's the best city in america all
right
so i believe hopefully people can hear
me we're just going to sit down and and
go through this
point by point to see where we find
common ground uh it's the first time
we've ever broadcast it live a lot of
people say well we think maybe you edit
it
or hand pick opponents hey can not can
someone actually grab some water here
and give him a closed bottle so that you
know he doesn't uh
accuse us of opponents it is a really
nice moment they ordered mine like
four weeks wait you ordered one yeah
what that means you're a fan you can't
come up here no
no no i still have thoughts no you still
have thoughts no get out of here we have
to have someone else who disagrees
you can't be a fan who here actually
disagrees with me i appreciate it i
appreciate it brother
afterwards not evil though it's not it
is evil you this guy seems to be really
eager or this guy in the orange
all right
okay well let's bring up the guy in the
orange sorry
i know i know but listen we didn't plan
on this we have no idea we usually just
show up and do it and people want us
to get out what's your name sir alex
alex are you holding up did you go here
uh no i go to urbana high school oh alex
we got we can't do
hold on a second hold on a second if i
if i do this with a high school student
next thing that's going to happen is
they're going to laura ingram me and say
that i mocked someone who's not of age
are you 18 your parents have to give you
permission i can't i can't actually film
you i appreciate it alex i'm sorry
this guy come on let's bring this guy up
here i'm so sorry this is the process
we don't want to break the law
because we only have one officer who
showed up because that's all you need
for a crowd like this
all right what is your name sir yousef
yousef nice to meet you steven
so i believe let me explain my position
i believe that socialism
is fundamentally uh evil and i have this
here we usually don't reference this but
it's sources in case someone wants to
look at them afterward but
i don't think i won't use it it's not
fair for me to use them so i believe
socialism
is evil you disagree i would love to
hear you change my mind okay well what's
your position on the minimum wage
hold on a second uh is this your this is
you're changing my mind i want to make
sure yes i want to get started okay my
position the minimum wage yeah
uh you know what uh i'm not a fan so you
think there shouldn't be any minimum
wage at all
not a fan okay are you against illegal
immigration and legal immigration from
poor third world countries
at the scale that we've been having it
so far oh yeah
am i against illegal immigration the
answer what was that
but we're gonna do everything we can
like we said this is last minute because
uh
we're not necessarily friendly here uh
i'm again no i mean
they don't consider us friendly so like
i said we appreciate you supporting us
of course i'm against illegal
immigration but
again socialism i believe the idea of
socialism let's do this before we go on
okay
cause this is something and that's i
think this is important this is
something we often see from both the
right and the left
see we started with the premise where i
made a statement socialism is evil
right and you've moved on to different
questions different topics so i'd like
to first before we move on if you
if if it's okay let's define socialism
okay
how do you define socialism so i know
that we're agreeing on
on that premise socialism is a system in
which the state
redistributes wealth uh from what it
would be under a pure capitalist system
okay i think we agree on that okay and
then i think it's important
but don't give up this is just an actual
discussion i might be wrong here
um and what it what do you think i mean
by evil or what would we both agree
the definition of evil is harmful to
society
not necessarily to society i believe
morally reprehensible it's immoral okay
so so as we both agreed socialism is
basically a collective a governmental
control
of the distribution or product means of
distribution or production
and when i say evil i mean i believe
that that is immoral
so can we both agree with that i don't
agree that it's evil no no but we agree
you agree that's what i'm saying that's
my position yes okay so what part of my
position
do you disagree with again the goal here
is to change my mind not score points
well i'm trying to convince you that
your own objectives if you're a
conservative
cannot be achieved under capitalism okay
and so i'll give you an example of that
yeah um you have a lot of republicans
like paul ryan who are obstructing
donald trump
well hold on hold on
you cannot deny that he is a big
capitalist and he has lots of capitalist
donors that would like nothing more than
to increase their profits i think you
can agree with that
and people like that have been opposing
immigration reform for decades
because they believe that mass
immigration will lower the wages of the
working class
and increase their profits now i would
say a lot of what you just said is
correct
okay and that many uh conservatives
republicans believe
that mass immigration from countries
like say mexico
from quote-unquote third world countries
could lower the wages yeah i do believe
that a lot of republicans believe that
okay so i would agree with you on that
so if you impose a minimum wage you're
not going to have this mass immigration
coming in because the companies that are
taking these illegal immigrants and
taking these low-wage immigrants if they
had to pay them 15
an hour we wouldn't have mass
immigration like we're having right now
yeah i don't necessarily know that i
agree with that premise so let me kind
of go um
because first off before i would like to
take that hold it
what example we point to before we go on
because i know a lot of times i disagree
of a successful socialist country
well there are different kinds of
socialism i think you're thinking of the
soviet union in venezuela when you say
these are unsuccessful countries
but you also have sweden you have norway
you have finland you have denmark of
germany
these are countries that have robust
economies and high levels of
socialization
right uh what's their minimum wage
i don't have the numbers off the top of
my head what if i told you that they
have no minimum wage
there are plenty of countries at a high
minimum wage australia has a high
minimum wage i know but we didn't talk
about them we talked about
successful socialist economies now first
off i think it's interesting
this is important because we need to
find the premise first off we're away
from the premise which is the moral
argument
i believe socialism is immoral the
redistribution of something that you
have not earned
i believe is fundamentally immoral i
believe that's theft are you an anarchy
hold on a second hold on a second
then we'll go in so now we moved on from
that to the pragmatic and no i'm not an
anarchist
um and then you brought up some
successful examples in denmark norway
sweden i believe first off these aren't
socialist countries now the reason we
would point to countries like say
venezuela or cuba
for the same reason bernie sanders did
for decades is because they're true
examples of socialism
uh the danish prime minister said bernie
stop referring to us as a socialist
economy we're a free market economy
they don't have a minimum wage as we
know it they only allow collective
bargaining between unions
higher skilled unions and those who
their employers
so these are countries by the way if you
want to get into their immigration laws
the only way to make it work if you
refer to those countries i mean i guess
i would have to ask it sounds almost as
though you're making an argument are you
uh
are you a nationalist i would say i'm an
economic nationalist
you are an economic nationalist okay so
there goes you part ways with a lot of
probably your your more left-leaning
brethren
i never said i was a liberal okay so
you're a conservative socialist
they're they're hard to come back
so no minimum wage there but again this
doesn't change the idea let's get to the
fundamental premise yeah before we move
on to the pragmatic and i'd be happy to
but i believe that socialism the ism
that we both agreed upon
the collective means seizing of
distribution production
um is immoral well i mean the argument
is absurd because if you say that it's
immoral then you also have to say that
government funding of police is a moral
government funding of the military is
immoral anything the government does is
immoral and that's ridiculous because
you have to have some state that's going
to
socialize certain things and so the
question is not do we have socialization
it's how much
sure um i would disagree with that now
would you would you know where i
disagree with that
guess what i'm going to say i assume
you're going to try to argue that
government funding of the military and
police is not socialism
why would i say that uh well because if
you don't argue that then you're going
to have to give some ground
on socialism no absolutely i think
you're right if i if i have to concede
that
police force as he's saying police force
military
roads is socialism the same as health
care
education and i'm assuming that's why
you're referring to denmark and sweden
they're not socialist economies but they
have more of a social safety net
that's kind of what you're talking about
right yeah they're social democracies
they're well they're they're market
economies with
higher emphasis on a social safety net
that's how they describe that's what a
social democracy is
so so okay we agree on the term let's go
with social democracy i just want to
make sure we don't get confused like
democratic socialism so that changes
anything
but um we just talked about this uh
conceding that ground i don't believe
that the military
and the police force would be the same
as
socialized healthcare school why not
sorry because we only have one
microphone we had to do a late set up i
appreciate you working with me
well i mean why not why not was your
question our definition was so why not
yeah
okay so make sure you don't um why not
because there's a difference between a
public good
and a commodity can you explain to me
the difference between public goods and
a commodity
well in economics a public good is uh a
good that is i believe non-excludable
and non-rivalrous
so exactly so that would include things
like
the police the military you'd be
hard-pressed to even find hardcore
libertarians to say that we don't need
those
so there's a big difference there's a
fundamental difference between that
and something like healthcare or school
it's still or it goes to
none of these kids should be getting the
media attention that we're getting like
on we we aren't experts we don't have
all the solutions with you we don't have
that much time because our next guest is
a diva
well he's no David hog I'll tell you
that much I can follow him on the
Twitter at Kyle cash of of course a
student at Stoneman Douglas high a lot
of people don't remember the high school
that's how quickly news please parkland
Florida and we had him on the show and
ever since then he's now been
gallivanting around with all the other
important hosts and politicians Kyle how
are you sir yanari well I would have
been doing better if you'd have had a
pair of headphones anywhere in your
house I feel like I thought that was a
Power Move I don't do headphones I don't
kalakashi doesn't do headphones Kyle
Kashyap doesn't do headphones maybe
that's for that that's for those other
kids at the town halls how have you been
doing so you remember you know you you
did our show we talked about this quite
we talked about everything that had been
going on it was still really hot in the
news and ever since then I've been
seeing you you everywhere well yeah we
were ever in DC and I uh I got I got the
flu from Oh meeting all the politicians
yes yes it's called it's called the
swamp flu that's true
yeah it's a particular strain and it
makes you a little bastard yeah for some
reason you have you don't have it you're
fine you the healthy relationship with
your wife you get it all of a sudden
you're hitting on men installs and truck
stops it's a very weird flu but who have
you been so first off let me tell you
I've said this before I'm very
uncomfortable generally speaking with
the idea of having anyone young kinda
underage on the show because I hate how
they were politicized in the media but I
do think there's a difference here
because first off you were kind of
dragged into it a little unwillingly you
know you wanted and what you were doing
is the other students were out there
immediately on every single outlet that
you we could pop you could possibly
imagine and all you said was like hold
on a second they don't speak for all of
us and so I think ok since they're
expressing an opinion for everyone it's
necessary to have a voice of reason like
yourself so do you feel like that's how
most people see you do you feel you've
been embraced at least as a voice of
balance or how have you been I think
it's that's pretty much where I came
into like the entire debate as in like
let's kumbaya this don't send out let's
find a middle ground
and so now is basically when I came in
because a it was representing the
conservative point of view in the Second
Amendment but but also finding the
middle ground we did find the middle
ground and while everyone was protesting
and marching we talked to legislators
and we got the stops groans Act passed
known to the house that's gonna hit the
Senate get on the Omnibus and pass the
day before the March well there you go
cuz you so you met with some US senators
right
I don't yeah I remember that I remember
how many money the caviar you can't
imagine the money
this would have follow us were they so
you member what is this what your
timeout now you found a middle ground
what is what is the middle ground
legislatively what what are we looking
at and I know you've played in a claim I
mean it's her we're not gonna pass
anything they have with gun control okay
the fact in like the Congress so
practically was everything that can be
done preemptively
to stop shooter without like talking
about gun control okay because I don't
even think gun control is the issue in
this debate it's clear like looking
factually gun control won't solve
anything so what we push we push the
stop school Act which lets teachers it
gives the funding for better recognition
of kids who do have these issues that
our treatment of these kids um better
development of technology at schools
itself and better communication between
the FBI in the schools right exactly and
that's important by the way that doesn't
even that doesn't necessarily get into
the territory what you're talking about
of hey you
you took a xanax so now you can't buy a
gun because of mental health issues
because that's why when we spoke oh
saying it was this idea was also way too
broad and we had we had done in a little
bit on something specific and and this
seems like this seems like a good start
and you're saying this is going to pass
the day before the March you believe
that if everything goes according to
plan they already passed the house
practically unanimous so what what will
this do for let's say let's walk us
through a scenario and I first often I
just find this thing I don't know I'm so
tickled that that that David hog is
everywhere he's like the NRA practically
threatened us but because I said they
don't like you he's out there on every
single show and at the same time
kyle is here any action legislation that
might make it the day before the March
the day before the pine final PR stand
they might already be up crap Creek so
let's go through a specific example
let's say a kid is really disturbed
exhibiting signs
what would this legislation allow for
for example we're help with that
wouldn't that we don't have right now in
place I mean right now right now
practically a little installation that
does is that it allows it teaches
teachers and our officers and students
how to properly identify these kids
okay hen reports into the proper
authorities because that right now a
teacher can't really do anything as of
right now and in teaching and like
educating these teachers on what to do
when they do meet a kid who has these
issues is a good step in the right
direction because honestly what happened
at my school could have been averted
like it could have been major that
wouldn't have happened had like people
followed the legislation in place
already right that well and and now this
is to strengthen that so how do you
identify someone I guess how do you how
do you ensure that it isn't and I know
listen I'm expect to have all the
answers because I know it listen your
your your younger chap well know what it
does is it doesn't here's a difference
it gives the funding to the states and
then the state's it's up to the states
to create the systems and to create the
programs to teach the teachers okay so
like the federal government what I've
been like very supportive I don't want
to see the federal government telling
the states what to do mm-hmm I think
it's up to the stage yeah so it gives
some money to the states and then the
state's decide what they want to do with
it they decide in what different aspects
of the bill the money needs to go to
right I can already see the backlash
from that this is gonna be a problem in
states are gonna just take that money
and they're gonna give it to the rich
oil buddies that's that's what they're
gonna say and then you're gonna be on
the hook for Halliburton Kyle do you
want to be on the hook for Halliburton
I forgot the bush the Bush years are for
in him imagine that growing up in
America where you really didn't go crazy
do you remember George W Bush as
president or is that where you just were
you too young to remember that
no okay I uh yeah see I grew up and that
was my high school years where you
probably grew up in a high school years
were everything Barack Obama did was
amazing I grew up in the high school
years were everything george w bush did
just everyone was I wouldn't
oh you know anything and then barack
obama happened and i was out of high
school and i no longer wanted to swallow
a knife every day so i one thing that it
does that I get concerned about as we
talk about like identifying students
listen high school for a lot of people
can be a really really depressing place
so yeah run into it so how do you know
you how do you differentiate or how do
we expect them to be handling reporting
different you know a kid who just says
like oh man I hate my life
I'd rather die than take the math test
versus some kid who's like this is that
these are the school plans and we're
make sure I wear this vest you know how
do we make sure that the it's
differentiated and not used as a tool
right where you just go hey that kid is
could shoot up to school and then he
gets on a crap list the kid is not
because it's really like it's a specific
specific matter it's the same thing of
like having the legislative and saying
that if you're mentally like disturb you
should be able to acquire weapon it's
the same debate of like being able to
properly identify the person they're not
overreacting I don't know so this is
more so about correcting the breakdown
in communication that happens between
like a state level you know they don't
really have it's about what every state
deems necessary what games like what
they want to do to ensure this won't
happen again
yeah and like in like a very like subset
group of what they're allowed to do and
it's very proud the group they can like
choose to go and like technology they
can choose to them it's a better the
communication between the FBI they can
work on like apps of reporting it's all
up to the states right yeah
well listen we've seen it when when I'm
in states with education tend to do
better than a one big federal
bureaucracy in Washington DC you know
what I loved is I just asked you the
question he said I don't know you know
who would never say don't know David
Hogg yeah have you ever heard David Hogg
say I don't know I don't think anyone
has really followed up on any questions
that's actually okay that's good that's
what we call a segue Colin you didn't
even realize cuz I was gonna be my next
question do you see any specific plans
other than NRA sucks and ban all
semi-automatic weapons like we saw at
CNN Town Hall do you see any concrete
legislative plans from your peers people
like David hog people who are in this
now now this is exactly happened in
school I talked to kids okay like what
you're right okay tell me anything you
want what do you propose and none of
them gave me anything nothing I talked
to it like so many periods today I'm
like like what do you propose like what
do you want to do like even if I don't
agree with you just what do you want to
see happen and none of them gave me an
answer and like it's practically the
same thing with the March to different
things with the March um there are
people in the March that saying that we
don't take away your guns I remember
David Hawk saying we don't wanna take
away your guns but specifically on the
website if you if you can you can pull
it up right now and scroll down it says
that you know one should be able to have
an assault rifle so there is a gun Genda
going on here and it is quite of
somewhat of an anti gun marks right it's
like no once again and I don't film the
actual legislative changes other than
that that are they're actually being
pushed all I hear is marching marching
is fine a few interactive ISM and we
raising awareness but you actually want
legislative change I talked with
legislators and you proposed something
nothing's being proposed right that's a
really very interesting point
first off when you say you spoke with
people today I know it wasn't David hug
cuz I saw him on the telly so I know
that he's not there he's too but he's
he's basically tutored onset Leonardo
DiCaprio and What's Eating Gilbert Grape
he's just on set and he's like alright
I'll I'll just get my GED got bigger
things to do
no that's a good point because and I
said we don't to take away your guns
just assault rifles well just assault
weapons well what's an assault weapon
and then you look into legislation and
it's basically all weapons other than
revolvers and pump-action shotguns it's
every hand it's every stubble stack
Glock it's every Walther our sponsor
there that you would use for personal
defense outside of the peace it's it's
the majority or certainly plurality now
I would actually absolutely say majority
majority of guns that people would use
for self-defense
so there you go that's exactly the point
they just so what defines an assault
rifle like you tell me what defines an
assault rifle it doesn't mean anything
well they said I think they just say
assault weapons anyone's all right
because I saw a weapon of war yeah yes
and by the way I know about the war
because I've been tat I've been tattered
by the war of dead Johnny Mathis a Don
Lemon on Ceres you guys mean tweets mean
tweets the NRA threatened to kill me no
way ha I got a pretty pretty sure no one
threatened to kill you they just said
that you were wrong sorry I know you
have to go back to school with him but
you know it's it's it's it's
uncomfortable and this is what I say
there's a very different approach
you get asked the question you say well
I don't know David Hogg knows everything
only there's no actual legislation there
are no propositions there whereas you've
met with legislators it is a
quintessential example I mean I'd
further on that and further I'm saying
that especially in the Town Hall that no
one further up on the questions when key
people said like stuff then we're like
outrageous no one followed through
saying like no that's not true or on
there like they say false false of on
live television no one falls through her
like questions then yeah at all yeah
well it doesn't good that's a good point
because they try to say that that I
member Dana lash didn't do that where
she what's the name of the girl looks
like the the Minority Report Oracle
shaved head you know who I'm talking
about she what's your schema Emma yeah
he probably the crushing on one point so
the point is she was up there and she
she goes don't say no on air because her
friends are gonna come after you the
chain gang and and so she goes dana lash
what of the inner I think she said low
so she you know she didn't do a research
on the name should what are you going to
do are you willing to stand up right now
and say that no one should own
semi-automatic it was something broad
enough where she basically included the
word semi-automatic weapons we can
probably people can go watch the clip
ain't it not fully set me ah yeah and I
fully semi-automatic and Dana lash
answers that listen what happened here
was a travesty this should not have
happened
this person definitely should not have
had a firearm so she was trying to find
middle ground and the girl goes you're
not answering my questions will you make
sure that no one has access to a
semi-automatic and everyone started
cheering him on a second she just
actually answered your question about
the Knicks background check what went
wrong here
all the red flags but you're saying
she's not answering your question unless
she commits right they're taking an oath
you know on the CNN spec sheet to ban
all semi-automatic weapons and she
doesn't know what semi-automatic is the
leading questions there and they cheer
but like you said no one ever questioned
them on it and that's a police officer
the sheriff the sheriff the sheriff it
would have been his job to say well hold
on sorry sorry sweetheart what what you
mean to say is you mean these
high-capacity specific rifles cuz cuz
the gun I have on my hip here's or not
that's a semi-automatic so you don't
mean to include that but no one followed
up yeah do you follow up and when you're
at school - please tell me you do I
think what do you mean like in school
all the things that we can't say that
we can't follow up do you do it for us
like you walk in honk oh I don't I
haven't talked to like any really one of
them like in school when I do as I like
to base with my friends like not my
friends but kids in class it might it
might don't turn it to the base with my
friends they're just straight-up
arguments in yelling because well I like
kids in my class before all this
happened I spoke with okay two kids from
like two leaders from the never again
movement and they told me that they want
to ban a fully automatic assault rifles
it advances 93 for sorry and then they
come on three like we want to bend all
all assault rifles and they couldn't
define them assault rifle is or like
which specific one so like it's an
indication that they truly don't know
right what they're talking about and
then it's specifically at school you
know um I would talk to kids and I would
say look you what do you want to do
they're like we have to been assault
rifles and I hit them with the statistic
and then they're like I don't like how
you tweet Kyle okay you're a damn what
yeah it's how you tweet it okay
how should I you do is that tell them
here's what you do repeat the fact and
say okay you know five hundred thousand
to three million defensive uses of
firearms each year the vast majority of
public shootings not committed by rifles
or quote unquote assault weapons assault
rebels of any kind how should I tweet it
ask them that no I can't tweet I'm
saying for you you I'm living
vicariously no I'm saying just tell ask
them say how should I tweet it and okay
that's that's actually very cute yeah
they would probably get to say they
probably would be like don't tweet it
exactly so that's that that once comes
down to they just don't want to hear
different points of view period I mean
it was the biggest factual evidence that
I just constantly say is that three
percent of all gun crimes with an
assault rifle sixty percent of those are
suicides and the majority is gang
violence and criminal activity right
well you don't the way even isn't even
an issue then you just say the same
thing the 1994 to 2004 clock like was
been proved inconclusive for actually
having an assault weapons ban I hate to
correct but because that's important
because assault rifle in the military
men
capable of burst fire assault weapons
doesn't mean anything and that includes
handguns with you know scary triggers so
they say assault rifles but the
legislation is assault weapons which
would ban handguns as well and that's
the point they don't even care that
because at the end game if you look at
the legislation
it's just they want to ban handgun oh
this is the 1994 2004 it was it was salt
weapons weapon was yeah yeah yeah it was
it was really really silly and it
included all kinds of magazine it
affected handguns and everything as well

be getting this video back up somehow if
you're watching on YouTube and you
missed the video join my club you can
watch it there anything else is there
for now they're threatening us with the
legal action but we don't follow
YouTube's policy we follow the actual
law we follow the law YouTube
Fall Out Boy has announced an anti-gun
concert for the March for our lives
rally with Pete Wentz claiming we want
to be the soundtrack for gun control
so do we please everyone when you think
of modern-day when you think of the
modern-day gun control movement suddenly
think of these guys so do we actually
says nothing to do with their lack of
relevance for the last decade no yes
accounting nothing no you're right yes
fallout but when it comes to saying no
to guns and gun related imagery you'll
be number one with a bullet a loaded gun
complex it and pull it in your
mouth we will sort of count it to make
sure that you are the face of the gun
control mood by the way in the least
surprising news of the day a baker from
France has been fined 3000 euros for
working too much a baker from the small
town of losing either Don's in your vows
and I'm French I can't read it in
northeastern France was fined 3,000
euros for working seven days a week the
law imposing a weekly day of rest for
all workers but said toothache aveva
have kept his bakery open all week in
the summer of 2017 hem and we got a
scoop I think I actually think to
discuss this because it's confusing to a
lot of Americans is um the ambassador to
the United States ambassador French
thank you for being here sir yes of
course
Stephen so you find this man 3,000 euros
just for working on a Sunday
do I guess well you see he broke the law
you can't work seven days a week that is
the law in France and without laws we
are just like you see just like the
animals this interesting I thought
France was largely secular so enforcing
the Sabbath laws was surprising to me
I'm sorry what was that this the Sabbath
laws no no your confuses there are no
sad baths in France because here in
France we don't take baths little on the
nose no Sabbath the day of rest you
don't work on the Sabbath oh okay no
yeah I understand now this law does not
come from some archaic religion no no no
no no you see it's because we are how
you say lazy okay thank you mr.
ambassador French I contribute nothing
Stephen I know thank you
I wish that would have gone better but I
didn't expect it to it's about like this
week and Oklahoma mom there's other news
and we're going to be talking about some
more legal issues with social home in
India I feel like we need to Oklahoma
watch at this point now I think we need
more of an India watch more of India
watch for sure I know watches to have at
this point really well except they don't
have watches in India the technology
isn't really there waiting for that well
not only the watches the wheel hasn't
gotten there so if they sell watch they
would know what to do with it and banned
in Oklahoma mom who actually once
married her son this is a real story
will now go to jail for marrying her
daughter this comes from WFA for her
part in marrying her daughter two years
after she was legally allowed to contact
her children following in an old
marriage to her biological son Patricia
span will serve time in jail so the
interesting part is a detaining officer
released a statement that Patricia span
will receive quote eight years probation
for the crime of felony incest then he
clarified the crime of felony lesbian
incest and he was immediately banned
from Twitter first upon hearing the news
Farah Khan himself blamed the filthy
Jews yeah that's not a that's an actual
Twitter that's verified it's not liable
for his account no one took over his
with them Twitter tested Jack approved
yeah there's a chick with some serious
daddy / broader issue Dean came fans
they both had Superman shirts on did
they they did in the picture they just
think we have a super relationship it's
gonna serve eight years for felony
incest but save a ton on last name
paperwork that's true why can't you just
marry your son like a decent person
sorry start doing that lesbian things
got out of hand
you need a tweet we are not animals
ki brother is perfectly good just right
your grandpa had a flipper your Pappy
had a flipper for him United Airlines by
the way accidentally flew a German
Shepherd to Japan instead of Kansas yeah
that's a story comes from Newsweek cuz
when cross window arrived at Kansas City
Airport the family went to cut the cargo
facility to pick up at any old German
Shepherd
ergo instead of their dog the swindle
family were handed a Great Dane who was
scheduled to fly to Japan wait his
family's in Kansas and he's in Japan
wait his family's in Kansas and he the
luck of that dog to land his ass in the
one agent country that doesn't see him
is fine cuisine you could have so easily
been rerouted to Vietnam China or Korea
or Thailand or Indonesia I think that
Disney film would be all dogs go to
kettle and then Tommy learn would kick
them what's what's the story Tommy one
kicked same computer you were telling me
that's Tommy one kicked the dog
she's now denying it but you had the
video on a social media saying that she
kicked her dog because the dog
interrupted her doing an interview on
Fox & Friends
so she rating she she read it away yeah
she did she shoot away she said I had to
kick you five times oh five time and you
know there's video graphic evidence
because they have the leg cam yeah this
is the one time a producer in the
control room at Fox is going get off the
white chair get up get down off
like though the other no no notnot
the dog dog get the dog are you saying
want to see your gams no I'm saying the
opposite of that
I'm confused I don't understand what
don't you want this is literally the
first time I've ever ever words in that
order out of your mouth sorry Tommy
sorry watch this show this was sent to
her if it's not banned Ford is now by
the way for go out there we want to do a
public service Ford is recalling 1.4
million cars which you know sometimes is
like because the sometimes they're
problems a brake pad you sometimes you
have a circuit board that's because
steering wheels are coming off seems
important yeah kind of pivotal see this
is what I hate the idea of be American
where was Abby American Baia Mare and
I've always be American buy the best and
and sometimes the best is an
american-made okay sometimes even that
sometimes american-made can
you may see the boy that's american-made
steel that is from American union
workers American man you can't put a
price on our simple art in the White
House
I'll obey that waiting I will be done I
guess also Lincoln's by the way we
should do that if for anyone who's out
there actually taking this I imagine the
worst part of this whole thing is having
the air to plug deploy deploy a new Air
drag I don't know I don't know I guess
this is a new this is the new safety
device that we haven't heard of yeah
it'll be because Ford just put it in
there instead of a steering wheel
all right listen do you know what can I
do we usually do a meat segment we get
any we have a ton of research and this
has been a stressful week for people who
don't know I've been Twitter banned for
the video we sent it by the way fun
computer thank you for going to need a
great job with that really I think you
did a great job for people who want to
watch it go to mug Club did you guys
mind if I take take a fitting that's
usually we go we go into something we
say let's dive into a topic and people
use it to to educate themselves and
educate their professors and use it to
rebut maybe Vox on gun control so we ask
you a question first off because we've
been dealing with it this week do you
feel there's a generation gap between
those in the social media fray right now
the ones who are obviously censoring
different points of view right of center
points of view and the old conservative
guard because that's what I've been
running into I have not been as upset
what you expect this from the left
people been saying for example that
Twitter and YouTube they shouldn't have
banned the video but then we've had a
lot of conservatives this week who've
been criticizing us saying well sure it
was entertaining but really how
constructive was it I wrote I wrote I
read somebody writing that it was
entertaining but was it constructive to
send in some computer to the gender
nonconforming it was entertaining but
was it constructive you just answered
your own damn question the point you
missed it was it exactly was energy
that's the point you're talking by the
way to the creators have changed my mind
were millions upon millions of plays of
nothing more than me sitting down with a
stool in enemy territory being bombarded
and trying to be as constructive as
humanly possible by the way this is a
late night show do you think anyone has
ever asked
I don't know how constructive it is for
Carson to do there's old tarp it I don't
know how constructive Letterman's top 10
is you know we don't want to be
constructive all the time so that's what
they say if you're talking about we're
talking about the banning we're talking
about the legal issues we'll talk more
about that with bill Richman after
you're either in or you're out you
understand how this works or you don't
whether you whether you support the idea
of the content or not and these concerns
we run into you guys all the time you
 and you say why does Jimmy Kimmel
get to use his platform for politics I'm
not gonna tune in to the Oscars but you
know why because he spent years being
entertaining if people are going to hold
us to that standard where every single
thing we say has to be like Rush
Limbaugh's cheering on Dear Leader let
me you were not the show for you was it
constructive it was hysterical
I pissed myself laughing and if that's
what determines whether you support us
or these people support us not in
fighting these behemoths of fascist
censorship bastions about all ism okay
then piss off don't want your show how's
that for constructive I expect this I
expect this from the left I expect them
to try and silence us but the see
conservatives going well I would support
you if you didn't do something that was
a could it be a little more constructive
could it be a lecture by the way as far
as constructive there's a reason this
video was removed the left understands
the scope of what we're doing okay the
old stick-in-the-mud right vanguard has
no idea you bet your ass the left thinks
it's constructive that's why they had a
hair-trigger double-barreled machine gun
ready for all of the platforms to remove
this video because they realize how
constructive it was in making the left
looking like the silly lgbtq a AIP too
spirited dumbasses that they are that's
why we don't like to talk about our
numbers we don't go out and brag that's
not what we're based on we've been
focusing on content creating more
content than ever but we cannot hire
people fast enough to keep up with the
growth which is a blessing and for which
we are eternally grateful but that's
because we were too busy being
unconstructive while you were
sermonizing to 85 year old geriatrics
who want to stock up on self lubricating
pocket catheters the left understands
how dangerous we are and all they do is
run a clip of the latest consumed by the
way the latest ranked the latest concern
right or got you segment on Fox and
Friends they just run on the view and go
see ha they just run the latest NRA clip
and go see they don't even need to rebut
it they just hit play and laugh if you
think that's constructive that's what
they do to conservatives constructive
content but it's just like what we do on
the flip side with Samantha bee or
Trevor Noah
we don't need to rebut it there there
unfunniest is their own rebuttal now
guess who these leftist sites never roll
us our content will get falls more play
this is a table break what content will
get fooled war plays then these hosts on
the left then the kimmells then the Seth
Meyers
then the Jimmy Fallon's with a fraction
and I mean fraction of the staff and I
mean a fantastic staff but we are
talking pennies on the dollar when
you're talking about higher ease
employees and the left doesn't play it
oh here's the thing they try to remove
it behind the seams they Twitter BAM
like you saw they Facebook throttle they
try to get dozens of videos removed from
our channel on YouTube we deal with this
all the time but they never ever utter
the phrase or the words louder with
Crowder for the left were like Candyman
they're afraid if they say our name
three times in the mirror will show up
and rape them with their own power tools
mind you their own power tools of
entertainment and comedy and by the way
we will we will show up and sexually a
cost level speaking of this
metaphorically of course
the left I'm speaking metaphorically of
course we will show up we will do this
and we do it we do so many things we
have a lawyer on retainer to fight this
every dollar you give us every dollar
you spend that goes into mud club goes
into providing more free content and
making sure that the path is still open
for you we're not like the Sarah
Silverman's we're not like the Amy
Schumer's we're not like the shock jock
comics who go up and they do a bunch of
dirty jokes and then they say you know
what you really shouldn't say gay we
opened the door behind us and we hope
that you can draft in and we do it for
you yeah you know it's been a really
stressful week hell it's been a really
stressful year but only for the
stressful week for us just as much
really I would say more so because of
the old conservative guard as it's been
for the left trying to silence us which
is why we're so grateful for people like
you who do watch and who do share and
who do do join over there mush watch I
said you watch there's gonna be another
daily storm or thing and then other
teachers are trying to be banned from
SMU this week it's been Twitter it's
been YouTube it's been Facebook which
you don't even know about it's been
South by Southwest you bet your
ask that we've had a rough go but every
dollar we get from you joining Mudd Club
that we get from you supporting the
sponsors buying the merch we'll go to
fighting this with everything we got
because despite the fact we have a
giant-ass target on our back we know
that you have ours and who cares if the
old stodgy Republicans don't have your
back we do we do this is where we are
this week it's been stressful but it's
also been a relief let me ask you do you

those web-based security ads for the
short-end money I got you in the myspace

[Music]
with you that is the sound of the
weekend it's a Thursday live stream Jim
Norton and Ben Shapiro on Today Show
also today's show brought to you by
hoppers trim it all I blew my back when
I blew him back and I have a ruptured
disk and I didn't warm up properly today
doing deadlifts was so loud that the guy
who cried Jim heard a popular you hurt

leave me in video studio as always as
Jaron who is now gay follow him on

conclusions are we good I'm not a meme
it's my goal and at G Morgan G but you
took the picture and I just eat him up
for new still look it simplified we're
not gonna hire you jail what's one of
the day done well we've got the lorenz
Perrier like just a little baby bottle
here for ya hey fan computer with the
overlays ready no seriously hopper I've
found this how to ask the vet an
armistice at the CVS is it yeah it's the
same paint it seems like it's the same
paint does it cost less I don't know but
these pills expired in like 2016 which
is a good thing it's a good it's a good
thing because it shows that I'm not an
addict I don't know if it's an opiate or
opioid watch your rock you start but the
bad thing is I took that it's very years
ago most to your point the latter most
comedians cannot claim they have that
you know two year old pills wolf of
wallstreet is gonna hit you a question
of the day is do you think we're going
to talk about this obviously in light of
the West Virginia story do you think
public schoolteachers are woefully
underpaid that seems to be the the
acceptance among society today I
disagree all right why are you laughing
because that statement is so hilarious
all we do is pay them more you don't
deserve it in the world is teaching I'd
say killing bin Laden news of the day
McDonald's is flipping its trademark
arches upside down to honor women on
hashtag International Women's Day
really McDonald will flip its logo
upside down to form a W on all digital
channels including its Instagram and
Twitter feeds and a hunter restaurants
will have special packaging crew shirts
and hats and bag stuffers for honest so
grab them by the gold
arches and jumping on the feminist
bandwagon of course Wendy herself will
also be going topless oh you know
Chipotle just shamelessly released a
taco bowl with 50% less Listeria that's
almost tasteless and not related to
women's day I don't know who's gonna go
over well off for feminists because I
think that I think McDonald's is half
the reason they're gelatinous and single
so I don't think they're gonna buy ounce
that now by the way with the W consent
in there they're not gonna buy it
because they've already bought a lot of
it 1 billion served that could read okay
800 million feminists served the rest is
a take a guess but a world by way this
was fascinating every now and then you
get a story that's just a fill the
world's oldest message in a bottle was
found by a beach walker in Australia
comes from The Guardian the bottle have
been thrown overboard from a German
sailing ship in 1886 Wow across the
Indian Ocean there did you know this
this come from a German story spin
computer I don't think so that's why you
don't get to plug your Twitter he's not
even ready want to go luckily the
discovery of the message in a bottle was
caught on tape
[Applause]
it's the international language the
universe is telling you that if Trudeau
had collected that someone would be sued
yeah although I hate hit the
notification bell if you're watching on
YouTube because subscribing doesn't mean
anything anymore so if you want to be
notified of our videos and not have the
Google of Lord stop it you'll hit the
back a woman was arrested for attempted
I'm gonna talk about public school
teachers but this is a story that's more
important a woman was arrested for
attempting to trick Albuquerque
authorities yesterday when she claims
she had a prescription for medical
marijuana and suspicions were all but
confirmed when she informed them that
her copay would be toothless blopps it
can be speaking a bunch of new study
shows that marrying your first cousin is
not as bad as we thought it was
conducted over seven years by a data
scientist and Columbia University and it
shows that it's okay to marry your first
cousin as long as your children do not
marry their first cousins mmm yeah just
come up somewhere yeah yes third cousin
Andy oh by the way fun fact
20 states today still allow cousin
marriage and we'll talk about them West
Virginia is not amongst them that's
that's hilariously surprising it's the
forbidden fruit of theirs yes that's
where they do the lie really West
Virginia here's the thing now here's the
fun extra bump act as sexual
relationships with said cousin totally
permissible Hans if M can be there can
you fact check there's that true yes
that is true okay that is so sexual
relation allowed with your cousins in
Virginia but not married oh hey hey you
make an honest woman out of her you
divorce her
and bangin on the side that's what
separates us from the beasts of the sea
stringing her along would just be
indecent it would just
torchy commit don't you commit way the
fact that someone at Columbia took seven
years to study this is he to watch list
somewhere probably so they came back as
a peer-reviewed make it just can't be
two generations down he's got a first
cousin I liked her taking his rights
first and do passes later for him grab
my the golden arches Israel is in the
process by the way of building a Jewish
Disneyland oh good designed by rabbis
and it's as fun as it sounds
the very company high-tech it tech is
planning a theme park based on Jewish
values and it will feature Torah themed
rides Jewish cultural cuisine and a Fast
Pass Lane actually for patrons to

how are you first by the way not a
country just so you know but always
trying to keep up this development is
prompted Palestine to break ground on
their new theme park six over Gaza Strip
yeah look at all the children having fun
and they're humans and they're human
shield that was almost immediate that
happened fast
firing an ak-47 we have Jim Norton will
be honest gonna be relaxed day because
am i doing what the pain pills by the
way I'm getting better or is that from
no one here who tomatoes Carter so
here's one thing I wanted to talk about
today we've talked about it on the show
but haven't really gotten in depth I
know I'm gonna get some flack for this
us place the question of the day many
people have the idea in their head that
schoolteachers are severely underpaid
public servants where do they get that
month here is the fact that teachers are
just going to have to keep accepting
lower salaries despite the importance of
our job of their job but we as a society
of decided that teaching is not that
important it's only because we make that
decision we're the taxpayers we're the
ones who decide how much the teachers
get and we won't pay them not only don't
we pay teachers what they deserve to be
paid in other countries that have better
test scores than ours you hear about
that all the time actually teachers get
paid much more on an even standard with
professionals or engineers and in other
walks of life although some do tell you
my sister by the way how's your brother
teaching actually pays pretty you're the
truth they actually paid pretty well and
so one thing I know it's unpopular
scipios it's the most important job no
not really
it's really not by the way you know are
we paying are we paying Eloy Clinton's
hairstylist on a curve what is going on
it just seems like you go back in
history like oh it was always bad yeah
he's never changed wasn't ladies they go
through that crossover age I was like
I'm just gonna cut it short now and do
this sort of flock of seagulls she's
always done that it's like Taco Bell to
keep revamping it but it still just says
the same exact thing yeah so teachers
are actually paid well let me lay the
case up for you no I'm not saying the
teachers too aren't important they
shouldn't be paid what they're worth
that is not what I'm saying
hold your comments let's compare them
first to other government workers school
jobs okay some of the better paying ones
out there see this first chart from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics they received
more than two times the benefits of
employees in the private sector by the
way the average public school teacher
comes to us I think national view more
than double the benefits package
received by typical workers well private
sector so when we take the benefits into
account overall compensation is actually
higher than private sector teachers
which listen shouldn't surprise you
obviously yeah public dole they're gonna
be paid more than private teachers yeah
they don't do better by the way test
scores aren't better now well here's
something we haven't even
yet we've compared to the other
government workers to private private
school teachers they only make nine they
only worked nine months out of the year
yeah yeah there's only thing nobody
talks when we talk about what they're
paid so the average salary for a public
school teacher is about fifty-seven
thousand dollars okay not nothing that's
a lot
no it's but if we prorate that for
working twelve months not even clued in
the benefits by the way instead of nine
teachers will be making seventy six
thousand dollars seventy six thousand
dollars well above the average salary by
the way for workers with a college
degree so if we're gonna do that because
I don't want it well you can't these
people they go to college okay let's not
just compare them to McDonald's worked
or 5 or 15 it is higher than the average
college degree worker and in line with
the median salary for workers with
master's degrees or higher she's seventy
seven thousand dollars by the way
something else it doesn't matter what
your test scores are doesn't matter how
your students are doing you're paid that
amount and they're nearly impossible to
fire even if they suck you'd have to be
given the Kevin Spacey treatment to your
students time yes I for them to even
consider getting you out of a rubber
room and then it'll take you about a
year and a half to two years to go yes
yeah well you're gonna say something
yeah so I I think it's it's just
absolutely seen I had never heard that
clip by the way that you played at the
beginning when they were saying the
teachers just accept lower and lower pay
lower pay like I just I just laughed out
loud because I'm like I didn't even know
that was out there in the narrative
okay listen so here's what's gonna
happen this year we're not I know you
were expecting a 12% we're gonna give
you a two-and-a-half percent raise this
year you're cutting our pay yeah it's
actually called the race and every
single time that this this argument
comes up to like it's for the children
it's for the children
our scores are terrible we do nothing
but throw money at the problem we spend
what we're like ranked fifth in the
world and spending per student 40% more
than other OECD countries out there and
you're telling me that you need to raise
teachers and you still suck are you
serious where else listen I'm sorry that
the overlays were not prepared I'm sorry
the sketches were edited but um I feel I
can't fire me just what was it waiting
for Superman was the film about and they
talked about in New York right so yeah a
long time ago this filmmaker was a
leftist but was a lipstick lad and they
jumped all over the film
because it showed kind of corruption of
teachers unions yeah by the way once
about money in politics I always talk
about big oil Koch brothers not even
close to the money being bandied about
by public sector unions yeah Jews are a
big one in it I'm some thing which
bumper stickers you see all the time I
know I've talked about this ad nauseam
this idea that we're spending more on
the military than tits like this paltry
sum that's left them no actually our
total spending on education is 946
billion dollars annually compared to
eight hundred and thirty five billion
for military including by the way
veteran care ok so it's important to
note that just the bumper sticker
doesn't necessarily it's not accurate
no they're skewing the step because
eighty-five percent roughly comes from
state and local governments not federal
by the way all of your parents people
watching they all went to school before
there was a National Department of
Education there okay and the test scores
are fine
some would say they're almost easier to
employ than Malloy yeah you want to see
the pay rate pay rate go for teachers
get rid of public education
tomorrow complicate completely get rid
of it well get rid of no get rid of the
federal Department of Education but it
states no get the state's out of it sell
all the land let private companies come
in have a base for people who can't
afford to go and watch how people can
now instead of paying property tax that
goes towards it okay so you're talking
out of school like I scrolled out your
program
no I'm saying get rid of the schools
yeah yeah yeah well so they can't yeah
exactly so the poor poor family even
there though you don't have to go that's
you don't even go that far you can still
keep public education in the states
allow them to do it and give the kids a
voucher so they can take it to at least
but right now we have an educational
system where you have no choice
whatsoever you have it just depends on
your zoning district teachers can't be
fired and our test scores suck and we're
spending more on this than our nuclear
arsenal
by the way our military up also needs to
it needs to hold up the star wars
defense system for Canada the Germans
aren't that what are the Germans given
the knate knate Oh aren't they skimping
on the bill there don't they owe more
than they've been paying no comment yeah
comment when it comes to plug in his
social media that's right when it comes
to shaming his country and rightfully so
nothing all right so according to CNN
actually West Virginia now they ranked
there this is the big
havelis for the story because I just got
a 5% raise okay
West Virginia is a great example this is
in the news recently they ranked 48th in
the nation in terms of how much they pay
their teachers so people go well okay
they're long overdue until you realize
they ranked 51st in SAT scores which
when I first read it I thought that must
be a typo no there are marvelous where
else do you rank below the number of
Rights and it's legit West Virginia they
ranked 48th in terms of 51st for SAT
scores so I actually say that's pretty
generous in any case here to discuss it
with us is Jed our West Virginia
Teachers Union correspondent Jed can you
hear us yes yes sure I can hear you
great okay so Jed so what do you say to
the skeptics out there critics who say
the 5% raise was unwarranted considering
your state already is 48 for pay but
51st for SAT scores that's huge that's
that dead last Jed if you work all right
no no say I'm afraid you're mistaken
Stephen if you do the arithmetic now
hold on
if you Adams together you got the 48 and
/ - 51 even that's not things Jed I
think oh no hold on hold on together now
if you put in together uh and you you
subtract the numbers supposed to be uh
you realize the disparity wage gap
painting of thanks Stephen I'm afraid
you're mistaken okay how's that well now
hold on hold on I am 45 46 and together
yeah two hundred forty six thousand
hundred Stephen which is pretty much
what I figured
I don't know paid and dimes yeah no I'm
entirely positive that's wrong well it's
not my fault my phone didn't do the flop
there's been no update there's not been
an absolutely been an update David I
don't get it not at all not even close
no I've taken afraid you're mistaken
okay Jed so listen you're ranked dead
last your schools are strained budget
wise as it is so you and your fellow
teachers are getting erased logic says
that the money's got to come from
somewhere do you know what they're going
to be cutting to make up for it or where
do you think they should that's all you
care about Stephen as cuts cuts cuts cuz
we don't need any more cuts the day our
air for C to host a bake sale the fun
enable tschappat teachers get the bunny
they deserve French you'll be a bright
day for our American Alison
oh good good what's out I'm gonna get my
home and leave
okay Jed our West Virginia's teachers
union correspondent will be up after
this with Ben Shapiro more pleasant
[Music]
now like any commercial break this
announcement is for fans of the louder
with Crowder program the viewers
listeners and downloaders joined under
the umbrella of comedy I hope a lot of
some of what's been said you're kinda
racist I'm cool with it that's a little
bit racist latest installment of real
conversations changed my mind the full
unedited interview will be coming up
soon I know that's why you tune in these
these are our segments where we have
full unedited uncut interviews usually
involving a topic that's somewhat
controversial just to prove that you can
have conversations with people and
sometimes Minds can be changed and
sometimes you can part ways and
sometimes there's nothing productive
happens sometimes nothing productive
happens and today's a little bit
different because this comes from when
we were at TCU we were doing the mail
privileges of myth which turned into a
meme changed my mind
and then I sat down with a couple of
people they were very beautiful and have
a conversation that day it was one of
our less productive changed my mind days
they wanted to go to the the white
privilege thank you so well sure you
interpreted the sign is saying white
male privilege yes white male privilege
either that was a thing and we'll show
you that in a bit and that's what
actually spawned a conversation between
a black gentleman and an Asian gentleman
they prefer Orientals they do not agree
with the previous black girl who was
talking about white male privilege and
how I was not entitled to an opinion so
we'll get she was trying to speak on
behalf of all all black men yeah exactly
in this black guy said like I don't
agree with that and so he came up and he
spoke and he sat down they talked about
cultural differences with us you'll see
this this Asian gentleman there and it
was it was really fun this is not really
an argument and actually I think the
black guy was a fan so full disclosure
so that it's not that what you're used
to but I just thought it was something
really cool was an organic conversation
that warranted a watch and I will say
this with it with the real conversations
that changed my mind segments we've been
very happy overall with what will we say
70% positive maybe Larry more than that
it's pretty rare I mean I think I think
even if you have to be a pretty hateful
little booger to just find this to be
like an evil well yeah I mean there were
a couple of those there's like the guy
the white male pros VI frustrating SMU
they tried to run us out in a rail which
is why we're going back to perform
on March 22nd and the feminist said it
was male priviledge II yes in the first
place but yes I'm you they got pretty
mad so that was one where there are a
few like they were they were pretty
upset and that's why we're going back in
the 22nd so book now but I'd say you
know I'd say I would say 70% trying to
be Jenner 70% been positive and 30% have
been somewhat hostile and I will tell
you this though any success that we've
had with this segment when we first
started doing it we said you know if
there's any success with this at all if
we're able to actually keep it civil and
actually have a conversation we want to
have with people the kind of
conversation that we've always had off
air with new people yep sometimes new
hires or sometimes when when people show
up to live shows we'll sit and I'll talk
to you for a long time sometimes even
just nuba right or at an uber ride for
exactly around so if there were if there
were a me level of success with this
series we would have been happy let
alone to see how much it's been embraced
by people out there because that doesn't
really happen in the age of the
clickbait title and everyone wanting to
talk about controversy and anti fun and
obviously that's that's that's reality
you have to deal in reality but you can
also have these kinds of conversations
that are very productive there there are
two sides of that coin and you don't
really hear this other side so we're
pretty happy I would say overall I mean
I would consider something that would
probably really would consider most
proud of here on this let's proud of it
and we kind of fell into it yeah there
wasn't a plan thing it was like let's
just try this and let's see and we
didn't expect much to come of it yeah to
the porter we get a lot of requests
probably more for this than anything
else yeah we have entire campus shows
and tour shows that people want right
just for change my mind coming to mind
right which is very different on the
live show a different at SMU in the 22nd
and then Illinois in March but we will
go to different campuses and do that do
to change my mind segments going forward
so first off let's show you the this was
supposed to be male privilege is a myth
and this lady decided to take a
different direction
[Music]
[Music]
what are your names I'm Hannah Hannah
Marilyn Hannah and Marilyn Jared how do
you okay Hannah and Marilyn so it's sort
of become this neologism this idea of
male privilege and I know we talk about
it a lot on campus and I've had some
conversations with people on campus
today I don't agree with the premise but
I'm open to having my mind changed well
male privilege is definitely a real
thing okay
our country country was built by white
males and it was built for white males
that's why women and any minority don't
have an equal chance of being in
politics that's why most of our
politicians are white males instead of
representative of the actual politic of
the actual population that's why
gerrymandering exists that's why
redlining is this white privilege and
white male privilege and male privilege
is real things okay so I want to make
sure I have this clear do you agree with
what yeah absolutely
okay sorry I'm trying to try and balance
this with the both you hope hope you
forgive me if I'm not perfect so you
believe that this country was founded by
white males exclusively I don't believe
it was I no innovation okay you know it
so what would use to substantiate that a
lot of white males obviously came here
because you know Western Western
civilization people came from Europe lot
of white males I thought it was founded
exclusively for white males that's what
you said yeah how did Amin ated Society
but that doesn't imply that that doesn't
necessarily equate to design the the
Constitution originally didn't mention
women
black people or anything or minorities
or anything and only mentioned white men
it didn't specifically say white but it
said man they didn't give any minorities
the right to anything we had to fight
for that right who's we
the minorities women had to people of
color had to everyone had to except for
white males I'm sorry I'm confused so
you're saying that the Constitution
first off mentioned only white men I
would say it denied man it said men give
mankind men turn you know again this is
just sort of a colloquialism men the
rights were extended to women you're
here aware right they weren't extended
to women women had to fight for their
right no women never had to fight
what do you mean women didn't have to
fight for these rights they literally
had marching women were hard for this
lake for the First Amendment and second
amendment women the right to vote for
the right to not be treated as property
okay so that's interesting you bring up
the right to vote so you say we fought
for it everyone except for white men
know some women did but fill minority it
was mostly white men women at first who
didn't include black women okay so who
do you believe procured the right for
women to vote women fighting for it
really yeah why men one not gave it to
him and if they didn't fight for it so
you believe a majority of women fought
for suffragettes fought for the right to
vote I don't know if it was a majority
but I know women did and we wouldn't
have it those women hadn't stood up for
it okay
well because I seem to move on to a
historical timeline historically that's
actually not accurate the majority of
women so women actually the majority
woman didn't want the right to vote I
told you it I didn't know if it was the
majority but it wouldn't have happened
if wouldn't haven't stood up and this
stuff for just well the reason I bring
that up is because you said it women and
minorities fought for that right not
white men when the fact is women
actually as a majority didn't fight for
that right many of them fought against
it
white men fought for that and were the
ones who signed that into law
because of women and they wouldn't have
sign it into law a woman hadn't made
them sign it into law but they didn't
the majority of women didn't want it
that's my point the reason I didn't want
it by the way we'll move on from this
was because of the fact that voting came
with the draft mandatory bucket duty
responsibilities that were actually not
bestowed upon women at that time and
they didn't want the right to vote
because it would come with the same
responsibilities and so women got the
right to vote but they didn't have to be
a part of the draft or mandatory bucket
to the mandatory firefighting service so
historically I'm just saying that's
actually it's not really accurate it
paints in an accurate picture I know
children there was an anti suffragist
movement
I know conservative women didn't want
the right to vote but it's because of
women that they were given the right to
vote and there's of course there's gonna
be people on each side but there's gonna
be women who want to stay in the home
but the whole point of women fighting
for it is so they have that choice to
stay in the home or go out to vote short
or go into the draft if they want to I
don't think you respectfully
fundamentally have a misunderstanding of
the draft no I go in I didn't believe in
drafting any one at all I don't play at
a time it was a part of voting that's my
point my only point here is you said it
was a society designed by white men
exclusively for white men and gave some
examples which weren't accurate so let
me bring us to today what rights are
afforded in 2018 to men exclusively that
aren't afforded to women and I would I
would like both either to answer Lena I
don't want you to sit there and feel
like I'm I don't want to cut you out of
it I think really well I just don't
think you're understanding her side and
how she's saying that it was a two-sided
thing so there are women who want to
stay at home and live that life and
there are women who wanted the right to
vote to have their voice heard in their
representation sure and I think you want
to you want to focus on the
Conservatives I don't want to say at
home and she's trying to say no no no
well they got the option to stay at home
because other women were fighting for
their right to vote no that's not what I
was that's not what I was presenting
from my site at all
no let me let me clarify one more time
than okay and I want I want to get
really clear not only for you for anyone
watching you said this was a society
created by white men exclusively for
white men and women and minorities had
to fight for these rights and use
examples as voting and white men didn't
what I am pointing out is that as
inaccurate white men did
most women didn't want it so that's a
false premise that pates a false it
paints a it's a false baseline for
today because if you say at one point
I'm not not it I think women should have
the right to vote I'm very glad that we
all do okay we can agree on that what I
can't agree with is something that is
historically inaccurate so I'd like to
find something we agree on
today what rights today in 2018 are
afforded to men that are not afforded to
women I don't believe that there's
systemic male privilege today I'm not
saying I'm entire I could be wrong I
don't believe it though and I would like
to be convinced or I'm certainly open to
being convinced I feel you're a male
privilege privilege is a myth I feel
like only white men have that male
privilege and that's what the focus
should be on okay so there's no black
male privilege no okay
we have some black men and actually in
the audience maybe they can come in
afterwards I would be interested to hear
their perspective so white male
privilege yes okay so what systemic
white male privilege exists a what
rights are afforded for example to white
males that are not afforded to black
males or to white males not afforded to
black females let's divide everyone by
race and gender at this point in regards
to like laws and things like that
obviously the laws aren't like Oh white
men get this prevalent ball of law so in
regard in regards to like technical
terms it says like men it's laid out by
laws really equally when it comes to the
actual systems there's tons of black men
crowding jails for an eighth of weed
well you know white men have like weed
parties and it's cool and that's their
thing but like black men are
automatically arrested for it
so that goes into the whole like police
brutality argument but so can I ask can
I ask you that I've never heard of a
weed party you mean one of the white
males probably yeah
yeah no I don't okay it will have
someone come in afterwards like explain
to me a weed party so I'm no genuine
this is this is not me being explained
I'm sure they do but the premise was the
idea right that black men are in prison
for an eighth of weed do you have any
statistical data to prove that black men
with nothing more than a degree go to
prison I couldn't give you the exact
statistics but there are several
accounts of it and it's not unknown it's
pretty much common sense that blacks are
weight easily more arrested than white
men well it apparently it's also been
common sense that the majority of women
were pushing for the right to vote and
that white men didn't support them so
we're trying to deconstruct some of
these ideas that people may be assumed
are common sense but are factually
inaccurate now the truth is men as a
whole are much more likely to be
incarcerated than women men as a whole
even white men get far more harsh
sentencing for the same crime as women
are shooting up schools so I think they
should have a harsher punished
well hold on a second I mean black black
hold on but hold on a thing but black
men are shooting each other in record
numbers that's not really relevant to
the point hold on one second hold on one
second from the n-double a-c-p you said
for an eighth I want to make sure we're
really clear here you said white men are
having weed parties and a black man with
an eighth of weed will be incarcerated
in a federal prison so what I have here
is your source from the n-double-a-cp
from the n-double-a-cp
in 2014 African Americans constituted
2.3 million or 34% 64% of the curricular
correctional population ok African
Americans are incarcerated at more than
five times the rate of whites now
nothing here at all involves behaviors
or crimes committed I'm trying to look
for anything in here that relates to
black people being sentenced simply for
an eighth of weed
so this is from the n-double-a-cp that
would be his bias of a source as you
could use but I don't see it I don't see
it show me give me I would like to see I
would be very open to hearing the
statistical reality I'm not trying to be
I would I'm not trying to be
confidential I would like to hear that
stat I think it's horrible I don't think
anyone should be arrested for an eighth
of weed or put in jail I think we can
agree on that right whether they're
white or black I think I don't think
white people should be shutting up
schools whether the white or black okay
so let's assume that that will and so I
hope I hope you're still comfortable I
don't want to make anyone I I feel this
has been respectful and you've been very
polite so again the systemic differences
we're talking about you know men period
are more likely to be incarcerated women
men are more likely to be physically
assaulted than women
so we're getting into this first off
this is data but when we get into the
anecdotal that well white men tend to
have it better because they can walk
around and have weed parties it's not
necessarily accurate so particularly
when we're discussing an issue as
sensitive as race gender and systemic
oppression or inequalities don't you
think it's really important that we get
that correct and the premise correct
before we go off and divide people by
these subcategories yeah but I think
there's tons of statistics out there
already and even if you don't want to
look up the statistics it's not hard to
see how many black men are in jail at
larger it's then why then two black men
commit crimes at a higher rate than men
know so you know black men do not commit
crimes at a higher rate than white males
do you have statistics that would
reflect that but it's definitely not
true it's because
since racism is built into the system
that's what the system of its built
against blacks and that's what racism is
that's why there are more blacks in
prisons okay what stealers have gotten
away from male priviledge now we've
gotten to black white but I'll go with
that if you'd like to and I don't
disagree that there have been horrible
instances of racism in this country
including by the way in Canada and of
course in Europe the British Empire and
by the way I hope you understand I'm
certainly not a slavery or racism
apologist I think that's bad I think
racism is bad but you just mentioned
that someone else was just earlier was
saying that he I was okay with rape
which I'm not simply because I believe
there needs to be proof for rape so I
think racism is bad if we can all agree
that racism is bad you say the systems
are racist and setup okay what's
systemic racism do we have today then in
that case therefore careful colored
people it's people of color one's racist
ones okay now
I've never been given the Equality
please never again been given the equal
of competing for jobs because they after
racism was abolished okay segregation
and Jim Crow and separate but equal so
people of color never been given the
same opportunity is white people which
is why it's been built into the system
in 2018 do you believe that's true
okay can I ask you a question your ID
here at to go to TCU at ECU do you know
if there is any affirmative action for
example grants exclusively given to
people of African American heritage so
there are grants and scholarships I
think we would agree across this country
for minorities we not say that's so
these I just want to make sure that I
understand these scholarships correctly
because I don't attend the school so
these are you said it's the community
grant for my it's is that what it's
called community scholar community
scholar and this is exclusively for
minorities to try and get them on campus
minorities but you can be any race you
get this scholarship okay so this is
something spittle
I'm a lower economic standpoint okay are
I'm giving you the example that
patriarchal like traditional patriarchal
mindsets affect you - you should 100%
get nine months off four if you decide
to have a child let me say this while
we're getting personal you should 100%
if you date a man who wants nine months
off leave him
all right so I'm very glad to have my
next guest it is first off anyone who's
going to be tweeting or texting or
messaging her I always want you guys be
respectful we talked about this anyone
who enters the arena as it were anyone
who was willing to engage in the process
of ideas with people across the aisle
it's really tough to get people it's a
lot of the time I mean recently so yes
so she has been tweeting me a couple of
times over the last week and a half or
so over the male priviledge is a myth
changed my mind segment and you can
follow on Twitter at Marea underscore
del Russo Maria del Rizzo how are you
I'm well how are you I'm doing well
thank you I appreciate you being on the
program thank you for inviting me and
not only that but you have your
headphones set up decent look she's I do
yes I mean your producer asked me to put
these headphones and so I have to give
you know I have to give props where
props or do what so no check later okay
so let's let's kind of get right into it
um I don't want it I want to make sure
that people kind of know our jumping-off
point how we made contact and I want you
directly your tweet so that I don't take
you out of context if I do at any point
please feel free to let me know
so the initial tweets that I saw for me
this is from the male priviledge of the
myth changed my mind segments we did was
that last Monday maybe - I don't know
was a while ago it's irrelevant we don't
need to get into this information but
you tweeted me the fact that you expect
people to walk up to you and hand you an
explanation because you asked for it
instead of going online and researching
it yourself is a pretty perfect example
of male privilege there are a couple of
tweets but let's let's start with that I
don't know that I necessarily agree with
the premise or understand it but sure
well I just want to apologize for that
in advance because a lot of your
followers did tweet me ask the fact I
didn't
know much about you or that this was a
thing that existed beforehand I did not
know that the change my mind segment was
actually a thing so now I'm aware of
that but Before we jump into all of this
I'm hoping that we can kind of start it
out just as kind of like to frame off
our discussion to kind of define what
privilege is because I think that that's
where a lot of this tension comes from
right so there are two definitions that
I want to share with you so the first
one is from like good old Webster's
dictionary and privilege as defined by
that is a special right advantage or
immunity granted or available to only a
particular group or person right if you
talk about privilege in sociology that
examines these social economic and
political advances advantages it excuse
me given to a group on the basis of sex
race finances all that type of okay
great really quickly just so I can make
sure and so we're talking about systemic
privilege systemic discrimination versus
geological cultural and in what you were
tweeting me were examples I guess you
would probably argue sociological
examples of me language well their
societal examples of male privilege
sociology is kind of the study of how
privilege influences these different
systems so society is a system as is
economics is a system as is politics is
a system so the examples that I were
sending you were examples of social
privileges that men have okay but when
we talk about privilege from the top
about me specifically well I guess I
guess this would apply to to all male
state because this is how I made contact
so I do want to I appreciate your
apology and to change my mind thing um
it's a second we've been doing for a
while and I know you mentioned you got
some threats from people and some
terrible comments which listen I mean I
won't apologize from because I didn't
make them but I'm sorry you had to know
with that that's never my intention ever
and I know you you asked me you know as
a male if I'd gotten similar threats
from from followers if I'd been asked
that I would be raped for expressing it
if it I'm sure now that you've done a
little more research on who I am that
you're you're probably aware this is not
a privilege I enjoy yep yes 100%
I and again I I get all of that now but
the reason why I wanted to define
privilege to you is that a lot of people
consider privilege when we talk about
male privilege they think of it more as
like an adjective when in reality it's
actually a noun so it's something like a
privilege isn't something that you
necessarily or men in general are
necessarily you know exercising
participating ain't exactly exactly
exactly I know that one of the jokes you
like to make is there's no secret
patriarchy meeting coming together and
being like here's how we're going to
oppress women like sure men's rights
groups exist in this country and they
may feel that way but on the whole this
is not what this is right what we're
talking about when we talk about male
privilege is the fact that historically
men have been in positions of power and
because they have been in these
positions of power they tend to frame
the way things are and because of that
they you know they they have privileges
that women don't necessarily have and
that's sure I appreciate I appreciate I
want to make sure you have you have the
full we have plenty of time so there's
there's no right yeah because you've
just discussed men in power and since
they've been in power the structures
that be that provide privileges yeah so
that would seem an example of systemic
so let's start with that
and then get to societal can you give me
any examples I guess right now twenty
eighteen of privileges rights afforded
systemic systemically to males not
afforded it cool so okay so this is
again why I have a problem with the term
privilege I actually prefer the term
advantage over privilege because I again
I think that people get really caught up
in the idea of okay advantage privilege
but you just mentioned measure power
right so let's just let's go with this
all right white men in power in this
country for a long time mostly men in
power right now in 2018 there are a lot
of female politicians a lot of
minorities but let's so let's go with
that what rights since you run up people
in power these people in power right
they've created the structures that be
right now the structures that be exist
in 2018 any rights or advantages
privileges afforded to men
not officially afforded to women in 2018
well what we are arguing here is that
you guys are benefitting from a system
where you guys were initially the only
people in power right you guys have like
a centuries-long head start on us and
because of that these things don't
change immediately so sure women are
equal to men in that we can vote in that
you know women are just as able to
ascend to ce o-- positions in all this
type of thing all of that is available
to us but since men have been in power
for longer than women have had the
opportunity to be in power you guys have
a little bit of a head start on us and
we all know that it's very difficult to
change people's minds about something
right I wanna move on I just wanna make
sure that we both agree on the premise
no rights not afforded sure on paper
there are no rights that a man has over
okay to clarify because you mentioned
government systems of power and so
people will hear that in right away and
I do feel that a lot of the left do that
cont I'm not saying you're doing that
but as a bait-and-switch like well the
systems of power that be and so people
go oh wait hold on a second what rights
out there are unequally distributed what
rights are not afforded so we but we
both agree okay there are no rights
afforded to men not to women okay but
and then so everything is so everything
is societal everything we're talking
about today then is societal sure yeah
okay so this is why I like to bring up
like men in power men in positions of
power another term that we get tripped
up on a lot is the term patriarchy right
like I know that the right hates that
term patriarchy and I think that it's
because a lot of time just funny we
don't yeah it's it's funny but if it's
it's literally defined as a system or
society oh no a system of society or
government in which men hold the power
and women are women are largely excluded
from it you can agree that that is the
way things have been for most of history
right you and I can agree on that well
no not if we're talking about societally
no no I'm talking politically a system
of society or cover
so let's talk government right which
price so now we're going back to
systemic so systemically yes for example
women didn't have the right to vote
until men passed laws that they that
they could yes but I want to make sure
we compartmentalize those because we've
now moved on to society because even if
you go back then you look at the
temperance movement you look at the
influence that women had in politics and
you look at prohibition they had every
bit as much as of influence and power
they just weren't necessarily in
official positions of government so now
we're kind of blurring those systemic
and societal but see those lines the
arrows are not hard to find lines
because one hand washes the other when
it comes to this type of thing when it
comes to privilege it's all kind of
interconnected because patriarchy is
also defined as a system of society in
which the father or eldest male is head
of the family and you could you could
trace descent through the male line
right so it's all whether it's society
whether it's government men are in
charge okay so today again let's so
because again we're going into systems
of power and men who are in power today
societally privilege advantages we moved
on from rights societally how do you
make the argument you know like I said
this is a change my mind effectively
right now the idea that we're taught in
schools by you know gender studies
professors by far-left progressive
feminists this idea of privileges the
word they use you know I know everyone
has different words we that word that's
used when I was in college when we had
to read Naomi Wolf examples of that
today societally I would love to see
some some concrete examples to see if we
would agree or disagree yeah I mean and
I'm gonna keep pushing on this it's like
the fact that men have been the ones
empowered they are the ones who are able
to dictate what is what is what is truly
like I'm sorry I'm losing my train of
thought right now because I understand
what you're saying but what I'm trying
to explain to you is that these power
positions influence our society today
because we they do certain I agree with
ya of course listen your house your past
dictates a part of your present but you
know listen again
two people in positions of power they
made men eligible for the draft and not
women right they made men have auditory
bucket duty and not women they made
men's an actual whipping post if they
abused their lives and not women so you
know no one's perfect and if we talk
about patriarchy you will hear a lot of
feminists say that these patriarchal
systems are also negative for men as
well we're not just saying like we need
to dismantle the patriarchy just because
it's bad for women it's bad for men too
for all of the reasons that you just
agree that you just talked about so so
since you guys have had the benefit of
being in power for centuries that's the
norm and you and I know that it is very
very difficult to change the idea of
what is normal right like your producer
and I were joking before I came on about
the fact that you know we I have to have
two different head phones one for my
computer and one for my iPhone because
when Apple changed their iPhone jack and
got rid of it people like went nuts Ryan
that's a small change right that because
that's the norm that's what you're used
to so if you are used to seeing men in
power and if men are used to being in
power it's hard to kind of change that
dynamic and because of that like you
just assume that men will be in power
it's an assumption it's a systemic
assumption it's something that people
just assume is the norm that is the norm
someone once asked truth Gator Ben Bader
Ginsburg what is the what would make you
happy like how many women on the Supreme
Court would make you happy and she said
all of them because there have been all
men on the Supreme Court so why
shouldn't there be all women yeah see
that's where we differ and that's where
I think I think where we can come come
to our disagreement maybe later on we'll
continue along this path is the solution
see I think that's a horrible and I mean
I'm sure you can imagine why I would
think that's the worst answer possible
sure I I happen to agree with you but
the fact that all men is normal and all
female is abnormal is no but that's not
why that's not why I think it's bad I
think it's bad because I am all about of
course we support on this program equal
opportunity
what Ginsburg is talking about there's
equal outcome I couldn't care less it's
not because there's normal or abnormal
whether it's Clarence Thomas or Ginsburg
I couldn't care less I care about the
most qualified person for the job I care
about the constitutional scholar who
will protect our rights I couldn't care
less if they have a penis or a vagina
and I think that's a big reason why
young women and particularly young men
the dangers that we're seeing now reject
this idea of feminism reject this idea
of privilege and advantages because they
see a lot of disadvantages that men
experience not as a result of patriarchy
but as a result of feminism because of
that mindset that it's time to ensure
equal outcomes saying all women on the
Supreme Court listen if you're a man
today if you're a 22 year old male you
go hold on a second everyone here has
equal rights and I don't want the
Supreme Court to become an affirmative
action land but and I completely agree
with you it should not be an affirmative
action land and the people who argue for
against male privilege are not saying
that you should give positions to women
simply because they're women we just all
want to be treated equally and we're not
really at this point if you do that if
you can't ensure an all female Supreme
Court so you understand the subtext
there you can't I do 100 percent a
hundred percent I cannot guarantee an
all-female Supreme Court but what I what
the reason why I brought that up to
begin with it was to underline my my
argument that all all-male all the time
is the norm it's the norm that's a
hundred percent the norm it's been the
norm I would not agree or you just I
would not agree that all-male all now a
hundred percent is the norm you had
females in the Republican primary and
the Democratic National candidate was a
female I don't know that it's a high
percent the norm I just I don't agree I
believe it it's actually probably
disproportionately not the norm if you
look at the amount of women who go into
certain fields and then you look at how
many of them make it to the top whether
it's stand-up comedy or the field of
Sciences I don't agree that in 2018 it's
the norm to see 100 percent men I think
it's the norm I'm not saying that it is
the norm I'm saying that it's the it's
the assumption that that's what you're
going to see when people go
to the doctor they assume that it's a
male doctor when people go to a lawyer
they assume that it's going to be a male
lawyer because these are fields that
have been traditionally dominated by men
you know I mean I don't have their I
hate to I don't agree premise you don't
have to agree with that that's not
accurate like the medical field is it
the legal field yes let's do this we
have to agree on fundamental facts right
yes most lawyers are men we can get into
why that's the case but in the medical
field you have plenty of women obviously
people will argue many of them going to
nursing but you have plenty of female
practitioners who are doctors I've had
female doctors myself my wife has female
doctors I don't agree with the premise
that it has been the norm for a long
time or certainly today for you to
expect a male doctor I think you're
seeing you're seeing everything through
the prism of gender here and and not
through the prism of qualifications I
don't believe that most people go mykes
if a woman walks into their office when
they're on that deli papers and will
hold on a second you have breasts this
is not what I signed up for I don't
think anyone cares
I really don't I'm not saying that they
care I'm not saying that they're gonna
like get up and storm out if I look like
if a woman walks in interesting that
there are certain things where you
expect a man to show up and I think that
that's very represented and you could
even look at our own government only 19
percent of the House of Representatives
is female and there are only 21 female
senators sitting at this moment so you
know that's not equal that's not you
know all women it's mostly men and I
think a guy why do you think that you
know over half the country are women why
do you think that is why do you think
women aren't voting in the women well I
think that we're not voting in the women
just because they're women I think that
you know we I don't really want to get
into the whole Trump Hillary thing
Hillary did win the popular vote we
don't have to get into all of that right
now
you guy and we are voting in four we are
voting in women I think that
traditionally women have not been pushed
into or have not been motivated or have
not even really been told that they can
achieve situations like this because we
and we can get into sexism with this now
women
who enter careers like politics who
enter careers like anything where
there's a high profile tend to be put
through it like it's had to be
scrutinized a lot more than men I think
that's your view and that's well and I
and I don't think that's you know and
that's not statistically corroborate and
here here's my point this is what I
think it's so important the way you
reached out to me you said they exist
the fact that you set up as a male and
no one who wrapped this is a perfect
example of male privilege you saw that
and you assumed it was because I was a
male just like right now you're assuming
that it's because these people running
our female it's an assumption and it's a
thin in this case with me it was a false
one you immediately say well as a
Magendie
and I think you let me Lane alright well
let me explain my criticism on can I do
that I know that you you look like you
want to say something else but can I
explain my criticism of you so your
change my mind segment is an example of
you know the the lack of diversity that
we kind of talk about when we talk about
what's an assault rifle uh like
one of them really large guns let me ask
you are you aware of what
the differentiation is between automatic
and semi-automatic no
people either have the right to protect
themselves or they don't and there is no
data to say that stripping people have
the right to self-protection would make
us safer
so for this week's installment i've
changed my mind we decided to revisit
the very topical issue of gun control in
the second amendment
matter of fact we returned to ut dallas
where we conducted our last segment on
this topic to see if anything had
changed
[Music]
now we're going to get to the two fully
unedited interviews in a second that's
the whole purpose of change my mind to
see what real conversations in real time
uh how they unfold but two things that
really struck me first number one
in a day full of conversations it seemed
that none of the even highly educated
students knew
anything about basic proper firearm
classifications or terminology
well i know fully automatic is the one
that is like restricted or an assault
rifle like what
why does someone need that assault rifle
or uh you know an automatic
machine gunner ars the same assault
rifle that was used in the recent
florida shooting
and two everyone wanted to talk about
florida obviously but shockingly not a
single student
not one had ever heard of the far deadly
or sutherland springs shooting
which took place in their own backyard
remember the sutherland spring shooting
that was right here in texas
you know what happened there right does
the name stephen williford mean anything
to you no
do you remember the sutherland springs
shooting
does the name stephen williford mean
anything to you
okay you remember the sutherland springs
i've heard of it
just now with the other girl from me
yeah for me absolutely terrifying how
could they not know of a shooting
with 26 deaths another 20 injured which
occurred only four hours away in which
the shooter was stopped by an nra
certified instructor with an ar15 a
national hero mind you stephen williford
but i repeat myself on with the
conversations okay so what was your name
again muad
mawad yes right um
i've asserted my position i think pretty
hopefully pretty clearly
um changed my mind so what do you think
about australia
1996. what about australia when they uh
buy back yeah i think it's terrible
really
why i think i think a gun ban stripping
citizens of the right to protect
themselves i think that's an immoral act
but i mean what if you look at the
statistics behind that the decline of
you know shootings deaths by gun it's
probably much less than we have per day
here
know what no it didn't it didn't have a
statistical effect on uh on violent
crime or even gun crime
matter of fact it came about the online
articles that
that say yeah otherwise we've written
plenty of them as well over to eladora
with kiter.com
and uh something more fascinating
there's an overall decrease in violent
crime there's an overall decrease often
in gun crime um and in new zealand where
they didn't have a mandatory buyback
you saw the same kind of overall trends
uh
so yeah i think it's i think it's
horrible um i think we both admit
it's a ban okay right yeah yeah so it
was considered a buyback which has been
proposed here
it was a mandatory buyback that's a gun
ban so i guess my question to you would
be
um would you like to do that in the
united states
i would love to to be honest personally
just ban guns honestly like what i mean
i understand there's
it's fun shooting a gun i've been to a
gun range before
there's a nice adrenaline feeling when
you're shooting at a target like you
know and it's just satisfying when you
hit the middle of the target it's
just like any other sport shirt per se
but um i feel like
we would gain so much more as a country
in the long run if you're thinking of a
bigger picture like
less possibilities of psychos killing
people like in las vegas
or just most recently where 17 people
died in a school right
i mean honestly like if i were to give
up my
my favorite hobby playing soccer if that
meant that
hundreds of people wouldn't die i would
gladly do it any day because i love my
country that much
great what do you believe the second
amendment is about
the right to bear on the right to bear
arms to protect yourself and
that's pretty much what i know i'm
really ignorant on this if i'm honest
oh really oh okay okay well listen i
appreciate you sitting down um
i don't mean to be contentious but you
mentioned it as a hobby
so um the first amendment okay right the
right to freedom of speech
do you believe that's absolute do you
believe that you should have the right
to speak freely without
having that be infringed upon by the
government okay and why do you believe
that
uh because just being able to express
your beliefs uh publicly and having that
as
you know a freedom is is essential to
the development of democracy in a
country
but where do you get that from who in
what sense
like what do you mean well where do you
get the the right to the freedom of
speech you said you believe that that is
fundamental you believe that's very
important to a democracy or to like a
constitutional republic
i just i just gave you a hint there in
that uh constitution
yeah yeah okay so so you're right
because you know the freedom of speech
is not
absolute it doesn't exist across many
other countries including free countries
including australia by the way you don't
have the right to free speech in
australia okay
so you believe the right to freedom of
speech is absolute because of the
constitution the first amendment
amendment number two is what the right
to bear arms
okay so did the australians amend their
whatever constitution they have when
they had that buyback
i can't speak to the specifics of all
elements of the australian constitution
okay
now i do know again that uh where i come
from for example in canada you can be
jailed for speech that's offensive or
you can be fined
so we decided to do things differently
from many places in europe
and certainly australia as it relates to
freedom of speech as well as the second
amendment
but i think it's important you just said
you believe freedom of speech is
absolute
why because you accept the premise that
these rights
as recognized by the constitution are
fundamental human rights
so when it comes to the life and of our
citizens yes
do you not believe that we have let's
say any let's like what if
just you know in general like does when
it comes to protecting the lives of
citizens and immigrants and anyone who
lives in america when it comes to that
do you believe that
there should be some flexibility in our
constitution
to protect our people so first off a
couple of
couple of key issues there right you
would have to
uh open it wide and now also nothing is
absolute so your freedom of speech is an
absolute so you would have to be
comfortable with that
secondly it's based on this premise that
we would save lives by
removing the second amendment which i
don't agree with
but let's go with with number one um do
you see
what a problem that is if you just say
well let's hold on a second because we
think we can be safer
let's give up this fundamental right to
protection uh
as recognized in the second amendment
can we acknowledge or maybe find common
ground there that
that'd be a real problem because it's
the same constitution that affords
you and i the right to do what we're
doing right now i mean i understand that
wholeheartedly but if we're thinking of
the bigger picture here where
like i mean i've seen things on social
media where people believe that teachers
should have guns and i mean so do you
just
as a human being do you think that the
amount of shootings that we have
every day in our country would decrease
if we had a buyback
like just thinking you know basic common
sense okay so we've now
i want to make sure that we're clear
here we've hopscotched past the idea of
human rights
it seems like that's not an area you're
super comfortable with because now
you're talking about stripping someone
of their fundamental right to
self-protection is having a gun if it
saves someone else's life
i mean why not why not i mean why not
you know like
take that step as a country take that
step as a country yes
removing someone's right to protect
themselves protect themselves from what
so explain to me since so the second
amendment so you all right um
no no you're gonna do your thing okay so
yeah second amendment you are do you
want me to explain what it is no yeah
sure so the second amendment was
designed to allow citizens to protect
themselves
uh cells both from internal and external
threats that means the right to protect
obviously
in their home property but mainly to
protect themselves from a tyrannical
government
because they fled a trinical government
they fought them off right these were
basically unorganized uh militias
who was a militia it's everyone you and
i are the militia
and the only way to ensure that there
can be a well-regulated militia meaning
a capable militia is that
all citizens have the right law-abiding
citizens
to keep and bear arms that's what it was
designed to do
you're proposing giving the government
the very fail-safe it's designed against
to protect against the tyrannical
government you're saying let's give the
government the authority
to strip people of rights
that's like a feat a feedback loop of
just a violation of human rights on a
scale that i don't think you might know
you personally do you think having the
right to free speech
is more important than having the right
to a gun no
i think you're both people we think
they're both equally important yeah so
you think like
for the development of our country it's
essential to have guns and free speech
and you think they're on the same level
in a scale
i think the right to own and keep
fighting it's more like a right
thing yes for you okay well i mean
why why is it just america that we have
tens of thousands of deaths per year
it's not i mean it is on it if you look
at statistics no we're not even
25. oh really yeah we're not even top 25
when it comes to firearm deaths we're
not even
we are the most armed populist but we're
not even the top country for mass
shootings matter of fact we're behind
norway and france
even though more people here have guns i
don't know i think we've
never heard of these statistics before
honestly i don't know where you get
yours from because
all of the ones that i've seen okay show
that america is always topping that list
okay uh well let's say we're able to
show you statistics afterwards
let's assume that those are correct okay
um it still can get to the question
let's assume
let's assume none of them are correct
what gives
you the right or what gives anyone here
the right
to strip someone of their ability to
protect themselves
so why don't we dissect that a little
what are we protecting ourselves from i
know you mentioned it from
internal and external threats so what
are those threats
tyrannical government okay yeah okay and
then of course the ability to protect
yourself from anyone who wants to do you
harm from evil people who are willing to
commit
uh harm i mean i don't i don't know why
that
that should you know have anything to do
with being able to own an assault rifle
assault rifle or you know an automatic
machine gun or anything like that
okay first off a couple things there um
what do you um
what's an assault rifle uh like
one of them really large guns
okay um yeah there's a lot to unpack
there
no no it's not i'm just going to
automatically yeah i know i mean
you mentioned a few things what kind of
where do you get your news from forgive
me or your sources what do you usually
read
cnn uh cnn twitter
cnn twitter and a lot of professors
probably here probably right
um everything that you have said here
and i said respectfully is incorrect
about the australia buyback the
statistics about that about
uh the second amendment now about
assault rifles and automatic weapons
none of the shootings that you've
discussed that we've discussed here
involved automatic weapons certainly not
florida these are not automatic weapons
automatic weapons are already heavily
regulated they're basically all but
unattainable for the actual
las vegas guy use yeah he's used to
semi-automatic
okay so semi-automatic and switch that
word what about that why do
people need to have this i'm sorry i
didn't know but do you wanna explain
what the difference is because
that's really important don't you think
because you you said here's something
and i
i appreciate you sitting down but you
sat down here
and you were willing to strip people of
their rights you were willing to say
listen it's time to progress as a
country which i'll get to in a second um
will cause countless more muggings
murders rapes of innocent people the
likes of which you've never
you've never even been able to
comprehend and didn't take into account
you were willing to remove the right of
those innocent civilians to protect
themselves
based on completely faulty data and
knowledge of things that simply aren't
so
there's a huge difference between an
automatic weapon that's a machine gun
and a semi-automatic weapon a
semi-automatic weapon
is every handgun pull the trigger once
it goes bang that's a semi-automatic
weapon that's most hunting rifles
that's nearly all handguns that are used
for self-defense so my point is
if if and i say this respect because a
lot of people have sat down so this is
not an insult but almost everything that
you just said is
is incorrect as a premise and you were
using that
or going up based on that knowledge um
to justify the stripping of someone's
ability to protect themselves
that is deeply so wonderful to me so i
obviously went to the extreme of just
banning guns
what if we you know improved our
regulation
or improved our our way of giving people
access to these
guns okay so we've got enough so you
would say now let's not ban
guns so i'm yeah with respect because
you know you got to please everyone
so let's just say we want to you know
just take another step do you think
we're at a
you know a good state where we're at
right now i don't i don't want to let's
just say
with what i just said would you
acknowledge now that okay
just banning guns could have some real
serious ramifications and maybe
you spoke a little too quickly on that
that might not be a good idea i'm sorry
what
so would you agree with that maybe
that's not a good idea to just ban guns
sure okay so what kind of regulations
would you like to see
and why just making it probably more
difficult for
people such as the las vegas shooter the
orlando shooter and
things like that to get access to guns
like that can and cause such
you know huge calamities to our country
um
how would you do it what do you think
i'm asking you
you're supposed to change my mind i mean
i'm just saying like we're not in a good
place where we're at right now with
regards to guns
really and from the statistics that i've
seen i don't know what which ones you
have and i
really love to look at the ones
afterwards and from what i've seen and
what i've been convinced through that
data is that
america is not in a good place with
regards to data from cnn
and twitter and professors is wrong um
uh okay so you've i'm assuming you've
probably never purchased a firearm no i
haven't okay
so if you purchase a firearm right now
they run a background check okay okay
okay you're a criminal if you're a felon
you can't get a gun okay you've
committed violent
misdemeanors you can't get a gun okay
domestic abuser you can't get a gun
legally declared mentally unfit you
can't get a gun get or own
meaning you cannot obtain you cannot
purchase it okay okay okay
so these already exist if you go to
purchase a firearm again all these

risk it doesn't even add there's no
reward don't even understand this all
right speaking of affordable Falcon 9
SpaceX is latest expedition finally
launched today and feminists are mad
like this headline from NBC the
patriarchal race to colonize Mars is
another example of male entitlement they
write and I quote it is the same
instinctually and cultural force that
teaches men that everything and everyone
in their line of vision is theirs for
the taking
you know just like walking up to a woman
and grabbing her by the I love how
this this isn't just proof that
yesterday's salon in Slate is today's
NBC I know it's what point do you say
maybe it's not Fringe its NBC front page
headline look as much crab as we gave
him
Elon Musk just put a rocket in space
okay you just mash your fat feminist paw
on a keyboard and hit auto correct did
you mean to say you can't do anything
Elon Musk might have been pushing this
one a little bit it does seem like an
instigator president it's almost like
they should have blurred that and it
only cost you four hundred billion
dollars worth it
just just grab that solar system when
you say when will feminists be mad about
everything oh now yesterday you imagine
landing on the moon was feminists today

call lock for you no no I didn't order a
large wine now I have requested to be

research when I have requested you

you don't have to answer that question
I'll answer the question you want
answers I feel the truth you can't
handle the truth it's a sad statement
our legal system I hope he finds what
he's looking for an angry cow beat up a
British tourist yesterday so that's I'm
female a tourist was left bloodied and
bruised by a ferocious cow which became
angry after this lady sang at a
black-eyed pea song amused by how large
the creature was she jokingly began
singing the popular song popular my
humps my humps my peace now the cow and
I quote unamused by her rapping ha
suddenly charged at her with its horn
most saddened by the story but still
thrilled but their name is finally back
in the news the black-eyed pea this cow
is awesome I'm now v let's look right
there you guys you to forgive yourself
sing around the sing the song should be
dead
I'm trying to be sexy to the cow wasn't
gosh I don't know it does make you the
black-eyed peas it's kind of like I
meant when the first dollars came out
episode 1 everyone now almost a
gazillion it yeah and people loved it I
hated it I always hated the Black Eyed
Peas I've never had I feel vindicated
did you see them was it was Super Bowl
they right a couple years ago it was so
yeah he worst thing I've ever seen it
might it feels like yesterday is still
the ruins are so fresh even Lady Gaga I
was one she did the spider-man yeah she
put on actually a pretty good show it
you could just tell she hadn't balanced
it someone hadn't calibrated it put on a
few pounds do but a carjacker carjacker
story is always fun carjackers by the
way
from Detroit we invented carjacking
you're welcome that's our gift to the
world made his victim drive to Wendy's
on the way to a drug deal this we're
gonna get to CNN in their fake news
Brett angle was charged with felony
aggravated robbery and abduction for
carjacking one with a box cutter seem
self-explanatory he then forced her to
go to an ATM to take out $200 police
then said that the suspect had the woman
drive to a nearby Wendy's and forced her
to buy him something to eat didn't go
dutch then the 84 year old brought him
to a gas station before finally driving
him to a White Castle where he appeared
to be conducting a drug deal
so most upset by the ordeal is White
Castle for finding out that they're not
serving food fit for drug dealers for
them I can attest it's so insulting he
added ten years to his sentence to avoid
White Castle and it wasn't like that
much of an upgrade it wasn't like no no
we're going to Houstons it was Wendy's
there's that much of a discrepancy this
is a guy who's going to prison because
he didn't know what Ober was yeah so
much trouble
Hey different ubers go ooh BRR ex do the
carpool they can't track you know keep
smarter than us we stopped at what we
did when we were driving fishing in new
Texas manly not fun
very odorous but a very distinct oh
tweet me a desk ride if you noticed this
I was talking about us everyone else
learn oh no White Castle it leaves a
distinctive after burn we don't just
mean like oh we like you ate a bunch of
greasy food there's something very
peculiar about White Castle on what it
does to the humanity and this guy was
like I ain't going down and I smell like
hamster cages hey no way we left and
came back so that they could turn on the
fryers
oh that's right if we waited we had two
minutes at White Castle gosh we had
opportunities everywhere made bad
decisions if that were on our record
there's no way we'd be buying a gun a
doctor who denied sex abuse
well this tada doctor has denied sex
abuse from I think Canada by saying his
belly was too big he lost his license
subsequently apparently the excuse
didn't necessarily work so Ontario's
medical regulator they revoked the
lessons of the very dermatologist who
argue that there was no way he had
complaints that he could have possibly
rubbed his
penis against his female patients
particularly their breasts whole area
because of his large reality I'm trying
to be clean here this is the actual
story so his argument was that he
couldn't I couldn't have done it because
I'm because I haven't done push ups and
the panel actually was unable to
conclude after expert examination mind
you whether his penal area actually made
contact with patients so it was
inconclusive because if the gut don't
fit you probably didn't touch her tit
another guilty man gets off can you
believe that
imagine that that's your argument I mean
you just have to have given up on life
yeah it's like you're cornered here's
like uh-uh-uh
no I couldn't have committed sexual
harassment really why is that
because I'm disgusting morbidly obese
have you seen me I have a rectal
dysfunction I'm unattractive and my
belly gets in the way and I would like
to be free to go Your Honor I haven't
seen a penis in years there's no way I
could have done it no way there's no way
imagine in trying to just to prove that
just like those those those poor
infomercials I can't even heard of old
cell phones there's got to be a better
way to commit sexual assault technology
today gotta be away yeah I don't know
what this is a great intro to nigel
farage so here's one thing we're gonna
talk about CNN this is in the news
obviously CPAC is going up by the way no
we're not coming to your CPAC party
everyone's been asking we're not there
no and a lot of people we ate we're
hanging out here and we have our own
lanyards yes exactly we have our own
lanyards we have the VIP plus plus plus
pass who what does that mean free Klean
Kanteen
so uh Florida obviously I don't want to
name the shooter
there was a you've seen the kids who
have been trotted out yeah 17 kids been
trotted out now one kid came out who was
supposed to speak at the town hall and
he said the CNN rejected his Town Hall
question on armed guards and that it
ended up being scripted that's what the
kid said so the message is you know well
please listen to the children giving
well they
why don't the children of the boys shut
that little up please not that one
not that one not that one CNN went as
far as calling the kid a liar
on Twitter they wrote there's absolutely
no truth to this CNN did not provide
script questions for anyone in last
night's Town Hall nor have we ever okay
if you would have said last night's Town
Hall the kid might have been in a pickle
because maybe he didn't save your Google
Doc right maybe he didn't save the
question that you sent him and you could
wiggle out of it but when you say nor
have we ever be yourself Oh a little bit
of a backdoor it's like the first thing
you learn in political science is just
don't speak and absolutely yeah I you
don't but you don't need a conspiracy
for this by the way okay CNN has a long
history of scripting and that's why
they've been catching flack for it that
Don Lemon is all torn up about it no an
actual lemon just a bitter little fruit
Duncan here he's looking old he really
doesn't like that Johnny Mathis he's
just decayed really fast
oh those Don Lemon every way that one
that one will be seen in the Twitter
section so here's your CNN they have a
hit and let's not I don't want to give
the whole crisis actor thing because
that's a conspiracy that you don't you
don't need a conspiracy theory that you
can't prove verifiably beyond all shadow
of a doubt when you have the truth the
truth should be enough CNN has a long
history with this Donna Brazile right
she they shared debate questions Hillary
Clinton campaign while working at Cena
we know that Michelle Malkin revealed a
long time ago she talked about the
systemic problem I think with the CNN
Town Hall's having Democratic operatives
and activist plants as undecided voters
I mean it's it's not really all that out
of the realm of possible when you
consider we did the ant if a thing and
the media just didn't want to pick up on
it at all yeah is this is the lies by
omission right exactly yeah and you had
guys like Chris coma I think I think
spent computer has it I do you have that
do you have that trend computer so this
was okay yeah Romo
yeah the Chris Brown with a CNN boy in
chief except nobody the kid said I
actually went and didn't actually buy
the gun and walked out without filling
any paperwork out but that's what do you
read tweets and he doesn't go back and
correct my story like walked in looked
into it yeah license and he's like
that's I got it
the rate of fire yeah it's like gosh
this is the kind of story that sways
opinion though yeah no exact or Bono's
well it's antigen there's scripting that
has been going on for a long time and
then there are lies by omission that
they don't even realize their inherent
biases we've talked about that with with
what occurs on campus I think some of it
comes out of mouth and I think some of
that comes out of they just don't even
know I think maybe this person who
issued the CNN statement didn't know
about the donna brazile thing didn't
know about candy candy crowley what
happened with Mitt Romney maybe this
person didn't know it was the same
person was bitching that Elon Musk sent
a penis rocket ship in the sky I have no
idea media there's you want to know why
there is no trust in American
institutions which ones you're asking
all of them now it's because of things
like this we have never ever ever ever
ever provided any scripted question
except if you were to ask me if you were
to say hey Steven scripted an interview
with with Nigel Faraj I would say no no
listen
of course now now let me show you I have
a list of questions where I asked Nigel
Farraj what he's doing at CPAC and later
on I'll be asking him those questions
here they are and then we go off-book I
just haven't I would tell you that
that's what happens but I would not say
no no we've never ever ever ever moved
down any questions at all it's just not
true such a lie and the difference is
CNN is having the people the guests
asking the questions scripted yeah so
hosts should be prepared right Chris
Cuomo so they tried out the kids and
this is a conversation
someone corrected me on Twitter today
and and and they were right I said you
know listen of course everyone has the
right to be heard and kids shouldn't be
in charge of making policy decisions
both computer but they said you know
what no not everyone has the right to be
heard I came rember who said this on
Twitter you can tweet me again it s
Crowder I'll try and retweet you because
it was it was insightful they said no
you have the right to speak you don't
have the right to be heard you can't
force somebody to listen so really they
have a right to speak and a complicit
media ensures that everyone is force-fed
what they're talking about kids no I
don't hate these kids I think I think
one of them for sure the one is
definitely a political opportunist he
was tweeting from the school or started
doing the the Instagram video that's why
I just don't like using kids as gimmicks
they do that seat back to they just
bridge I don't like kids being involved
in politics we just try and avoid on
this show so Seth MacFarlane though
tweeted this out this is the narrative
just like Christopher Titus means in the
show don't you care about kids
since they Fraulein tweeted the American
right is terrified of the students of
Marjory Stoneman Douglas high the
students who rapidly turn themselves
into activists after 17 of their fellow
student and teachers were murdered have
become the most visible face of this new
phase of gun debate number conservatives
of limited okay so we're afraid of kids
that says it used to be you don't care
about kids now we're afraid of kids how
many kids have they trotted out how many
kids were at the town hall anywhere from
15 to 20 oh yeah let's let's say 30 tops
what about the other all students at the
high school who haven't been on the news
what about the kids who actively come
out and said hey you know what I'd like
to talk about it I actually disagree
with what some of these kids are saying
I actually think that this is something
that could have been avoided I think
there's some policies that could be
changed for example putting this in the
in the database nationally the next
background check this guy had thirty
nine calls to the house I think shot a
chicken with his gun there have been
other kids no no no no not so fast right
kids with opinions they agree with trot
him on up Steve okay do you tell me this
what what were you know someone there
had to be a grooming process for that of
course coming through who has the
political viewpoint that they want to be
at some point that had to occur that is
the truth now the lie that people run
with unfortunately the crisis actors go
this kid is pay yeah
just put him in a school for years to
lay low until there's a shooting no what
happened is the kid decided he can get
on TV kids get attention just like a kid
who gets a laugh and so it keeps
repeating the stupid joke because he
keeps getting attention that's what
happens with these kids and then they
stutter over their lines and they get
some scripted dialogue that happens in a
lot of these interviews especially with
inarticulate kids who don't understand
the Second Amendment but it's just funny
you tell me this okay
kids with opinions on gun control some
of them weren't even in the same wing of
the high school they're more relevant
then Steven Willeford who killed the
shooter who shot him with his own ar-15
no one wanted to interview Steven
Willeford every night but throws - we
had him on the show we had an exclusive
because no one was calling so you bring
up the girl with the buzz cut you bring
up the girl who looks like the Minority
Report Oracle to yell at Dana lash on a
CNN Town Hall don't hate the girl I'm
so you're getting very emotional this is
serious yes of course Heidi really
privileged mail I stopped why do you
have to break the seal on to kill a male
rapist when that male could just not
rape in the first place
I know wouldn't that be great yeah
wouldn't it be great yeah I know
why wouldn't it be great a Mendon rape
yeah it's the latest installment of
changed my mind this time male
priviledge is a myth this is going to be
fun hey really quickly want to hear from
you which subjects would you like to see
most going forward with change my mind
we've done pro-gun pro-life male
priviledge of the myth there are two
genders comment below and we'll be doing
them in the future we'll get to the
unedited segment interview in a second
but one thing that I want to note is
that what these change my mind segments
we can go hours without a single person
sitting down willing to have a
conversation that's the part you don't
see we'll sit down set up and sometimes
it's 30 minutes 45 sometimes it's
several hours and as soon as one person
sits angry left to surround and feel
safe yelling from the mob all of a
sudden I can't get to everyone fast
enough
got it great so if you had true the
statistics of according the FBI
wait so one just food right we noted a
new you know today poo and we would like
to extend invitation should you like to
you can sit down you can sit down
afterwards will do it every fit yeah you
going to turn what was that
there you go that's always a sign of an
intellectual Titan but you'll get a
chance at bat sure now we'll come back
to this gentleman in a minute he's
actually the subject of today's
long-form unedited interview I won't
bore you with many conversations because
it wasn't all that much productive to
glean from it if you look even at her
SMU interviews the one aggressive
feminists kind of took over
it was confrontational but all of the
others were really productive every
other changed my mind we've ever done
has been pretty productive but I noticed
when discussing the idea of male
privilege or any privilege for that
matter on campus not only was pretty
much everyone hostile off the bat but
not a single person provided any
substantive argument every single point
without fail was anecdote what rights
are afforded in 2018 to men exclusively
that aren't afforded to women this is
serious yes of course
Highbury right privileged male of course
I chose it of course but I mean the
reason why I chose it then like shapes
other opinions okay my framing a race
within the first two weeks of coming to
the school as a freshman this also might
be why despite having a permit the
gender studies professors who along with
their students teach the injustice of
police brutality inherently within the
system called the police on us simply
for disagreeing quick bring in the
patriarchy so we weren't really able to
finish our conversations in the first
place and at this point when everything
was anecdotal I kind of just have to
pick one enter this guy the person you
saw before who was yelling and cussing
at me beforehand who also stayed to yell
and cuss at students afterward
you're not a white girl you're not a
girl okay raise your head if you don't
so he's been raped on this campus yes
watch and make your own decisions no
come up and debunk my book so is a great
way to start a civil conversation what's
your name sir Gregory Gregory yes yeah
okay so why the anger and profanity it
was such that those such as that was
such a simple conversation answer your
question so Hank your profanity because
this is an extremely sensitive sensitive
topic with with white with male
privilege and I know you guys the last
conversation was I had a lot about
racial things and you wanted to talk
about lost Ronco are really about the
practicality so practically you know I I
don't I don't have a car here so
sometimes like I like to go down I go to
yoga when I walk back it's at night I
have my headphones on I have like a
hoodie on so I don't know I'm not aware
of my surroundings and I feel perfectly
comfortable doing that I didn't always
are only conscientious of that my entire
life until I got a year ago I was on the
phone with my friend and she said she
need to get her text book from her car
and it was like probably like thirty at
night
and she just wouldn't do it she didn't
feel comfortable she didn't feel safe
sure and so that's something that's
inherent as a male biologically larger
and just like women that's that's an
inherence privilege and hearing
privilege as I mail it well I keep I
illogical ProLogic lee you're going to
be larger taller and you can overpower a
woman and for the most part so you
believe so you're saying that
male/female is biological first off
that's a premise increaseth biological
and and societal and there's also
systemic systemic is gonna be where it's
just ingrained in a society okay so
could you use for example explain to me
what the difference would be between a
biological male versus a systemic male
choose your words I
I say this is they're inserting a
biological male systemic well I'm
talking about systemic male priviledge
and okay we said you say biologically
mine are bigger and stronger right yes
exactly
okay so you're I just want to make sure
we agree on the premise that your snare
logically males have privileged because
they are larger because of that they
have a certain as safety afforded to
them where they can go out and then they
don't have to worry about you talked
yeah it's a horrible horrible comparison
earlier about how males are more
vulnerable to being like to being
burglarized or whatever your thing was
no no I didn't that wasn't what I said
okay what did you say they're more
likely to be like experienced violence
yeah cancer you know all kinda Jen do
that can it can I answer go ahead yeah
no they're statistically more likely to
be victims of violent crime across the
board by which gender know what you just
said you mean gender biologically or
systemically what you just said there
were difference between biological
societal and systemic I want to make
sure we're talking about that yeah
because you're providing the privilege
I'm forgetting the systemic privilege
let's assume I illogical gender it's the
stomach okay well okay
difference okay you okay horse a
biological gender privilege
don't forget the privileges we're very
important yeah it's very important
remember the privilege yeah okay violent
crime many of them would be committed by
men at large domestic violence is very
comparable domestic violence would be
committed on the same rate from with
biological women to men as men to women
sumption than men who are who are more
like vulnerable to violence is what
other men statistically having more at
but being the victim of violent crime
yes statistically also being the victim
of domestic abuse those victims those
men male victims are mostly being
victimized by other men
sure let's go with that yeah sure you
think that's unlikely no I didn't say
it's unlikely let's go with that
okay well yeah I think I think we can
all agree on on that and then so so for
women they don't have that biologically
we're still in the biological part right
when they are law when they're smaller
when they can be overpowered more easily
they they can they don't have the same
privilege when they can't go running by
themselves you've never liked talking
about one sense demons cussing at me so
I'm going to
my sentence and if you want to listen
that'd be great if you don't you don't
have to what I'm talking about here is
privilege I do not see it as a privilege
having a violent crime committed against
you at a multiple rate likelihood other
male whether it by a male but the man
who is getting violently assaulted I do
not believe is more privileged than the
woman who isn't and statistically that's
the likelihood not a privilege because
biologically that male who's being
assaulted by another male has a better
chance of defending themselves than a
female who is being assaulted by a male
and that's the gender difference we're
gonna talk about male privilege sure to
talk about the influence on the opposite
gender don't I don't Nick don't give a
 about you when you're talking about
like male on male crime really I do
this is not what this is about talk
about that sure talk about crime let's
talk about crime we're talking about
male privilege yes now I'm bringing up
the biological inherent differences
between the genders I agree on the I
agree that you buy out in German sex and
gender you are less likely and less
capable of defending themselves against
the opposite gender
sure biological I know listen I agree
that's why I'm a huge supporter of women
concealing and carrying no it's not
something oh yeah I think it's different
subject because they're being why I
don't want women what is your trennis
that the premise as though for some
reason women are less likely to seconds
this is not about male Emile's crime and
this is not about access to firearms
right now I want to talk about the
practical different the practical
livelihood our existence why we want to
talk about systemic privilege my
systemic religion he said two seconds
that was about 18 okay I'm going to
speak now and I'm not going to cuss at
you so the point is we are talking about
systemic privilege no one at any point
I'm still open to anyone can sit down
has given me any example of a right
afforded to a man not afforded to a
woman that's what we're really talking
about systemic privilege now we've just
acknowledged both of us that men are
statistically much more likely to be the
victim of a violent crime
we're statistically much more likely to
die at the workplace okay now this is
something that matters to me and perhaps
not to you and then that's okay we can
disagree I don't believe that the man
who is 70 80 percent more likely to have
a violent crime committed against him is
privileged
whether it's committed by another
or not now I would agree maybe we could
find common ground on here what I'm
talking about is I don't want to see
women victimized as a matter of fact
most men don't and the only way a woman
would be able to defend herself against
a violent crime though statistically far
less likely than that of it occurring
with a man would be a mechanical
advantage in a firearm would you not
agree yeah sure no it is no it's about
protecting women it's about keeping
women from being victimized okay cool
that's that's us that's it men have also
but you want to talk about male
privilege so we're talking about
differences between the genders you want
to talk about far I'm so quick let's and
that conversation with this man that's a
major do I have a different
accessibility to firearms no they don't
exactly exactly that's a great their
privileges there you go there's there's
no privilege there's a firearm what I'm
talking about is wanting to a few or if
you let me let me boil it down in a way
that maybe you might be reductive I
would like to read far more headlines
okay that's a rapist shot dead in a
ditch by a woman with a 38 special then
woman raped on campus because of some
concealed carry law okay so I don't I
would exactly you know why how do you
stop why do you have to break the seal
on to kill a male rapist when that male
could just not rape in the first place
I know wouldn't that be great yeah
wouldn't it be great yeah I know
why wouldn't it be great a Mendon rape
yeah who are you arguing with your Don
Quixote fighting windmills man you think
I'm your same way with it they don't get
away with it oh they get away with it on
the smooth campus really yes they do
okay Miami Vice brainy name great within
the first two weeks of coming to the
school as a freshman she was a virgin
two minutes ago Hall you know what that
mother had to do you have to move out of
that hall forget to move out that's
about it really
yeah so this is so this was a rape I
told you things are they written so
you're getting very emotional this is
serious
yes of course hi Mary white privilige
male I can go now okay stay on my phone
my little bubble of TCU I don't have to
turn my back I don't have to worry about
my job my my inktober anything I die
don't the worry about getting grapes
well you should my friends you good
worried you should worry about your own
comes you should worry about
communicating something you should worry
about tree you should worry about
communicating with adults you should
worry about treating on people
respectfully because this will affect
your future employment opportunities you
first came in here and talked about how
you put on your hood of your headphones
you don't even look around in the
periphery that's dumb
that's stupid you should worry about
your safety that's not that's
fundamentally unintelligent white black
yellow red I don't care it's not smart
to do it's also not smart to come in and
say we should get them to stop raping
I'm not your father right I'm not your
father
will you come in here they're gonna
school somebody and cuss and yell and
say you need a sound rapist everyone
here wants to stop rapist everyone here
wants to stop rapists okay the point is
this kind of doublespeak and this kind
of rhetoric and this these kinds of
false platitudes don't help women do you
know what you're doing you're
victimizing actual victims of rape there
is no 1 in 5 rape statistic when you say
men get away with it we allow men to get
off scot-free with rape it's not true
and you absolve people that personal
responsibility the O's no worse Society
leads to a polarize campus it leads to
god forbid actual rape cultures like we
see across the Islamic culture and this
campus is there yeah ok and then what is
the rape culture this is the rape
culture on TCU is is brewed up by first
of all twice of having twice as many
woman has twice and one it creates a
different social dynamic Greek life so
let me continue it let me continue our
first example my friend who was raped
within their first two weeks stare
apology R Lewis
having lost her virginity to rape it's
terrible the the the criminal who was
uncharged was to give a name pledge I'm
not I'm not gonna release this would go
out to a lot of people girl this is not
mine I was always nothing it's not my
decision she did not want to release his
name she did she just don't want this to
be a public thing okay don't judge her
for that so don't roll your head no no
no I am judging okay not her I'm making
it I'm judging the decision you're
judging her victims so I'm dreading the
decision that's a bad decision because
you know what that guy could go forward
and rape another woman
so this stupid false victim status I
don't want that guy to go on leave
nobody oh then cuz she inflamed the
school because a guy Reynard she didn't
give the name do you want to put the
name on publicly cuz she know
how do we stop a rapist if we can't
charge him or get a name here how do we
stop a red meat sauce I'm gonna answer
your question okay
is this decision having the stopping the
racist would be to put him in jail
do you have to have the punishments for
rape to be so significant not just
taking away swimming has caught
scholarship in attendance at Stanford
for that for that rapist but at this
school she did not want to put out the
name and make it a public thing because
she did not want to be associated with
doctor directly this is a small school
she puts out his name her name gets out
there she doesn't want that she doesn't
want to be known as a victim let me
finish the school no she did she did she
did want to prevent that that same
person or his affiliates from raping a
gun okay she told the school okay so the
school and police have his name and
there was a crack he was he was charged
he was no no he was moved out of because
she because he lived in the same Hall as
her Milton then he had to move out of
the hall both freshmen see each other
for the rest of so the police were given
her name of a man who forcibly raped a
woman here telling me they just removed
in from the hall this is the story and
it comes to criminal when it comes that
conviction are there other things that
are needed proof yes exceptional things
and and it's a big one
when we not agree on that yeah obviously
proof is important obviously okay and so
when he comes to the the practicalness
of this event it is lovely talk cuz we
talked about the culture so I'm talking
I going back to the example because
those they were Greek
they were pledges the rapists okay and
you want to know what his brothers did
when they found out about this I'm
guessing something bad mm-hmm yeah they
do not go up to her and apologize and
say you know he's a bad egg so and so
Greek fraternity entered Greek words
this not Baptist we do not represent
this know they they harassed her they
said do not ruin this kid's life for one
dumb mistake he was intoxicated he was
this he wasn't thinking sure he thought
you were cute okay that's what they did
and that's why it's the stomach I was a
part of a fraternity here I left because
two members were put on our version of
our internal Supreme Court they were
giving chance out their chance of the
chance
they were put they were in they were in
positions of power within the TCU
community to where they were subject to
incoming freshmen they were subject to
other girls and they they use that power
in ways where they ended up harassing
these girls sexually assaulting these
girls that's terrible within the
fraternity they were given chance after
chance at the chance until they just
became maybe inactive can I take this
did not they were not big enough they
were not a part of the fraternity enough
to be to where they would shed badness
okay that's why a lot can I ask a
question
okay okay because you went you kind of I
think we'd both analogy jumped from a
few topics there so I'd like to kind of
donor in a couple then hopefully we can
move forward so you mentioned that this
man raped her the school knew about it
the police knew about it he was simply
moved to another house to simply move to
another dorm then you said that the
Greek house knew about it and basically
was encouraging and they harassed her
right okay do you have any proof
I wanted to count and that's that's
probably one of the reasons why it
wasn't my turn there was no there was no
GoPros everywhere you know there was
that's that's how it happens that's how
we just said proof was really important
so anyhow you just you just gave this
whole example to paint a picture of
white male privilege on campus and this
is underway with any longer oh no it
appears to be mr. Yu to himself shake we
are the Young Turks well known to work
[Music]
hey hey youtube you never got me down
you never got me down YouTube you never
got me down never got me down there
never get me down
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah it's the sound of the weekend
because it's a Thursday live stream Oh
what's a we live stream I haven't every
we yet we have great guests we have
razor fists that's mr. razor fist with a
zero because he's cool but Clint Howard
on the show so he's insane and Owen
Benjamin with a song and of course
producer with me and video studio as
always is my faithful producer because
he's producing Jared who is not gay
follow him on Twitter not gay Jeremy
describe with your thoughts your
comments your photoshop's I fulfilled my
legal obligations as far as I know drawn
conclusions are we good we could
appreciate that Gerald Morgan simplified
wine.com
apparently can order one have a ship to
your door but why would you want to
unless your raging alcoholic add you
Morgan Jr what's the one of the day
we've got a bear Taj Zinfandel you start
more of a beer guy what did you like the
Bears Folsom Street Fair of course doing
overlays is that's FEM computer how are
you sir hello beep beep you can follow
me on Twitter at Elon Musk thanks for
foreshadowing soon we're going to be
talking about Elon Musk today I never
want to talk about everyone wants to
talk about the shooting the tragedy and
this is always sad when it happens it
happens on the show and then we hate
Nike and I'm over here you see what he's
doing he's looking at you you look at
everyone but me a beautiful show
sometimes cuz he gets emotionally
uncomfortable you know you wish what we
talked about by Elon Musk sucks let me
say that because I'm tired of always
having to deal with the political
mudslinging when it comes to public
shootings but that's your question of
the day comment below I genuinely want
to hear from you do you think that we
should do the class act just mourn those
who lost as we usually would have
throughout human history or are we
beyond the point of we no longer afford
that has the left forced us to fight
fire with fire
do we have to go tit for tat that's a
question I struggle with because a lot
of times we're looking old you're doing
the same thing well yeah I am but that's
because they're they're they're
politicizing the gun control issue
before the bodies are even close your
hand every time I don't know what do you
think I think you have to I hate having
to respond to these things like that but
you have to throw logic out there
because if people use emotion to make
laws we're gonna end up really screwed
in the end the United States America
okay Jared you know what set of ten
we've already done rebuttals with with
Vox because they had the biggest
anti-gun video
for a while with the young turks we've
done videos out there on the Second
Amendment whether it's meant just for
muskets they did the same thing with
freedom of speech we've done the gun
show loophole we've done so many videos
we've done so many shows where we've
dealt with the Australian gun buyback
the Canadian gun laws that I grew up
with so you know what I'm not gonna
revisit let's recap it and then we'll be
done with it because I know you're
dealing with this on every single other
show we can wonder why Elon Musk sucks
or something else because I'm tired of
the same conversation over and over set
your timer let's go assault weapons are
not an actual thing mass shootings are
on the decline the United States does
not actually have the most mass
shootings in the world all pistols are
some form of semi-automatic an ar-15 is
actually not a military weapon States
with the United States stricter gun
control laws and not statistically
reduced crime gun control matters at
large have actually proven to be not
effective in reducing violent crime the
United States by the way does not have
the highest violent crime rate in the
industrialized world most of the
statistical gun deaths that you actually
read about include suicides that's
something I didn't tell you gun by the
way gonna save millions more lives and
they ever take according to the FBI
anywhere from two hundred thousand to
three million plus by the way none of
this matters because the Second
Amendment ensures your right to
self-preservation period including
firearms period and yes that extends
beyond muskets to high-capacity guns
that were around back then like a Pelton
flintlock the public gun the Peckinpah
box revolver and by the way your toll
for exploiting this senseless tragedy to
try and forcibly strip us of our human
rights regardless okay
on what the show does that about cover
it I think that's a big pieces of human
shape if I could stand up and clap right
less than a minute that's pretty good
you can skip the entire CNN dialogue
we've covered all of that we've covered
every watch this AC worry your reference
mister internet skeptic do some research
guys then yourself I'm so tired of the
gun what bothers me is that is the
grandstanding the political
grandstanding the virtue signaling is
that they have the moral high ground
when their very position is evil and I
mean that is it no it's evil to disarm
law-abiding citizens what people call
something like what gives you the right
what who in the hell do you think you
are because someone did something bad
you think that you now have the right to
strip me of my god-given right to
self-defense
that's the problem with people countries
like Europe sorry spend computer that's
the problem with countries that don't
reckon
your rights coming from somewhere else
other than government sorry you get the
angry skeptic atheists mad and guess
what the Constitution recognizes it
rights were bestowed to us they were
bestowed upon us by God not by
government but these people don't
believe that they think they gave you
the rights that's why they think they
can take it away they think they can
tell you can't defend yourself because
something did something mean on a school
property
you know what it's terrible and it sucks
and I wish we could just say it's
terrible and it sucks I knows we could
just say God what an awful tragedy can't
we worn as a nation and the left talks
about coming together and finding common
ground how about you find common ground
shut your mouth and let the bodies be
buried before you push bulk legislation
that you know won't do anything and you
don't even abide by by yourself all
right in Olympic news
what's the outdoor sign pickets they're
out the Jamaican bobsled team coach has
just quit and she's taking the team sled
with her this comes to us from CBS
Sports the all-female bobsled team was
revealed in a series of first that's the
big thing got a series of firsts oh nice
first female Jamaican bobsled team like
come on but just days before their South
Korean debris that Sandra Curie Karis
Asus I have it right here
anyway former gold medalist for Germany
sure yeah but Germany has to import
their bombs that coaches Twitter post at
the helm of the team staff and she's now
threatening to keep the sled claiming
legal ownership so naturally this isn't
the news a team's very upset and
apparently they've been issuing veiled
threats to their former coach which is
already prompted Disney to purchase the
film rights why you running they
didn't know s.o.s locked it right off
that's the Canadian version and I think
she would already take in the sled but
she couldn't find a man to push it I
guess say you had an ax story they
wouldn't they asked the lady yes lady
yeah yeah she she had something to say
about her the sled and she responded my
not saying it I love is the actual
German yes yeah in her defense she only
knows two words mine and udin so she's
pretty here
the FBI language is now investigating a
funeral home for allegedly running a
side business selling body parts how to
make that money the federal inquiry
began several months ago shortly after
Reuters interviewed a half dozen workers
who formerly worked for Hess you notice
what he's actually not illegal I was
saying I guess there's nothing against
selling it for like medical expert oh
yeah I don't know something along you
can't sell your own organs but I guess
fire someone else officials they said
their suspicions were first raised at
court like without Capone as always
accounting discrepancies that's how they
caught it but it was later confirmed
when they saw the BOGO pancreas closeout
that was what tips it'll define oh
you're sorry to me it's never concerning
to me when a business minded person
fills a market it always concerns being
when I discover there's a mark or
something I never think there should be
I'm rocket for yes exactly that's what
concerns me
yeah these guys market for their lists
typically yes but other than that like
who's buying this I know someone who
won't be an org are you this is another
question of the day along with my first
one yeah are you an organ donor I know
some people say they don't wanna be an
organ donor because they think they'll
have the paddles like yeah that's true I
am a donor dang it to see if I was a
donor oh that's right you have the
wallet for a while I wasn't because he
can't be bothered carrying a wallet like
a man Iran has accused the west of using
lizards to spy on them this comes from
The Times of Israel the former chief of
staff of Iran's Armed Forces said
Tuesday that Western spies have used
lizards to attract atomic waves and spy
on his country's nuclear program the
lady doth protest too much nothing to
see here I think in Iran get any more
pair
my
put it pretty only agitator we'll deal
with it later can this officials have
now come out and said that guys it's
okay let's put up put on your game face
smile for the cameras Kansas officials
say this dog can't run for governor yeah
this is a real story the dog thought he
was a shoo-in because there
unfortunately for him his urine sample
did so Nick Nolte / Gary Busey of dogs
what if he just ends in a proper reveal
worried more trying again my yearbook
and I know it was weird looking back it
wasn't sweet Dyson I will say this my
wife will love this one because my wife
loves Dyson vacuums well someone's
saying are you saying yeah my wife does
actually I vacuum but my wife does most
of the vacuuming namely because I forced
her Dyson plans to bring a premium
electric car to market by 2020 this
comes from CNET the car is initially set
to feature solid-state batteries
technology in which I guess Dyson
they've been investing heavily now if
they can bring this technology to market
first it'll actually give em a huge leg
up on more established competitors I'm
sure you can guess thanks to the solid
state batteries higher energy density
and I guess that recharges more quickly
versus standard wet cells in other news
and what some people have seen as a
response
Elon Musk has announced his latest space
vacuum it's got a cup holder - a cup
holder only cost fourteen billion
dollars yeah I don't what well you were
saying something about the vacuum it
doesn't make any sense in space there's
an atmosphere right what do you tell me
there's no atmosphere in space they
still could have something to vacuum
well yeah but I mean that this no that
can't suck anything and doesn't know
nothing to work on right you mean no
force to work against yes
I mean there's still pressure but you
could create like a centrifuge
essentially feel like inside the back
vacuum right
I don't know this thing I don't know
well I mean let's say you go down to
different pressure in the ocean right
you still can keep a relatively
consistent pressure and we're talking
about space though yeah but they would
still I mean they could well they would
have to have some kind of a gasket I
mean they they vacuum don't they vacuum
stuff up in the in the spaceship in the
ship yes because they have some
atmosphere in the ship
yeah it's artificial
so you meant in this okay that makes
sense then okay in the spaceship beeping
outside do you think yeah it's just
vacuum when vacuuming
why wouldn't a q many thing outside a
spaceship well the photoshop look like
that just back hearing like the space
trash it's not factually accurate it was
a magazine spread from Tesla scaring
people off their money sorry we really
crossed wires there this is off to a
fantastic start you know it's funny
actually because you were the one who
really you can't stand Elon Musk and he
made news last week what was it because
of the launch of us is it the Space Act
I think they launched a new heavy
missile okay very sick so what what
happened with it was a it was a it
failed right because of the do you guys
know I don't know it was a Tesla RV it
wasn't a header it
what was it headed to the asteroid belt
and so it was supposed to know them the
middle Busan was supposed to land that
crashed and then it was supposed to go
to Mass beep-beep
supposed to go to where mas Mouse to
correct himself okay and instead oh
that's right and then yeah and then
instead what happened it when it's on
course to the asteroid belt right so
it's gonna crash that's I guess the
computer has no clue okay here you know
what I don't know how do you feel that
Leon musk I don't I think he's a dick I
I know everyone loves Elon Musk I think
I'm in the minority here it's like it's
like it's like people were saying the
Godfather is the best film ever right
I think Chinatown was the better movie
that year I think the guy father's fine
it's like Carol Burnett I don't find
Carol Burnett funny I'm in this small
minority I don't like Elon I don't find
the stuff he does that cool you know
this is we went to LA and the one guy
that might you bridge I was just like
just fawning over the new Tesla Model 3
it looks like a Ford Focus with the
facelift crap I get it but at some point
like I love guys that throw out crazy
audacious ideas right so that part of it
I like that's fine just other part I
don't government subsidy fund projects
that would never like to stand on if it
weren't for billions of dollars right
and that's the debate in that debate
right there right so engineers calling
him an idiot for tunneling and stuff
like that or whatever I which he might
be well he could very well be but hey go
go like test that's a good example it's
Elon it's the electric car okay
it's basically way to scam the
government out of money and let's
celebrities rich
people virtue signal with their electric
cars without government subsidies Tesla
would employ I think sales and Denmark
went down about spend commuter can bring
this up sixty percent once they started
phasing out the tax breaks there you go
from Bluebird so the government was a
Tesla and I talked about this what's the
the Prius back when I did a video at
PJTV in 2009 it was still losing Toyota
yeah money on everyone sold and it was
the most profitable hybrid vehicle at
that point yeah I think the Nissan Leaf
was a similar story was it yeah there's
only a subsidies I don't think it really
made the main well the story with the
Prius a lot of people not remember there
were a lot of other hybrid cars at that
point now yeah but the Prius is the only
one that was a driving guilt token you
know so they wanted to drive it there
were other there was basically the Honda
Civic Hybrid but you didn't get the
street cred Oh he drives a Prius he must
really have human oh by the way every
single person who can't drive got
together in Los Angeles and picked the
Prius as their car just worry about the
Tesla because you got liberals crazy
good but that you see ones driving
around you're like I know the guy isn't
the 1% yes that's that's what's
important because let me sort of set the
stage the government is taking taxpayer
money they're giving it to rich people
as a reward for purchasing these
pretentious I know they're fun to drive
I've heard they're fun
$7,500 rebate from the federal
government right on the purchase price
and I think some states like California
it's $2,500 or more they can add it up
to their own by the way like you said
the average household in you know the
average household income of a Tesla
owner has the owner Tesla model probably
Electra model 10 Model X is one and then
model 3 is the one that just came out
it's a big big deal I guess I don't know
okay five hundred and three thousand Wow
yeah where's Bernie I need help two men
where is Bernie next campaign should be
503 didn't buy as much as you think in
LA no it doesn't it doesn't it does not
buy as much pittance namely you're just
getting stabbed and you're 503 being
taken for pretty much yeah so then there
was a Solar City project the Solar City
reportedly received I think it's close
to 500 million dollars 490 something
millions fanless bring it up indirect
grants from the Treasury Department Wow
the cost of the government would be a
total of somewhere around between one
and two billion that was one point five
billion dollars I don't have it in front
of me I know Sven does do your jobs
phone computer which would include
Treasury grants paid to solar city
directly
sex everyone loves to talk about space
excuse me I'm not a huge fan of that you
want must thing because I think there's
a house of cards if you want to talk
about some guy being a brilliant there
are people who are brilliant
entrepreneurs or people who create
products and services that people want
they make their money and then there are
people who find a way to game the system
and I would say half a billion dollars
in direct government correct you're kind
of gaming the system
SpaceX same thing more government
subsidies about 20 million in economic
development subsidies from Texas to
construct the launch facility there and
then I think separate from whatever from
incentives SpaceX they've gotten is it
something like five point five million
over five billion over five billion in
government contracts that's a big thing
is you never know some of those
contracts are no bid
but contracts these are from NASA all
the way up to the Air Force overall you
have Musk's Empire never I get it I'm
gonna get tech people who are mad at me
I'm not saying I wish the guy I wish the
guy ill will at all but his empire has
taken in over five billion dollars from
the government it's not the same as it
even invented a mousetrap you say
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
all right glad to have our next guest
there's only a handful of guests so we
can do long-form interviews with a
little bit handful of guests with whom

still be interesting yeah we don't hit
our lives bye-bye yes 3dr yeah we dr.
Peterson and now you said our three he's

Dennis Prager sometimes there's an
underscore in there and Prager you the
real thing a guy does unbelievable mr.
Bricker thank you being back sir

interview with no no that's not true a
long interview with and still be
interesting I love that I do the same
thing but it shows you are monitoring
yourself for accuracy and that's very
impressive
thank you I also tried to correct my
grammar because I realized that I just I
just spoke out of turn it was just a
disaster to start and so I try to
correct it you know it's funny I right
away I have abandon any of my notes I
was going to ask you and this is the way
it goes I always talk when I tell people
to go hey you know you seem comfortable
speaking in front of an audience any
tips and I always say you'll never be
thought a fool if you speak simply and
effectively you see so many people
misuse words or try to use you from you
try to use sort of colloquialisms they
don't even understand it so if you don't
just stay away from it and no one's
gonna call you on it's like Joey
Tribbiani with a thesaurus yes exactly
have you did you learn that at an early
age I knew what a barrier I started
speaking at 21 and I and I oddly in a
very odd life I was sent to the Soviet
Union to learn things and I came back to
America
and and they said all young man who
speaks Russian just got back from the
Soviet Union so I had a lot of speeches
at a very very early age but I knew
immediately that the more I spoke real
that's my favorite word by the way
real real the more I spoke real the more
people listened and when I hear talk
show hosts often who or just starting
out or in even just mid-career and they
have a different way of speaking on the
radio than in real life and I tuned out
it's not interesting to me well and
therefore now this is Dennis Prager ITSO
talking Ceridian but nobody nobody talks
like that yes that's why people say when
they meet me Wow you're just the same as
on the radio and that's the greatest
compliment I can get they are right it's
the exact same guy that's true you're
you're taller than I expected I remember
when I first met you that's a shock to
people yeah you know I think it is a
shock to people looking at me now I'm
six foot four but looking at me now I
could be four foot three it's true
we have no idea you know what it is I
think it's because you're proportional
and I've talked a lot of you'll think
wow you're a lot taller than I expected
you know people like if you think of
Sean Hannity or a lot of these you know
these newscasters or Anderson Cooper
they have these big square head it's
Josh Brolin yeah they have heads like
refrigerators and then they're tiny guys
are not big guys whereas you have a head
like a normal person I'm not saying you
have a shrunken head you have a normal
head and so in comparison to short guys
with a big head the camera it's a it's a
total facade people don't realize it's
not an accurate representation of who
you are yeah yeah well you have to worry
about it because you do a lot of radio
but still you know you got your hair and
it's it's going well for you um let me
let me let me ask you this it's funny
you just said real I was just watching
this filmed all eyes on me with Tupac
and that's a I this is true and I'm
watching it and they gloss over his ten
arrests and they gloss over you know
that he just so happy well he just so
happened to be in the room where a rape
occurred with his manager and I glossed
over he just so happened I was be wrong
place wrong time when he shot people who
happened to be undercover cops but it
was always you know keep it real and he
talked about how much he loved his mom
and keep it real respect our women but
all
he did was disrespect women it's become
this cloak keep it real when people
couldn't be keeping it more fake I
wonder if that's the appeal with you I'm
not saying your your you know an
old-timer but you're older than me but
you have a very young audience
I think it's authenticity not all that's
a very interesting subject you raised in
general because I have this odd life of
having done the same thing at 21 that
I'm doing today which is publicly
speaking I can tell you a fascinating
thing that I never would have predicted
when I go to colleges which I do
regularly to speak uh I obviously know
my audience as you know your audience a
good speaker knows their audience young
people take me more seriously the older
I get when with all of the stuff about
the you know society is youth mania and
youth worship the fascinating truth is
but Bernie Sanders was an example yeah
the fascinating truth is that a lot of
people get more credibility with young
people as they get older
well you I think I think some of that is
because I think we're finding ourselves
more and more amidst generations who
don't have those father-son
father/daughter talks I think that's I
think it all to you because there's like
there's a hunger in a in a market for
people who dennis prager shaped hole in
their hearts yeah yeah exactly to speak
so my wisdom I need people's lives you
know
seriously it's I get I get a lot of
attacks and I get a lot of compliments
and one of the compliments that really
does mean a lot to me is especially when
a guy calls up and says you're like a
father figure to me and I always say I'm
happy for you and I'm happy for me
because we guy needs a father figure
either in his own father or in addition
to his own father
yeah sure and every every woman needs a
father figure unless you want to install
a stripper pole in the trailer park that
is very very some prices pretty right
well let me ask you this because this
transitions to what we were about to
talk about Prager University
but this teaches a lot of
and I will say by the way the age thing
is true of always said it's not about
age it's about relevancy and I don't
necessarily even think it's because
you're older I think it's that you
maintain relevancy and I think you're
become more and more relevant in this
age of identity politics and populism
some form of consistency that people can
use as a reference point when I was on
Fox News and I was the youngest
contributor I made sure I said don't
ever use my age because I never wanted
to be the young guy who came out just
either my ideas are good or they're not
and I think yours are good and it's
about relevancy do you think that's why
I know you guys have a lawsuit maybe
clarify for people who don't know from
prag are you with YouTube these videos
are so family-friendly they're so benign
I guess as far as the hate speech
guidelines but almost all of them are
restricted do you think some of that
targeting is because you're relevant
because you reach people there's no
other possible explanation for those of
your viewers who don't know I'll be very
brief we put out five-minute videos
every week we have about 300 out there
the people who present these videos are
some of the finest minds in the world
whether MIT Stanford Harvard the you
know the usual gang for Pulitzer Prize
winners you will well anything you're no
no you're a fine mind I mean we wouldn't
have had you what for any other reason
you you have your perfect example you
have something relevant to say well I
pre and we appreciate that in any event
you know we put out stuff like you know
Victor Davis Hanson who was his
mild-mannered a human as I have ever met
five minutes on the Korean War
why is that on the restricted list I'll
tell you why because it paints America
positively right wherever we have a
video that paints America or Israel
positively YouTube has put it on the
restricted list which means that if a
family filters out pornography it can't
get that video libraries by definition
can't get it in schools my definition
can't get it now you've seen our stuff
it is the antithesis
of pornography I mean give me a break
its intellectual pornography one could
make the case
what progress its intellectual put to
pornography will make you that's right
yeah no no I agree with you by
forgetting I on everything i mounted the
drugs but but the intellect should get
you high I agree with you on that and in
any event it's purely political they
they don't want an effective
conservative voice and were very
effective we had six hundred million
views last year and most of them were
under 35 years of age yeah well we
talked about this
forward publishing and pray are you
people we went out to with YouTube in
New York I've talked about this on the
Joe Rogan show and your people and the
the forward publishing daily wire people
were the only other people in that room
who stood up everyone was sitting there
quietly kind of nodding and they gave us
a nice lunch in the cheese spread and
talked about the new guidelines
fantastic hummus it was fantastic hummus
it was world-class Google spared no
expense but then I remember I stood up
and said hold on a second we're all here
because we're losing our ability to make
a living on a platform that you actually
advertise to us you advertise to us your
platform for us to use your platform
exclusively to make our living can we
talk about this and some conservatives
think tanks were oh hush don't rock the
boat they wanted to be there and mingle
play game the Prager University lawsuit
and I said it makes sense we're not
playing around I know you aren't playing
around or you're playing for keeps
rather what is what is the status of
this is it a lawsuit exactly is it a
petition for information I don't want to
misspeak no no it is a lawsuit okay
there's it's a breach of contract they
they claim that they will allow anything
that is not pornographic or the like or
incites violence on on their platform so
they either have to change their
platform and say we are open to all
views left-of-centre not two views right
of center or they have to in fact allow
our videos up I mean so it's really it's
a lawsuit
in in not not only because it's a
lawsuit but it's an attempt to get them
to say the truth and the truth at this
moment is that YouTube owned by Google
is political have they
how have they acknowledged your
complaints and they responded at all
what's what's there just a cura stay had
to respond and the response is fairly
weak cheese oh well we're a private
enterprise we could do what we want sure
all of a sudden that all of a sudden
they're big on private enterprise right
but believe me if a baker doesn't want
to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding
right they're not for private enterprise
no no or when it comes to net neutrality
they're the biggest supporters they want
to force ISPs to to play by rules
unfitted in 2015 and we're doing it for
the little guy well what about the
little guy making a living who disagrees
with you I'm gonna trample him so you
said this is I find interesting I didn't
know this because I assumed all of our
stuff it just gets D monetized or
restricted because they find it
offensive fine you know painting
Mohammed as Bob Ross I get it
I don't agree with it but I understand
it but Frager you videos like you said
there you have some of the best minds
you said anything that's Pro America I
understand Israel because of these sort
of I guess sort of I guess you would say
Jewish secularists in Silicon Valley who
have some sort of fascination with
Palestine I don't know what it is
Houston and feminists but it's a big
movement Alice Tinian feminists they are
very anti-israel I've known that for a
long time but pro-america videos you
notice get dinged oh of course that's
why the Korean War one or or one name
that this is hilarious we have one
called America must lead some left-wing
site also has a video called America bus
lead there's is a hun and ours it's
restricted and so where wherever people
should look at the list they go to
Prager you've got to come they could
read the whole lawsuit they could see
what's on the list of the 40 that are
restricted and again if it's if it shows
America in a favorable light the chances
are it will be restricted when you say
you understand the Israel part not the
America part they're very related
one of my books is called why the Jews
it's it's in third edition with Simon &
Schuster and it's an explanation of
anti-semitism but the interesting thing
is that in the third edition I show that
anti-americanism is a variant of
anti-semitism for the exact same reason
Jews have been hated America is hated
and and it's so they do go hand in hand
I don't know anybody for example who who
loves Israel and doesn't love America or
loves America doesn't love it it's very
rare right they almost always or hates
one but not the other that is true they
almost go hand in hand it's kind of for
example you know Joe Rogan was accused
of being an all right not see it because
he had an American flag behind him to
them that's basically my little be the
flag of the Third Reich they see the
American flag they see you with a flag
pin they see patriotic symbolism the
left assumes you're an enemy and just as
surely if I see someone who's patriotic
I go oh he's probably at the very least
moderate or slightly right of center
yeah that's right well the giveaway was
when when Donald Trump gave his speech
in Warsaw last year and said we need to
protect Western civilization the New
York Times said it was a white
supremacist dog was right yeah there was
a dog whistle
yeah Western civilization Western
civilization right don't tell that to
the black and Asian Americans who've
pulled themselves out of poverty in
record numbers in comparison to any
other civilization in the history of
humanity that is interesting that is by
the way why the Jews from Dennis burger
not to be confused with why it's the
Jews by Mel Gibson totally different
look different direction sorry mr.
Prager I know you're both critically
acclaimed both critically acclaimed for
different reasons you know it's funny
that you mentioned the Winter Olympics
are underway and I've noticed this
certainly a lot of the American athletes
and a lot of these competitors worldwide
when they're interviewed when they win
their medals they talk about their
experience or you know my journey not so
much their country and obviously
competing this pride of country or
certainly not as it used to be you know
that America is the greatest force for
good and if you look back in the 40s and
50s and 60s there was a lot of pride you
were
for your country have you noticed that
stark contrasts between I guess sort of
the the post-event interviews today and
those of your EIN watch them as much as
I should to answer you properly but i
I've noticed it over the course of time
look the left hates nationalism except
for one there's one nationalism on earth
they're in love with Palestinian yeah
but outside of Palestinian nationalism
since Marx remember that communist
manifesto ends proletariat of the world
unite
you have nothing to lose but your chains
they divided the world between worker
and owner not between American and
German and French and English they
wanted to abolish national identity from
Marx to today's Democratic Party that
has been a consistent they have no
interest they have contempt for national
identity
right and that's why they for open
borders yes they don't care if ask a
leftist what if 50 million people came
in tomorrow and American identity were
there by simply diluted they go so what
right American identity is fascist
anyway which is for a couple of ironies
they're Palestine not a nation also the
fact that you as you mention okay here
all the stuff you wanted we have gay
marriage now you the trans people can
you know they can hop on up to any
urinal they want
isn't that a national identity you're
proud was compared to people of enforced
abortions of North Korean internment
camps you're saying that Kim Jong sister
stole the show at the ceremony how about
just relating to the national identity
that you've helped create here modern
progressives it's it's it really is
crazy to me modern America is something
they fought for too they should be happy
with well liberals for fourth the left
has always been opposed it's at your
daily statement of mine on my radio show
that liberalism and leftism have almost
nothing in common
the problem is Lib
don't know it hmm that's that's the
there are a few liberals like Harvard
professor what's his name uh Alan
Dershowitz yeah the harvard law
professor who is a big liberal a big
supporter of Hillary Clinton he said to
me and it's on camera it's coming out in
our movie no safe spaces later this year
and they want to dude with Adam Carolla
right and yeah and he said the left is a
much greater threat to liberalism than
the right yeah yeah I think well here's
one thing though I he can say that all
he wants and I agree with him but at a
certain point people like gerschwitz
they do have to say hold on a second
there is no official representation
whatsoever of my point of view in
today's Democratic Party it doesn't
exactly
it's a left-wing party it is no longer a
liberal party Franklin D Roosevelt the
Liberals hero Franklin D Roosevelt
regularly spoke about the need to defend
not only Western civilization but
Christian civilization if a president
said that today they would be
impeachment a movement for impeachment
yeah no that's an important point to me
by the way also the guy who did the
internment camp we were just talking
about that's left left his folk hero
after year do you guys remember this
this wasn't a guy who was necessarily
soft on foreign policy kind of went a
little too far some people argue in that
direction but you know this is one
difference I see from the right in the
left they talk about how closed-minded
the right is and I talked about this I
think with Ruben in Rogan who's like
they say way and its political tribalism
I go hold on a second the right you can
have someone like Dennis Prager you can
have steven crowder you can have Ben
[Music]
there put some mug in the basket I it
puts the mug in the basket it does
whatever its toll Oh place of a mug in
the basket I I just can't really push
the ball to the basket or gets the hose
again
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yes that is the sound of the weekend
because it is the Thursday livestream on
the YouTube so glad to be with you we
were in Virginia Tech rattling so there
was no show I haven't introduced you yet
great guests roaming millennial we have
the hodgetwins who are always
entertaining and hey we're still alive
budgets budgets save lives producer with
me in video studio as always as Jared
who is now a filing on Twitter and not
gay Jared me at as credit with your
comments your thoughts your photo shops
your t-shirts if you came out to a
recent show pictures I fulfill my legal
obligations draw your own conclusions
are we good we are good mostly at G
Morgan Jr is here sommelier and chief
simplified wine.com what's one of the
day you didn't take me to Virginia Tech
we didn't take you to bring your tech
and with good reason for example Paul
Paul Meyer Meyer our show helping with
research and overlays at Sen computer
doing well hello yeah by the way that's
fine computer soiled himself at Virginia
Tech no no joke there's hundreds out I
better look at my shoes look they're
vets now I think I consult bill Richmond
yep yeah sorry he doesn't work with
crowds
all right you must go so uh question of
the day we were going everyone's time
off I see and we're talking about the
budget that was okay we'll talk about
that but Lori mainly want to talk about
Prime Minister Trudeau and obviously he
did the people kind comment recently so
we went back to the archives and just
looked at the worst most cringe-worthy
but we have a top five on Trudeau but I
asked you this hint it was hard to
choose yes it was very very difficult to
call it down there's no winner really
there's no top five it's a low light
less of a highlight which this is a
question remove your political goggles
for a second who do you genuinely think
is more mockable
I think if you're even if you're North
Korean and they asked like Kim jong-un
yeah I could see how you think he's a
character
you know like Trudeau or president
Donald Trump obviously President Donald
Trump has some gaps but Trudeau just
uses social justice warrior lexicons
like ones
we don't even a lexicon I don't even
think the social justice where your
lexicon publishers knew existed
ironically if you're just gonna take
someone and run a highlight and say I'm
not going to write anything to make fun
just listen to him who do you think is
more embarrassing who do you think runs
the country yes
oh yeah that's actually good point
there's no doubt as to President Trump
that he runs the country they allowed
you to be a father much less all right
went to get to news today Nancy Pelosi
of course you know this we had to talk
about an eight-hour marathon speech that
she had set the record for longest
continuous speech at least since 1909
boy of course many suspected it was just
a complex marketing scheme by Snickers
as evidence when Pelosi concluded her
speech with a chocolate bar and turned
into being a not not I'm still guys
fiber netic founder yeah sent from the
future to destroy us all I'm gonna see
that on network TV we just figure we
start out right out of the gate let you
know we're about San Diego let's show
boom san diego's adopted now new
safeguards against skew homeless people
the city garbage truck San Diego
officials have completed investigation
following some near deaths with homeless
people last year and have issued new
rules to make sure that doesn't happen
again a lot but San Diego a lot of
people think San Francisco San Diego
obviously a lot of homeless people yeah
really big cities in California so they
did this investigation they've released
a memo and some of the changes actually
makes sense you know for example garbage
trucks in San Diego used to come on
Mondays and Thursdays and now they'll be
coming never they just to avoid all the
people in the gut that's the only
solution silly leftists you could have
just recycle worthless
yeah that's what we need to do thought
it was corn the renewable resource to
take us into the future is hobo Merrill
I'm pretty sure Johnny Depp is just a
recycled hobo yes back from the grave
yeah he's a hobo who lives he's
energized through the power of beating
women you could also not hit I mean this
is pretty
well rent control that's it's hard to
get rid of that man at your is contract
man well you know he does sorry in
Ithaca high school just canceled their
Hunchback of Notre Dame musical after a
white student landed the lead role
because at best this is cultural
appropriation the student group wrote
alleging racial bias from the Performing
Arts program at IHS and quote at worst
it is whitewashing a racist casting
practice which has its roots in
minstrelsy yeah this is well actually
this is where we are now the outrage is
the lead in Hunchback of Notre Dame yeah
so it really shouldn't come as any
surprise we spurred this curious protest
seemingly at first if it goes own MC
hunch back in his noted sidekick DJ
little moto this one was just kind of
scraping people not offended all of the
blacks and Ithaca who aren't hunchbacks
it's a new frontier by the way we still
have in 1740s France black royalty and
powdered wigs and white face and Beauty
and the Beast we're gonna make that's
okay punch pack of Notre Dame
there's no one fighting for that I don't
know who's fighting for that it that's
that's the least role you would ever
want yeah aren't you that exactly
besides is probably you're like a funky
looking dude purpose a TV in there
anyways
Notre Dame in the show band I'm like oh
there's one that went right over Gerald
spend computer maybe you can fact check
some sense of humor firm bring that up
for the dome Tammy's upcoming Hunchback
it's time to hashtag hunch forward
that's all we're saying
lunch board okay here's a story that's
kind of sad but not I mean it's it is
sad but not to us
fentanyl was actually recently found in
Anna Locke's own kit given out at a
pharmacy oops
so fentanyl which the well noted opioid
painkiller was accidentally placed into
a naloxone kit which is for those who
don't know it's kind of like methadone
is to heroin it's a kit designed to wean
people off of painkiller addiction
of course the pharmacist in question was
fired was the supervisor citing the
reason being that he like did the
only thing you're not supposed to do
with any opioid addiction kit it's the
first rule of painkiller don't give them
the customer in question was thinking
this is the easiest withdrawal ever
sobriety is its own reward is strikingly
similar start with the oh he's calling
all his family mom I feel good I feel
better than I've ever felt clean I'm
just you know what I'm really doing it
when they find out actually you just had
a higher dose of I've never had before
but I'm okay with it
was that part of you bit about a you
know a runner sighs just as good as
heroin I think guys like ever tried
heroin speaking of missing the mark
senator angus King of Maine has finally
accomplished what he set out to do in
getting an official lobster moji for
months the senator he lobbied for this
Lobster emoji highlighting its cultural
and economic significance to the state
let's bring us up CNN I think we just
run it for like two seconds there you go
on Wednesday the Unicode consortium is a
thing announced the emoji would be added
to its library a move that Senator King
has hailed as quote great news and we
want to risk shutting down this
government are you out of your tree sir
most happy about this new emoji all the
witty millennial sea-captains
yeah it's gonna come I guess more ammo I
don't need that next to your cat gifts
that guy's gonna be an editor BuzzFeed
watch very quickly
always so soon by the way I think
between the pitch meeting in this this
moment right now we missed there's new
black redheaded emojis oh that's right
yes those happen in nature well they do
they're called albinos and they
typically are they're typically
particularly soul sucking vampires
that's the truth yeah I get
uncomfortable twins who will be on later
in the show because they're black and
they have like light green eyes yeah I'm
like you got your you're a shoo-in for a
reboot of Buffy
no dad straight out of Blade yeah I
don't even have never watched played
because I watch better butter shows I
admitted it was worse is that a film
yeah played your but you're an adult
correct well at the time I was not sure
I was that kind of slow hey man you
gonna come with us you laid three pretty
no not at all that won't be there so
that we were we were facing you were
looking off the the cliff of a potential
government shutdown today so thinking we
all we just it is it is a dance with
death it is a cruel reality of nature
like every time we talk about this we'll
talk about it with Roman millennial it's
just whoever is the opposition party
just uses it as political football so
sure and by the way not a great deal
when you look at the increase not really
we're not really talking there are no
fiscal conservatives representing anyone
right now yeah well they'd see Pelosi
stay home have shut the government down
yes yes let's do it
right well people now people were
terrified terrified of what would happen
without the government and if you listen
to the news if it we know about what
would happen because we we've lived
through it
[Music]
breaking rules with a threat of a
government shutdown looming over the
United States of America money systems
find themselves uncertain as to the
outcome and unpredictable nature of
their immediate future and what
[Music]
you don't know who yours sometimes does
you love the most we fought for the
wrong side there are real big bucks hey
speaking of victims
so as fen computer you know I got flack
for talking on Joe Rogan about the the
normally high taxes in Germany for for
young men and and you were getting flack
for it so this is this is your segment
yes beep beep so Germany I love how he's
not nervous until he's in the hot seat
as like yeah yes we don't do well under
pressure
unless exerting it would you carry out
the service I'm a computer yeah I don't
know you're an insubordinate
once you've carried out the Holocaust
nothing fazes you he can joke about it
he has the Holocaust past okay go go
ahead stand by Peter correct because he
won't given you flak obviously and you
know you know this better than anyone
Germany has the second highest tax rate
in the world yes and the average tax
burden for a single person is forty nine
point four percent now 15 only fifteen
point nine percent beep beep of that is
your actual income tax right so
obviously a lot of other taxes like your
VA t v-- beep your your mandatory health
care okay
so there goes top tax bracket I think
it's forty two percent target is forty
two percent which starts at $65,000
already BP which you know it's not crazy
money exactly beep yeah and no added to
that of course is again your all your
medical stuff your health care your
Social Security or VA t so it comes out
as something pretty pretty crazy yeah
it's it's insane it's basically you are
paying an insane amount of taxes if you
are just a young male who is employed at
a normal level yeah but - don't go there
because you might pay high taxes or get
gassed god well using that pass won't we
need this button anymore well this will
be changed out for a an ice speed dial
they are the only one in our top five
right speaking of top five top five we
have today we want to talk about because
I keep wondering it's a Pierre Justin
Trudeau will have Canadian on roaming
one day after this did
the whole people kind but we'll get to
that but we have our five top Trudeau
cringe moments I want to ask you this as
someone who was Canadian I voted for
Stephen Harper how how do you guys see
Trudeau did you think about Canadian
politics at all before Trudeau because
it's kind of a celebrity I didn't know I
don't think I even knew who the Prime
Minister of Canada was before as she was
a paint maybe I wasn't paying attention
but I feel like he has been shoved in
the limelight because of the suave
little were you familiar with Stephen
Harper or not so much not at all okay he
was like our Ronald Reagan and that's I
was talking about Joe Rogan about it
going like listen like it's okay to mock
him but the fact is all these comedians
mocked Stephen Harper because he was the
Christian conservative right we didn't
have the housing crisis like he did a
really we were higher on the economic
freedom index for the first time in the
United States when he had Harper and
President Obama oh my god could you
imagine if we had eight years of overlap
between Trudeau and Obama oh that's the
stuff that gives kids nightmares I don't
think most Americans spend any time
thinking about Canadian politics though
so no a shoe earned himself in he seems
to be somewhat fashionable and he says
stupid stuff that the left loves nobody
they don't really but they don't know
they're stupid that's the thing is it is
like the sky like Kim jong-un but a
totally different lack of self-awareness
er yeah okay so let's go through the
worst possible moments I don't even
think Gerald has seen you so number five
we all agreed is his Bollywood dance
Fiasco let's roll that buy that outfit
and decided he was gonna do the girl
version of the band because that's a man
you want to trust national security
there's like in a back room at a why I'm
in the back room at a Hilton Garden Inn
haha
they only got half the room to the only
thing more cringy itself is the
Canadians just fawning over it
they're just love them I remember seeing
JB Rochelle in the interview recently
he's like well you know we uh we like
our Prime Minister obviously was Trump
and now you know we tease him a bit you
know he's very good-looking
insufferable just absence mind-numbing
walking vagina that's one you make fun
of him okay metaphor is uh who can
forget this one he was asked why he had
so many women in his cabinet what
obvious answer is obvious I understand
one of the priorities for you was to
have a cabinet that was gender balanced
why was that so important to you
because it's 2015 I look it's met with
cheers just as surely if he'd have said
because they're the most qualified
people for the job and that's the only
reason he would have been met with Oh
exactly spot two looks like ah yeah
prepare for this that's how easily there
a law days it what day is it the left is
that all the time we've talked about it
they just say it's time for this yeah
it's time for same-sex marriage okay
it's time for an all-woman cabinet I
guess it's time for a black president
I never realized time for a woman
president old on I was telling it before
it's time
there's Bruce Buffer wire chop tied four
drafts I've equal equality marriage in
and just just filling the gap with
arcade machine it's time psyphon to
promote a paedophile three times in a
row it's time it's time for generic old
white guys to beat the till over the
ship every now and then hardest people I
don't but I said it's time that's true
doesn't that work okay so number three
is the recent one let's analyze this
this is one of course the infamous from
this week people kind joke and I'm aware
as to what people say about this clip
let's roll at first maternal love is the
love that's going to change the future
of mankind
so we'd like you to look we would like
to say people kind not necessarily
mankind
okay yes thank you we can all learn from
each other now he said that's a joke
mm-hmm she's clearly not aware it's a
joke the audience not aware it's a joke
and it seems not like the kind of a joke
that a progressive would make now this
is where the took the preponderance
evidence the totality of all the clips
we show you would lead one to believe
it's not a joke because he could watch
it and say I think maybe what no I don't
think it was a joke and something else
this is actually what what happened with
Andrew Breitbart this is a story Shirley
Sherrod everyone came down on him
because Shirley Sherrod was fired she
worked in the agricultural department
again people know the exact title she
was giving a speech to the n-double-a-cp
and she talked about a white farmer
coming to her and she said I didn't I
did not offer him the full extent of my
help because of his race and the
n-double-a-cp claps now when Andrew
Breitbart posted this article he posted
it and he said just so you know at
minute 20 her humanity eventually gets
the better of her and she does go on to
say that she then realized it wasn't
about race and she helped white and
black farmers alike so this was posted
the original time Andrew Breitbart
posted the video he said but the
reaction from the n-double-a-cp at that
snapshot in time was to clap and sheer
simply at her saying I didn't help the
white person right so he was and then of
course an editor at Bill O'Reilly took
it out of context thought we can make
this lie sexier than the truth and
Shirley Sherrod got fired and they said
Andrew Breitbart into that context when
he never did his point was the
n-double-a-cp reaction the reaction
there from the audience tells no one
there thought it was a joke no yeah you
said you also said inclusive yeah you
progressives and joke about inclusivity
like now after following this is after
the women in cabinet
yeah I've team now sudden it's it's a
topic right for satire the exercise a
problem with the English language man is
inclusive yeah man does not necessarily
mean just you you can use it to mean
everyone come on yeah I know but that's
the thing is because they're trying to
score points with a fence I know yeah
exhausting what you looking at jump in
there same computer yeah well be
whenever I see Trudeau I just I just
want to actually embraces his lifestyle
babe if you just stance and then off the
mirror every morning just goes how
they're such a giant
you never know what you're gonna get
from that German you're a terrible
computer but I think you okay here's
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
there we go glad to have our guests so
this is a long-form interview it is for
now and then it's kind of first twenty20
team first or 2018 the reason is because
we are going to be a bridging attack
February 6th true so we need to buy some
time on the road they're only select a
few people who are worthy of long-form
interviews very very it's a boiler alert
it's not you that's never ma so our next
guest he's been making the rounds and
he's probably as viral right now he's as
hot a ticket has ever been his book is
that of course the 12 rules for life
you've been reading it quite a bit been
reading it I've had to look at the cliff
notes because I have it in my queue
right now I have Erica I think Eric
Metaxas his book on Martin Luther that
I'm finishing and he'll be on the show
too but this is of course by dr. Jordan
Pederson you can also do the self
authoring program if you go to use a
promo code Crowder you get 25% off
because I'm a basket case so it's helped
me so if you're as messed up as me he
can be as useful for you of course he's
on the Twitter at Jordan B Peterson dr.
Peterson thank you for being here sir
thanks for the invitation well no of
course and you knew you were gonna get
an invitation I think you invited
yourself as a matter of fact oh yeah
yeah well yeah it's my live stream yes
exactly
well come on we have some firepower even
if they happen to be some people who you
might not necessarily want your fan base
um so first off this book it's been
selling like hotcakes correct what's
what's the reaction been by and large
and I know there's been viral videos but
the book it's spelt itself what kind of
feedback have you gotten well it's it's
hovering between number one and number
two on Amazon in Canada the US the UK
and Australia and it's the same on the
bestseller lists the big bestseller
lists like the Wall Street Journal and
the London Times and all that it's crazy
it's selling like mad yeah for those who
haven't read it kind of give them
obviously a bit of a summary you know
what's what this stems from what what
kind of data is it is it you know by and
large a big component of or is I should
say maybe the self authoring program a
big component of this book well part of
what the book does what promote is the
idea that you need a vision in life and
a strategy and so that's a good overlap
with the self authoring program isn't
doesn't make
cific reference to the program but it I
would say provides the psychological and
philosophical and ethical underpinnings
for what what we're doing with the self
authoring program and so the idea
basically is is that well that there's
no doubt that life is difficult and that
people get betrayed and that hard things
are coming down the pipeline for
everyone all the time but that if you
organize your life reasonably and face
it courageously and make a plan so that
you're not just a leaf in the wind and
try to do things that are meaningful
then you can extract out path of being
from all of that that's worthwhile and
Noble and helpful and productive and all
of those things and and so the book is a
description of of how you might do that
and but more importantly why right
couple of things are there that could be
this is one of those issues that I
notice a lot with your interviews what
you just said right now if I were
looking to mince it I could say that
sexist against men why because he talked
about organizing your life this book
effectively is using a trait or teaching
people how to best enact a trait that is
actually pretty women have naturally
more than men organizational skills this
is something you talk about now if I
were looking to mince that as a radical
left is when they say well that's sexist
that's a byproduct of patriarchy you
extolling the virtues of organizational
capabilities could easily be turned as
so you're saying women are better than
men because they're more organized
here's here's where here's where you get
wrong because in the book y'all sucks
about how order is a stem of masculinity
in chaos from femininity so he does it
out okay
explain yourself haha are you teasing
poor Kathy Newman from channel 4 again
net well okay see that's that's what we
call a segue he was he was okay before
we get to Kathy Newman yeah um I'm
refraining here before we get to Kevin
your rise has obviously been meteoric
here this last year which will also be a
test of your northeast narcissism we'll
have to test those levels afterward
because often the kids right you know
right well I'm trying to keep that and
my existential terror is keeping the old
narcissism under control
well we'll test that later on in the
program but in the states large positive
feedback say
it seems in UK for people not named
Kathy Newman but Canada still a lot of
people there hate you what's interesting
to me is this is effectively a self-help
book I can't remember in my lifetime I'm
I'm sure someone will fact-check me here
I'm sure it's happened but certainly not
to this degree that a self-help book
has been met with so much backlash why
do you think that is because ultimately
what you are doing as someone who's
who's gone through the self authoring
program you are looking to help people
that's your goal well you know what I
took a stand against the radical
leftists that started about it's almost
18 months ago now and if you take a
stand against the radical leftists then
they immediately try to paint you as a
super villain of the right and so that's
just continuing in Canada or not with
everyone I mean I have many journalists
who are supporting what I'm doing in
Canada but it's definitely polarized and
like there was an article in Canada's
so-called national newspaper The Globe
and Mail this week which by the way is
failing dismal E as it moves forward
through time that really was a hip piece
and and it's an attempt by the people I
would say on the radical left or people
who are just misinformed to tar everyone
who dares to stand up to their
hypocritical and racist idiocy by making
the case that they're associated with
like far-right thinking which is just
preposterous it's first of all you don't
you don't have to be far-right to
dislike the radical left you just have
to be sensible and reasonable and not
full to the brim with resentment and
false what do you call that false
compassion so the problem is is if the
radical left admits that someone like me
actually happens to be reasonable then
they have to admit that reasonable
people can object to what they're doing
and then if reasonable people can object
to it then there's always the
possibility that there's something wrong
with it imagine that something wrong
with identity politics and identifying
people by race and ethnicity and and
construing the world as victim and
victimizer I would renowned I would
reduce that and just say imagine
something being wrong period
right and wrong you know that's just
amazing to me and you see that in some
interviews with you let me say one thing
if okay let's do a little test a little
bit of the narcissist in you this is
obviously the most viral interview I
think you've done with Kathy with Kathy
Newman
what would you say yes okay yes
definitely and it's one where I've seen
even leftists if you look at the
feedback saying okay this is an example
of someone who I disagree with but this
person is reasonable the feedback on the
Kathy Newman interview is almost
entirely positive would you say that's a
compared with other interviews that were
seen as more polarizing when you say
that's a relatively accurate assessment
yeah the only exception would be that
there was a flurry of newspaper articles
after the interview came out claiming
that Kathy Newman was victimized by my
evil army of trolls because I seem to
apparently have an evil army of five
million trolls yes which is a lot of
trolls you know at some point you start
wondering if the trolls are just normal
people yeah but yes I would say that the
apart from the press and there was a lot
they were they want people to think you
have direct access to Jim Henson's
Creature Shop and you're sending them
out yeah it's exactly and well in The
Guardian claim and Channel four as well
that they had to bring in the police to
do a security analysis and and you can
bring in the police under any
circumstances doesn't mean that the
threats are credible and I don't think
they produced any evidence whatsoever
that the threats the threats so-called
were credible but yes I would say
overwhelmingly the consensus is that
Kathy Newman conducted that interview in
a highly biased ideologically rigid
confrontational and inappropriate manner
okay good so I just want to make sure
that we recap this so your most viral
interview and certainly the feedback
among amongst viewers and listeners as
positive as we've seen this year let's
kind of separate the media from it a
little bit because you know yeah when
it's more wrong so yeah so I think a big
question here is you know why is that
why were you so successful at this and
obviously you're wildly successful so by
the way take this or leave it and I am
not at all assuming that four people
hold your comments and I know anything
more than Jordan Pederson on any given
topic he's a doctor I'm not got it what
I will say is this as an intellectual as
kind of an existentialist and you've
talked about this sometimes you can be
almost too smart for your own good
what I think you did with this interview
so well certainly I would say more
perfectly than I've seen in any other
interview is this this form of I've
talked about a pattern disruption in
sometimes you'll you'll wax on sometimes
which is in a way that's very
intelligent but the viewer may not
necessarily directly correlate it to a
point I think what you do with Kathy new
one that was so effective is you asked a
follow-up question
you made her clarify her questions which
showcased them as absurd and you lasered
in on an answer better than I think I've
ever seen you do not that you haven't
done it well but you did it with every
question here it was almost like a boxer
just coming back making her overreach
and straight down the pipe that's what I
saw would you say maybe that's why
didn't know oh there he is yeah it was
fortunate to have handled that interview
properly I think what clued me in I
think very rapidly was when we when I
first sat down with her in front of the
cameras before they were running she was
very friendly and engaging and chirpy
and and you know I thought that we were
actually going to have a conversation
because that's what we were having
before the cameras rolled but as soon as
the cameras went on it was like she was
a completely different person and what
happened in some sense was that I I the
clinical psychologist in me turned on
because that was such a dramatic shift
in character I thought oh there's
something strange going on here and so I
got really detached from the interview
now I not completely detached because it
was still a high-pressure situation I
would say but I started just to watch
what she was doing instead of taking it
personally and what I realized almost
immediately was that the person she was
talking to bore virtually no resemblance
to me and so it was hard to take it
personally you know like if people come
after you with attacks let's say or
insults or or they're after your
character and they and they cut close to
the bone well that's one thing but if
they come at you with all sorts of
accusations that really bear no
relationship whatsoever to either what
you think or what you said
then it's easier to be detached and I've
also been trying hard to maintain a
sense of humor through everything that's
happened over the last 18 months and
that's been difficult
partly because I've had very serious
health problems and of course that makes
having a sense of humor difficult but
also because in many situations I had a
lot on the line and wasn't sure how it
was going to go but my sense of humor
has returned and although I don't know
if you can tell that in this interview
yet but it has there's this ironic
because usually in this this is one of
the few places people go Jordan Peterson
laughing but I'm just facet I wanted to
get to this you seem more relaxed yeah
you seem more relaxed in the interview
flip more I hate to use word but use
this a lot in in combat sports more
fluid you know you just you were able to
take what she gave you and every time
return it back tenfold and and it's
almost like you know that analogy you're
a tiger who kind of has to bleed a
little bit before you're in the fight
I've noticed that when you're with
friendly people there's no time
constraint you have so much room to you
know expand upon an idea sometimes being
framed in by someone else who's
confrontational might bring out the best
in you and I think we saw that it was
formidable yeah well it's a lot easier
to have a sense of humor when you're not
feeling 3/4 dead right yeah so you know
my health is back I'm in pretty good
shape again and so it's a lot easier to
be sharp as well and to pay attention to
what's going on but also to to do to
have a bit of a lighter touch and I've
always struggled with that with the
material I deal with because it's so
serious you know I mean totalitarianism
an atrocity is what I've been studying
for 30 years and it doesn't really get
any darker than that but I do know that
even despite the fact that that what I
study is very dark and and I suppose
some of the things I talk about is very
dark too that the humor is just
unbelievably necessary and I think I was
able to keep a lighter touch in that at
an interview and to laugh a little bit
especially at the absurdity of it
because it just became well I think the
reason that it went viral is because the
interview became its own parody yeah
like she could have what what should
have happened likely was that she should
have gone after me like
I thought afterwards I thought that was
like being mauled by 20 miniature
pitbulls and I was sure that I was sure
the channel 4 was going to edit that and
cut it up so that I would look like an
absolute monster and I guess they did
that to some degree with regards to what
they broadcast and also what they put
put on their Facebook page but they put
the whole interview up on YouTube which
I actually think you know you could say
well more power to them and fairness but
I actually think they did that out of
straight naivety I don't think they had
any idea whatsoever what that interview
actually looked like to the outside
world the shell shocked by the response
I really believe that I have some inside
information from channel 4 and I've been
following people's reaction to it like I
invited Kathy Newman to do another
interview
no because I suit through a back door
gentleman I said look like why don't we
basically make this right instead of it
ending this way because you've taken a
lot of flack for this why don't we
actually sit down and have it a talk and
then that'll work out fine and she said
something like well I need to let this
die down and rethink it but I don't
understand what all the fuss is about I
thought the interview went very well
well I think whoever's in charge of
their YouTube account probably not a big
Kathy Newman fan and uploads it access
to YouTube that's fascinating so she
didn't take you up on it
I mean you know yeah I think there is
some naivete there but it's interesting
that they they uploaded that entirety
what we had that with Sky News remember
that I'm not gay Joe you were there one
time and there were some producers there
who didn't like one of their hosts but
they brought me on and you could tell
that's how I got my gig at Fox News and
that's how I got my spots at CNN you
know as a young kid was just a comedian
even have the show back then it was just
kind of kind of a lamb for the slaughter
and I did all right you know it's like
they set me in front of Alan Combs and I
did okay and then they kept bringing me
back I don't think they always
necessarily expect it and like you said
they're out of touch they she may have
thought that she did really well in that
interview one thing that I often do and
I think we've talked about this to
prepare for debates to prepare for
conversations or even just to see kind
of where I stack up against great
thinkers and you would be certainly in
today's sort of great thinker Mount
Rushmore I would say is all what the
first time
watch an interview I'll watch the Kathy
Newman portion and pause it before I
hear your response and I respond as
though it's in real-time I'll do this
with Bill Maher I'll do it with I don't
know Don Lemon I'll do it with Kathy
Newman just to see how I would respond
so it's as close to a live simulation as
possible one thing that you handled
superbly it was very different I noticed
from where I took this when she said
well hold on a second I'm talking about
the transgender law in Canada
she said why does your freedom of speech
Trump their right to not be offended and
I just paused it and my answer was there
is no right to not be offended but that
way and yours was actually I thought oh
this might play against him I thought it
was a little too intellectual but it
actually drew her into a firefight to
where you ultimately said gotcha you
said well think about it you need to
have the right to be offensive because
you need to have the right to dagan to
offend me and that's absolutely
something you should be doing and you
turned it in a personal analogy and
telling her giving her more free rein
and I think she was caught off guard by
that that was handled really well but
she was because it was so the thing is
it was so patently obvious by that point
that she was doing everything she
possibly could to make me uncomfortable
she knew it I knew it the viewers knew
it there was no doubt about it and it
was easy just to point to that and then
to say well perhaps that's what you
should be doing at least you certainly
have the right to do that right that
offense argument like we can break that
down a little bit because that's
worthwhile it's like okay you don't have
the right to say anything that offends
someone else it hurts their feelings
okay what if you're talking to a
thousand people you don't have the right
to say anything that's going to offend
any one of those thousands of people
which basically means you do not have
the right to say anything at all because
in a group of a thousand people people
virtually anything you say will be
regarded as offensive by at least one
person even if it's merely a consequence
of the fact that they're misinterpreting
you and so really the the right the
absence of the right to offend is
absence of the right to speak at all
right and that just seems so
self-evident all you have to do is think
about it and if it's not a thousand
watch were to do we passing attitude
would you stand up and walk out on me

you enjoy this video here's the thing
your role you're here this is the end of
it so we don't care cuz you already

it and you want to justify it leave a
comment below telling us why you didn't
like the video and if you liked us let
us know and subscribe to the channel
because that lets the overlords at
YouTube know that you know what you're
alright
a fetus is literally a parasite like it
is sucking the life from a mother yeah
every single day what happens not a
mother I'm guessing okay latest
installment have changed my mind is
actually kind of a sequel we're
revisiting the topic of abortion I'm
pro-life change my mind the first one
was an hour long with one person
some people said they'd like to see more
of a mix so this was an SMU it was part
of a five-hour changed my mind marathon
and you get to see what happens with
three different people what one person
is actually returned visit some people
change their minds some people at least
rationalize their positions and we kind
of find some middle ground and then some
people are just confrontational no
matter what hope this helps you Pablo
nice to meet you Pablo do you want to
hold a microphone sure okay please hold
like below your mouth out here okay good
that became a point of contention
earlier and I don't want to freed not be
heard so I am pro-life and I am willing
to hear the other side's argument have
my mind change basically I'm pro-choice
more because of personal liberty you
know okay I think that if in an instance
where I don't know a woman is raped and
sure she is she gets pregnant I think
that she should have the right to abort
baby why I wanna have why because um I
think number one it's your body mm-hmm
it's for life and
you know without her there wouldn't be a
baby in the first place so I think
that's why you know what if it's not her
body
what if she's aborting another body
well then that would be murder
it would you know it really comes down
to at what point is it another body yes
well you also use the word life said
it's her body it's her life
so obviously the big disagreement I'm
pro-life I couldn't care less what a
woman does with her body right they can
get the god-awful
eyebrow tattoo that leaves them a scar
for 50 years after that it's their
prerogative but when it's another body
inside of your body when it's another
life that's a violation of course of the
non-aggression principle so that is the
only question that really needs to be
answered right if we're gonna find
common ground yeah are you just keep on
you cuz I've got a mic on me so you know
I appreciate it though you're playing
reporter for me Hannah
Pablo Channel 5 News you know there's a
there's a certain point where okay it's
it is somebody else's body and not I
mean okay it really comes down to at
what point
a woman is gonna abort you know if she's
gonna abort you know eight months you
know pregnant and I think that right
there from I agree with you see because
um I think that that's closer to being
an actual human being you know another
person okay you know when it's three
weeks and it's I'm cell or a little
membrane or whatever I mean I don't know
about biology but I mean when it's not
an actual body okay I when it doesn't
have legs you know it doesn't have
actual fingers I you know I think that
at that point she can I can ask you a
couple questions
yeah it's great like so you can keep the
microphone yeah we'll hear me you said
maybe eight months maybe not three weeks
right you said I don't know I don't know
a whole lot about biology yeah but you
agree that if it is a life you know the
right to take that life yeah okay so we
agree that you don't have the right to
take another life and you've conceded
that you're not a biologist so you don't
know the exact the exact sort of
prenatal developmental stages right I
don't there are people who do okay okay
so but I'm just a for our conversation
here I'm not either
okay so let me ask you this we're gonna
do kind of go through the philosophical
idea first then we can get to the
medical let's say your
tonight driving home from school and you
see someone in the road and you're about
to hit them but you have enough time to
stop would you stop yeah why because I
don't want to show somebody okay exactly
okay no that's a good answer if not we'd
have to have you written up let's take
that same scenario you're driving home
tonight and use some you see someone
walk out in front of the car you're not
entirely positive but you're pretty sure
that could be a person and you do have
the ability to stop do you stop your
question no it's not so it's not a
person no no it you're you're pretty
sure it's a person but it's a little
fast and blurry you have enough time to
stop you're not sure that it's a person
but you think it's a person do you stop
yeah I would stop for anything okay why
because I don't want to hurt my car
Oh for is because your car well that's
fair I see a branch and I try to evade
it so you they can just use you and IKEA
at Planned Parenthood and job done so
you would stop right you're saying
because why I wasn't your car you
wouldn't wanna hurt ya a human being
killed whatever it is you know okay even
if it's a dog or something okay so even
in the second instance where you weren't
sure you erred on the side of life yeah
you erred in the side of not killing so
in this case where you've conceded you
don't know where life begins you don't
know if it's a life or not shouldn't we
err on the side of life and not
terminating life yeah we we should and
on that side I do agree with you but I
believe that you know again I think it's
more about personal liberty and you know
when it comes down to a woman's body I
think that a woman should have the right
we're talking on another body right we
owe both both the great woman can do
anything this is this is the issue a
woman can do anything she wants with her
own body
yeah if a woman wants to amputate
herself and a doctor says I'll do it and
this actually occurs now these people
identify as Fu T's this is a common
practice I'm fine with it
right so we need to frame in the
argument fairly and accurately
no one who's pro-life is telling a woman
what to do with their body in any other
instance outside of when it directly
ends the life of another person
so it's the burden of proof is on you
why is it not a life well I mean I want
to say it's not a life but I also you
know would say it's an actual human
being like that I mean I'm not really
for you know actually can yeah the other
stage where you know it's an actual baby
but when you know like I said well if
it's so sell or whatever I mean I so
when is it okay
I would say three weeks probably one
month two months three months at the
point where three months actually little
toes that's when okay probably so before
we get to that because that's medical
what makes a human what what makes a
human being what is a human being a
brain a brain is human being yeah like
once this has a basically a formed brain
at that point I believe it's wrong -
okay baby but so before that what
defines a formed brain we just threw out
brain very definitively so what
determines a brain you mean a you
mean a functioning brain cerebral
capabilities yeah or I mean just the
actual membrane the actual you know pink
stuff you know when once a they start
forming that or have it that at that
point I believe
well that's forming immediately because
the tissue forms into a multitude of
ways right so the young you would have
to say as soon as conception a zygote at
that point because it could be
potentially brain tissue yeah so that
doesn't really hold up to scrutiny
so you're saying brain so it would have
to be a developed brain at that point
otherwise you wouldn't be able to
differentiate between tissues so it
develops brain this would assume
cognitive abilities
yeah okay I mean obvious isn't my
argument but it's very common it goes
back it goes back hundreds of years but
bench peers use it what if I'm in a coma
I'm brain dead what if my brain doesn't
function that made me less of a person
is that less of a life can you kill me
mm-hmm
not necessarily I mean I wouldn't you
know kill you you know but you know
seems like you might want to with your
car
as long as someone waxes it afterward
okay but honestly you know at that point
that certain situation would not be okay
because um you know at one point it was
life and there is still hope that he can
wake up one day from the coma ah so now
we're dealing with the potential of life
yeah you see all that short you know
where this goes right yeah so you said
brain you said well not really brain a
functioning brain because even if it's a
non functioning brain it matters there's
the potential of it being a functioning
brain so now we're back to square one
that would of course apply to the baby
growing in the womb it's a life by your
definition why do you have the right to
kill well I'm not you a woman yeah I
would say um a woman has a right because
you know it basically comes down to it
being her body you know it doesn't it
doesn't you just said that it was
another body but another life inside
your body if someone or somebody were
inside my body that I do not want inside
I think I should have the right to get
him out so every time you're having sex
with a woman or man they have the right
to kill you because you're inside their
body okay yeah yeah they actually would
have the right anyone of the right to
kill you or to get me out I mean if she
doesn't want me inside her body I think
she should have the right to get you out
if the woman I'm not saying you're let's
get beyond you're not raping the person
okay okay all right Pablo I don't think
you're a rapist I think you're a little
little bit shifty with the microphone
but far from a rapist
if you're having sex with someone you
are in their body male or female you
don't need to tell me I don't care
that's not the point of this
conversation do they have the right so
we do they have the right to kill you
yes and no no if they don't have their
know they don't have the right if it's
consensual but if it's okay so let's use
that because well that's the only one
that's relevant right because this is a
baby this baby did not consent to being
harmed but the woman did not consent to
being raped either
okay let's let's use this let's remove
rape from the table let's deal with
ninety-nine point more than 99 percent
of abortions right okay so let's say
rape incest let's take it off the table
all right so then you would say that the
vast majority of abortions based on your
standard of what is a life that people
who abort when they are not raped when
it is not non-consensual that that is
morally wrong yeah yeah in there and
there I completely agree with you okay I
would have to say I'm more pro-choice
just because of that sense well so
you're more for just because of one
percent less than one percent but you're
pro-life so you don't think a woman
should be able to abort if it was a
consensual sexual engagement that
resulted in a pregnancy you don't think
abortion is a is a I do not think it's
okay because I think there are a lot of
people that abuse the fact that they can
abort and that's the vast majority of
abortions yeah and I'm actually against
that but okay just because of that
certain situation of those the people
being raped for that reason I would have
to subside to so because of a very very
small percentage of people rather than
allow other choices could you say you're
pro-choice I'm pro-choice too you know
yeah I'm Pro for choices right mm-hmm
abstinence adoption pregnancy
contraception I'm just not procuring
right there's a fifth choice so you're
saying I'm Pro killing if there's rape
involved and if you want to remove the
extreme examples and say that you're
pro-life and all other examples that's
fine that's not the policy of the
platform right now that's pro-abortion
and I respect that you would disagree
with many of the people here who
consider themselves pro-choice but
that's a that that's an extreme example
yeah so you know in that case I would
say no
forcing a woman to carry a baby in that
case I'm simply precluding someone from
killing a baby but again we're dealing
with less than 1% of abortion so we
agree on 99 point something percent of
abortions that it's morally incorrect to
end a life okay one person honey because
one percent of a billion is still 100
Millions
I know but the 99 percent is hundreds of
millions of babies that have been
aborted ten million of it but yeah but
what about the hundreds of millions of
babies you've admitted their lives that
have just been ended and yeah and I
agree with you I I wouldn't I say that
I'm saying that's morally okay all right
well thank you finally I appreciate it I
Priya taking them Thank You Man right
great conversation thank you very much
Pablo I appreciate it yeah I can hold it
if you'd rather me hold it okay what's
your name
it's Syd Syd yeah nice to meet you said
Stephen all right I'm pro-life yeah you
can change my mind I heard or you read
you were on campus
yeah I am able to read you're at a very
good campus I would hope so yeah I know
I mean I'm pretty much I'm first of all
it's not through abortion as pro-choice
really yeah why is that because it's the
option to have an abortion or to not
that's what choice is about so there's
an element I guess a pro-life isn't it
necessarily and pro-choice because you
have the option okay yeah so are you
pro-choice when it comes to what amount
of taxes you pay or I pay excuse me you
say pro-choice I'll get to it
philosophically said you're pro-choice
it's only about choice would you
consider yourself very consistently an
advocate of choice and liberty sure okay
she would be pro-choice where I could
choose what taxes I pay so would you be
pro-choice and I can determine what laws
I obey I know I know you laugh but we'll
get to in a second okay
because it's not your choice if it's
terminating another life so it is it
does come down to abortion because
here's the thing pro-choice would apply
to everything else
taxes driving SUVs carbon credits policy
we're discussing the issue of abortion
right yes because I think we would all
have differing opinions on choices
regarding other issues in this case
we're just talking about abortion are we
pro-abortion Pro right to abort or
pro-life right support yes okay Pro
right Pro right to abort okay good so
let's use that to pro right to abort you
can throw it virtually you can use
pro-choice that's fine I won't
okay change my mind well this is the
purpose you sat down here I'm pro-life
so where it where am I wrong where are
you wrong I mean okay well going back to
the what you're talking about earlier
with the other person I think there's
missing an important part of the
argument whenever I think his name is
Pablo Pablo was saying that you like the
coma yeah I guess so I knew can you go
for that again sleeping why was you only
bringing that argument cuz he was
talking about defining life yeah so I
think the only argument that really
matters is the funny I find life that's
my question
yeah that's the basis of those yes yes
let me let me try and be as clear as
possible I don't want to I don't want to
wiggle on this or do you feel that I've
tricked anyone I believe life begins at
conception because I believe it's the
only consistent line to draw that's
where a unique genetic code human DNA no
I'm fine I'm Pro birth control birth
control African yeah let me explain you
why because preventing conception is
different than aborting after conception
is it yeah it is that's when the light
starts that you're purposely preventing
the conception from happening is that
not aborting no it's not because every
time I masturbated I'd be committing
mass genocide
no see what you're doing is you're
taking a very clear answer
no but I'm twisting it to try and make
it nuanced I believe it believe I
believe it begins at conception real
life within everyone's genital organs
right now there is a life within every
single one's genital organs do you mean
a separate life within your organs and
my organs so let me ask you tell me your
genitals right so you mean a different
life from yours I mean your this is a
life I'm a life it goes on you're
dependent yes personally I don't believe
life starts until outside of the womb
okay so really okay so I do believe life
begins at conception you believe life
exclusively begins outside of the womb
correct okay so is it your
presupposition that abortion up until
the moment it leaves the birth canal is
acceptable sure not nine months sure
eight months sure you can blow that to
life no okay you haven't changed my mind
thank you very much yeah we're not gonna
find common ground if you're okay with
the boarding a fully fully sentient
fully viable baby at nine months
yeah that's just not true I appreciate
it you haven't changed my mind I mean if
you had a difference but yeah it is with
nine months if you're okay aborting up
to nine months I don't think were gonna
find common ground but I appreciate it
SID thank you
marce Marcella yes thank you so much my
name is Steven Steven I am pro-life and
I am willing to hear the other side they
should willing to have my mind changed
by convincing arguable Eve that the
fundamental of this topic is rooted
where life begins and it's not a battery
whether to abort or to not abort a
living life it's the discussion is on
where the living life begins okay just
to start off though I am actually a
practicing Catholic so I myself my
religious views are pro-life but my
religious views don't always coincide
with my political views and the rights
that the Constitution grant grants us if
it makes me you don't to look at the
crowd you can yeah it's it's more
conversational it's usually doesn't
happen usually just everyone wants to
hurt me yeah you just look at me that's
fine I don't I I appreciate you'd take
some take some guts to do that I know
more people are afraid of speaking in
front of public than dying yeah so when
you stand up comedy sometimes both
happen I know I believe that not I don't
believe in pro-choice I believe in the
right to abort when it is those extreme
cases okay since it is such a small
percent of the population you said those
99 percent yeah isn't it yeah but as a
woman I don't know what it's like to be
raped sure and I don't know what it's
like to have something in my body that I
feel like it's not mine sure so I
believe that it's not my right to tell
that woman
if that she has to have something in her
body that's dependent on her to survive
right I it's been argued that I believe
that a baby is a person so much so that
if you kill a pregnant woman is that I I
don't know if this is actually the law
can actually kind of the double marry
law counts as a double murder so
religiously I believe that if you kill a
pregnant woman most likely she wanted

miracle drug really slash steroid yeah

your immune system helps with endurance
increases hemoglobin some more tests
other actual double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials so

13 hours give me a break
all right our next guest I love him you
love him he's also in the daily wire
Network and their tumblr mostly sucks
but his show is pretty good you love him
you fall it's the Andrew Clavin show at
Andrew Clavin on the Twitter mr. Clavin
can you hear us sir I don't think you
can hear us sound guy Edward all this
thumbs up and you hold on a second and
sound guy didn't even have this stuff at
write yet what's happening I would have
just taken the time to eat my
raspberries now I can hear you oh great
how are you mr. so much happier before
you I'm sorry I don't know if you know
what's been going on today you've been
briefed I heard that you were going to
sit in from CNN for 16 hours but I
thought even you are not that stupid
yeah well no you were wrong
[Music]
16 hours CNN what are we our 12 over 13
almost 13 no no coming up an hour 13
right 6:30 wait
we'll go it's coming up on eight we go
to midnight so our 12 Oh God well we
have four more hours yeah ah don't worry
it'll go by okay sorry Andrew I'll be
drinking but here's the one that we just
talked with Ben about it I don't know
where you are you in the same studio
there has been right now no I saw Ben
walked by outside I haven't talked to
him yet though I hadn't and I didn't
hear I didn't hear what you guys were
talking abut you look measure Bonnie God
oh he was he was sobbing terrible well
it's because we had some dirt on and we
let him know right before I leave all
right listen
that's true but we have sewing it let me
fill you in Andrew we have to do this
with all our guests I'm sorry let me
keep it really brief the CNN hit list
the reason we're doing this and the only
were able to do this has been set it to
live like welfare queens is because of
mug club we needed 16 hours for the
entire original CNN clock just to prove
how bad it is
how biased it is we hope we can only do
this kind of like change my mind
unedited watching it all day so people
can see how bad it is so let me give you
a really quick a hit list okay of what's
been going on today on CNN slow news day
you would think
not according to Blitzer so we started
the day where they were sucking of
stoking of course the Russian hysteria
idea that Trump was gonna fire Muller
then an Adam Schiff on regarding the
Muller probe's and Singh he has evidence
for nine months no evidence not one
single mention of uranium one despite it
being trending on Twitter all day they
said with the chip program Republicans
wanted to defund it and nine million
tiny tim's would die they used the word
nine million tiny thames yes they did
they actually said that and the funny
thing is of course no mention of the
fact that republicans actually want to
continue fight of funding the child
health care initiative for another five
years no mention of the melbourne
attacker being Afghani save Maori nori
if I'm pronouncing it correctly saying
he did it because of mistreatment of
Muslims they didn't mention the 1995
Israel vote at all to situate the
embassy in Jerusalem and recognize it as
its capital no mention of short term
funding from the Republicans until
January 19th remember they said we don't
need to shut down let's just extend this
to January 19th Democrats had to vote on
it but then when they finally did and
then it was kicked to the Senate of the
base that's going to happen they just
said Oh House votes no government
shutdown well you mean what the
Republicans pushed forward and then
finally breaking news currently
developing Bannon said that Bush 43 was
a destructive president and of course
that was actually said last October so
it seems to me breaking news on CNN is
uh it means lie your thoughts you're a
little too kind I think the fact the
fact that it took you 16 that's taking
you 16 hours to figure out the CNN is a
pack of lies is a little disturbing you
know they do did you know they do this I
think they showed a clip of Franken and
they'd said earlier but they meant
yesterday like they wouldn't news
usually say yesterday when someone says
earlier don't you think all this
happened earlier today so the tax bill
is off the news already right that's
gone yeah
they said that 9 million Tiny Tim's
would die because of the tax bill nine
million Tiny Tim Stein yeah is that is
that enough Tiny Tim's to kill I think
you know they can be Tiny Tim's can be
incredibly annoying
yeah million seems like a start but you
know you want there may be some escaping
you know they're always coughing I know
we want to fund a program to hunt them
down I think yeah I think you're right I
think you're right I'm just saying this
because that's gonna really mean tweek
and reclaim it so you gotta listen you
hear them you hear that word you know
god bless us everyone you got to rush to
the scene and just wipe them right off
the face well Tina you know tonight is
the premiere of YouTube Carol and we
have tiny not Kay Jarrod in there of
course we've just found out in the last
segment tiny knocking Jared was riddled
with aids down to his last 200 cd4 cells
so I see a crutch by the fire without a
tiny not gay Jared to use it when Howard
played for those Clint Howard played
YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki in place of
the ghost of Marley it was Clint Howard
as Susan Wojcicki
as Marlon yeah it's a really messed up
special I I don't know how I missus you
know I did see I did see not gay Jerrod
as as the elfin that the shelf which I
find I have an elf on the shelf behind
me I find these the creepiest little
things they're supposed to you know they
you know what they're for are you
supposed to put them on the shelf and
they tell Santa Claus whether your kid
has been naughty or nice and so starting
that right there is kind of creepy and
then to have it be not gay Jared just
kind of amps the creep to it yeah tiny
NSA on the Shelf and if here's the thing
it's either complete lie or if it's
functional they're just millions of elf
on shelf sex tapes just ready to be
dropped at any moment in my studio has
seen things you would not believe yeah I
mean you were talking about you know you
were talking about Nikki Haley at the UN
that's that is my porn watching nikki
Haley slap the UN around it's like
spanking foreign to me I just want all I
want is for nikki Haley to wear leather
when she attacks the people of the UN
and I would be in heaven that would be
it at one point I just really sorry I'm
eating because I haven't even had a
break for dinner at one point what would
you give just for when nikki Haley was
doing her thing sitting there for
someone to object and just nikki Haley
look him dead in the
I just heard talking someone say I
object and her go shut up how much
would you get a whip is it too much is
it too much to ask that Nicki's given a
whip too when she goes can I beg for an
elf on my shelf
it is truly up on the Shelf is really
creepy I know that um you know you get
by the fireplace Christmas tree get
under the mistletoe I've my wife and I
and I turn to the elf and say don't you
look at me and I turn it around and then
three hours later it's been turned back
around no one knows that's way beyond
what anything I wanted to know and I
think I've in fact I think I just went
blind well yeah we're all on a second
let me cure let me let me cure what ails
you that's we did earlier we wanted to
see how many coffee beans we could fit
into I have a missing sternum take a
guess how many coffee beans we could fit
into my sternum oh yeah I know I
actually I actually knew that once wait
it'll come to me give me a second fit
into his empty sternum I learned that in
school but I just can't remember the
numbers seventy two hundred and a u-turn
u-turn code Jewish slash Christian let
me ask you what's your favorite there
isn't even being beer involved yet this
is just what happened we get tight it's
almost like a boxing match where we
talked about like the most dangerous
boxers when they're tired they're so
loose and now we're just winging them
and people like this this special have
gotten so much more fun well hold on to
your butts cuz gonna get a lot more
claiming what's your favorite moment of
the year like if you have to pick one
political moment of the year this is our
final episode this is our farewell it's
our goodbye yeah what's your favorite
moment of the year politically of 2017
this year I think I actually think it
has to be this this tax bill passing
because up until this moment I mean I
kept going on the air I didn't like
Trump you know when he ran I was really
opposed to him being nominated then I
thought well he's better than Hillary
okay so I'll vote for Trump cuz he's
better than Hillary but it's gonna be a
disaster
and then very slowly as the year went on
I started to think you know what this is
going pretty well you know we need to
score search and then we get some good
judges and then the regulatory rollback
right all the sudden it's just kind of
slowly slowly building but they kept
selling this idea that rally hasn't had
a legislative victory
when he bet that bill I just thought
this has been the best year for
conservatives since Reagan who I act you
know I can actually remember Reagan so I
mean this is the best year for
conservatives since Reagan it's it's
been an amazing year everything Trump
said he was gonna do and more he has
actually gotten done and you know he
hasn't done I and Colter is still
yelling about the wall at a wall but
nobody but nobody's coming across the
border anymore so yeah that's so scared
of them right that's right by the way
don't think I didn't notice that was a
prick comment he's like oh I can
actually remember Reagan implying that I
can't by hey but the joke's on you
you'll get dementia before I do so I'll
remember him for a longer period of time
you'll be ramming people with shopping
carts while I'll be talking about him
demanding course so the tax bill is you
know what I think you're right I think
it's last week politically has
definitely been the best of the year
because he's he's finally gotten some
stuff done um I'm a little upset with
the passive versus active income in the
tax bill I think it favors kind of
people in real estate a little bit more
than people in other businesses but
overall eighty percent of Americans are
going to see a tax break and that's the
crazy thing you've been talking about
with CNN they go breaking news poll most
Americans think they'll pay more under
Trump's plan but they're not eighty
percent of them okay and where did
people get that idea that's where they
should get the take the pole the pole
should be why do you think you'll pay
more so I saw it on CNN right they don't
take that poll you know that is the
important pole you know they have this
has been the year of misinformation the
news media one of one of trumps greatest
accomplishments has been destroying the
credibility of the news media I mean
they went after him they thought this is
gonna be easy you know we destroyed Mitt
Romney we went after george w bush we
called him Hitler this is gonna be and
he smushed them there now just there now
on self-destruct I mean Trump has this
magic quality that if you attack him
it's not that he destroys you it's that
you ultimately destroy yourself it's
like Marco Rubio with the small hands
comment when I was going to ended his
it ended his campaign CNN is now just
reporting stuff they're making stuff up
you know it's like God's right now right
now right now it says pence can't stop
hailing the chief that's the headline in
case you were wondering now they're
reading a tweet so sorry the ritual
submission in the exaltation is nearly
pornographic so it's it's editorializing
pence can't stop hailing the chief and
then they show a tweets based on CNN's
editorializing you just spent nine
million tiny things would guide you
crazy
sweetie Todd like they just manufactured
a plan to where they could just ingest
poop it out Riaan jest it like it's
never-ending Potter for that is an
unflattering angle quick get it get it
get it get it get it looks like it's the
orc when Peter Jackson got too lazy to
have a makeup department too sweet from
like two months ago and listen I don't
just like Rick Wilson I always never
Trump I think he's gone too far
but there read it they're reading a Rick
Wilson tweet on CNN four months ago this
is you know I hate to tell you this I
like it's not that I dislike the never
Trump's not that I think they're
dishonest I just think that they it's
time for them to reconsider this is this
I mean when when was the last time
something like this happened all these
judges sixty conservative judges right
you know this regulatory roll back which
is historic I know it's boring but it's
historic the judge what I mean what are
they waiting for when do you start being
like I like Donald yeah
he's you know I got you know what I
realized about Donald Trump he's a he's
a New York loudmouth kind of like me you
know like half the stuff he says half
the stuff he says it's just stuff that
New Yorkers say you know like stuff New
Yorkers say stuff that's funny because
it's so awful I agree he's a lot like
you he's kind of a dick I think
exactly bingo now you know I go back as
far as I'm like oh I think there might
be enough damage in the Republican Party
cuz he's because he's so unpopular he's
given them so much fodder then we may
never get another Republican again but
then it's counterbalance like this week
of ok once these legislative
accomplishments go through once you see
the fruits of the labor once people see
how much money they save right now
here's a 35 percent approval earning I
think it maybe might have been 37
because the majority of people don't
realize they'll pay less in taxes they
don't know like that lowering the
corporate tax rate just to be comparable
to the rest of the industrialized world
will result in more employment you know
they don't know that this alone fight
for 15 I think was Boeing Wells Fargo
AT&T Center low minimum wage now goes to
$15 an hour and we're giving out
millions in bonuses I think it might
take a while and then you know what
listen there may be hope for him yet but
rhetorically it's it's been bad and
that's why this last week I think was so
pivotal and the thing is the reality
does have a voice so at some point
people look around and say you know what
you know Nancy Pelosi told me tiny thing
with the eye and Tiny Tim is still
annoying me you know they told me that
the economy was gonna crash it didn't
crash they told me that I wasn't gonna
get a tax cut I did get a tax cut
eventually you know that starts to
filter into people's minds you know I
when I when I talk about Reagan you have
to remember they did exactly this to
Reagan he was an idiot he was a war
monger he was gonna blow up the world he
was a full actor he confute conflated
reality with the movies he was in they
said all this stuff about him every day
60 minutes did a whole thing about how
Ronald Reagan thought reality was the
movies and then you slowly started to
look around thought hey you know the
economy is ten times better and wasn't
the Berlin Wall standing there before
you know Ronald Reagan it was gonna fall
down and everybody said it was gonna be
a nuclear war reality has a voice and
album eventually if Trump is successful
as I think he's now going to be I think
people are gonna start to scratch their
chins and think maybe it's CNN yes the
problem well at least everyone who has a
layover in Atlanta who actually watches
CNN I think we're the only
they're talking to you and you're the
only person watching CNN who's not
catching a flight that's true and
sinneth in the thousands of people I
thought was 16 17 thousand people
watching us right now but you're right
reality has a voice and with Reagan that
it's a whisper more so it's a whisper
because it takes a little while to pick
up on it and with whistle Ronald Reagan
the whisper was Jimmy Carter's are puffy
and you're like what is that with it
Jimmy Carter's a person you're like oh
good okay we get it now so hopefully
that's what's gonna happen with Donald
Trump and who are they gonna run against
them they've got Methuselah and
Pocahontas you know they Sanders who may
actually may have passed away in the in
the since the campaign I think he I
think he's now you know just a corpse
and animated Medtronic corpse going now
we take everybody's money and give it to
the bull people okay great and then
Elizabeth Sanders who I could I would
pay money to watch her to pay that
Donald Trump I think moved a lap right
it's true Wolf Blitzer can't read
prompter claiming I don't think and see
he's the worst person at reading I don't
I I mean I this is just it's it's almost
like you could teach these hallways of
course in Antioch rity with Wolf Blitzer
but like hey mediocre choices 101 Wolf
Blitzer that would be the name of the
tumbler how many's all people working
acknowledge you're gonna I think my TV's
frozen it's oh no it's just wolf always
late what I just noticed they're Chiron
was official confirms commis account
that Trump asked for loyalty I don't
think anybody else was in the room when
that happen no no mccabe was and that's
by the way that's from yesterday 7.5
hours of questioning and McCain has said
I don't have any proof at all in Trump
dossier you know like hey yeah you know
there's any truth to call me saying that
Trump asked him to be loyal to him he's
like yeah I think that happened and
that's the breaking news now you
couldn't even get a story straight oh my
gosh I just you know what Blitzer look
everything that he does is a choice the
hair the glasses the beard um doesn't
moves the choice to drink a bucket of
saltwater before he goes on air so I
like the guy is out of his mind he's net
he's just
I don't think he's worse than Ron
Burgundy he's here all of Barnum news
commentary just aggressively mediocre
alright alright I think we five to get
going right we do have to get going
alright and reclaim and apparently have
them oh there's a story here today they

the missus will talk about the only
thing in the news Roy Moore how do you
see this I'd like to hear your comments
because I've heard a lot of different
opinions do you see it as a short-term
loss Roy Moore losing for a long term
victories it's a loss as a loss of the
loss do you see do you see it as an
individual screw-up or do you see it
kind of you were saying this before the
break is some people see it as a
referendum on the Republican Party right
yeah so a year what do you think about
that a lot of different opinions and
we'll get to that but before we do we
have to get to other news of the day
[Laughter]
there's a phrase you find herself saying
always a legend warren sapp defending
himself he was proving that he was not a
creep by publicly posting pictures of
the vibrators they bought for female
staff so first let me say why does that
sit why would he okay Daily Mail the
article sap considered by many to be one
of the all-time great defenders in the
league gave the retirement of plaintiff
gave the plaintiff sex toys as a
Christmas gift three years in a row Wow
which would seem bad at first but salve
defended himself pretty valiantly saying
this was taken out of context what they
don't tell you is it on the twelfth day
of Christmas I your true love gave to
the a dildo in a pear tree its context
is keep myself out that Sam in a pear
tree or a partridge in a dildo tree why
three years in a row what kind of usage
with these suits and you're going you
got a dildo three years in a row what
created an environment where this man
was comfortable sending a colleague a
dildo my mom's it's at the snow you snow
like you wanna get our gifts get our
snowman at some point someone should buy
me rolled out books yeah no I don't I
don't I'm not like I just I like Gene
Wilder and now it might have a stack and
I don't need them grandma don't you just
pigeonhole you okay Connecticut man was
sentenced to a year in prison for
necrophilia as well after having sex
with a dead girlfriends corpse
I think he did it in an attempt to
revive her and this is an actual quote
 what Aaron gangster said he thought
that sleeping with her body might revive
her because his girlfriend hated
sleeping with them according the arrest
warrant so we can add rape to the
charges this guy was serious and his
answer it would seem absurd except the
rights have already been purchased to
this story by AMC for their tentatively
titled
the debt and they're already
taking auditions we hear how about
instead of bashing zombies we start
loving zombie because it seems like a
waste and Lucille needs a place to hide
that really seems it doesn't have the
same mass appeal no you might find that
in one of the smaller channels might be
premium package robots are now being
used to deter homeless people from
setting up camp in San Francisco scum
social visits inside of the San
Francisco Business Times reported last
week that the San Francisco SPCA an
animal advocacy and pet adoption group
put a security robot to work outside its
facilities the gentrifying mission
neighborhood I understand where you're
coming from and then they're obviously
all kinds of protesters they don't think
that you should be getting rid of
homeless people at all it's a problem
San Francisco though in the I will give
in their defense some of the robots in
question are overkill seems like they're
going a little bit too much that's a
robot on a powered yeah that is exactly
who think if they were trying they were
at least made the Blitz not not white
yeah $7 an hour two is all they pay for
that yes I'm not kidding that's in the
story seven bucks an hour below minimum
wage they do have the black robots that
just put them in Oakland
and they hold the torch sideways a
suburb find itself gonna heat it there's
no good way to get out it's fine stuff
and heated standoff over what the locals
are now claiming is he's a hyper
sexualized logo for an ice cream shop
you see that bear that booty booty I I
get it this is where I thought oh no
that's that's a human ass on a cow yeah
it really seems as though they're
pushing it and of course this is a
growing trend we all know and the food
mascot marketing as seen recently what's
a makeover the Land O'Lakes butter
Indian which you know just hey and then
there was of course the redo of the
sun-maid raisins and yeah a little bit
and then of course it culminated in Tony
the cyber sexting Tiger and it was
unrelated obviously to the hyper
sexualization but there are racial
tensions in the country and people were
obviously upset about and just be
talking about pancake mix and
ill-received
next week is a big big week 16 our lives
yeah save it has been charged with
assault for burning his initials into
his patients livers that's that's
gangstas comes from The Guardian a
renowned liver spleen and pancreas
surgeon used an argon beam I'm reading
that creppy used to stop livers bleeding
during operations and to highlight but
he would sign his initials into the
patient's organ it's hilarious would you
find it so funny for what if it were
your liver as long as it worked I'm fine
[Laughter]
when you get put out all kinds of stuff
can happen buddy I'm just saying that's
true I was always paranoid yeah I'd go
under I've been out for some weird
surgeries yeah I just assume you don't
know what you're signing with that way
that he's going you cry in the shower
and you're good now that's you need you
need to seek counsel this is not a
normal person more film yes crying in
the shadow part of the Rico now does he
always send me the pictures when you do
it's gerald please find somebody to hold
of course the surgeon by the way is no
stranger to controversy given that four
livers just came forward last year
letting me force them to watch and
masturbate in the surgery prep room
seems as though he presses yeah well
they go back to the question today we'll
talk about next Blair White will take
the quiz yes I can only get better
the joke is Roy Moore Roy Moore one
thing is correctly he lost yes and I
mentioned in people's opinions on it but
there been a lot of before we get to the
opinions there were a lot of memes going
around not gay J was wondering she
showed this to me out
it's funny the memes we couldn't find
the source and we find out I think it
was CNN but memes declare that black
women made more lose this is something
you see everywhere right now okay
and I immediately when I watch I get
well of course that's untrue and it's
one of those things we weren't going to
talk about until we realize that most
people if you're not paying attention
they don't know that of course that's
untrue black turnout was up about ten
percent
okay five percent less voted for more
than for Trump so that just it wouldn't
have even been close to change the
election by the way black black voter
turnout is not very good no it really is
no but let's pick up on this fall
because we don't want them there right
yes well I was surprised I think was it
was like 96 what was it he got six
percent of black men which surprised me
that's it hi that's actually already
high for Republicans I think like Donald
Trump was really high with something
like 9 percent of black men I don't I
don't have the numbers in front but the
voters who turn the election just just
to correct the misinformation they were
Trump supporters who didn't vote for
more whether you like Trump or not it's
people who voted for Donald Trump and
didn't vote for more almost half of the
people who voted for President Trump
stayed home Wow
turnout was down 45% 45% in the
presidential election there's a nine
percent drop in support from Trump
tomorrow okay know something tell you
there's a limit to the tribalism yeah it
tells you that Republicans don't just
vote for whoever has an R next to their
name in people say people say that both
sides do it I think both sides have done
I think before President Donald Trump
you know there's a much this goes to
kind of would have talked about it's a
much wider tent with Republicans you
have limit Ariens you have conservatives
you kind of have now the Trump populist
there okay disagreeing with Democrats
there's a Dean exit name they're gonna
vote for yeah I think is age thing too I
think it's an age thing for Republicans
typically the ones that we like are down
ticket no matter what always ever yeah
typically older people
for Republicans I think it's typically
younger people you find more and more
for Democrats seen as all people that
who were you know Bernie Bernie Bernie
only write hate Hillary but still pull
the lever for yeah well one you and I
had this conversation in the 2016
election like oh man we're in a really
tough spot the guy with an R next to his
name isn't exactly the best person for
the job don't think more thoroughly yeah
first off right so we had that I don't
think the Dems have those conversations
nearly as often like oh no they're not
really a good Democrat no they really
just gonna vote D and go it really is
that is one thing they get behind their
candidate and people would try and say
well you have to do that for whether it
was Trump whoever it was you have to get
behind the candidate no matter what
well it's mental gymnastics after that
just to try to say oh I'm still with
this person because they don't even
believe what they say they please well
that's because one is one people say
well why are you want everything you're
a political ideologue people always say
that this means like really this kind of
shows that conservatives are are they're
more principled for sure they're they're
prism their worldview it determines
their values now but it's not based on
an R and ironically people label
themselves Republicans are more likely
to proudly say I'm a conservative
Republican to see guys gonna believe in
labels she killed the guy right yeah
that's okay the head idea was he was
duping kids in the basement well it's
okay what do you think do these a
referendum in the Republican or anything
just write more no I honestly I think I
think it's the the sexual-assault stuff
that's coming out right now we talked
about this a little bit I think right
now you can in you and I probably
disagree a little but you can throw that
out and it's going to sabotage anybody
right now anybody is willing to believe
me because so many examples have come
out we're like oh yeah now this really
is going on so even if there's no
evidence in his case I think there was a
lot of evidence but I think any other
year would have been a little different
story I don't think that's right but I
think it would have been so I don't
think it's a public I think you're kind
of right maybe in in terms of a
temporary bubble but I think temporary a
long term right now people are going
right sexual assault because everything
is sexual is the optics war so everyone
is trying to avoid the optics that's why
that's why I'll Frank it's up down
that's why what with the other guys that
just stepped down from from Ayers
Cornie yeah it's all it's an optics war
it was according someone but that's the
problem like there's legitimate stuff
that we have to fight against in sexual
assault but right now my fear is that
there's no due process for anybody you
throw it out there right now and people
are willing to believe it you and I are
like getting to the point where like
right proof show me proof and I'll
believe it that's why it's a funny me
that they're like what clearly VP Mike
pinch must be a creep yeah what do you
think you think this is do you see this
as a short-term loss that was necessary
do you think that if Roy Moore won it
would have been you talk about the OP
yeah it would've been worse for the
Republican Party long-term long-term
absolutely you do yeah cuz you like I
think we still want him to win I do I I
find myself going back and forth but I
do think long-term you gotta fight the
long term more good things and I think
with Trump if it weren't for the Supreme
Court I think it I think mostly would
have been worth yeah the long term war
to let someone else take it for a little
bit looking back I think Trump is
definitely cause irreparable damage to
the Republican Party of course and the
Supreme Court was really really
important and most most optics it's most
of it is its branding he's rebrand in a
way that it should never been really
represent the people who he's branding
right I think it definitely is better
because Democrats don't really have a
leg to stand on right now politically
there's nothing that they're coming out
with it's really motivating anybody and
so if they could have attacked Roy Moore
with the sexual assault stuff and really
painted him with that yeah they would
have used it Hollywood tape yeah right
with Roy Moore yeah that was really
legitimate and then they'd be like see
that's the kind of guy they want an
office already doing it with Trump so if
they had another person to point to it
just makes it well al franken did it
with his resignation but I do you think
listen this is intriguing to me there is
a silver lining here I'm going hey you
know what regardless of and I do think
listen the media is going it's going to
be hatchet job and Roy more far more
than Al Franken right it's gonna be a
hatchet job on drug war far more than
the Clintons Bill Clinton we do know
that he hacks for marital Affairs we do
know that any extramarital affairs with
people who weren't even necessary
willing we do know that he lied about it
in court doesn't even care anyway keep
turning in 2017 2017 you realize oh yeah
[Laughter]
this is breaking news look at here
something with Democrats not only is it
swept under the rug they become fixtures
Ted Kennedy now Ted Kennedy has like a
heat up at a 40-year career after he was
soliciting sixteen-year-old girls 12
after he had an affair with Mary Jo
Kopechne he left her in the river for
dead he serves for 40 more years after
that so Roy Moore we didn't have any
evidence there wasn't even been a trial
yet it was these were just allegations
now it seems there might've been some
weight to it and that was enough for 40%
of Republicans who voted for Donald
Trump to abandon the guy Ted Kennedy
killed a broad and solicited teenagers
so if you were to intentionally
misgender a trans woman
that could put her at risk of murder you
understand that because people think
because i don't dance i hate to ruin
your polite discourse
thank you thank you for putting that in
this place
fourth installment a real conversation
changed my mind for those who haven't
seen the series this is just a a series
here where we
set up shop reel pick a controversial
topic
and uh allow people to change my mind
sit down unedited you get to see what
happens when a real conversation
transpires not set up to be a debate
just a conversation
we sit up at a campus today is there are
only two genders change my mind you will
see
three different people a full hour of
change my mind today uh
in chronological order and i wanted you
to see specifically
three different approaches three
different tacts from the people
uh who were trying to change my mind
regardless of the fact that we didn't
change ours so
it's important to see that sometimes it
doesn't matter what you do it doesn't
matter how you treat people they are
coming in
i guess we can say cocked and loaded and
after the video you can stick around to
um
see where you can buy the change my mind
shirts and become a part of the champion
army let's go
it's all so magical
to meet you okay so um you know
this is just a series we do or let
people know my point of view there are
two genders go ahead and change my mind
it's the opposite of cable news we're
not going to edit anything out of
context
you said you disagreed i'm open to new
ideas
well i'm i'm wondering
i'm wondering the phrasing of the
question are you arguing that
um there's not more than like men and
women are you arguing there's not a
difference between sex and gender or
yeah i think i think they're two genders
male and female
okay so you're saying that male and
female is a gender not a sex
yes okay so okay
and see that's that's where i would have
to disagree okay
male and male and female is something
that uh would be by breath for example
uh you probably have a penis a male sex
organ
as would i but why would you assume that
yeah
do you but you assumed it though okay i
did i apologize
no you don't listen you don't need
anything i'm not trying to do any gotcha
yeah it's interesting to me that you
assumed that i have a penis
why
[Music]
because you uh seem
uh i don't know man because is it
because of societal construct
yes that's why yes it wasn't because of
my bone structure
or my penis bulge
that male and female is different than
being
a man or a woman okay and the fact that
we have
as a society created man man and the
male gender roles and just says women
gender roles
uh just as we would um anything else the
same way that we would say that
uh i don't know that music is good or
that we have created it to place people
into
roles and so i'm saying that if you were
male or female if you identified more as
a man and the gender roles that go with
being a man
that you have that so you're saying so
you're saying that that
sex and gender are very different yes
okay i understand that's your premise
um so that's based on on kind of modern
gender theory
uh when did that start i i wouldn't know
okay so why let me ask you this before i
guess before we get to the history
why do you accept that premise
uh because it makes uh
it makes the most sense to me i mean uh
the
argument that we've created roles such
as
um being being feminine and we have
associated it with being
female as opposed to being female is
being feminine
sure you unders you understand that
they're inconsistencies there for
example with your presumption of my you
know my penis
um let me ask you this then how many
genders are there
uh i would say if we're um we would say
that there are
two genders being men and uh man and
woman
and then that there would be people that
don't accept either of those
and that would be in a x or
non-identifying
category what's what's the number how
many genders are there i would i can
tell you
isn't that important um
i mean they were the point is that
before you know uh 1948 with simone de
beauvoir and then judith butler
with modern sort of post-modernism
feminism theory
gender and sex were effectively
interchangeable you can even look on
legal documentation depending on the
permit they are legally interchangeable
i mean this is the way it's been with
societies for millennia we've had male
and female
um so when you radically change that
you do have to have a number in in my
opinion and
some kind of an end game it can't just
be we're going to shift the rules based
on how people feel
so i can understand if someone says hey
you're wrong that there's difference
between sex and gender
but the burden of proof at that point
would be on the person asserting that
they're different
to tell me how many genders there are
because we the society right have to
know this
we have to function within certain
parameters um
and i would say that those those
parameters for
gender would be whatever that person
wants those parameters to be if they
identify as a man or a woman
or they don't identify that would be
their prerogative and that
it's not my place or your place to tell
them that
they have to identify with being a man
even if they are male
or they have to identify as a woman even
if they are female
but we but we do that all the time
people want to be things that they
aren't and we say that's not the case
you know this we constantly do that as a
society so i don't understand why it's
i'm really sorry to interrupt your
conversation but i have some logistical
questions for you
my name is laura chad and i work at smu
student activities yes we manage the
outdoor events request process um
are you the sponsor of this activity
it's college republicans actually and
you can speak with uh
darren wherever darren is he spoke with
drew we have a permission so
okay thank you very much so so i'd like
to continue on that thought uh
where were we sorry i forgot uh you were
talking about um
we have uh we do it all the time we do
it all the time so
why why is it a problem to do it if
someone we know biologically is a male
or a female um and that can never be
changed
it can never be changed biologically uh
but someone chooses to say that they're
not
that's a very that's a very modern idea
um
and the question is why do we now have
to subscribe to that and then it gets in
the idea of compulsion of language
compelling language
you know gender pronouns
what's allowed what's hate speech right
it's it's a fundamental
re-transformation of society based on
from what i'm hearing from you unless
i'm mistaken abstract
i haven't heard a number i haven't heard
what defines male or female
only how people feel and i just that's
to me that's not
very convincing or conducive toward a
productive society
okay and i would uh and i would argue
that
um reason we're talking about uh
like like you said when i assumed that
you had a penis when i have no idea if
you have a penis or not
um and saying that people i got a nice
big penis there okay
and so that people when people subscribe
to being
you you would say you see somebody that
uh you would presume to be male
and you asked and you would assume that
they would identify as being a man
sure um as you did yeah yes and uh
and so if um but if you had told me
that you are that you um in fact don't
identify as being a man that you
identify as being a woman
i would believe that would be wrong of
me to try and
uh subscribe you to being a man when you
say you identify as a woman
what if i told you that i believe i am a
bobcat
good for you man but would you accept
that would it be wrong if you did not
accept it
yes really okay well listen i appreciate
your intellectual consistency why would
it be wrong of you
to not accept my identification as a
bobcat
because uh if you id if you
identify as a bobcat man go for it great
for you
i hope you're the best bobcat on the
 earth man
well i appreciate listen i think you're
a nice guy i hope it's been productive
and you you
i believe this has been civil but um you
do see obviously this is very this is a
very emotive
uh argument that you're making right
you're making an argument from a very
emotional
place and i think it's because you're
compassionate it's because you're a good
person but
and i appreciate your intellectual
consistency but the ramifications
of saying that we have to acknowledge
somebody legally who identifies as a
bobcat
you understand would be insurmountable
the ramifications would be all sorts of
new legal identifications that would be
required which don't currently exist
why the conversation i would love it if
you want to sit down afterwards
and i would love to sit down and have
continue this conversation i would
well are you thank you thomas are you
done yeah i appreciate it thomas
thank you madison i'm co-president of
spectrum the lgbt organization on campus
great love to talk to you about this
great thank you madison
my name's stephen okay uh i appreciate
it
uh you sitting down and um what is it
that you disagree with
so um i think you happen to be you're
confused on the idea of
gender versus sex i'm confused okay yeah
okay so
when we say there are only two genders
we often confuse the idea of gender and
sex
shorts is a generalization of xy
chromosomes so we assume that
our you know xy xx you know combination
of chromosomes
um so we assume that you know male and
female comes from your chromosomes right
but uh
that's really just the idea that there's
only two possibilities of sex
right so even within sex itself you know
you can
be born uh intersex which means that
you're born with
sexual characteristics of both what we
would consider male and female
and then you have gender and gender is
more about a mental state based off of
societal
norms so within our western society we
often discuss
gender as being binary meaning that
there's two options sure so boy
girl man woman however in other
societies non-western societies there
are more than
two options okay can i can i ask you a
couple questions there to unpack
um appreciate you taking the time by the
way so what was your your name madison
madison
madison so let's go to the sex concept
before gender i think because
the idea of gender being different from
sex is predicate on the other the idea
that sex is
um binary that's where you mention that
term gender binary so you mentioned
intersex
okay i'm aware of intersex now of course
intersex doesn't necessarily mean that
someone is completely between sexes
usually they have very identifiable
characteristics like a very large
clitoris
or micro penis in that case it also
affects point zero eight
people think this is funny it's just
true less than point zero eight percent
of the population earth they still but
they still exist let me ask you this in
human anatomy class
uh how many fingers are you taught human
beings have uh we're told typically that
people have 10 however there are people
born with 11. but you're taught 10 right
yeah so we don't teach people there are
people born with 11 fingers are people
born with 12 fingers yeah but we don't
completely dismiss that those people
exist just because that they're uncommon
do we
we teach that human beings have 10
fingers
i would wager that everyone here has
been taught yeah human beings have ten
figures of course there are anomalies
that's the same way that we treat
intersex or these as you said you
mentioned chromosomes genetic
abnormalities that are very
a very extreme case so i think what we
need to do is remove this extreme case
with sex just as we would with how many
fingers toes how many kidneys you have
how many
feet you have there's something that's
typical or something that's atypical
then you go to gender this is where
listen i'm open everyone has said sex is
different
from gender and gender is not non-binary
um so i would like allow you to kind of
unpack that for me
yeah so uh in western society at least
so in our country in our society we bel
we tend to think of gender to be on this
binary spectrum of
you don't well not even really a
spectrum just a binary so you have man
woman and that's it those are the only
two options
however gender really is more of a
spectrum so
it's non-binary there are not just two
options okay you have
man woman and then everything that
doesn't fit into just man and woman is
considered non-binary that's an umbrella
term
and that includes a lot of different
categorizations so how many genders are
there
i can't you can't put a number on the
number of genders because everyone uses
different words to classify themselves
i would disagree i'm not that's worth
change my i'm not convinced that anyone
can just use any classification for
themselves for their gender
and certainly not that then we have to
compel society
to address them this way right i'm sure
you can understand that the compelling
of language is an issue so what gender
do you think you are
well i'm a male okay well i think maybe
i think you're a woman
no legally i'm a male oh it says on my
driver's license that i'm a male
okay so that's your sex no it's a yeah
but i'm also a man
that's your sense it says on my carry
certificate that i'm a male gender some
legal documentation
say gender what if i say i don't believe
you it doesn't matter exactly it doesn't
matter if you don't believe me no it
doesn't matter because biologically what
gender do you think i am
i would assume you're a female yeah so
you're making assumptions
yes i identify as non-binary yeah i
don't respectfully it doesn't matter
it does matter now let me ask you this
what would you say if i have
what pronouns you use for me it matters
how i'm socialized in society it matters
my gender expression
it matters the way that i'm allowed to
express myself it matters what bathroom
i use it matters who i'm allowed to live
with it affects every aspect of my life
so you're saying
what pronoun should i use you should use
they them pronouns so you're saying that
what if i don't what if i don't if you
don't i would consider that
disrespectful and that's actually an act
of violence to misgender a trans
it's an act of violence that is an act
of violence to intentionally misgender
someone
here we come to the issue and this is
why i'm out here um you just said that's
an act of violence that means it's an
actionable offense that means it's a
crime
so you believe that for me it's a crime
i said it's an act of violence
that are not considered crimes are acts
of violence okay so you believe it's a
non-aggressive act of violence i think
that
okay when you misgender someone if you
were to misgender a trans woman
yes trans women especially trans women
of color
are the most or have the highest rate of
murder within the lgbt community right
so if you were to intentionally
misgender a trans woman
that could put her at risk of murder you
understand that because people think
because
i don't understand i'm sorry it does
show that you're privileged in the
situation then
yes i believe we're both i think you're
extremely privileged in the situation
that you don't have to experience that
or that you don't have to worry about
that or consider that that you don't
feel like you need to respect people's
pronouns i'm i'm considering this i'm
asking you questions
you said these are the pronouns i need
to use i said what if i don't you so
that's an act of violence yeah i would
say i'm trying
to act to violence against me okay so
that's a crime an act of violence
against you as a crime i would consider
that
i would consider you being disrespecting
we were decrying and when I say we I
mean you know us on the Left we were
decrying ben shapiro coming because of
you know if there's gonna be violence
and because he's hateful and because of
this and because of that the reality was
that a group an tyfa was going to be the
they were gonna be the ones producing
that type of violence
i'm really glad to have this next guest
i think we agree on very little policy
wise but that's also i wanted to have
mon this guy has a brass pair he wrote
some articles yeah i think the salt lake
tribune he's actually one of the
founders of indivisible utah so and then
we'll take it from there you can follow
him on twitter at da giri a GUI our our
e84 this that's the gringo way for
announcing it donald Aguirre how are you
sir I'm good how are you doing I'm doing
well thank you you're taking your life
in your hands coming on the show first
off so we or she you said you had some
friends who wanted you to punch me
forcefully yeah they well they said
punch him hard for me yeah and then
somebody somebody told me that you were
gonna make me eat my lunch today
he brought a box lunch you know I I
would allow you to on-air it's important
relaxed atmosphere
well this stem from you know obviously
individual Utah the Ben Shapiro spoke
there and and we were there we did this
video on anta fo and I saw you posted
that video first off knows is that where
you got the the first reaction from your
colleagues so it came in two waves the
first the first reaction was when I when
I submitted that opinion piece to the
Tribune I got messages saying you sound
like a like a self-loathing liberal or a
hateful liberal to yourself right and
that was the first time and then the
second one was after the event when I
saw the video that you guys made not
made you guys didn't fabricate that I
mean I I saw the raw footage after after
you guys released a three-minute yeah
and and you know I I mean you got a call
it how it is I think when it comes to
bad behavior dangerous behavior I mean I
wasn't the only one the good thing is
that people on what I guess my side who
watched that video also had the reaction
of oh my god yeah what the hell is this
you know people who luring people back
to possibly hurt them I mean political
ideology kind of just it caught it falls
to the wayside like he that anybody who
is interested in in civil dialogue and
in our society can see that that's
that's not good right it's and so yeah I
got reactions when when I posted that
video in fact I got a reaction from
someone that was in that video I forget
the person's name but they they work at
the you okay and you guys you guys
called them out specifically that they
were encouraging some of this behavior
they made a comment on the Facebook
posts that you know when I share your
video and it kind of just went from
there and the funny thing is outside of
the hidden camera footage were released
the raw footage mostly was pulled from a
lot of news they go out of professors
matter activists and let me see this you
wrote in your piece you said listen Ben
Shapiro is a lot of things but he's not
a white nationalist so I put the answer
thing on the side and go back to it that
struck a chord with me because he's a
notorious Jewish Nazi I mean I get that
you probably disagree with Ben on a
whole lot sometimes I wanna I want to
lay one on him you know Ben is smug he's
but he's a brilliant kid let me ask you
this the left they call him a white
nationalist or they call him a Nazi as
someone who's not afraid to go against
the grain this is a genuine question
since you're more on the Left than I am
do you think they really believe Ben
Shapiro is a Nazi a white nationalist or
is it an attack that they use and how
they react when you say listen it's just
not accurate okay so I'm glad you asked
that because I really think that this
comes from a purely emotional place I
think I think it's coming from from raw
emotion of of angst and not knowing in
which direction to take that angst to
properly address the actual issue one I
think it's coming from it's coming from
from from up high
I guess when when when you have groups
that are being led by people that get
caught up in having to retain attention
I'm gonna call it out right now
I saw the video that Lex Scott said that
he's the most dangerous man on the
planet right and and that that's
ridiculous he's not the most dangerous
man on the planet I would say the leader
of North Korea
pootin Trump to a certain degree there's
some dangerous crap there when it comes
to people that can make these big
decisions that affect your lives ben
shapiro i don't know what is he weighed
150 pounds 160 pounds I'm not gonna do
the carnival barking because he's doing
Crossfit so I don't want to get it wrong
yeah but he's a fit fit compact man I'm
probably probably in the ballpark yeah
and not only that you know did you watch
his speech by the way I did so I I woke
up the day that the tickets were being
distributed I got up at 6:00 a.m. and I
thought I'm getting up at 6:00 I'll
Drive to the you they use only like a
30-minute drive from where I live I'll
get a ticket because I want to attend I
want to go watch this and I got there
and there was already like 1500 people
in line okay and they had like 400
tickets you know so I wasn't able to get
in but I went to the event anyway and I
hung outside and I interviewed people I
talked to trump supporters ben shapiro
supporters i talked to a bunch of people
and i in since i couldn't get in i had
it playing on the youtube link that was
available so i listened to that on the
audio while i interacted with people
after at the rally that was outside and
the one thing i can say is that every
single side does not have all the
information they have pieces of
information that made me fit their
narratives but they don't know the
entire story
I asked Trump supporters did you know
that should that ben shapiro supported
ted cruz they had no idea i asked people
if they knew that ben shapiro was a jew
they had no idea so there's a lot of a
lot of missing information that i think
caused emotions to run high on on all
the different side did you pull a large
sampling of blind people who couldn't
see the yarmulke if you know you have to
ask it a certain point go and there's a
plus/minus of a hundred percent here
yeah it really i mean i so i i watched
you and the funny thing is the first
time i saw your stuff i thought is this
guy a liberal is he conservative where
does he fall on things cuz it was fun it
was funny to me as someone who i guess
you know after this people will say
you're not even on the left you're not a
liberal you're you're capitulating to
the right you're this and you're that
here what they say I know what I think
sure the first time I saw your video I
thought I don't know where this guy
stands and then I watched more of them
like oh okay this guy has a conservative
slant on things which is fine sure and
and then I went down that little rabbit
hole looking at ben shapiro videos i've
looked at at milo videos i've looked at
a variety of things and and at the end
of it all all you have to do i think
that the arguments that were being
presented sucked on the left made us
look stupid i think because we didn't
know all the facts we're calling this
guy and not see a white nationalist
someone oh he's he's part of the
alt-right oh he supported donald trump I
watched ben shapiro laughing his ass off
the night of the election when Trump won
because he thought it was so ridiculous
he thought it was like this guy won
right and he was laughing so and that
only took me a couple clicks to find
well then L tribalism that you see I
mean listen you know we in the primaries
I support pretty much everyone but Trump
when I came to the Trump versus Hillary
okay I see the argument but people just
go you're you're an alt right Trump
supporter it doesn't matter what you are
that's an umbrella term that's been used
but let me ask you this going back to
the first off did you hear anything
particularly incendiary in Ben's
specific speech at Utah okay there's one
thing that stood out to me okay I wasn't
I wasn't I wasn't calling you know an
emergency line to talk me off the ledge
about it right I looked at it as an
opportunity there was one situation
there was one specific moment in the in
his talk where he was talking to
somebody that I know that was in the
audience who is the chair to one of the
Democratic parties and one of the
counties here in Utah and the question
was about societal value of gay marriage
of same-sex marriage and and ben shapiro
started off with you know if we're
talking about promiscuity and if we're
talking about maybe the spread of
disease and yes there's a societal value
there and and I heard that and I thought
he did that on purpose he obviously did
that on purpose
I know that he's he'll app he'll let
liberals or people that lean to the left
to ask questions first he lets them ask
questions first that's in the front so I
know that and so I know that that was
that was kind of a setup he's also and
he's entertaining the crowd it's not
like
he's not you know and then it went into
the whole if we're gonna define you know
the value of marriage it has nothing to
do with those things it has everything
to do with the reproduction of children
with the production of children and the
person who asked this question by the
way who's the chair of the Democratic
Party in Utah County is gay and so it
was very civil it was like okay then
that's it he sat down and that was the
end of it I know that there were people
that watched that and said oh this guy
is hateful he hates gays he hates this
type of person and that type of person
when that's not the argument that should
be made the argument that should have
been made I think and I'm not a
constitutional lawyer I think Ben
Shapiro is a constitutional lawyer I'm
not exactly sure what is law practices
but yeah the argument to be made is if
we're gonna define that value of
marriage is the production of children
then how do we explain heterosexual
couples that don't that can produce
children you know if it's if it's
children themselves then you know what
about same-sex marriages that same such
same-sex parents that raise children
they give a stable home in the house
sure you know there's a lot of viable
arguments that could be made that could
be based off studies that could be based
off facts but getting caught up in
emotional getting hooked by that you
lose right so it was immediately I don't
want to get into a debate we're gonna be
back on to actually debate issues
recover you know have a conversation
about issues when we disagree
I would have loved to hear that
conversation but I guess sort of in a
nutshell nothing that been said was
deliberately incendiary or hateful I
just wanted to make sure you know I
don't want anyone here since I know
you're more left to think that you have
to defend everything Ben said that's not
what this is about
going back to the antiphon issue I know
you're you're more liberal but I think
we'd probably both agree that the media
leans to the left did you feel as though
maybe your eyes were opened a little bit
again this is truly just it's it's I'm
not fishing for an answer
but if someone who's been on the right
and it said before this happened I said
the media no matter what happens to me
he's not going to want to cover this on
anti-fur they're not going to want to
cover even if it is violent we never
expected it to be as bad as it was but
seeing the media having access to the
same footage that the FBI had access to
which led to the arrest of one of these
people saying no no we're not going to
cover it did that concern you at all as
someone who's more liberal and knows
that the media tends to lean your way
I'll tell you what concerned me what
concerned me was the
journalistic integrity that needs to
exist when we went when a journalist
when someone wants to deliver the news
and by the way I'm I'm a university
student and I'm studying journalism and
that that's something that I enjoyed
very much I love to read and so I want
to know facts and I want to know well
what was the story give me the facts and
let's see let's let's dissect that the
fact that that was just kind of glossed
over and and the only because the only
video I saw came from from this from
this YouTube channel I didn't see it
coming out anywhere else right I didn't
see someone debunk you guys and say hey
we went behind and looked at what
Crowder did nothing like that came out
and so what concerned me the most is the
fact that this was this was a factual
thing that happened this this this
looked like a truthful event this this
thing occurred and you went to them and
told them hey this happened I have the
footage I have as a journalist I would
want to at least look at this I would
like to vet that information and then
put it in the news like I I would that's
that's that's what my biggest concern
was yeah because because there needs to
be in integrity when when there is a
delivery of the news or when you're
discussing the fact if you're gonna
discuss an opinion or an editorial then
obviously it's editorialized you're
gonna have your own subjective view on
that which is completely fine that's
what we expect from an editorial but
that wasn't an editorial this was a fact
this is what happened yeah you know it's
give more leeway and say we edit oriole
eyes based on what happened you know we
went in and we thought that you know
screaming you know we've had them spit
on people or throw stuff but when they
handed page here Dan was an icepick that
was wasn't that a nice pitch at night
I'm not up to date a shank ship I don't
know that verb versus noun when that
happened he texts us that they just
handed me a knife and a shiv and they're
going to get more it was said we pulled
them out so then we went right away to
the police to the feds see and the media
yeah the police the authorities took it
right away took him into a van I didn't
see him for two hours and media said no
no don't nothing about this that was
what was crazy to me so two things one
excellent thinking on not knowing where
to go take us to get out of that
situation
remember to number
- here's what I would like to know I
would like to know you know what if safe
like let's say Fox News would have been
there who many say well that's that's a
conservative that's a conservative news
channel or let's say a conservative news
outlet would have been there do you
think you would have gotten the same
response from them or do you or do you
think that the you didn't get a response
to them solely on the fact that you feel
that they lean more to the left that
they're more liberal media well you know
what that's an interesting question
because there's a lot of inside baseball
you know I worked at Fox for four and a
half years I will say this they would
have been more interested if it were
just a generic person coming forward
with this story right but news outside
of let's remove sort of the politics
from it they're so focused on getting a
scoop and an exclusive and not just
reporting the actual news they might not
if it were me because they know they
have a big enough channel I've had
people at big news networks coming in
say hey listen listen can you give this
to us exclusively I said it's going
online well we don't want to use it then
we don't want to cover the story so IDIA
logically yeah Fox leans to the right
not as far right as people think with
this you know we're the redheaded
stepchild listen we this is editorial
ization this is the podcast that grew
beyond you know our wildest imagination
and we tend to have a platform I don't I
can't answer that question for me I
think Fox would have taken it if it were
just some random person with a story I
do I I know that I'm not sure if you if
you guys over there have recently seen
it just came out yesterday or the day
before the Washington Post had a they
released something on a woman who had
approached them from they say she came
out of a building in the New York
offices as a project Veritas Oh so James
O'Keefe thing that James O'Keefe thing
and you know this is something that you
know I I feel that the media as a whole
just needs to be better overall I mean
the news would be much more boring I
think but it's it's more like we get
constant analysis of things and we beat
it to death that is just constant
analysis constant analysis there's
always breaking news of the same I'm
sorry don't worry about it
it's the same it's the same stuff that
just keeps coming out when the reality
should be that you know like this
information like that that specific
video I seriously was shocked my friend
and I but couple buddies of mine that
work with me I show them the video and
they will
oh my god I was planning on going there
I was gonna take my wife or you know I
would have gone with my kids I would
have I would have gone there and then
they saw that video and I thought why
wasn't this on the news why didn't
nobody report this why did this not get
reported and so you know it's it's one
of those things where we were decrying
and when I say we I mean you know us on
the Left we were decrying ben shapiro
coming because of you know if there's
gonna be violence and because he's
hateful and because of this and because
of that the reality was that a group
auntie fuh was going to be the they were
gonna be the ones producing that type of
violence if you're came down to that
luckily it did not I'm so glad that
didn't happen but you know I've been
getting flack for calling out auntie
from the very beginning well
specifically aunt I thought why have you
chosen before our video to not get
behind anti and why is it so hard for
the left you know it's not hard for me
to say hey the rallies were the guys of
the tiki torches we're not with them
that's just as disgusting to me and
running somewhere the Dodge Challenger
awful terrible why is that the left
can't do the same thing when aids but
whether they're sucker punching people
at an airport or this is happening in
Utah and why did you have the foresight
it's I don't understand it because it
seems like you're reasonable I would
imagine there are more like you on the
left than plenty we'd like to believe
plenty plenty plenty I you know I wish I
could answer that with 100% certainty
but I think what it comes down to it is
again it comes down to a level of angst
there's a level of anxiety that needs to
be talked down but in order to for it to
be talked down people have to be open to
listen I think losing or ceding the
moral high ground or move any moral
ground for the forget the high ground
but seating any sort of moral position
to a group that incites violence doesn't
win the public over and and I think
looking at peaceful protests honest
dissent that that is done in a peaceful
way that's done in a way to where you're
bringing in more voices that whole level
okay this latest installment of change
my mind
is regarding the abortion issue i'm
pro-life changed my mind so probably the
most contentious that we've
discussed i would say so can certainly
be argued
warning uh this one is is it 45 minutes
it's like 53.
it's 53 minutes so it's very long and i
know that when you're watching this it
can feel very frustrating i know i did
so i i think it's important to lead with
where this conversation
ends up because that will really help
you understand the context of the
conversation
so when would it be okay i guess to put
limitations let's say on abortion
limitations when is it okay because
we've acknowledged
viability is not consistent but you're
okay with it anyway
you're the only one who's valuing the
rights of of one being
over another being the mother over a
child because you're the one who's
actually proactively terminating life
and you're okay with that i'm simply
saying no one
has the right to terminate another life
just like you don't it's a
non-aggression principle
you don't have the right to hurt me i
don't have the right to hurt you i'm
saying
that person doesn't have the right to
hurt that baby
you're saying it does so you're saying
her rights supersede that of the other
life
living growing inside of her so at what
point
is that okay or not okay i guess is
where it comes down to it it's dangerous
to put
any kind of limitations or controls
around that because she in the end is
the one responsible for that and
and though in those circumstances and i
i don't think that
it's entirely fair to judge them without
being in her shoes i'm i'm not sure
people felt about the decision that i
made but
it doesn't but that again that doesn't
change the essence of what is moral what
is a life it's like saying well listen
i'm against
slavery i think it's bad but if someone
else makes that decision
i have no right to judge their right to
choose slavery because at one point that
was considered okay
it doesn't matter what our opinion is if
that's a life and that's why it's the
only question i would say that really
needs to be answered before we have any
other discussion
so the moment of conception that's where
a woman
loses all ability to make any decisions
no no no you act as though i'm
anti-choice that's not true
well how can you be pro-life and
pro-choice sure i support four choices
contraception abstinence motherhood
adoption okay
the only one have a problem with is the
fifth one that's murder
murder yes so you don't even use the
word abortion you just use the word
murder okay killing what is killing
what's defined what's
what is killing what's the definition of
killing killing
would be the cessation of
the forcible cessation of someone else's
life right murder or killing
let's let's let's let's i'm trying to
see if i can kill the tree but i mean
okay killings will relate to a person
would it be the forcible termination of
someone else's
life killing right okay right now
what is murder it's the cessation of
a formed life it's killing with intent
right to simplify it because otherwise
it's man's thought sure
okay so we agree on murder so if that's
a life
how is abortion not murder because
again at different points it's not it's
not it's
not viable let me answer your question
with as much specificity as i can you
said
yes i believe that once that unique
human dna is created that's separate
from the mother separate from the father
to an entirely new person yeah i don't
support uh the forcible termination so
that's my
view to be just just so i'm very
consistent
so let's look at the fetal development
where is it okay for you what point is
it okay
to kill
so why do i think that's important we
don't do a whole lot of editing with the
change my minds that's what people
really like about it
in this case today we're going to
provide a little bit of commentary again
because it's 53 minutes long it'll be
intermittent it'll be brief
um i think it's important for for you to
see this and for you to note
that some people it doesn't matter how
convincing your arguments are
maybe my arguments aren't that
convincing uh it doesn't matter how
civil you are
sometimes you're not going to get
anywhere and often with you know when
you do q and a's whether it's me at
umass or bench appear answering these
these questions and you see like you
know these montages swatted down leftist
super entertaining yes it's super
entertaining but you don't see those
quiet moments afterward where that
person
sometimes they still think they're right
sometimes their mind isn't changed
sometimes you run into someone in this
case i was wondering my gosh the vi we
go through viability you'll see we go
through the idea of
obviously viability outside of the womb
also the idea of sentience
all this is kind of covered today and i
found myself frustrated
and it is hard to identify sometimes
okay is it me
not doing a good job or is this somebody
who
whose heels are so dug in their mind
won't be changed and i think that when
you see this this woman looked at that
chart
looked at a nine month old baby and said
i don't care no abortion laws
and so i i don't know what to say
to that and you realize there is no
changing there is no common ground
there there's no viability doesn't
matter and looking back on this
conversation if you
think it seems like circular logic and
it's frustrating
it's because it doesn't matter she's
okay with avoiding a nine-month-old baby
anyway
yeah that's why you're never going to
pin her down on any specific issue as
you'll see
that like you like you discussed it
you're never going to find a place
to agree upon because she's that's not
her end game but she brings these up as
smoke screens
nice lady but she means well i think
it's about viability why what about rape
and incest
she doesn't care about any of those
things because she looked at the the
graph
of the fetus zygote feed his baby to use
her words and said
nowhere situational ethics completely
and i think it's important because a lot
of people sometimes will send us emails
and say well how do i have this person
who's coming over to thanksgiving a
family member how do i convince them
sometimes you need to sit in the pocket
you need to take as many swings as you
can you need to try and change their
mind
as best as possible and you need to
accept that it won't happen
anyway and it's hard it's a hard pill to
swallow because
obviously if you're someone who cares
about changing minds you're going to
look back at yourself and say gosh
could i have done a better job sometimes
maybe you can
sometimes it's just somebody who says
abortion up to nine months
no laws at all period so with that being
said that context
uh let's watch this video and kind of
take you through the series of arguments
that brought us to that
conclusion
[Music]
what was your name the way jen jen
stephen nice to meet you
all right general here you can hold this
if you want um just
you know you know talking to the yeah
you're talking to the stick
change my favorite part so i'm just
supposed to tell myself
just talk to me yeah we're just having a
conversation so okay jen
i'm stephen i can hold it if you want me
to yeah that's fine yeah i know
sometimes people get a little
a little more formal i don't i don't
bite so all right i appreciate before we
even set up you were
really quick to say okay is you seem
surprised you said is that for real
when you saw the sign i'm pro-life
changed my mind
why what was so surprising about it um
in my experience dealing with um
pro-life either protests
or discussions normally it's not
change my mind normally it's
they show pictures of actual abortions
or trying to
create women or shame them into
decisions that they've made
it's not really about having um you know
a repartee
it's more about kind of either a
religious ideology
or you know their personal ideology and
just kind of trying to force that on you
rather than
trying to have it understand having a
conversation where we can understand
each other
right and where we're coming from and
why we have these different values
right and also because we're across from
the art museum so i didn't know if
it was a experiment like a social
experiment to see
what people thought you thought it just
might be ironic
i just thought i would ask okay no yeah
it is for real so i am pro-life
okay um and uh you know this is this is
a series we've done it on
gun control we've done it on free speech
uh just listening to the other side
uh giving someone who genuinely believes
from the opposite side of the political
cultural spectrum than i do to
to change my mind to convince me and
have a uh
a respectful but critical dialogue of
issues that you know
we all talk about in today's political
realm but often it's just
it's shouted about right so i am open to
having my mind changed and i have an
international relations degree i've
worked for the united nations i've
worked for the state department so i'm
very much about
understanding and coalition building and
sure discussion
i am not about the shouting okay so um
also my daughter is standing right here
she's a wonderful
shiny example honor student i had her
when i was 16
life is very important to me um
but recently i had a different kind of
um experience so as i promised we'll
keep these commentaries really brief but
one thing you'll notice with changing my
mind anytime someone comes up who's
really hardcore against our viewpoint
they have invariably set up some kind of
a victim status almost always
trans disabled i'm literally autistic in
this case someone who
needed an abortion out of a medical
necessity they use it because when they
feel their argument is is on shaky
ground or their position they revert
back to it you'll see
i am married i also
uh during my experience at the state
department
i was a prisoner of war so i have very
severe ptsd
that causes a seizure disorder and i was
on seizure medication
when i found out that i was pregnant and
i don't know if you know this or not but
when fuses
uh are developing it's actually nerve
bundles
that create you know the arm or the leg
or fingers or whatever sure
and seizure medication by design is
created to limit nerve
bundles and certain synapses and certain
processing
because the person with a seizure
disorder means that they're firing too
much or in a way that they shouldn't be
okay so um found out that i was pregnant
went to uh my ob gyn the same one that
delivered my daughter
and um literally
on the sonogram watch my
baby die cardiac cell by cardiac cell by
cardiac cell
not because of anything a choice that i
didn't make not because i wasn't
just not because i was outside of a
marriage
not because and there was nothing that i
could
do i could either continue to at first
it had
seven cardiac cells and then we went
back to another sonogram and it had four
and then it had three and then it had
two so my options were to
literally let the fetus die and begin
rotting inside of me
or to go to a clinic based on texas law
and get it taken care of before i had to
actually
physically experience jesus
right um so to me um
based on the safety of you know my my
safety and and
if i didn't have a that option available
to me um
and the trauma that that would have
caused i think that there are
unique uh situations especially um
you know when a woman's been you know
raped or whatever
that that that's something that should
be available to them
as a decision that that they make okay
can i ask a couple questions sure of
course
so you first came in i know you said
that you're uh you said life was very
important to you but you didn't say
pro-life
so can we i guess establish what that
means first before i kind of want to
unpack
the personal story which i can only
imagine is harrowing i've never been
through that i'm not going to act as
though i can relate to that
uh i'll do my best as we discuss it but
you said life is very important to you
and then went into that story what does
that mean
i fought for uh life my entire life i've
risked my life for other people's lives
that's why i went into international
relations
i worked at the united nations i was
very successful at setting something up
for people that
live in rural areas setting up social
and economic development for them
it's something that i did in my
dedicated my education to it's something
i dedicated my career to it's something
that i was
eventually captured by rebels in west
africa
you know trying to still fight for right
um
so it's not something that i take
lightly at all
um but the option for
a woman especially given the position
that i was in and and when my
obstetrician that
i'm going to hold this a little closer
because of all the ambulances so forgive
me i don't mean to intrude but
we won't be able to hear you that wealth
but but when i um went to my
obstetrician that i when i was pregnant
with my daughter at 16
or 15 actually i had her when i was 16.
um she didn't
say you know what are you doing go
take care of this so you wouldn't
consider so you asked if we were serious
because
you definitely don't consider yourself
pro-life then in that sense
not in that sense okay um
so my next question is you use the word
you said rather than
endure that trauma right uh did you mean
that for
the baby or yourself
i meant it i guess primarily
watching it every time i went in was
was increasingly more traumatic watching
each cardiac cell
die off sure increasingly more traumatic
do you mean for you or traumatic on the
for me and for my husband
okay right um at that point in time
depending on what you believe the
nervous system hadn't really been fully
formed so i don't know how much trauma
the actual
but it was dying nonetheless and there
was nothing that that we could
have done at that point in time based on
the medication that i was taking
it's interesting to me that you you just
use the word dying
why would you use that word because its
cardiac cells were dying
so without those cardiac cells its heart
stopped and then it sure
but you said it was dying not cardiac
cells it
so that would i guess would we agree
that that is that was a life
that it was a potential life now
important to note here this is not a
debate tactic this is actually very
important when discussing an issue to
find out what
what your terms are to define them so
you're both understanding issues
and um notice how she sort of hops she
jumps
from word lilypad to wordlilypad using
her own definitions absolutely that
happens a lot and now it makes sense
because
she doesn't care where life begins
anyway she uses the word dying she uses
the word cell she talks about heartbeat
and then backtracks
because none of it matters we're okay
with abortions up to nine months let's
keep that context
was a potential life for a life it was a
potential life okay can we can you
help me with this uh again being
pro-life differentiating between the
idea the potential of life
versus a life so when you say that as a
potential life
potential for what a potential
to grow into a
baby that could self-sustain
on some level outside of its mother's
womb so you mean potential human
so the potential human is fulfilled into
actual human
i want to make sure that i'm clear here
so we understand the kind of the terms
we're following
the potential human then becomes a human
when it is sustainable outside of the
womb
i think that that i think that that's
true
i think that that until that point it is
an
so alright this this is a I wouldn't say
first it's basically at first this guess
is a first on here in la cascada but
it's a first to get someone this much of
a there's another way say in the studio
we were all very praising of him this
morning
this man is is thought it was a national
hero by a lot of folks and we just so
happened that I guess his daughter's a
fan as a mug club member and so we were
able to get him Daren our Booker got him
on the line this is the man who pursued
and I believe I believe I'll let him
explain it shot the shooter the Texas
shooter who everyone's been talking
about right now that I hate sitting here
of the hour because I know he's gonna be
humble and downplay it but Stephen
Willeford thank you for being here sir
thank you for having me on well I know
how emotional of a time this must be and
probably exhausting everyone's been
wanting a piece of you in the press so I
really do appreciate you making the time
and listen if ever you just don't want
to discuss it
I know legally maybe can't answer
question just feel free to say pass and
you know my moronic self will move on
down the trail okay so explain for
people who don't know you know what
happened we've all read we've all heard
about the Texas shooting storylines two
very confusing this storyline is very
confusing for a lot of people as far as
I understand you were across the street
you're in the neighborhood and you got
your firearm and pursue this individual
just explain it for them to the audience
for people who they've been making kind
of putting this together with bits and
pieces from the media I live in a little
small community of Sutherland and wig
number in the hundreds definitely not in
the thousands they're all community I
want to dairy there that I was support
generationally I love my community I
love the people that are there I know
most of the people that went to the
church there and most of them knew my
great-grandparents the older ones that's
how far back it goes
and why I knew anyway our yeah go ahead
sorry I know how much you care for them
I know how emotional must be and if I
can help you anyway let me know here the
community knows you well if ever one
who's been interviewed spoken so highly
of you I don't think there's anyone as a
bad word to say it all about about this
Manchester then people pivot right away
to politicizing the issue of gun control
so let's put that on the Shelf here what
happened that you know the day of the
shooting when this this story broke what
happened what did you hear what went
through your mind what went down that
day I I was I was at home yeah I was
actually in my my room relaxing and I
started hearing a sound and it sounded
like someone tapping on my window I'm
about about a block away from the church
okay yeah my older daughter ran in she
was she was cleaning dishes in the
kitchen and she ran into my room and
said dad doesn't that sound like gunfire
and I told her I said that sounds like
someone tapping on the window and and it
was just a rapid tapping and I went to
the window and open the window and I
could not see anything but I followed
her into the kitchen when I got into my
kitchen it's not more volume and I could
tell that it sounded like gunfire I said
oh my god it sounds like gunfire
I ran to my safe and opened my safe and
I am my daughter ran outside got in her
car and drove around the block well I
got my ar-15 out of the safe and I ran
back and I grabbed a box of ammunition
and she came in and said dad there's
someone in tactical black I think Oh
gears the Baptist Church and I said call
your mom
my wife and
my daughter that's here too now and her
husband were working on their house
we're building their house and they were
over at my property that's five miles
down the road and and she called them
and I said stay put stay put we have an
active shooter situation at the Baptist
Church - stay where you are because I
knew they were far enough out of town
they were no danger right oh I opened
the box of ammunition and I grabbed a
handful because I was hearing shots one
after another rapid pace and and I just
grabbed a handful and I started loading
a magazine and I started out the door
and my other daughter I told her love me
another magazine and I knew she couldn't
come give me a magazine it was busy work
I was trying to give her something to do
keep her in her house for thought I was
thinking you need it so you actually
just you hadn't you had the time and
spatial awareness to think
give her something so that she's
distracted I guess I've been a foreman
before and construction and sometimes
you just gotta get busy work to someone
I have to get him out to get him out of
your hair yes okay but but in and my
daughter is she is great girl and she's
actually I I started training all my
kids when they were eight years old they
were NRA distinguished experts Wow so
they are the firearms yeah I was a
instructor but I did not want anybody
else that might be a target right Wow
good there and and I I ran out of the
house and some of them people said why
did you run out barefoot as I didn't
have shoes on
the simple answer well my answer was was
every time I heard a shot I was thinking
that was assigned to someone else right
that shot was assigned he was shooting
and another person every time I heard a
shot fire and I didn't have time to put
shoes on I'm it's the time of the year
that I'm growing my Santa beard because
I fell on a motor because I go on a
motorcycle ride with the Baptist Church
where we deliver toys for boys and girls
of low-income around Wilson County and I
ride with a Baptist Church it was under
attack well so you so high shoes on and
then what do you do you get into your
vehicle do you run straight to the
Cherno I'm a block away or less of less
than a block away they're their catty
corner behind me in my house her house
behind me and they're across the street
on the other side okay and so I ran over
there and I ran across the neighbor's
house that was right across from there
and as I approached the neighbor's house
I see a gray SUV setting in the middle
of the highway in park with the engine
running and the driver's side door open
and it was out of place and I was
focused on that trying to figure out
that and kind of looking back behind the
vehicle and and I don't know that I had
tunnel vision or what the deal was but I
saw the shooter come from around the
front of the vehicle okay
and at this time he had a handgun in his
in his hand and I didn't know but my
daughter said that it had an ar-15 but
when I saw him he had a handgun okay and
he had a tactical helmet on like like a
SWAT team would use with with a black
visor and he had Kevlar vest and you
could tell it was a bullet test he had
that and you know I'm a Christian sure
and I believe I believe at that point
and maybe this sounds a little off just
some of your visit there
viewers that aren't Christians I believe
the Holy Spirit was on me because I had
the presence of mind to look at what was
going on and as we exchanged fire I
noticed that the side was one of those
tactical vests that velcro's across
meaning he has Kevlar in the front
Kevlar in the back nothing in the side
how far away was he at this point for
for context would you say 20 yards okay
so 20 yards so you can see that clearly
and someone like you is trained with
firearms to it you know 20 yards as well
within what you would practice with I
had a ar-15 with an EOTech moment sure
and I trained at 20 yards that's no snow
real great amazing shot I shot between
the two Kevlar plates well that is what
not to just heat trace oh no everyone
else will but to have that frame of mind
like you said that force sight I know
people are going to be asking mahir NRA
instructor training military background
because most people would not think to
look for this to be aware of your
surroundings it is it is remarkable well
that's what I'm telling you I can't I
can't explain the clarity of mind that I
had I can't explain it and and and not
only back but I was using the neighbor's
Dodge pickup truck he had a four-wheel
drive Dodge pickup truck in his driveway
and I was using it all I had all he had
for a shot for me as my head because I
was behind the truck and using it for
cover okay and we exchanged fire and he
hit the neighbors car's windshield he
hit the neighbor's house and he got into
the vehicle and I fired again and he
fired two more shots through his side
actually he shot fired two shots through
a side window first and it put notice
the two distinct pistol shots coming
through the sides of the window and I
fired my our 15 again and it took the
window down it fell okay and I took I
took another saw and at this point I'm
stupid where his head will be right and
he started the vehicle and he turned and
he turned down five thirty nine which is
which is a highway and he took off took
one more shock and what I perceived
would be about his head through the back
windshield and it shattered okay
and he blasted down the road I looked to
my left and there was a another a pickup
truck at the stop sign that apparently
witnessed the bubble thing and I ran up
and I tapped on his window and I said
that guy just shot up the Baptist Church
and we got a stop and he unlocked his
door and we gave pursuit and thank God
that he did because you know obviously
you have to think from his point of view
he comes up with a gun and says you know
this is a tactic that kidnappers or
people who are car jackers use a lot hey
I need your help and he I don't thank
God you both got it right he he did he
did he did witness this the exchanged
gunfire right he saw the guy student at
me also and he saw him run out from from
the Baptist Church and he saw him in the
black tactical gear and me and me when
no shoes on yeah he might have that
point he might've said okay that's the
bad guy the guy with the black visor not
the guy with the Santa beard and there's
no flip-flop so he lets you in a few
windows now been shot through and how
far is he from you as you behave and
closer yeah he had a considerable lead
with the body but he he left out of
there we shot across in a major
intersection at full speed and again I
had the presence of mind I I dropped the
magazine but because I had to remember I
didn't load a magazine I just grabbed a
handful and stuck a man didn't count
right
I dropped the magazine down and I looked
and I have one round in the magazine
meaning I had one round in the
one in the magazine and I pushed it back
up in place he had called 911 at this
point and he was talking to 911 and
obviously the Wilson County Police
Department and everybody else has got an
active shooter at the Sutherland Springs
Church right and so we started talking
to dispatch and telling them that we
were in pursuit of him going for John
5:39 and they said which direction he
was headed toward Seguin North 539 and I
said can you seem and about that time he
came into view of the n we started
catching him okay so he comes into view
and started catching him what does that
mean you start closing the gap do you
bump them no no we were still three cars
behind him but we could see him and you
can see the back windshield was knocked
out and we were making up ground and
they asked us specifically where is he
and there was a crossroad there that 7r2
27 or something like that the crosses
and goes back to Lavernia and he had
just passed that and we told dispatch he
just passed the road that cuts off and
goes to laverna
and so we're giving them we're letting
them know where he is right and and we
started closing on him real fast at that
point any veered off the road and he
almost stopped and I reached down and I
started to open the door and I had my
rifle in my hand and I was gonna stand
behind the door and then he took off
again and he hit a highway sign and
folded over the back of it over the top
of this vehicle he got back up on the
pavement and ran up about a hundred more
yards and then down into the far ditch
on the other side and stopped okay and
at that point I told the driver and I
didn't know his name at all his name
ended up his name's Johnny
though the driver I said just get down
you have nothing and just get down get
out of the fire
let's just get below the dash and I open
the door and I got out and I use the
truck again to lay my rifle across the
hood of the truck and I started yelling
which is not like me well I think it's
forgivable in this instance I don't
think anyone's gonna be too upset about
it
so you're yelling your rifle is on there
it's he at this point saying anything
back or if this is where he's already
he's quiet there's there's nothing left
coming loose from him there's no
movement there's no I I don't know I
don't know at this point I didn't know
what was going on in the vehicle what
was going on if if anything I didn't
know and so I sat there and Johnny said
estimated between five and seven minutes
it's y'all got to tell you it seemed
like an eternity right I've got I've got
my rifle trained on the side window of
the driver's side and just waiting for
any sign of anything and I'm yelling the
whole time and I I remember one time
yelled out where's the police and just a
short time after I yelled that I was
focused on the SUV I heard a PA system
come on and said driver get out of the
vehicle with your hands up I'm gonna
hurt it begin I laid my rifle over the
hood of the truck and I walked back to
the back of the truck with my hands up
like this and the officer looked at me
so not you
I didn't want him to think that there
was any threat with me at all right but
now that was kind of a funny moment
because I realized at that time that
there's only one spot bar and I go right
and so I went ahead and and I held my
rifle trained onto the car until I saw
about six different police officers pull
up and I thought my job was done and I
put the rifle on the back of the toolbox
to the pickup truck and started to walk
back and they said no no no stay where
you are stay where you are and they
drove a car up so that I could get
behind the car and be shielded as is he
backed up and got me away from the scene
the Wilson County Police Department
should be proud of themselves I'm sure
they aren't I'm sure they're proud of
you I wouldn't be surprised if some kind
of a metal or achievement here because
you know listen this is you did so much
and this is when people often say well
call the police you see in this instance
they did as good of a job as they
possibly could and in that instance
right if you weren't there this is one
thing that I would like your perspective
on the media says well this didn't
necessarily stop at the shooting had
already occurred but who knows just
during those five to seven minutes what
what kind of damage he could have done
if not for someone like you as you said
that's an eternity I'm going to tell you
and and I found out later they said he
had multiple firearms in the vehicle and
lots of ammunition and I don't know what
his plan was but my my my my thought and
looking at it is he had active ball
helmet and a Kevlar vest he wasn't
through yeah and there and there was the
River Oaks Baptist Church two in the
same direction that he left right yeah
by no means saying that that's where he
was going
but they were in the middle of my Sunday
morning services - yeah
well it doesn't seem like a getaway a
guy who keeps his car running and has
several more weapons and ammunition
that's not someone who's just looking to
get out of Dodge
so I mean what are you I mean I I don't
want to Barbara Walters this but do you
have it what are your feelings like now
they they mixed I mean I know people
talk about what it's like in these
scenarios and you can never imagine
taking a life but in this instance
knowing so many people in your town and
saving so many people what are you what
are you feeling like now I I'm having
all kinds a issues and I now I know I
probably need to talk to I know police
officers go through some sort of
counseling and I probably need to talk
to a counselor and I'm going to because
I can't I can't put my finger on what my
feelings are
I'm a little bit angry at the media oh
that's gonna really make you happy but I
felt well my my issue is is I feel like
a prisoner in my own home because I
can't step out my door I I know and
that's I appreciate you doing this
interview it's feel free to be off at
any time I can imagine you want some
time to yourself but not all differently
either this is crazy crazy they're
coming up to my door and they're
sticking cards in my door Sheriff Joe
Tackett told them if they come up into
my yard again he was gonna arrest them
and when they left they were right back
gosh and I would love to you know and
and this is where I want the focus for
this to go sure right here not me
I want the focus to go to the families
of the community that I grew up in and
the people that I love they're the
people that I know
the church was very small congregation
and 27 people are dead children are dead
20 amol 20 or so were injured
[Music]
that's decimated their congregation
there's very few left in their
congregation right the pastor of the
church
Frank Pomeroy was him and his wife were
in Oklahoma they're 40 girl daughter was
killed I can only imagine I mean that's
just that's a that's a long drive home
where's there a place people can go to
support the church and its its members I
was you know a lot of people feel
helpless as to how they can help in an
instance like this oh you know please
figure it out again I've been a prisoner
in my own home I have no idea
I can't they're having a memorial at the
baseball stadium and the media is gonna
be there and guess who can't be there if
media's there yeah I can imagine it's
got to be tough I want to hug somebody's
people yeah I don't even know which
one's my friends made it and didn't I
don't know cuz the media has not given
me any information and they're keeping
me from seeing any of these people have
have the media been helpful with you at
all have some have been contentious how
have they been treating you I know
obviously they're they're being very
persistent after well and I'm gonna tell

so we have Gary Sinise Dean deserves
more than boom it's kind of a rather
became bro that's bra bra bra I don't
know when it goes to next the orange in
stores now question of the day by the
way this is will get to the
trick-or-treating socialism Donald Trump
jr. tweet JK rowling Stephen Colbert one
thing you know obviously people know
that you tend to get more conservative
as you grow older in sometimes because
you have more skin in the game but I
want to ask you if you're watching we
have a lot of young people in the
audience as you've grown old or right
after Halloween do you find yourself
caring more about merit and less about
fairness is that a big part I think that
is for me I think when you get out of
college everything is about fairness
things about equality of outcomes and
once you've earned something unique to
you something that nobody else can earn
also you're going wow I this isn't just
a merit this isn't just a trophy
everybody gets this this merit thing
really means me yes so did you you
didn't do this yes you need to do all
this thing I either make rent or I don't
know right using your own value your own
skill sets what you bring to the table
so did you feel it as you get older
that's a natural progression that is
definitely been for me when I was a kid
I wanted everything to be fair yeah and
I I progressed a little earlier because
I just wrump you old main at twelve but
what's fair changes a lot too because
what's fair when you're younger it's not
saying the same thing is cuz me getting
what I earned that is fair that that is
fairness is Boppity no I think if you
wanna look at the surface fairness yeah
alright well we'll talk about that more
in the news floor living room an Idaho
credit union were forced to apologize
after this photo of him in blackface
surfaced the fact that Gerald laughs
right away
he's so as Facebook and Halloween by one
of the workers at the six poor women who
work at the p1 FCU credit union in
Lewiston who were apparently dressed as
the 1988 Olympic Jamaican bobsled team
made famous by that see that so that was
how they try to defend it people were
attacking and actually matters were made
worse when the creator of the costumes
clarified we actually weren't the
bobsled team just subprime borrowers
it's a very first one of the show aim
that flare gun right at your face Oh
Donna Brazile of course we have to talk
about the she's in the news this comes
from Mediaite she's been making the top
trends everywhere where she was she's
issued a scathing report on hillary
debbie wasserman the DNC at large
essentially she's just gone rogue she's
gonna party laughing birdie
it's like she's just feeling the Bern
it's like way so late like she doesn't
realize like it's done it's done
basically trying to burn the DNC figure
out of course is actually as we know her
second stab this week at relevancy after
quickly deleting her ill-fated and
widely met with skepticism hashtag me to
tweet a victim blame Friday the
Louisiana Supreme Court actually refused
to hear a suspects case today they
claimed there was no violation of his
rights occurring when he asked for I
quote a lawyer dog with the cops
claiming he asked for a lawyer dog
responds to suspect claiming that his
demand for a lawyer should have resulted
in the immediate suspension of
interrogation Scott Crichton penned a
brief opinion concurring with the courts
decision not to hear the case he wrote
the
defendants ambiguous and equivocal
reference to a lawyer dog does not
constitute the invocation of counsel
that warrants immediate termination of
the interview and this actually does
from salons of course have been cries of
racism judicial malpractice with one
opposing Disney producer actually
claiming there ain't nothing in the rule
books that said going retrievers can't
practice law black people do have a
harder I would like I don't buy in a
black you know black guys matter hands
up don't shoot but when it man I want a
lawyer dog that's why privileges are
talking about I get it I'll give you
that we put a comma in their lawyer
comma dog speaking I know just that's
what I mean I retama
it burns when I pee I need to cut out
Osama bin Laden was a huge gamer and
animate things insane so today the CIA
publicly released nearly half a million
files from his hard drive and it
revealed that he actually add a passion
for things like Resident Evil I think
was Mario and loads of Japanese anime so
people have now when you remember Saddam
Hussein they found him he loved The
Avengers and Raisin Bran from you yes
yet he was crazy for Raisin Bran crunch
they just they they hate America even
the stick yeah it is two totally
different cereal from raisin really yeah
I thought you were just making the
raisin breed you versus raisin bran
crunches candy cereal yeah totally God
okay but a son belongs parity was also
an artist himself as documents reveal he
was trying to get his comic series
published Tali bond got to kill them all
yeah that was no I don't want to take
off that one didn't take off and his his
venture into the young adult franchise
even less so hardcore tear as tentacle
pornography just didn't Japanese
appreciate straightforward marketing
there's no BS thing around the titles no
no no that's what market and they
appreciate it and they love them for it
plan and multiplayer with the sama bin
Laden
I got you he's gonna clan Taliban number
one it was just a stupid name Josh yeah
I guess well apparently also pirated a
lot of this game I think it was childish
thing for terrorists to have why would
he like that's ridiculous
no it's because the Japanese are also a
deeply disturbed dark people there you
go well kindred spirits Russian women
stripped naked in front of the US
Embassy in Russia to show their support
for Harvey Weinstein I know I first
thought am I reading that right so these
are the feminist protists where they
have to say they said we came here to
support the producer who offered women
sex the sex is right six is cool we're
here to say that when a man offers women
sex it is awesome it means you think we
are beautiful and sexy said another girl
this comes off on the heels of that girl
who is lifting up her skirt yeah a
feminist no skirt to protest groping in
a Russian train station their feathers
are different they're feminists are very
different from us and so to that we we
say we defect
[Music]
alright let's hunt for red october just
then yeah well you weren't it's a comedy
don't rest easy we still have a so
Donald Trump jr. tweeted something JK
Rowling retweeted it and then Stephen
Colbert decided to make it a part of his
monologue because that's what
entertainment is now on television so
yeah it is on here but listen soft
expectations this let's set it up this
is Stephen Colbert responding last night
Don junior tweeted a picture of his
young daughter holding her candy bucket
and said I'm going to take half of her
Canada tonight and give it to some kid
who sat at home it's never too early to
teach her about socialism yes it's never
too early to teach kids the danger of
sharing
yeah well litany of things that are
incorrect there the dangers of sharing
it's the old its it's the old adage but
you know there's nothing compassionate
about sharing somebody else's stuff so
if that didn't set it up for you where
you can hear that the rest of Stephen
Colbert's monologue will be mislead if
not misleading let's go into clip be on
Halloween kids literally go door-to-door
to get free candy from the neighbors
because the kids don't have it and the
neighbors do that socialism no it's not
no it's not that what why the kids
create or purchase costumes and for an
entire evening they walk door-to-door
tirelessly and they're rewarded for
their activity with candy that's called
work yeah the only way this actually
works is if that fat kid sits at home
does nothing no costume and makes
everybody come and bring candy to him
yeah it's the only way that's actually
socialism stuff looks like a little yeah
exactly in that fat kid by the way was
Bernie Sanders
now then Bernie change he started
counting points after his couch we're
done next clip no child in the history
of child antara Lee missed Halloween I'm
worried that kid didn't go out why is he
okay
is that child caring for a sick parent
you know it would be a nice thing to do
give him half your Halloween candy so
this is the quintessential leftist
argument right away they care and you
don't right they're compassionate when
you're not which statistically let's
just skip it couldn't be further from
the truth
okay Republicans give more to charity
they volunteer more of their time and
they give more blood not only that
Republicans are better tippers yeah
which we've written about of course
Bernie Sanders never kissed above 18
percent on the dot we wrote about that
was 15 I think it was 18% it might have
been 15 how the and to its credit yes 15
percent but it's very much like Ebenezer
Scrooge with the prisons and poor houses
I'm going to give the bare minimum and
not a penny more
exactly he says no child is willingly
ever stayed home on Halloween which this
is nothing it completely echoes again
the liberal idea of socialism and this
is an overarching theme that no one
could possibly be in poverty no one
would ever four go trick-or-treating
right if if it were within their control
it's closed off something they wanted to
do these are their victim of societal
circumstance where do they get this from
what let's go to Obama he said the same
thing all the time what we've long
understood though is that some
communities have consistently had been
odds stacked against them that's not
necessarily the thing that's always why
people are poor we also know some kids
who didn't do that right we know kids
who didn't want to wear a costume or
they forgot to make a costume or buy a
costume until it was too late and there
were always the kids were too clear
you're kind of a douche I need to treat
it in the college what's the matter with
that I trick-or-treat until I was 22
years old necessary joke 22 you just
have to get a full body costume and mask
and although you like to dress up you
just say you have a pituitary disorder
now if we get rid of the kid you know
who's going through Lukie going through
chemo who has leukemia
let's get her the extreme examples it's
far more likely that a kid isn't out
trick-or-treating because he chose not
to either because he chose not to
through inaction through not being
prepared or he just decided he wasn't
gonna go trick-or-treating he was gonna
rely on somebody else to do it the same
can be said for adults benefiting from
socialism good example Sweden were only
0.3 percent of refugees work had to get
that dig in their research study
concluded in the mid 90s the welfare
reforms actually could explain about 50
percent of the decline in desire to work
among non participants meeting people
who are not in the workforce so here's
that when you when you just give
somebody stuff I know it sounds like a
logical reach they just rely on you
giving them stuff next clip and it's
disturbing we need to be talking about
things like universal heath care which
would be a lifesaver for working people
socialist ideas outlined by the authors
of dots capital Karl Mars and Frederick
skittles or as you dum-dums like to call
them nerds oh my god now we don't call
them they called them communist copy
this hardcore
Karl Marx yes as a positive example you
don't want to do that and I was kind of
confused to threaten you know Frederick
any means fabric angles thank ya okay
who's the guy who helped the found
Marxist theory like who is this burger
guy and I realized oh this is like this
is like someone who's really in the know
of communist no spread drink well no no
it's no but it was bad because skittles
like killed Mars you kind of get but
skittles but was that great candy bar
barbar come on ripped off in the US I
can't find them very easily really yeah
true story that's replace Emma Snickers
always we have a slightly bigger Cadbury
egg in Canada so you get the short end
of the candy stick but it's crazy to me
he uses commas and the fact that then we
found out I think he means Frederick
angles like look if we ever made a joke
about Hitler that seemed to be praising
we'd be pretty clear you would realize
it
this is not satire and the fact that he
says you dum-dums in other words you can
be dum-dum tonight like the founders of
carnies because you dum-dums who don't
like chocolate Himmler like you'd be
like if someone said Hitler gummy and
then starts praising the generals and
Hitler he just say Hitler and Himmler I
think he sure Stephen Colbert is pro
communism was destroyed the world a
couple of times over and they never were
whose past it please they also never
worked no no never get beyond the
horrible ideology that resulted in the
hundreds of millions of people killed
yeah they were the douche who couch
surfed who never actually paid taxes or
work the job so just on a personal level
but Karl could you could you just leave
your stiff socks in your own drawer all
right
would you starch them we know what's
happening because when I go to work you
have time by yourself I know you're
writing your latest novella I mean total
losers this is crazy to me that people
have skimmed past Karl Marx yes yeah
this is what they left us they just want
to claim the moral high ground and give
people stuff but they fight they
consistently fight any policies that
would actually help the chronically the
perpetually important so they'll fight
for 15 yeah you sign up for fight for 15
which anything by the way
turns out yeah because they never I tell
you where they're gonna be and what
they're doing when they get these
pictures that's right down the block
from down the block yet twelve people
and they claim that was 35 I get emails
all the time you could tell they reach
out for like the really black names to
sign off on the letters it's really
obvious like it's not really they go out
of their way to make them something
really sad so the left they'll fight for
15 they'll fight for a bigger welfare
state more money for schools health care
to fight poverty Michelle Obama wants
you to get moving right to be healthy
move it but they oppose drug testing for
wealth there they opposed working for
wealth there and hell if you even live
an active healthy lifestyle guess what
you're still gonna have to pay the
skyrocketing premiums for someone who
lives in a diet of Snickers and funnel
cakes
hashtag no fashion really if you
actually look at you want to help people
get out of pocket and consistently fight
the tools that would do so if
we really want to help solve poverty
okay which is what the whole Colbert
thing is premises you don't care about
the poor it's only okay avoiding poverty
is pretty simple
ben shapiro has talked about this we've
talked about this for years finish high
school don't do drugs get married and
stay married not only will you not be
poor but the statistical likelihood of
your kids being poor as Nexus the
statistical likelihood of your kid
finishing school going to college
getting a job getting married where the
ends up in prison is or mommy and daddy
married and his daddy's still in the
house okay how dare you make sense that
requires a moral judgment people are
perpetually poor because rather than
tell the truth the left gives a handout
yeah yeah the truth is if that kid
didn't go out door-to-door again let's
disregard the extreme examples right the
kid who looks like Charlie Brown
progeria okay fine we'll give him
anything he wants okay he's gonna get a
make-a-wish you're gonna fix ice bars
get it but it's gonna be charity you're
not gonna steal it for me to give it to
him right that's a good volunteer yes
but most kids just didn't go
door-to-door for that candy okay fact is
he doesn't deserve it and your virtue
signal a little compassion doesn't
change it let's give you two scenarios
okay scenario one all right that kid who
didn't get the candy right seemingly
versus just give them the candy kids
bummed that I didn't get any candy and
he turns it around for next year
scenario one says no I really I really
know this was bummed this was a bummer I
should I should go door to door it I've
missed a lot of fun and candy next year
it gets a costume hits the road big year
two trash bags full of candy scenario
tis that kids bummed that he didn't get
his candy okay so he stays home instead
a parent steals it from some other kid
and gives it to him because compassion
and that parent promises him that he'll
do the same thing next year and the next
year and the year after that what do you
think happens to that kid worse what do
you think happens to the kid who
actually went door to door hit the
pavement only to have half of his stuff
taken and he knows that you're going to
take half that stuff next year and the
next year and the next
eventually that kid is going to give up
and that's this issue this this fake
fake victim culture though how about the
nice thing is just give the kid the
candy it's free this is when I was a kid
I remember we were do someone said you
there is no legal definition of hate
speech in the United States and freedom
of speech is a fundamental human right
so the only world in which hate speech
would be defined correct me if I'm wrong
you're drawing a hypothetical you've
ignored the reality of where we are now
let me finish my friends first off I
wouldn't use that language you could be
fined for hate speech welcome back to
another installment of changed my mind
for those unfamiliar this is a segment
where I go on the street we take one
given topic and I just listen to people
let them change my mind we rationalize
our positions and it's usually really
productive we attempt to have a civil
dialogue sometimes people end up
changing their own minds and we'll show
someone in just a few seconds here but I
do want to show you something first it's
important to note that there are some
people out there who have no interest in
a rational discussion they will be angry
and volatile no matter what like this
guy do you would you like to have a
discussion or would you like to
interrupt and be contentious I'm trying
to listen like to be arrogant and not
hear anyone people say you're making
you're capable you're hurting you're
you're causing dysfunction in the world
said or you can have an intellectual
discussion cuz like I don't understand
no I understand exactly as you said
there's no definition of a human right
you really don't people who understand
and empathize with other people when
they say hey man you're really making me
uncomfortable and you're making my life
worse
yeah legally that's abuse on here they
don't make references to the law man
that's what matters no it's not like
what yeah it is
dude I'm literally autistic so okay I
can understand other people's feelings
better than you apparently really how
would you know that imagine if I run up
and I'm a real big jerk to you kind of
like you are right now
now even with that having occurred this
lady who could not disagree with me more
ended up having an entirely different
experience why do you question
well symbolizing male white male
privilege no I hadn't even thought of it
that way that what you thought when you
look at it I wondered so because I'm a
white male well it's just to fit the
sign it doesn't really mesh well with
the the peach skin tone as it were do
you a problem with white male privilege
yes no how so white white males have
destroyed this country I disagree would
you like to change my mind or present
have a discussion but Jane that could've
been better
sure Steven by the way Oh Terry oh sorry
I mean it was it you hurt your wrist
there okay oh oh you know I have that
too oh you do yeah I wanted to learn
piano too it's just gotta be chopsticks
yeah you know I've looked at the surgery
and it but I have to do another knee
surgery now so it's like I want it I got
to decide what I want working at the
time yeah fix your knee so you can walk
walk and then you can yeah walk to the
other surgery to have your wrist on you
know what's helped is I've gone to an
iPad from my laptop and so as opposed to
constant Mouse work doing this seems to
have helped quite a bit
well they mentioned what you said okay
so I imagine how different the world
would be or the country if women ran it
yeah if woman had been the ones in
charge okay when men had been the ones
fighting for suffrage
all those years you know but men were
the ones fighting for suffrage sure for
women are you aware that it was over
over 60% of women didn't want the right
to vote it was actually closer it was
like 70 something percent you know why
those in those mostly majority would
have been wealthy women right
no no a big reason why action we were
just talking about this with Naomi Wolf
is a because the right to vote was
actually low as a privilege it wasn't
just a basic right and so for men it
included the draft mandatory bucket duty
meaning fire fighting services and when
it was proposed it was okay women the
right to vote comes with these
responsibilities they didn't want it so
majority of women didn't want those
responsibilities so they didn't want the
right to to vote
want to wear the pants that was back
then yeah I mean we still want men to
treat us like delicate China yes well
back then historically you know so women
did get the right to vote but they
weren't a part of the draft they didn't
have to perform on the firefighting
service
I'm not saying by the way that women
shouldn't have the right to vote I'm
just saying it's looking through today's
lens of history for nothing it's like
all right ladies you want this well this
goes with it I mean right we can also
tell you that you can be drafted just as
easily as weekend guys that's something
you'd support women in in the draft yeah
yeah okay sure absolutely
oh sorry well you know I yes
I just hate speech is not a thing it
doesn't exist and anyone can change my
mind do you disagree
what about like racism and stuff you can
all cut you can all come in and discuss
by the way it said that what is hate
speech
okay what's the legally but hate speech
right what's the legal what is hate
speech what's the legally defined term
what does it mean it doesn't exist it
does in my country of Canada or in
Europe where you can be jailed for
saying offensive things but in the
States the First Amendment protects
against that so the question I was
raising Canada yeah I live here now
thank God really well why don't you go
to Canada I just came here I wanted to
come and I came why don't you go to
Canada then why really free health care
right yeah you'd have to what would what
is uh what is free about health care in
Canada what are you paying taxes here in
the States
I like like all my paycheck is really
small so so you didn't pay okay
so right now you're fundamentally not
paying taxes so what if I were to say
you know that your tax is over your
taxes are over half your marginal income
tax right you're paying 14 percent sales
tax and you still have to pay for 70% of
the drugs and services you want in
Canada and the wait times are bad as a
matter of fact there are fewer they're
really bad yeah so if you want to move
therefore just free health care also by
the way they're not super friendly to
immigrants um put the health care
doesn't include you guys right off the
bat yeah they're actually much stricter
on immigration than the United States it
includes it includes people coming in
there haven't paid enough time into the
pool right no no they're not it's just
you know when you're talking about a
socialized health care safety net a lot
of you law understand sort of a the
asterisks that comes with it yeah
exactly you know so she's entering you
hear a lot of people say they want to
move to Canada so you would be okay with
like Canadian law where you can be
jailed for quote unquote hate speech or
fined yeah well it is passed a bill
where you can actually depending on how
you read it legally you can be fined or
you can be jailed for misusing gender
pronouns for someone who's transgender
mm-hmm you can be punished for that
legally I mean at that point right
legally it's either it's illegal or it's
not so then it becomes is it by accident
is on purpose
either way is it something that should
be a punishable offence
okay so we said that we've said that's
not hate speech so in other words
they're trying to break down the First
Amendment rights in Canada well they
don't have a First Amendment no other
country has a First Amendment outside
the United States yeah free speech
doesn't exist outside the United States
Lobby people don't know that so are we
willing to trade that if speech is
offensive I say no but I'm willing to
hear any arguments that change my mind
that's all you know even if we disagree
on let's say everything I think it's
important to listen to what an opposing
point of view us to say in other words
we can just you're trying to define hate
speech is just in the same category as
all speech yes First Amendment yes so
and it's you're right it doesn't make it
ethical of course it doesn't mean of
course you could say something very
offensive for example very racist that I
would disagree with horribly but it's
speech you have the right to say it
and I have the right to be offended if I
want I have the right to disagree with
it
I have the right to argue why you're
wrong but I don't believe that we have
the right to shut downs anyone's speech
based on a term like hate but I'm open
to hearing convincing arguments on hate
speech don't mention when you say
something like microphone was on get a
couple wild turkeys in you all of a
sudden you're talking about making
America great again you never know what
comes out yeah I've seen it but you're
not pro Trump that's an interesting
question I'm actually more of a
libertarian I am definitely a
conservative having moved to the States
leaving a socialist country I'm not a
huge fan of Trump individually mm-hmm
yeah well I mean I'm Pro free speech I'm
Pro Second Amendment
I'm Pro limited government I don't I
don't really know what Trump is any of
those policies but for example looking
at his recent tax proposal I would
support that I would support beat coming
from a family of legal immigrants I
would support ensuring our borders
making sure that we're secure well of
course allowing people to immigrate here
legally so certain policy I've
definitely lined up more with him than
say like
Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders but I
don't I don't really like him
right because it's there's a few facts
about trumpet that are bothersome to me
yeah the fact that I expect that because
many presidents before him especially
even Michelle Obama had a PhD Barak had
a PhD that's the highest position in the
country wouldn't you think we would
expect at least the person to be that
well educated you have a PhD he's got a
bachelor's and his dad probably paid for
it right we pretty much know that come
on command not to mention yeah go ahead
so I was gonna ask you a question
who would you say or just you don't have
to pick any one specifically but list
who would you say were the best
presidents like throughout history from
George Washington up until today who
would you pick who are your personal
favorite my personal favorite is Abe
Lincoln okay did he have a PhD I do not
know is it possible that Abraham Lincoln
read in a shack by candlelight a very
little formal education you tell me did
he yep yeah I'm saying
friggin that's the case is you're saying
that my only my only contention there is
that a PhD doesn't make anyone smart or
unintelligent I've met people with PhDs
who are moronic I've met people who
never graduated high school who are
brilliant yeah it's not to say you're
wrong if you're if you your
presuppositions that President Trump is
unintelligent it's not arguing that but
I don't think that a PhD is a fair
determining parameter and based it seems
on your own preferences we probably
agree on that
yeah unless you possibly unless you look
at the fact that educational
opportunities were not as easy for
people for press presidents as they
might benefit Trump especially since
Trump has enough money mm-hmm you know
to have gone that far and that has
stifled his maturity I believe I mean
he's sorry but he's a toddler I mean he
is he's immature
I think he's emotionally immature I
would I would agree on that I'm a
therapist okay
so clinically speaking
is mentally ill it's not stable doesn't
wander the White House yeah but we can't
necessarily forbid him from the White
House that people voted for them right
just based on that yeah but I don't
acknowledge knows my president you don't
know I go was that because he's not
representing what I feel are is valuable
okay values okay but he is the president
legally and like I feel like every
stupid opportunity that he has like the
like going to Puerto Rico throwing paper
towels it's like PR stunts yeah and his
his rhetoric he's doesn't I mean what do
they hear the other day he said he was
looking to speak to the president of the
Virgin Islands or something like that
yeah understand his his horizons aren't
open so it'd be safe to say that you're
probably more left you're liberal I am
okay but I guess on this it sounds like
we agree you support the further
Al Franken for resident okay sounds like
we agree though on on this on the idea
of the first amendment and no
limitations on freedom of speech we have
to because when we start putting those
limitations we're gonna be like when uh
we're gonna be needing Amnesty
International step in and save our ass
right I mean so you're pretty something
that yeah you're pretty right leaning on
that libertarian on that does it bother
you at all that your your party that who
you support the DNC people like Al
Franken there's a lot of proposed
legislation on speech that they support
hate speech laws does that concern you
and also of course culturally I'm sure
you're aware liberals obviously are far
less tolerant of speech they disagree
with but on the legal side would you be
for example opposed to any legislation
that would impede on someone's speech I
would okay would you vote for it left it
left its leading it even though you know
that's ironic because
hillary-bernie Warren Graham he's not
politics it's no sure I'm actually very
interested to hear your opinion on that
because you know you would know more
about the pathology behind that and
seems like you agree with seems like we
find common ground even though I'm an
evil right wing privileged white male
from Canada and you're more liberal well
it's interesting that that's something
they get behind because if they're you
know if the liberal left-wing view has
always been you know free free thinking
mm-hmm and you know free to be who you
are and you know gay rights and all this
stuff right immigration and you know Pro
immigration why wouldn't we still
welcome that freedom to express
ourselves right you know because I'm
sure and you never want to think that it
would start to spread in that regard to
right we could be stifled by our ability
to express ourselves in that particular
manner okay and we have it be tyrannical
yeah it be I mean defined or looked at
or sure you know so let me ask you this
oh I see a message in this it's haste so
take it off the wall right you're
arrested for I know yeah
well that way right exactly let me let
me ask you this kind of final question
cuz I want I know you have to go on your
merry way here today let me ask you this
if you will do now do maybe after this
conversation a little more research into
candidates you support regarding their
positions on freedom of speech yeah
because I didn't know Al Franken was
well let's say whoever it is whether
it's Bernie Hillary Clinton would you
look into it more and let's say it were
a candidate who supported some form of
hate speech laws or constrictions in the
First Amendment would you consider not
voting for them even though they were a
Democrat see that was nice not
everyone's this guy
imagine we change a First Amendment yeah
and then we pass a law saying that
that's behaviors heat speech right is it
now hates that would be a violation of
Human Rights and I wouldn't support it
thank god there's no law like that that
exists wonderful imagine that we did it
but here's the thing you're not your dad
you that we did it connect can I can i I
just answered your question I imagine
that we did it because there's no legal
definition of it right I'm saying
imagine if there was a legal definite
yes yeah
i William Denby hates me no no it would
be a violation of Human Rights and I
wouldn't support a violation okay so you
don't support hate speech laws I do okay
I'm hearing you say that whether or not
something hate speech hinges on whether
or not it's legally defined know it what
I'm saying is yes there is no legal
definition of hate speech in the United
States and freedom of speech is a
fundamental human right so the only
world in which hate speech would be
defined correct me if I'm wrong you're
drawing a hypothetical you've ignored
the reality of where we are now let me
finish my friend first off I wouldn't
use that language you could be fine for
hate speech did you enjoy this video

another news Californians will soon have
non-binary as a gender option on birth

a lot of people skim through this this

beautiful baby

Bill O'Reilly said this week there's
just no info that he was mad at God
quote over not providing more protection
for him from the recent sexual
harassment allegations which actually it
makes a lot of sense it explains his
latest book released killing God is a
tough one which of course is part two to
his wildly popular killing human
resources no self-control
turns out the no spin zone meant rape
covered man in a thong was pulled over
by police in Oklahoma this is actually
Jerry the police report was Jerry
noticed the man was trembling and
appeared nervous more unusually he also
noticed a nearly empty container of
Vaseline in the car and a pornography
magazine on the seat next to Kellerman
after be bats for identification
Kellerman handed over an oklahoma ID
card with his name on it the deputy then
asked if Kellerman had been masturbating
Kellerman said that yes he had indeed
been he had indeed been I I mean this is
one of those stories where you read the
headline and it's the opposite of
clickbait it's pretty much what you
expect hello sir license and
registration please
were you yes I was masturbating
furiously he didn't read you your rights
it's in the Constitution you don't have
to admit you to master Pretoria you
riveted you have a right to an attorney
well there's there's no need to say
anything speaking of sweet nothings
Corey Feldman launched a campaign to
expose Hollywood pedophilia this is way
he first off before we set this up
because there are critics and it's not
that we think anyone should be a
pedophile in Hollywood I do feel bad for
Kourt Feldman
but this is his video they released on
Twitter here let's let's watch those I
need to protect my family
and you make up our security and I need
a legal team help represent me
so that I can fulfill this mission
change the entertainment system as we
know it and by Tiger blood and I believe
I can also bring down the documentary
yeah a pedophile ring that I've been
aware of since we go out he's acting
right now right off the bat I can name
six names one of them who's still very
powerful today and a story that links
all the way up to studio a studio oh I'm
not going to say which one invest below
the only hang-up he wants 10 million
dollars totally cappers indiegogo 10
Cory 10 million dollars that's Illuma
less did you scrooge mcduck 10 million
dollars you only need $600 worth of
heroin to die
we're home with a Halloween theme
I just it's one of those like I
understand I do feel bad from the guy
right this is clearly someone he dresses
like Michael Jackson yes he does and he
has no identity of a porn star wife -
not a porn sorry I'm sorry she posed and
play with I think maybe and I saw the
wife swap he was trying to act like you
Haffner in it he had these the you know
these love angels he called them it was
clearly a Hugh Hefner ripoff he doesn't
know it it is kind of like indentured
servitude we'd say he didn't choose to
be an actor and he got rust into an
industry of the Weinsteins of the world
and you know I am sympathetic but the
thing is like it seems like he's
treating it more like a an award for
turn these people in yep and say you
know just doing the right thing right
like could you imagine thorn of
disciples knew Judas was the the
betrayer and he was like I'll tell you
if I need some sheep and some shekels
how much you in our little secrets
finally did you pay up first so you pay
up first and like oh and no he already
hung himself you already knew Jesus okay
dang it hey by the way just to clear
this up though hopefully we can clear it
up because here to discuss this issue
happen is we haven't no way the Corey
Feldman himself Corey are are you there
thanks for being here I'm very glad to
be here Stephen thank you sure no
obviously you've heard your critics why
not just release the names of these
predators so that they can't attack
again see that's how you misunderstand
the sensitivity of the issue Steve and
that's why I need you to go immediately
now to my IndieGoGo campaign calm yeah
okay Corey buy me ten million dollars it
you can see how one might think it seems
a little opportunistic you you can just
say whom left did you know no it's not
that simple Stephen this is all part of
a very careful plan you see well it may
be that simple because we have the man
here who admits to the crime himself
well host you actually don't need to pay
a dime for that information it was me I
did a dig molester soon thanks for
taking the time yeah Stephen listen
there's no need to pay him ten million
dollars all over the one dick molester
son who molested corey feldman
okay that is not true and that's why
even to go to my IndieGoGo campaign
absolutely true
even though the VHS tapes to prove it
okay mystery solved I molested corey
feldman hard yeah okay see that seems
pretty cut and drop no it's not which
people can support at my GoFundMe go for
me that times last weekend and Corey's
no no I know they want to hear who needs
the funding no no this is this is
absolutely other trillion dollars are
raised corey feldman and dick molesters
in everybody oh oh god no no and that
went about it alright moving on down the
Cho this is I think the biggest story
from the week also probably the one
that's gotten the least coverage from
see believe it well okay first let's
let's set this up because you've been
following yet well yeah the most central
proof for those who don't know and this
is where the question was have you if
you watch the in if you still have cable
have you heard about cable the Trump the
Russia dossier and its relation to the
DNC and how much comment below we really
really wanted you know I'm not a big
pollster but I'm curious according to
polls because voting for the news were
going why is this not front page so to
set the context the most central proof
of the Trump Russia collusion is
backfiring on the left it was the Trump
it was a dossier they called it right so
this is the one that alleged Trump had
directly colluded with the Russians to
defeat Clinton and it's also where the
more ubiquitous rumors from which they
stem like the Russian prostitutes and
the golden shower real estate deals that
were intended to be bribes yeah this is
the one that BuzzFeed obtained I think
somewhere in January 2017 yes now ever
since then the media has non-stop
embargo I mean listen I don't even tell
you this that Russia influenced the
United States election they're still
interfering in u.s. politics you know
this it's a question of whether Russian
intervention into US politics into high
level top-level US politics whether it's
stopped during the campaign or whether
it is still happening right now
I'm sure the run denier stylist
[Laughter]
they like fly people over and have them
vote in the elections the way they frame
it like they actually voted well in your
place it's funny that you say that
because it turns out then the Washington
Post broke the story this just broke
this week with the Clem campaign and a
DNC had actually funded the Trump toss
Clinton campaign and at the DNC what
exactly did they do well I mean they
have a lawyer and that lawyer went about
looking to hire research when the
interview from one of the firm's example
to get questions GPS perfusion gps
intern subcontracted out to Christopher
Steele the former British intelligence
officer to help get information about
Trump's relationships in Russia those
those reports that Chris field produced
were then passed back to the lawyer who
is representing the Clinton campaign
what we don't really know is how that
information relayed to the campaign our
understanding from talking to people who
are close to the matter is that those
actual steal reports were not directly
handed to the campaign so we don't
really quite understand how the
information was passed who got the
information and and and we you know
obviously we want to know you know what
they did with that information after
they received it I can take a wild guess
DNC officials have repeatedly no never
happened the only thing they like
talking about more than Trump and
Russia's daca Backa Backa and they
continue to deny any knowledge of it
take for instance debbie Wasserman
Schultz daemon and chief right here when
did you worry the DNC in the clinic
every word
and then how can you the DFC of be in
the dark about the dusky arrangement
otherwise you're not really in any of
there's no authority with the DNC oops
or you're really stupid but that would
be sexist we're gonna be presumptuous oh
stop it let's see the sender send your
sexist complaints to the wine man if you
don't know fusion GPS Chris for steel
were heavily connected with the Kremlin
yes Russians participated in creating a
dusty now to be fair the Russian lawyer
who Trump jr. met with was connected
directly with this organization fusion
GPS okay so let's let's let's give that
yeah we use a British special agent guy
to aspire to go do this we couldn't even
keep it made in America miss dossier
point yeah it's crazy America first
[Laughter]
American spy there we go
break the law hi ollie north I'm sure
he's available not so uh now there are
lawsuits by the way being brought
against steel and said secret agent man
himself
court documents revealed that fusion GPS
was feeding the Trump Russian narrative
to the Washington Post Yahoo News New
York Times New Yorker and CNN even
before the election in get this
face-to-face meetings with journalists
it wasn't just like an email that might
have been you know hacked with WikiLeaks
and Podesta talking about meeting behind
a pizza parlor it was actually face to
face this happened even the New York
Times admitted they noted this as of
yesterday
there has been no public corroboration
of the salacious allegations against mr.
Trump nor of the specific claims about
coordination between his associates and
the Russians none no corroboration of
the rumors with President Donald Trump
at the bottom of the article that should
have been the lead what you put this
whole paragraph in the bibliography
smaller fine friends so now we can't say
there's definitive proof to put anyone
behind bars in this case but no
corroboration at all as far as mr.
Trump's involvement we have tons of
evidence that directly refutes the
allegations
president Donald Trump and that is
important considering how the media has
taken the ball and run with it the New
York Times even went on to admit some of
the dossiers claims have been challenged
with supporting evidence that means
 for instance mr. Trump's
longtime personal lawyer Michael D Cohen
produced to rebut the dossiers claim
that had secret meetings in Prague with
a Russian official last year so what
does all this mean why does it matter
what are you laughing about the Little
Shop of Horrors over I mean once you
prove one of these things false in this
article doesn't that pretty much like
calling the question everything else
that they're claiming especially yes
that's what's interesting and if we're
gonna play by the left's own rules
they've been claiming all year that
Trump worked on a professional level
meaning exchange monies with the
Russians to directly interfere in the
electorate but but he didn't Oh only one
person did that or one group I should
say the DA's campaign lawyer directly
hired a research firm with ties to Putin
in Russia to create a falsified report
full of information obtained from the
Kremlin to influence a 2016 election and
to subsequently D legitimize President
Trump it's their God and hero Saul
Alinsky would be like you know I told
them I told you to accuse your plot of
doing exactly what you're doing but dear
Lord the story from somewhere more
erotic would be if Trump turned out to
be an illegal Mexican immigrants Alawis
you know it's really all kidding aside
they're actually in some pretty big
trouble with how they handle the
payments for this they actually paid the
lawyers don't use PayPal yeah exactly
they actually paid the law firm and
didn't with the FEC they actually didn't
claim it and so there's some big-time
legal ramifications to that because it's
like twelve point something million that
they paid for this yeah so they're
they're in hot water not just in kind of
a PR sense but they could legally have
some big problems yeah I know right this
is what's incredible to me and again
more important is the media's complete
they're nowhere
again this is an app this is an actual
if you're looking at some kind of a red
flag this is it this is the absences
right here is this way to happen with
President Trump you're talking about
actual just financial ramifications all
your other laundry nice black man when I
paid him a teen billion and you know
what's turning on Twitter right now
front paid 1.75 million or 250,000 more
than the past couple of presidents to
remodel his Oval Office for the White
House
that's what's turning and not this like
this give less of a crap that just shows
you what they're doing like this should
be front page everywhere and it's not do
you realize that Donald Trump blows his
nose with that amount of money
no it's our money that he's spent doing
it it was taxpayer buddy but he's still
doing yeah I know but every headline
these almost 2 million he spent 1.5 and
they they give you the Obama stat like
at the bottom right we have 3 guess we
have to get going but I do want you to
come and I want to see how many of you
knew about all of this go check out the
sources read up on these articles how
many of you knew before this we have
Lauren southern coming up and then of
course a a pre tape with Kevin Stover
than Phil Robertson

[Music]
all right the horrible intro but for a
very lovely lady she deserves better
than this she deserves better than
everything that Hollywood has
propagandists and Elmer's glue you can
yes you don't want to use those services
there is an open and unmediated internet
that you are allowed to publish whatever
you'd like on but you're gonna use the
social network that's created by
somebody else then you aren't beholden
to their rules sure we see the issue
here right you're the one who has a
problem with their rules really glad to
have our next guest I think he thinks
that I'm the boogeyman that's usually
people think when they come on this show
if they don't necessarily come from the
same political persuasion you can follow
him on Twitter at Josh Conn steam he's a
writer for TechCrunch misra constant
thank you for being here sir thank you I
mean I'm glad to have you now are you
are you here out of your own free will
or do we need to notify the authorities
there's someone putting the lotion on
its skin there that background oh yeah
I'm here on my own volition I'm hoping
to have a good civil discussion about
some really important topics okay so
you're not you are in fact this is your
own basement no this is the TechCrunch
office oh okay nice eh just boosting
morale in what happened Bob listen Josh
I wanted to talk with you because I saw
your article up here at TechCrunch and
it was titled silenced by free speech
and which you were putting forth I don't
want to misrepresent your putting forth
I get some solutions assertions
regarding the policing the treatment of
speech on social media platforms not
gonna lie I come at this from the other
point of view so I'd love to hear what
it is I guess in your own words you were
asserting with the article yeah so
modern social networks there's just a
fundamental in Korean currency with
being completely and unabashedly open to
all forms of replies and insults and
harassment and being a place for civil
discussion of important issues well well
you know free speech is critically
important that right was not designed
with the with in mind with people being
able to come to you shout in your face
and say these are their beliefs everyone
is welcome to speak their own beliefs
but I don't think other people are
necessarily obligated to listen or
that speech come into their house you
know whether you call that you somebody
coming into your front door and
screaming at you or coming to your
Twitter profile and screaming at you and
so I believe the social networks need to
do more to protect people from this kind
of harassment that's not protecting
people from having their own points of
view nobody should be censored for
having those perspectives if they're you
know tweeting them on their own profiles
but when it comes to replies where a lot
of this abuse happens I think that there
needs to be some changes made and
Twitter has announced a bunch of changes
to promote safety on its platform but
none of them right now address the
fundamental problem which is in replies
and so in silence by free speech I
discuss how well some social networks
have put up a defense that they're being
completely Pro free speech but in doing
so they're allowing harasser to actually
silence other people by bullying them
into being quiet and so Kay yes yeah but
you kind of unpacked a few things there
do you mind if I ask a couple of
questions sure so you started off with
the First Amendment so I'm interested so
why you started off there and mentioned
the founding fathers mentioned how it
wasn't they couldn't have conceived sort
of this inner connectivity as you put it
in your article first off before we get
off on that do you believe this is a
First Amendment issue or a Facebook
Twitter and YouTube have the right to do
what they want as a business issue
because you start off asserting First
Amendment wasn't designed with this
technology in mind yeah this is about
what Facebook and Twitter are doing on
their platforms as businesses they are
not a hold into to unequivocally allow
any type of speech even so that is where
what I'm discussing here but then why
start with First Amendment and then go
into businesses have the right to do it
with what they want to do that they're
completely separate they're unrelated
you invoke the first they're not
unrelated unfortunately because these
companies are saying that the First
Amendment and the free end free speech
are why they're allowing this abuse so
this is their their rationale for for
not policing their platforms or for
protecting victims is that it's all part
of free speech they're the ones pointing
to the First Amendment they're the ones
appointed in the first minute and that's
why the first paragraph and of your
article and the first thing you
mentioned is the First Amendment did not
account for this technology so that's
your argument in response to their
rationale I just want to make sure I'm
understanding this clearly yes okay
let's do that first where does that line
get drawn is it at the printing press is
it with a typewriter and it was a
computer is it with social media where
does the First Amendment still apply the
First Amendment plies to be those own
speech okay so that can be in similar
forms but so what were there was
technology though because that's that's
your assertion is that it didn't take
into account this interconnectivity the
technology that we currently have so I'm
just trying to clarify what your
position is because I'm not entirely
clear in the article and and you went
down a few different paths that I would
like to explore then how does technology
it could not be less relevant well it's
obviously very relevant because speech
is conducted through technology now it
is so I don't understand how you could
think those things are totally separate
they're separate on what you just said
that someone has the right to say
whatever they want but then you say that
the First Amendment didn't account for
current technology so I just asked you
where does it stop and you just said
it's in relation to your own speech so
to the First Amendment for example apply
when you're using the telephone speaking
freely with your family members does it
apply to your town crisis okay if you're
talking yeah if you're talking to
someone who consensually wants to speak
with you on the phone they're allowed to
say whatever you want but if you call
someone at all hours of the night over
and over again to scream at them you can
be charged for harassment sure can be
charged for stalking absolutely and is
it isn't it wonderful that with new
media social media like Facebook Twitter
you can block you can mute I think
that's the fundamental assertion that I
disagree with your presupposition that
people have to listen therefore the
people at the top from the top down at
Facebook Twitter YouTube need to do
something about it no one's forced to
use these applications and no one has to
listen you can't before caller ID and
you aren't a rotary phone someone called
you asked if your refrigerator was
running yet to say dammit and hang up
and hope it didn't happen again
now you know you can block it yeah but
what if somebody kept calling you from
different phone numbers every day a
different phone number you couldn't
block those right but that's already a
violation of the rules exactly but you
couldn't block those phone numbers
you're saying the blocking is fine but
if I called you from a different phone
number every day couldn't block buzzer
great I assume that you're obviously
drawing a connection here to stock
accounts to bought accounts of creating
multiple accounts for harassment
campaigns could I know you've written
about that and I would agree with you
but that's already a violation of the
rules you're suggesting new rules and
stricter enforcement so I guess my
question here is you say that free
speech isn't free if someone is
intimidated by somebody else's speech is
it am i misrepresenting what you've said
there or is that the general premise
yeah you're misrepresenting me here
someone has offended you people are you
know welcome to save views that offend
other people but when you start to
directly reply to people when you're
shoving that that perspective in
somebody else's face it becomes
different it's not about oh you're in
the street saying your point of view
that's so I can just walk away but if
every day you create a new Twitter
account and reply to me and put those
those messages into my timeline into my
own it's different
well it isn't allowed to do it on one
account but that hasn't stopped anyone
from creating new accounts to do that
harassment everyday so that's why I'm
saying that the current block options
are inaccurate okay well again that's
not really that's not really what you're
writing about in your article you're
talking about nothing somatic weapons
already heavily regulated right someone
can buy a semi-automatic weapon and
transform it that's illegal
it doesn't change the fact that it's
illegal it's already illegal to create
targeted harassment campaigns online
it's already illegal to stalk somebody
online people get banned for these
offences and the important thing is for
example threatening somebody you know
grievous bodily harm or calling people
to violent action or continually
targeting harassing the reason that
these policies are in place and aren't
allowed is because they mirror directly
our laws it's illegal to do that going a
step further beyond that which you
suggest in your article then that
becomes as you discuss it censoring
these were your words not mine
then you kind of become the
thought police yeah I'm not asking
anyone to be the thought police I'm just
saying that if you if you force people
to register their accounts to a phone
number then when if somebody is banned
like you said then that ban actually
sticks what you're saying is that the
ban works fine right now and it doesn't
you know that you know that anyone can
create a second account anonymously and
they can harass somebody again even if
they were banned yesterday and so yes
I'm saying that people should have to
register their accounts to a phone
number which makes it much more
difficult to create new accounts to
continue that harassment after they've
been banned for breaking the rules right
so okay so now we're moving for with
with solutions and I appreciate you
actually put forth a solution do you
think that a policy should be an account
directly tied to a phone number that's
at least one way to improve prove the
condition by increasing friction to
creating new harassment accounts okay
other ways to do that other signals
would be requiring that people have been
on the service for a long enough period
of time or that they don't have any
other signals that they haven't been
reported for other violations sure
do you support an tyfa being on twitter
or facebook that has nothing to do with
this topic right now it has everything
to do with it what about black lives
matter what about fight for fact I do I
do support black lives matter okay but
yeah but considering that maybe
something about this specific group but
I'm not aligned so disingenuous your
opinion to theirs because I know for a
fact that you've supported these groups
being on these social media platforms so
do I by the way but again unpopular
speech I have a problem with anonymity
by the way it breeds cowardice we can
both agree on that but unpopular speech
is speech that often needs to be
protected most so let's take int if a
black lives matter fight for 15 for
example they very often most often
aren't tied to an individual person and
phone number account should we shut down
all local chapters of anti phone Twitter
because it's anonymous there's no person
attached to it it's not about anonymity
it's about harassment you just said the
solution was a phone number so if
someone wants to remain anonymous if
somebody wants to send themselves I'm
using an example a very clear example of
which we would have some kind of
precedent here or
that don't set a phone number that don't
attach a private address or name to it
should they be removed well if they if
they create a new account and they've
been suspended for for breaking the
rules then yeah if they want to be able
to continue to reply to people but the
problem is rarely that these groups are
caught in the trouble is when people are
replying specifically to specific actors
and that's where the abuse comes from so
just because an account is anonymous or
is tweeting their own perspectives on
either side of the app on either side of
an issue that's not a problem the
problem is abuse directed at specific
people sure and that's why I that's what
the rules that I propose would help to
come back so we've just abandoned the
idea that you would need a phone number
to be attached to a Twitter account to
be created that that wouldn't apply to
groups no but if you want to create a
new a new Twitter account if you want to
be able to if you don't if you didn't
already register with a phone number
press if you want to be able to continue
to reply to people after being reported
then yeah you would need to register an
account is the standard reporting
because you've written extensively about
mass flagging and mass reporting
campaigns occurring from the alt-right
you've written about this people have
talked about this
so the standard that you just use not me
is being reported and you need a phone
number now you've said well no you
wouldn't need a phone number it's if
you're replying and if you've been
reported so let's say a group like an
tyfa has no phone number attached or
black lives matter or fight for 15 or
whatever it is the SEIU no phone number
attached this is an organization they've
replied they've been reported as
harassing remove them it would depend on
whether they were actually found to have
been harassing this has been reported
this is where we're going who determines
this what's your solution how do we fix
that who determines what is and is not
an infringement of someone else's speech
based on level of offense these services
need to put forward clear Terms of
Service that dictate what is of an
offense that is banned a ball or causes
a suspension thank you very hard to
realize that they already do are
controlling these services need to put
rules in place yes and the rules
currently are inadequate
they certainly are
not preventing abuse as we're seeing
about these produce problems all the
time so obviously they need to improve
their roles so you just said people so
you would you would advocate for human
input yeah you're gonna you're gonna
have to have humans to write these rules
there's no robot that's gonna write this
for you I don't understand the question
okay well let me clarify the question
assume I'm a dummy its algorithmic or
there's human input so Facebook YouTube
Twitter for example have argued that
it's not the byproduct of human input
they vehemently argued that it's
algorithmic now of course people on the
road isn't a so of course people on the
right let me let me finish what I'm what
I'm saying here I appreciate it let you
answer they said it's not human input as
someone personally who was I think your
site actually wrote about this
TechCrunch I certainly know was written
about engaged in Gizmodo when Facebook
was found to have had human input
determining pages that had to be
throttled and could not be viewed there
was Ted Cruz for president Chris Kyle
Foundation and yours truly and we had to
settle this legally so I've been through
this I've experienced it I've
experienced the wrath of human input
once said human doesn't like what you
have to say do you see how dangerous it
would be to simply give over the rights
in this capacity just to someone who can
change by the way it should change on
any given month
what if someone doesn't like what you
have to say next month instead of me
you're confusing completely different
issues you're talking about trending
topics on Facebook which had human
curators that looked at what was
surfaced by the algorithms know and then
you know somehow comparing that to the
rules about harassment there's totally
two different things no they're not
they're not because you talked about you
talked about people replying so we've
gone away from phone numbers we've gone
away from you said you said that humans
would have to determine if it was a
violation or not
did you know humans we posture right did
you okay yeah not you did you not say
that a human would have to determine if
it was a violation of the guidelines or
not Josh yes or no I said that humans
have to write them yes you want human
input so can you see problems with
because you keep trying to move away
from it you made that point I'm not
making it up people can go back to the
tail of the tape so
you were advocating for human input
could you not see how that might be
problematic based on the fact that
humans have inherent biases
yeah humans do have inherent biases but
if you want to write rules for social
networks no robot is gonna write those
rules for you I never said they sure
don't understand how do you how do you
propose on the other side we would
create rules for dictating how
harassment was treated but the rules
were written by algorithms that's like a
science fair never seen the rules damn
no I never no I never said the rules
should be written by algorithms and I
know the tech is kind of your one card
to play so you want to go back to that I
want to go back to what it is that you
said a human should determine what is a
violation of these guidelines you said a
human would have to go in because I said
what if people have rules that are
applied evenly and consistently across
the city who are advocating more human
input correct I'm advocating for human
input to write rules that are then
enforced both by algorithms and by human
moderators yes exactly so you're
advocating for more human input there we
go we've answered that question both on
rules which wasn't my point but
determining what is and what is not
abuse so alt right doesn't like what you
have to say they report you human
happens to be sympathetic to outright
your removed my position here is they
already have rules in place that mirror
the law there's one person for that
there's one person here who's advocating
for more than regulations that would
mirror the law that's yourself and I
haven't really heard a justification for
it again you're willing to give these
freedoms up online to a human to
determine what is and what is not
offensive and it's based on the premise
that you've written about that freedom
of speech is not free if your free
speech or my free speech silences or
intimidate someone else from speaking
freely this is the premise of your
article and I've heard it taught at
colleges across the country what
determines or who determines since
you've decided it should be a who
determines what is and is not okay to
say we're not talking about harassment
it's already not allowed we're not
talking about daxing it's already not
hey YouTube what you're about to watch
is a new segment we call change my mind
pretty simple we go out and set up in
public and pick a topic in this video
it's second Amendment where I just say
hey listen I'm pro-gun change my mind
and we actually allow people from other
points of view to come up and
proactively change my mind I'd love to
hear from you what what topics you would
like to hear discuss on this also it's
important this isn't about just a debate
or a highlight reel the point to this
exercise is to actually get people to
question their own point of view and see
if their argument is rational and maybe
at the end of it they'll end up changing
their own mind so pro-gun Second
Amendment change my mind
enjoy very pro-gun pro-second amendment
changed my mind I'm open
do you believe guns have uses other than
hunting yes what do you believe those
are I believe that the Second Amendment
the Second Amendment I should clarify is
about the basic right to
self-preservation be that from internal
threats be they're from domestic threats
would be definitely threat of a
tyrannical government that's the purpose
and intent of a second matter that is my
contention I agree with the Second
Amendment has that intention however I
do think that guns aren't necessarily
the most effective way of defense
I believe that guns are so easy to show
would you mind putting the mic just to
you just do it yeah sorry so I believe
that if you have a gun if for example in
the case of a home invasion sure if you
are a good a gun owner have it in a safe
in a safe place and you know not like
under your pillow or anything and you
take care of it then by the time you get
to your gun
it probably is already too late to
defend yourself sure well I guess that's
defined true
maybe we're not disagreeing it seems
like maybe your pro Second Amendment you
believe that people have the right to
purchase in their arms as to whether an
individual is effective in defending
their house with their own firearm I can
tell you that mine is very easily
accessible and many of them are and that
wouldn't be the scenario so it doesn't
change the right for me to have that
firearm to protect my home I also
believe that there is definitely a
reason to have them for sport not not
just hunting but also aiming practice
gun ranges I have a friend who was on
their way to actually becoming a
professional marksman but then they got
glaucoma yeah but that's not what the
Second Amendment is about so I guess
we're still we've really yeah come out
looking to change my mind on that you
agree people have the right to purchase
and bear arms yes I have a disagreement
with the mostly the concealed carry laws
and such in that I believe that you know
having a gun for you know the purposes
I've set out is perfectly fine but
that's no reason to carry one around in
public particularly because it could be
used against you someone could grab it
off your person and threaten you with it
someone could take your car and run you
over with it yes but I mean that we
can't sell you a car cars actually kill
way more people than guns but cars are
necessary to get to point eight
from from point A to point me third you
can take public transportation you can
take a bike you can walk not everywhere
not everyone has public fears always
what many literally areas you need you
need a car in order to get several miles
to the grocery store to get your food
food let me ask you is it your
contention that because something you
can legally own could be used against
you or someone else the government has
the right to tell you that you couldn't
own said item is that your
presupposition
I believe that it's not like you can't
own it you can own it it's that you
can't for no good reason bring it out in
public what would be no good reason what
would be a good reason for someone to
have to be able to exercise their right
to protect themselves a good reason is I
am bringing this gun to the gun range to
go not to protect myself let's get rid
of the sports in the hunting aspect of
it right the second one is just to
protect yourself so why is it again I'm
hearing why does the government have the
right if I'm a law-abiding citizen to
tell me that I cannot protect myself
with my firearm because the whole point
of having a government is to trust the
government to protect you no - no that's
not true
because as a woman I feel very
threatened walking around at night on my
own you should probably get a gun I have
an app on my phone where I can set it up
where one touch brings the police to my
location and it actually alerts the
police that I might have a call when I
click a certain button like if I'm
feeling somewhat threatened I click one
let me ask a question you're open that
last question the police come what what
would the police be able to do that you
wouldn't
they are able to physically if not
intimidate than let's say a very violent
attacker okay you call the police you
are calling the police because because I
fear for my life and they would protect
you yes with with firearms because they
are trained and they have they have a
legal responsibility to use those
firearms properly in a way that casual
firearms owners do not final question do
you believe we have a police brutality
problem yes I do I believe that police
need to be trained better than they are
now but do you believe in a society
where police exclusively are granted the
rights to carry firearms no police not
only police I say I say police should
have firearms to deal with violent
individuals let threaten with the police
officers life okay whereas the everyday
person should be able to rely on the
police to do that now the problem we
have is that we aren't able to rely on
that I don't think the problem I don't
think the solution to that is get guns I
think the solution to that is reform the
police department I disagree with you do
you think that maybe after this
conversation hearing some of the things
that you said talking about how you
believe it's the government it's the job
to trust the government and then I've
talked about inherent corruption in the
government police force I would
encourage you and hope that maybe you
would reconsider some of these stances
moving forward about having a society
where only the police have the right to
carry firearms I think maybe would find
some common ground think about it and
then maybe if I'm still here come back
we can talk about if I know we got some
of the people here in line okay
Danny Danny thank you so much day I
appreciate you taking the time and one
last little clip I'm also particularly
vulnerable to police as a
disabled trans person so I do really
understand the police brutality issue
right but I think that guns aren't the
answer so thank you all right Sam Steven
nice to meet you Sam would you mind
holding the microphone up when you talk
to Suakin huh yeah you know how those
works talking to the talking linetti
thing yeah Sam so you said you're a
program but you believe in some control
yeah okay you're in college you're
obviously a smart guy I think it's
important than to define what it is
we're discussing right yeah when you say
some controls what kind of control
controls that actually you know a lot of
Americans when they're trying to get a
license for guns or they're trying to
purchase guns or whatever they should be
able they should be able to document it
and not with paper but with machine
documentation so and on top of that they
should go through a psych evaluation if
they're too violent or they have a
faster being too violent then they
should be restricted or completely opted
out of even owning a gun depending on
how violent they are we go so you're
saying that if somebody has a documented
history of violence mm-hmm they should
not be able to purchase a firearm yes or
they should be restricted to only
probably a handgun okay well that's
interesting I'd like to go back to that
mic a little closer to so I could okay
everyone's getting lucky so if I were to
tell you it's already the law I assume
you've never first to know it's already
the law you can't buy a firearm if
you're violent and they said but maybe
only restrict it to a handgun that's I
find that curious why would someone be
restricted to a handgun above other guns
because here's the thing again every
American has a right to own a firearm
and that's the Second Amendment we
cannot change that we cannot take that
away from them and that's something we
should always protect I appreciate that
but
demoting them down to was say a handgun
that doesn't take away the fact that hey
maybe someone might come into their
house and you know might steal something
or my effect their family or whatever
and just because they're a criminal
doesn't always mean they're just like
always going to be violent all and all
that stuff if they have a handgun to at
least protect themselves and not cause
mass damage - like what happened in Las
Vegas right then that way they're
protecting themselves and they won't be
out there to harm others and if they do
we also have the police at hand to at
least you know limit casualties and
always forgive me if it seems like I'm
interrupting guys cuz you go - that's
work I want to kind of address each
point so we can find out whether we
again so my understanding is that you're
saying we should limit these people to
handguns yes as opposed to long rifles
semi-automatic rifles and this with
which they could commit mass damage so
in order to mitigate the damage yes
what if I were to tell you that
unequivocally it's not even close the
vast majority of mass shootings take
place with handguns
well again people put modifications on
the guns and I understand that a lot of
mass shootings also happen with handguns
know most the home almost nearly all
says yeah but I also think that actually
let me refer let me step back a bit and
where I'm pulling this idea of handguns
is there was a article I read about
someone cleaning I hang on that only
registered to yours like biometrics have
you heard of it yes I have yes sure but
yes continue it is a disaster but the
reason I'm touching on that is because
it's a really good idea and the NRA
which I kind of have a problem with
right now is not laying us research guns
in a sense or making them completely
safe as from what I understand I'm not
to educate on what the NRA is doing
right now is just how they conduct more
research on guns than anyone in the
country
yeah and they always find a way to like
make sure there's no gun controls going
on and all that stuff but um let me say
people are able to able if own
modifications are on their guns which of
course should be completely unalaq bumps
dogs there's also there's also this a
bump stock is basically if you fire a
gun that thing just bounces back there's
also a needle in which you can put in
your guns where if you pull the trigger
it constantly forces your finger back so
it's kind of like an automatic rifle
right and that's of course should be
illegal as well and going back to why
I'm saying demote people to handguns yes
they're almost all machines are camila
handguns again I'm saying people should
go through background checks and all
that stuff that already have that
already exists but it's not too refined
I mean here's one thing I would say
respectfully and I would just I do
disagree with you on several instance
but I appreciate taking the time I think
that there's a discussion taking place
in this country yeah and it's between
two camps you're not gonna like what I'm
about to say but it's not meant as a
personal insult no no it's between gun
owners mm-hmm and completely
ill-informed if you've purchased a
firearm you would know that everything
you've just said is untrue yeah and I
don't set to insult you know you in fact
I would recommend you go purchase a
firearm for yourself even if you're
getting off just getting a gun revolver
okay I mean a 22 revolver okay you'll go
through a background check you'll see
asking the questions you're going to ask
for your license you're going to make
sure it's the same address that you
currently live
it'll probably be the most stringent
background check you've ever gone
through it was more stringent than
Social Security okay so all those things
already exist a bump stock is not we
described it to be as a matter of fact I
can make a bump stop with my belt really
really about you it's a technique a bump
stock allows you to optimize a certain
technique okay and it's already illegal
to modify a gun to a fully automatic
rifle okay this is already illegal right
so someone taking a firearm and
modifying it to make it in a illegal
firearm okay is already against the law
it's already against the law to purchase
a firearm it's
you are a convicted felon if you're a
violent criminal you mentioned the NRA
there's so much research conducted on
firearms as a matter of fact if I were
to ask you how many defensive uses do
you think there are firearms each year
if you were to guess you knows about
theirs I would say a good couple hundred
thousand maybe into millions yeah into
Millions
how many gun deaths do you think you are
I would say around ten to twenty
thousand per year a little higher than
that but lower than that if you remove
suicides okay so again there's these are
important and a lot of these come from
from pro firearm associations I think
what is important to have this
discussion and I hope it's been
illuminating maybe thanks mayor plants
me I would really encourage you to buy a
fire yeah even if you go right back and
just trade it in you can buy it and then
give it right back to the gun shop and
they'll consign it where they run a
background so if you don't want to spend
the money yeah that's a very experience
where you learn the things that you
thought were not sure and I think it
starts from the the preset position and
I think we certain the common ground the
Second Amendment is not about hunting
humans about the basic right to
self-preservation and we either support
the idea that we have the right to
protect ourselves both our houses our
families our property from local threats
or tyrannical threat from the government
we either agree on that and I think we
do or we don't now and if you've read it
to write like three speeches are right
yeah the government cannot remove a
basic human right unless you've
forgotten it by violating someone else's
rises yeah and I mean that's I love I
love the second I mean I love the
Constitution and I love America how it
is and I just love the idea that if some
other country tries to invade us we have
the firearm not only do we have the
police and a great military but we also
have the American people who are
definitely going to be pissed off shoot
the other guy one thing I want to ask
and you were telling me to go ahead and
purchase a firearm now I don't mean to
sound offensive to anyone or any of you
or the thing is I'm a person of color
and I'm not even a black person I'm just
a brown person yeah and the derogatory
the Serio type I'm always
is I'm basically a terrorist just by my
skin color right no one knows my
background and all that stuff and I've
come from a very conservative location
back in Florida now if I purchase a
firearm and if I am team around with the
gun I know for a fact people are always
going to view me as a threat
well there's that one saying carrier you
don't need to carry it around out in the
open yeah you legally can now in Texas
but concealed okay okay that spread on
down the trip isn't it wonderful that
there are horrible racist ass because
the color of your skin and think that
you're a terrorist
yeah isn't it wonderful that that
doesn't affect your rights yeah that's
completely amazing
yeah it doesn't affect it because guess
what that background check if you
haven't committed a crime you have the
same rights as that racist down
the street yeah definitely and that's
the only thing is you know we either
have to agree on the freedom of the
right for all of us to protect ourselves
and we don't and I can't imagine what
it's like as I'm sure you've dealt with
with you know racist encounters your
whole life and it's always sad to hear
but um again that doesn't think take
policy and I would look at that and say
hey isn't it great that despite what one
individual things it doesn't affect your
rights as an American citizen like and
that's the beauty of blind justice and
if you give that authority to the
government or if you give that authority
to an individual or a committee yeah
guess what it just takes one of those
racist people to make a decision for you
or vice versa so it's it's pretty
important right especially for
minorities to make to ensure that that
they're not in their rights aren't
infringed upon by the mob of the
majority right I don't think that anyone
should be able to vote the brown people
can't have guns any more than I think no
one's be able to vote that anyone here
can't have guns yeah but it's also let's
say I'm gonna defend myself at home with
the gun I perjured all that stuff and I
happen to shoot the intruder I don't
know if he's a threat or not now here
comes the main problem as to why I
personally won't buy a gun though I love
guns I won't buy a gun if that gets out
into the media I'm a brown person with a
gun that killed
and in tutor yeah now in that scenario
already I'm always gonna I'm already
gonna be classified as someone who's
again very violent in all this stuff but
are you studying me I'm a computer
engineer good engineer yeah I would
encourage you we do I know there are
other people are so we had to go see me
but encourage you to read up more in a
Socratic method yes I think that if you
question some of the things and I think
we've done it here where you
reestablished I mean your your views a
little bit I think if you question some
of the premises of your your positions
here you'll realize they're not
necessarily true yeah and not
necessarily some that you can certainly
confirm is true yeah and I do think
especially in today's era more important
than political correctness more
important than sensitivity more
important than opinion it is more
important than even common ground is
truth yes I think if you examine some of
your premises I say this respectfully I
think you'll find that they are
incorrect
yeah and that's what I really hope from
coming into here because I'm saying I
want I want gun control right right and
just sitting down and hearing about this
of course I listen to TYT and I listen
to very progressive news outlets I'm not
I'm not an innocent in any ways with
this biased media who do you listen to
on the right on the right
I want to write like uit on the far far
finding the root cause of equal rights
for women across the globe who have
their genitals mutilated and can't drive
cars and can't enjoy the same rights
that people enjoy 100% in the United
States and the Western world
respectfully I don't I don't really and
I think it's beneath you to say that
something's beneath me let's argue the
ideas not use this sort of undercutting
tactic I read her book in college I I
don't agree with her everything but I I
very much appreciate her approach the
book that I think I read was the beauty
myth back in college she is CEO of daily
clout CEO where people can share bills
and basically work together online get
only a daily clout dot IO I don't know
they thought I oh I but Naomi whoa thank
you for being here thank you so much for
having me I'm excited to be here I don't
know why you'd be excited to be here but
I'm glad to hear that's not usually a
common response
I mean actually I'll tell you why
because one reason is that you know like
a lot of Americans I'm in a bubble not
of my making because I sort of grew up a
little bit left of centrist and most of
people I know are you know urban yuppies
who are a little bit left of center and
that becomes an echo chamber and it's
not healthy and a you know it's got a
website that's committed to building
democracy and strengthens and mock recei
and it's so so important for us to kind
of talk to people who don't agree about
everything well I can appreciate that
that's where I know you were asking our
book like what's this change my mind I'm
pro-gun thing we did a segment where we
just went on the street and I just put
up a sign and it says I'm pro-gun change
my mind people to sit down or I'm
pro-life changed my mind I'm cool
whatever and it was surprisingly after
at the end of the I'm pro-gun we had
several students at the end of it every
single person was glad they'd had the
conversation and not a single one found
they had a rational argument for what
they thought were proposals for gun
control that doesn't mean that one
doesn't exist but they sat down and said
well I think we should have background
checks and they found out there were a
background checks and they said well I
just I think machine guns should be
illegal and I said effectively they are
illegal and they said well I guess I
don't know what I'm asking for and it
was really valuable a valuable learning
tool for us so let me ask you I know you
wrote the beauty myth
many people call you the the godmother
of sort of third wave feminism some of
you so like with a horse in their bed
equal rights but now there are so many
factions with feminism it's it's some
people say third wave the they claim its
intersectional feminism there are people
who have differing views on transgender
issues how they relate to feminism we
had Leah Keith on here for that so let
me ask you I guess sort of this how do
you define yourself how would you
describe your brand of feminism for
those who might not be familiar in the
audience
sure well let me first I want to say
that I think it's really healthy that
there are so many different viewpoints
within sure feminism because it means
it's a living breathing movement that
people care about and also as I said
before it's really healthy when people
don't all march in lockstep you know
that's how our country should work is
people having different opinions and
educating themselves as you just
described I see feminism as nothing more
or less complicated than the logical
extension of democracy and and my my
brand of feminism if you like is you
know very much descends from the end of
the 18th century when people like law
can pain and Mary Wollstonecraft were
coming up with the ideas that became the
American Revolution and the
Enlightenment ideas like everyone's
entitled to Liberty everyone's entitled
to the pursuit of happiness to the full
development of their human potential and
and that one person should not dominate
another control another so these are the
ideals of the American Revolution and
you just extend those to gender
that's the demonym that I believe in
right you know anything that you you you
mentioned that because I know you're
sort of you describe yourself small-l
more libertarian these days which I
don't think was always the case I don't
want to miss characterize you there but
I've seen you be actually pretty
consistent in criticizing the left as
well do you find um that do you find
that tough kind of a juxtaposition of
obviously the roots of sort of feminism
as it's in the 60s and 70s and certainly
in
sectional feminism now far-far radically
left and becoming more libertarian in
your views is that that sometimes tough
to balance so I don't really understand
the question you just asked because
there were a lot of dependent clauses
and for instance I'm not sure what
intersectional feminism means I was
hoping you could answer either someone
comes in dressed like a lady says it's
hate speech to ask a question
intersection I mean you know I I guess
my instinct is to say it's too often the
case that we live in a world of labels
and you know as I said before often the
labels that are affixed to groups of
people you know we too rarely have the
chance to kind of sit down with those
people so sure if intersectional
feminism means like my daughter's
generation my son's generation which is
growing up more aware of how race and
class effect you know human limitations
on potential and opportunity and not
just gender I'm all for that like I
think the more we try to be nuanced
about where is everybody coming from the
better but that doesn't mean I like
reducing people to labels I think people
are more than where they come from more
than their gender more than their you
can ethnicity or sexual orientation
that's you know that's I think we have
as human beings a lot more that unites
us than divides us but the libertarian
thing is really interesting I really
grew up you know as I said like a baby
of the left you know I grew up in the
Haight Ashbury I grew up in the middle
of all of these very hopeful revolutions
like you know gay rights and and rights
for workers in in agricultural fields
and you know they turned into a lot of
really wonderful things but the older I
get and the more I'm exposed to
different countries and different people
from different backgrounds the more I do
think I feel like I don't want to say
small l libertarian because that's just
another label but I I'm very sympathetic
with the libertarian philosophy
underlying policies it doesn't sure
libertarians always come up with the
best policies and it's no policy that's
usually what they come up with which is
often nonsensical like I'm going I
really respect this group students for
liberté and i'm actually going with my
partner who's gonna be a speaker at an
event in sarajevo at the end of next
week and they're a libertarian student
organization they're like there are
hundreds of thousands of them all over
the world and we get into really great
arguments you know and I'm all for a lot
of things but when they get to like why
should the state do anything about old
people or sick people are orphans then
they lose me I think I feel strongly
that well I have a libertarian profound
number-one respect and it's all I've
been working on really for the last
since 2008 for the Constitution right
that's where my kind of libertarian soul
goes to and we can then argue about
policy and what really surprised me when
I wrote a book in America which was
about the decline of freedoms in America
right and it started with a critique of
Bush but it could people kept saying in
the Obama years what about Obama and I
kept saying thank you for noticing the
consistency I kept saying he's a tyrant
he's dictatorial he's sending drillings
and to take out Americans right without
due process he's keeping Guantanamo open
he's creating a war against
whistleblowers you know there were like
six people on the Left who kept
critiquing kept defending the
Constitution when our guy was in the
Oval Office code was nowhere to be found
I I want it I want it I wanted to frame
this back because we could go a million
directions you know obviously we'll
disagree on that I was a I was in
Guantanamo Bay and saw the prisons and
the troops supporting them containing
them but I do want to go back to
feminism cuz you mentioned libertarian
and kind of your children's generation
so I guess let me ask you this in 2017
since there are so many different sort
of definitions of feminism in 2017 do we
believe I guess or or how would you
argue that feminism the fight for equal
rights we're talking about systemic
equal rights it's relevant is it needed
in 2017 and is that maybe a lot of
people see that it isn't that's why
there are fewer self-identified
feminists even we've seen I guess this
is there more self-identified feminists
than ever in my adult life Stephen and I
guess this is one of those moments where
the women watching this maybe a lot of
the men are thinking why is this
question being asked again in 2017 so
let me ask you you're a smart thoughtful
person do you think there's a reason to
have a movement for gender equality
still do you see any
any problems that women still have that
men don't have in the headlines right
now do you see rapists being convicted
okay questions I just want to show you
both because could I ask a question I
think it was a little more pointed than
your question you mentioned earlier some
clauses
let me zone in more what systemic writes
in 2017 are not afforded to or
specifically excluded from women as far
as engaging in practicing is that is the
question that is really common with my
audience both which rights systemically
are not afforded to women that's a very
fair question because the truth is that
in North America and Western Europe on
paper women have pretty much all the
rights that men do you're absolutely
correct about that in enforcement they
don't and in practice they don't we can
get to that but you're you're totally
right that the second wave you know my
mom's generation fought hard to make
sure that in law you know we have
technically the same right sure but then
you go outside of Western Europe and
North America it's a big world out there
and all over Africa little girls are you
know having horrible mutilations done to
them sure within unity you know the
Middle East and we just saw in Saudi
Arabia woman given the right to drive
but little Clause you actually have to
get a permission slip to get permission
to drive from your legal guardian who is
oh your dad or your husband and that's
that's common practice there sure in
India there are bride burnings and this
is not a religious thing in countries
all over the world trafficking of women
in Central Europe in Eastern Europe you
know on a massive scale
you know women being essentially in
domestic servitude in the developing
world you know shipped to countries like
Dubai and I mean horrible things are
happening where women don't have basic
legal rights I mean the rest of the
world so that's a and B I would say even
in this country you know it's a it's a
tough time because you're right that on
paper we've we've won the war but in
reality we face hurdles and harassment
and violence all day long I mean just
looking at the me to movement that's
erupted
you know half a million people most of
them women
many of men have posted hashtags after
in the wake of the you know Weinstein
case the issue of sexual assault and
rape came into foreign some prominent
women spoke out and now there's this
flood of women saying I was raped I was
insulted no one did anything I was
assaulted when I was 19 I came out with
it you know to save other women 25 years
later on the cover of me up magazine I
was a vicious attacked you know there
there was an EEOC investigation other
stories came out it was not just me it
was 20 years of Yale covering up much of
things we face sure can so just want to
hit the pause button there because you
went into a few different directions all
of which I'd like to explore at one time
or another in this interview so I'd like
to kind of well give give you first
choice here would you rather discuss the
the international women's rights issue
or kind of unpack the domestic sort of
Western whatever you like okay audience
yes well I would say you know obviously
it's terrible at your harass you were
harassed I think Harvey Weiss Weinstein
isn't awful well you were sexually so
good and then harassed afterward when
you came to actually all of that but but
what's really important to know is that
I didn't even know it was a crime until
like 25 years later sure all of my
exposure in education I didn't know it
was a crime until my partner's a private
investigator informs me there was a
crime and I didn't know that you know
what the statute of limitations was and
I filed a police report you know in
October and they lost the police report
I do refile it in April those run into
myself and it's that's why you know if
we go to the other side where you much
it's not a religious thing you know I
have an actual flaw on me so I've had
some run-ins with the religion of peace
yeah for having the nerve to read it's
pretty pretty well intuitive on the Isis
Isis list and cares watchlist so I make
all the top ten lists but you know how I
mean how do you know you're on the ISIS
list like that well I'm sure you know
you've dealt with if you've dealt with a
sexual assault case you deal with the
FBI or you deal with you know
international yeah and you can see me on
the careless right there wonderful
organization so ok so let's go there
organically because I know you talk a
lot about the patriarchy and you talk
about sort of the sociological
conditions I I would say that if we're
going to get two solutions which
do believe that you do I think and this
is why I think a lot of people reject
feminism in my generation is that
there's a lot of a lot of screaming a
lot of angry people and not a lot of
solutions and they just blame men for
problems a lot of times this third wave
intersectional feminist and that turns
men off and then also they become more
anti women it's a vicious cycle so
that's in the western side and the rest
of the world I mean if we're going to
get to solutions
I do think we need to be honest about
where the problem stem and yeah it
happened across the globe but there
really is no example that we can point
to certainly no consistent example of
Islamic society where women are treated
the way certainly that you and I would
fight for as far as equal rights so I
kind of like to take this down it a
quick questioning here so that then we
can let let you have the floor and
examine it we talk about patriarchy
really quickly can you define for the
audience what would be patriarchy I
guess as a societal example and then
more of an individual example do you
think what is P I love your questions
they're like you know we should be like
the middle of the night in the dorm room
like a very male-dominated society
pretty much centered around the you know
the father had figured the patriarchy I
think we can agree it is patriarchy yeah
is that your question well I think let's
move on to an individual example because
I think we can go on that for a long
time but like in an individual example
of patriarchy would we say that a family
where a man is a sole breadwinner the
woman works at home she's a mother
through no choice of her own he's not
very loving he's not very caring he's
emotionally abusive goes out with the
guys doesn't treat her well would we say
that's an example of a patriarchal a
toxic patriarchal house a household I
wouldn't know
okay why not well if she I mean if she'd
the question is does she have choices
right if he has the choice to ask for
counseling
get a job have some financial autonomy
like because of the second wave she has
a lot of opportunities to change her
life that she didn't have 40 years ago
you know she can get a credit line she
can move out she can say I need the
therapist with you or else I need a
divorce she can get a divorce
the libertarian you okay I'm following
it's also the feminists to me right so
she has choices so I wasn't say that
that's patriarchy I would say that
patriarchy may be one of the big reasons
that that man has trouble expressing his
feelings okay um fair enough I'm trying
to get into individual practice so we
can kind of get to the root cause of
these obviously in justices across the
globe now and then we can go to the
United States would we say for example
we're talking about religion Jesus
Christ a man who saved a woman from
being stoned said treat your wives as
equals among you treated a woman as
equal among men was very rare at this
point had no wives committed no physical
abuse or emotional abuse would we say
that Jesus Christ was perpetuating
patriarchy himself actually I think
Jesus Christ was one of the original
feminists and one of the most historic
significant feminists come I'm a big fan
of Jesus Christ historically I'm Jewish
but so is he and president historic
figure
continued they can be pissed go ahead
okay let's bring that in there there's
been a lot of scholarship about the
historical Jesus and he's someone that
any radical Jewish person today or
anyone really would really like if you
know if they like social justice he was
challenging orthodoxies on a lot of
levels he was absolutely about gender
equality he you know the early churches
were one of the first gathering places
where women and men could speak and
worship together it was later that there
was a dictum like Paul wasn't so great
you know respectfully saying that women
shouldn't preach that was later Jesus
never said that and there were Mary
Magdalene was you know there's a lot of
historical research that shows that she
was a teacher and also that a lot of the
things that he was doing like having
slaves and wealthy people and
prostitutes and tax collectors were
reviled sit down together and break
bread together you know that was like a
radical statement about social justice
and social equality was very unpopular
at the time got him killed but I'm a fan
okay I just I'm asking a good good good
so we agree I think we agree on that
point
this is a starting off point Christ like
he said I'm a big fan of organized we
would agree on that people who don't
know that Jesus was a Jew people who
beat their wives back died bad people
okay let's put them aside so this is
Jesus Christ the founder of the faeces
we can put him what about someone let's
say who lived a life who took several
lives some of whom were six not talking
about consummated against their will of
course I am would we say that that would
be an example toxic masculinity or
patriarchy or terminology that would
certainly be differentiating from Christ
like dim ain't gonna get apologies David
you just saying you're not black enough
guess what there's no coming back
I've been found these guys for years
they've over three million subscribers
on YouTube yes you can go check out
their dates they're an Austin on October
7th San Antonio go to official
hodgetwins comm follow them at
hodgetwins and you can just search them
on youtube if they haven't been silenced
hodgetwins glad to have you both yeah we
can't well we can't we can't get enough
of the hodgetwins in our household
though we can't say this on the record
so you guys again out of the ordinary
bodybuilding channel not necessarily in
line with what we often talk about but
you've been hit by the youtubes d
monetization ad pocalypse we were gonna
meet with you when we were in Utah but
you know we got held up by the FBI now
you get explainable who don't know what
it is that you do on your channel and
how you guys got started because it's
kind of a new media success story yeah
so in California and I just got this
idea I was like I went to us definitely
kill the start a YouTube channel you
know he didn't say those words he said
let's beat some medians I was like wow I
thought he was smoking crack again but
yeah plenty well we started a YouTube
channel called it heart with just pretty
much just door whatever just random
skits and stuff like that and start it
weld into Doolin our current event
because to do comedy sketches PD more
than one person yeah and evil we did it
come as guilty about what to change all
the lights yes yes okay so before this
started you you guys were about a
hundred and ten pounds soaking wet and
then you realize man we got to lift some
weights and do our YouTube channel I
[Laughter]
remember you guys started at Planet
Fitness earlier which is the bane of my
existence but you know I'm not a big fan
but I remember you did a video on that
I'm banned from Planet
for life you know the true story
actually uh we back in the day man we
had a membership with Planet Fitness the
reason behind it was because we worked
at insurance company we got fire comes
with cussing in the YouTube video so we
had to give up our membership because
there's too expensive was like $25 yeah
no snow squat rack there yeah I was
kicked out for going in as a so
that's actually a little different
reason this was they had to hold the
whole men going to women's locker rooms
and so I just went in as a woman to
Planet Fitness they let me in totally
fine but by the third one I walked into
like Steven we know who you are you're
not a lot of Planet Fitness please ever
again
[Music]
I know but apparently they knew the
weight we had a youtube channel at that
point look we don't think you're being
sincere and I'm like but I am I am being
sincere I'm not feeling anymore I'm
Stephanie okay speaking of which you
guys did a lot of crap you just did a
DNA test on your channel from the black
community for what is it not not being
black is that the now my great-grandma
she was white yeah okay to don't that
black dude that's why we're here
but um we would say comments and our
videos and like black people's like you
know what I'm not comfortable I'm
not dark enough to be talking like this
plus they say we sound like some
rednecks move cuz we got a strong
Jackson
so they I sound like you'll send me Sam
like yes well there's a lot we talk with
a lot of common ground was actually
white Southerners and blacks from even
like urban Detroit a lot of the same
same terminology a lot of the same slang
and that big that comes from basically
sort of a common history here in the
United States hate to say it
some of that not so pretty with the
slavery but we got past we're doing
better 2017 us don't
well you okay so I don't know if I'm
outing you here but you said off air you
like oh yeah were you at the ben shapiro
thing in utah so you guys are aware of
him your your I wouldn't fans but you
you like some of his content yeah yeah I
watch his stuff on YouTube and yeah I
just like them hi put the V damn
liberals put them in a place where it's
like yeah like them ain't gonna get a
politic people say you're not black
enough
guess what there's no coming back now we
used to be CC liberal yeah but as we got
older us actually st. more for myself so
up here we like like right now we like I
would say we're leaning towards the
right I got one split in the right right
I got the other foot too used to be on
the left side so you're doing pistol
squats on the right and you haven't
figured out where you land yet you know
we just don't like how they paint
everything like I if they it's important
to race it stuff like that it's like
race it's like they use an angle to like
people keep people stuck as being
Democrats you know I don't erase prints
with y'all yeah yeah I mean you'll get
maybe this on your YouTube channel
they'll de monetize you but we're fine
you can say whatever you want here so
you've been hit obviously I remember we
met I've been watching you for a while
not a bodybuilder myself have always
been more of you know straight strength
trainer so you know practical purposes
but we can get into that another time
but we are you guys sent me a direct
message saying like yeah man we got to
monetize what kind of knew it but you
get that's proof man
it's like what we do is really pretty
pretty clean stuff and ever it happened
to us was that was that a part of kind
of your your awakening process do you
think you just saw the left trying to
shut everything down
yeah anything is controversial a tip is
true you talk about it unless you're a
little pushed everywhere pushing your
face on me every time I look at somebody
now what Australia becoming shows down
there got in the cab dc-8 we think punch
for president don't cry I'm like you do
yeah
it's like an infatuation with this guy's
Oh everybody talks about it it's like
yeah I'm like sick of you can't look at
nothing but I don't even look at say
anymore
it's just bad Trump 24/7 well I don't
look at it because I'm gonna see what
they're saying oh yeah I look at it with
bands over that toe yeah this is super
Merle dropping the Moab on ya what you
know it's funny actually when I first
moved to LA I was in Inglewood I was
sleeping on a cot in Inglewood and the
guy guy's name was I shouldn't say it
but he was black guy sometimes on his uh
on his floor he's like you can stay here
for a month and four days in we got into
an argument over politics and he's like
you got to go I was sleeping out of an
82 Datsun that I bought from a Cambodian
named Sonny and I remember I left told
the story because I was six hundred and
fifty two dollars because you know those
Cambodians are so cheap and then I I
said I don't have the fifty-two can I
write an IOU for $52
so really the black guy kicked me out
you know and I didn't hold it against
the entire race of people for a long
time I got past it the point is there
can be some healing
six days white bikini blood black black
brown me right out it was him and he
didn't say that it was because of
political argument but it was really
pretty clear and this was right before
Barack Obama eyes I don't even get into
it so let me ask you this you do live
shows now did you start doing live shows
because you didn't start out as like
stand-up comics no I started out as a as
an actor than stand-up comic in my
mid-teens on Benjamin who's often on the
show stand-up comedian was it more so
because of the D monetization on YouTube
and you found you guys have been pretty
smart with selling supplements doing a
lot of live shows and diversifying
outside of just YouTube so you haven't
been hit as hard did you always kind of
think okay what's the next step thinking
ahead
well we always love you stand up with
this we didn't have enough courage to go
out there and do it because going from
YouTube videos stand on the stage and
making people Apple just a microphone
man yeah that is no easy cup of tea
right everyone already knew you so if
you go out there it's like if you bomb
you know you get about five minutes of
grace as Colin Quinn says and then it's
like if you're not making us laugh
so you didn't have the benefit of just
starting and being a nobody you started
doing stand-up after you are known what
well we first started doing stand-up
though the whole money thing on YouTube
was great yeah I mean it we didn't have
to do stand-up we wanted to do stand-up
we really wanted to knock the money per
se but but thank God we did because
since we be doing stand-up that's the
only thing that's really keeping our
it's above water still as far as being
you know financially yeah we definitely
be in the red we would be in red
well then all your bad fans would say
okay they get a pass yeah you thank God
we did you didn't yeah we monetize
ourselves by selling clothing and
supplements if it wasn't for that I mean
if we would just laugh or get to man I
would be I would have to go get a job
yeah then you get fired because I'd see
your YouTube videos I'd say wow you're
hired
oh wait we saw your YouTube video on
Steve Harvey your fight your unhide yeah
immediately I'm hired yeah we've all
realized it's not kid Jared here he's
you can't be hired anywhere no go on
college campus anywhere now without
security not after what you just did
with an tyfa it's inside we really
wanted to meet up with you guys in in
utah but you know the FBI slows you down
when you have to turn over all this so
so do you deal at all in politics on
stage here's one thing I will say the
right kind of has the corner on fun now
lucky said because of political
correctness there are no youtubers on
the left where you're going oh I'm
aching to see their stand-up show that's
gonna be a rip-roaring riot you know
someone from The Young Turks oh what
will they say next
oh this is my seat so do you feel like
gives you a leg up I mean because you
don't care the right doesn't care at
this point so much who you offend I've
got to imagine that that's somewhat
liberating for you guys at least a
little we are pretty much well we just
pretty much tell a bunch of stories
about us being kids I got a killer
Caitlyn Jenner jokes let me hear it yeah
we just don't yeah we just we come from
a good place
yeah yeah now how do you balance being
on the road and obviously fitness but
you know staying in shape you just hit
road gyms do you bring do you bring
resistance bands with you what do you do
it's pretty rough I would say the time
with it again but most of time it's like
after healers show in the meat free yeah
I wiped out I was back to my hotel room
is I never we never realized who we
start doing on status shows like when
you onstage for an hour demand it's like
running a marathon oh yeah wow it is
taxing and then sleeping in the strange
beds and being blind and man it is rough
I remember we did a big 10 shows in
telephone yeah in five days oh geez
oh yeah cuz we had two shows back to
back days in San Diego then forever
some fallacies so you had to give some
stays leaves does one of you get
Cratchit na kijiye notice I always have
you know it's like this is these are my
diva requests stage microphone and for
45 minutes before the show a green room
because sometimes they'll do private
gigs I'll go on college campus and
they'll try to the meet-and-greet before
the show or something with you yeah it's
happened when you've been with me or
people are coming in their pitch and
sketches I'm like listen I don't know
don't be a jerk but I need 45 minutes
just to be by myself focus because it is
exhaust is one of you more cranky than
the other or you both just I imagine you
two like velociraptors in the kitchen
and that Jurassic Park contained just
constantly biting at each other's necks
do you know what um we come out on stage
the fans think that energy is so high
keeps us going like it's big what I
found to be very important when you're
torn you need a nice hot shower and you
show up to your show of your fans or
like you know then you love they'll it I
mean it keeps me going if you walk if
you walk into a show I've walked in
shows people seem like they're tired oh
it could be a drag because such shows
you the first couple of jokes you know
if it's will be a good show that yeah
and say Oh joking it doesn't hit like
[Laughter]
crowds is just it's kind of weird
because all you froze again
oh I froze well you know Hassan yeah if
you just show this is almost more funny
for the show can you guys hear me or no
I don't even think they can hear you go
oh all right yeah I was gonna say you
know I had that actually so just you
know but act like we can't that's better
for the show I I had that for a while
when I was young or that was nineteen
and I won a myspace comedy contest it
was called so you think you're funny and
you know what the prize was I got to
perform with black boy two eyes and
Bruce Bruce yeah no money though but
just imagine me opening up for Bru
brew and black boys that crowd was okay
I realize none of these jokes work and I
just joked about how white I was and I
didn't realize this speaking of the
racial healing I had to introduce Bruce
Bruce and I would introduce was like any
other stand-up show I look around I'm
selling I'm thinking like oh he had a
heart attack in the green room like he's
not coming out he's dead he came out
with an entourage like Mike Tyson and he
walked out slowly and it would have like
you know blaring hip-hop and he'd have a
full entourage and he would take a
minimum of a minute and a half to get to
the stage and the light McCallum so I'm
just this lone white kid 19 years old
yeah it is the most awkward thing and
you realize really early the audience is
honest you like this isn't gonna work
yeah
yeah it is crazy - he has a black
audience oh my god audience yeah I
oughta slap people you know yes so that
we have a black audience but I would say
sympathy audience and white Asian
Hispanic and then I will say 5% black
yeah well after the DNA test maybe
you'll get it up to six you know what I
was wrong about them man probably
thinking my whole purpose cuz in DNA
test all right it is official hodgetwins
dot-com and they have some good training
advice over there - I know you're you're
you're inundated with YouTube now with
just a whole bunch of horrible training
tips from people who are loaded to the
juice loaded to the gills with juice but
they swear that they're not you can
follow that hodge twins
hey it's I didn't even go I know I don't
know which ones Keith which ones Kevin
thank you guys and well yeah let's be
honest you're interchangeable at this
point and cut
come back soon guys okay hey hey boy
let's go go stay the play to the me
please
II know some people have no reason he
was like okay he's looking I tell you
what I'm gonna say I'm gonna give you
the out and play that music will let him
go let him come back next time do the
Pledge of Allegiance that's how we'll
live
hey did you enjoy this video here's the
thing you wrote you're here this is the
end of it so we don't care cuz you
already watched it but if you really
didn't like it and you want to justify
it leave a comment below telling us why
you didn't like the video and if you
liked us let us know and subscribe to
the channel because that lets the
overlords at YouTube know that you know
what you're alright
he is literally Hitler I mean literally
our babies take it two feet over you're
blocking the TV
hey okay when dealing with this whole
Weinstein drama I've always this I don't
want to attribute to collusion what can
be attributed to incompetence but with
the Weinstein in Hollywood sexual
assault situation a sexual assault
situation at large so the question of
the day are we at a point where the
preponderance of evidence leaves no
other option at this point I you would
have to believe incompetence on such a
massive scale it almost seems less
realistic what do you think I would
genuinely like to know we're going to go
through some of the worst offenders
before I get to this let me let me set
this up okay everyone's a hypocrite
everyone in this room is a hypocrite if
you have any standards at all you're a
hypocrite that's that's not what this is
about no the difference is Hollywood
gives themselves awards and they laud
themselves with praise simply for their
pearl clutching hypocrisy their virtue
Singh and the ultimate irony is they're
the worst hypocrites which is really
hard to do when you have absolutely no
stations at all like your high jump is
already below knee level
and they're missing it so this is what
it is
everyone's a hypocrite I get that you
can point that out to every single
person but they don't all make livings
as hypocrites that's the issue can you
believe this scumbag is our president he
is literally Hitler I mean literally are
they take it two feet over you're
blocking the TV
I mean it's the Christian Right taking
the high ground and then voting for this
guy that's just these tweets but I know
they're a pot that hypocrisy knows no
bounds we should find that too horrible
to air but we're hypocrites yeah ruin so
many films that were family favorites
let's uh let's go through the worst
offenders here because I again and then
we can tie to or look at Hollywood at
large first off okay right off at Meryl
Streep Meryl Streep very close to
Weinstein talked about being close to
wine sees a matter fact called him god
and one of her acceptance speeches I
just want to thank my agent Kevin
and God Harvey Weinstein hello didn't
make her from the rib of man he just
raped her yeah and then she went on say
that she had no idea she claims
regarding his sex scandal she had no
clue okay again let's let's do not
everything nothing has been proven yet
okay a lot of this is alleged but here's
the deal with Meryl Streep why don't I
tend to believe her because even if she
did know that Harvey Weinstein was a
sexual assault multiple time felon she
she doesn't have a problem with it we
know beyond a shadow of doubt she has no
problem with sexual assault as seen by
her saying she felt sorry for multiple
child rapist Roman Polanski for him
being in jail and she gave him a
standing ovation at an awards ceremony
the Oscar goes to Roman Polanski
[Music]
now it might seem like that's bad
considering that he anally raped a
thirteen-year-old girl on quaalude my
someone would say that's look behind you
there is the line but everyone's line is
different here's the real here's the
real kicker it wouldn't be as bad if she
weren't traversing the country and in
every single speech decrying bullying
taking this pseudo moral superiority at
any opportunity possible disrespect
invites disrespect violence incites
violence when the powerful use their
position to bully others we all lose
does rape fall under the bullying
umbrella in this scenario
that's what they always do they always
say what they should say to the person
giving them gold and fame to just some
other guy right yeah it's like this miss
message by the way it's like it's not
for you Harvey don't consider yourself
this MIT but about the powerful but no
Harvey you're good you're good just have
to say this to the room here's the next
one that really bothers me Gwyneth
Paltrow so what if Paltrow has now come
out and I know people say were your
victim-blaming I get if they're a victim
of sexual assault absolutely they have
proof they should be heard but there are
two separate issues so Gwyneth Paltrow
claims that Weinstein made unwanted
advances in her leading up to this the
film Emma and allegedly Brad Pitt knew
knew about it and confronted him about
it very very meekly but here's the thing
at this exact same time she was publicly
thanking Weinstein in acceptance
speeches I would like to thank Harvey
Weinstein and everybody at Miramax Films
for their undying support of me here at
this point she's no longer just a
self-serving hypocrite she is that but
she's acting as an active recruiting
tool for Weinstein if you are being
raped if you're being sexually assaulted
behind the scenes now you're a victim
but there is some culpability if you're
going on up to an awards show and you
know that girls from across the country
are watching the glitz and the glamour
and these glorious actresses and I'm
looking up to Gwyneth Paltrow and her
homemade $95 dinners that you can make
to because she's just like you and
you're watching saying oh well what do I
need to do what what did Gwyneth Paltrow
do Oh Weinstein was the one who gave her
a leg up she is acting as a recruit
tool for other horse it's called
vouching for someone exactly like it
like if a mechanic breaks my car and
then I just go to a friend and go you
got to use this guy and then their cars
broken he's like hey thanks a lot man
except you escalate that to rape yeah
your guy thanks your guy over there at
maitus put his what is in the tailpipe
of my car yeah I don't even know how he
expected that to help you're the one
thing to that really really I find odd
not a single ass-kicking from a husband
or boyfriend when Weinstein not one like
not a single husband her boyfriend came
forward and kicked his ass when I read
that Brad Pitt confronted Weinstein oh
man oh so Weinstein has been shot once
no oh did you do this well huh
please don't do that but I do hope you
you give me enough shame on you
and from someone who's been in this it's
like the thing that Hollywood laugh will
do that if she just didn't say he was
great that absence of praise or absence
of condemnation mengapa sit like for me
it was I wouldn't attack Trump voters
right and so people that that silence
like when you see people in Hollywood
that don't talk politics typically
people yeah they start assuming you're
conservative and it's the same thing
with her if she didn't thank Harvey
Weinstein they would be like you better
thank Harvey Weinstein or else it's
obvious that like you're revealing that
he's a scumbag exactly yeah that's an
important point a lot of people don't
necessarily know the politics behind the
scenes and you better thank Harvey
Weinstein it would been it's a it's I
was surprised a story broke well
everyone's known that for years it turns
out there's actually there's more
evidence and accusations here now more
people coming forward that's why it
isn't of course by the way with Gwyneth
Paltrow of course all of this with
Gwyneth happened while she was
championing feminist causes like the
gender pay gap because she's a strong
feminist who praises the people who
commit sexual assault let's move on to
Tina Fey hos hos want money yo they want
them if we say that that's considered
sexist if Harvey Weinstein says that
it's considered foreplay Tina Fey knew
all along and you look back you can see
Seth MacFarlane's joke you can see these
little cues that everyone knew she knew
all along about Weinstein's debauchery
she had a sketch 30 rock it was titled
Jenna turned down Harvey Weinstein three
out of five times roll clip don't duel
with Jaden
you don't want to miss what we're down
oh please I'm not afraid of anyone in
show business
I turned down intercourse with Harvey
Weinstein on no less than three
occasions out of five it sounds like
it's a well known secret it's it's held
normalizing by the way well that's the
thing they keep accusing us for
constantly that's what they do in
literary term it's also foreshadowing
yeah shadowing by the way then Tina Fey
noted feminist and non comedian in chief
went on to tell a college-educated white
women who voted for Trump that well
first off sheet she chastised them and
then told that they couldn't look away a
lot of the selection was turned by
whites at college educated women who now
would maybe like to forget about the
selection and go back to watching HGTV
and I would want to know no silly middle
American women because it doesn't affect
you this minute but it's gonna affect
you eventually what what about what
about being mounted haha that affect me
right now might not affect you right now
are you watching a GTV what about your
guy who raped me could someone consider
I mean I don't even necessarily think
that that's affect by association I
think it's directive because he was
inside of me against my will Tina Fey
strong feminist this is the would again
have a great but they make a living off
of their hypocrisy the huge component to
Hollywood is giving yourself an award
and a huge component to getting an award
is speaking out politically and a huge
component to speaking out politically in
Hollywood if you're gonna be taken
seriously is simply to vilify middle
America let's go this is the final a
trifecta we had to wrap them all up in
one the worst offenders Matt Damon Ben
Affleck and Jimmy Kimmel okay those are
probably the closest people to wine wine
some you go back to Good Will Hunting
Matt Damon responsible for the Ben
Affleck now according to Sharon Waxman
who wrote an expose on Weinstein in 2004
again this is alleged but Matt Damon
made a call demanding that the story be
spiked and then she said the story was
stripped of any reference to sexual
favors or coercion and buried on the
inside the culture section and obscure
story about Miramax firing an Italian
executive so this is something that
journalists have been trying to expose
for a while it's just something that
several people have notice matter fact
rose mcgowan called out Matt Damon
asking what it feels like to be a
spineless profiteer which he is now this
is no one we get it not people aren't
huge fans of Matt Damon but at this
point this is trending right everywhere
Matt Damon is running Ben Affleck right
now because people looking into it so
Jimmy Kimmel created a segment from it
was trending on youtube today
Kimmel now the guy who cried for Cecil
the lion the guy who cried about gun
control healthcare did he cry for a
countless potential rape and molestation
his friends here's Brad it's something
else to note his father's friends by the
way when there's trending when they're
trending videos and in trends on Twitter
okay
and it's really really bad for Ben
Affleck for Matt Damon right now if
you're watching this please just don't
check Twitter it's gonna be it's good
you're gonna have a bad time
um it's sucked in Jimmy Kimmel
deliberately created a video to act as
Damon's PR guy to bury the bad searches
strategically releasing this fluff piece
they're cool okay that's enough we can
shut that up remember when people got
mad at Fallon for not vilifying drone
normalising it's almost like like the
heard of it almost like you're making a
living off of him actually of course
Rose McGowan also called out Ben Affleck
the lesser talented Damon brother as
he's affectionately known so if you're
such thing about Ben Affleck to me
hilarie Burton accused Ben Affleck of
groping her on set of not one trio but
on Tia yeah I think he'll know it's TRL
she won't real actress so she accuse him
of groping her now there's video of this
here's what's interesting to me is uh
okay
this happened but there's also this clip
from a 2004 interview I remember this
clip because I was in Montreal when this
happened this is from a french-canadian
channel and it's been on the internet
for a long time well are usually sure
this was a 92 story
why are you bring it up today
- these are very suspiciously firm to a
Janet Jackson stunt are you wearing your
liberated by all you want to do is have
sex all the time you don't want to talk
you don't want to hold me and the only
time we do get to talks when you think
it's gonna be about sex okay so later
after Gigli how the hell do you have
that kind of confidence have you become
a creepy eighty year old man when you're
a young movie star like that's like how
like the creepiest oldest dude in my
neighborhood batali hey ya boobies that
guy was like a movie star like how is he
so creepy that you only want to talk
about sex huh he went out and he
publicly condemned Weinstein saying this
is this is disgusting and we have to we
have to put more women in positions of
power and I am I am sickened by this a
from Weinstein so he said that then
immediately apologized to to Hillary
saying I acted inappropriately but I
only apologize for that he made this
condemnation wow this here's what when I
see these things I don't just go okay
there's a bad clip of Ben Affleck he
knew that this clip was out there to me
that shows no conscience whatsoever
he was condemning Weinstein hoping that
he would get away with this isn't self
out there it's like that kid everyone
had in the group who you knew you
weren't you were caught and you're all
fasting up but he would still live still
like you're calling does it write you
but yeah okay we did do it we did go
swimming without a lifeguard you know I
didn't Thanks over there it's not even
just lying it's going the other
direction cuz like we're friends you
know that I'm a fairly messy person like
you know I'm just a messy guy that I'd
be the equivalent of not just lying
about that being like yeah I'm not messy
I would then attack you and be like
what's up with all this dust they have
this god complex that they think they're
gonna go do you realise Ben Affleck we
have access to clips from 2004 it's not
Limon trello some internet' and a
sophomore and this isn't by design this
isn't this isn't by happen since right
this is absolutely by design the
Hollywood left like you just said it's
evil and that's why they have disdain
for conservative America you made this
point just evil people hate good people
yeah and and I like the quote that the
line between good and evil goes through
someone's heart because it we we're all
capable of good and evil but like people
trying to be good are seen like and
people that have just accepted this
hedonistic awful existence it like
bothers them too
see happy people they want to make them
miserable like themselves and they want
to just attack them so they have disdain
for Middle America and in basic of
course as Owen points out basic biology
that's why the Weinsteins are some of
the biggest Democrat donors in recent
decades over a million dollars since
2000 it's more than $4 there's multiple
Democrat politicians you know that's one
third of the entire NRA by the way yeah
yeah when it comes to Clinton by the way
she was quicker to come out and condemn
the NRA for what happened in Vegas and
she was Weinstein the big difference is
the NRA didn't put their penis in an
unwilling victim don't take our word for
it you're the politician ISM self this
is possible because of Harvey he is a
wonderful human being good friend the
president thank you for being my guest
tonight and as I said I always learn
amazing things from you true he will
give his penis to anyone who'll have it
and some who won't and then you have
this again we're talking about do you
think again comment I really want to see
your comments on this because I often go
back and forth is everyone incompetent
Barack Obama the same thing with the 77
cents on the dollar do we have to
believe that Barack Obama does have
access to Google he can't actually make
sense of these statistics he can't see
oh that's a basic number that people
just take with the median salary for
women median salary for many dozen take
into account hours or degrees or
experience okay we get it it's untrue do
are we to assume that President Barack
Obama had no clue as to what's been
happening with the Weinsteins and that's
why he sent mallya he was going to send
Mallya over for an internship again no
father's no husband's kicking anybody's
ass when it comes to the wine scene you
can attribute stupidity sometimes but at
some point you have to believe and this
is where I am that Matt Damon Ben
Affleck Meryl Streep Gwyneth Paltrow
Casey Affleck Jimmy Kimmel Tina Fey drew
Barrymore Chuck Schumer Hillary Clinton
Bill Clinton shell Obama Barack Obama
either they're all idiots complete
morons who never knew at all as
marriages I had no idea or they are
actively banding together to sweep evil
under the rug out of convenience
just feels like a bad dream I still
can't believe he's really present like
this video subscribe by clicking the
button it's a circular button now that
says subscribe if not head on over the
Young Turks that's probably more your
speed although they're coming over here
Cinque we know you're here watching I
can smell you from here there's also
recommended video box playing right up
there you can join the monk little otter
with credit.com slash mug Club for daily
content so we're not dependent here on
YouTube shank go/no-go you don't need to
stay here this isn't good for it's bad
for your soul
you weren't given that platform the
platform of this late-night show because
of your political views you were given
the platform in order to create comedy
your job is to create comedy and in
these scenarios it's more important ever
your job is more important than on days
where it's easy to do Jimmy Kimmel was
number one trend on YouTube social media
today I'm starting to realize the
trending list is not so much about
what's trending but what YouTube wants
to be trending before I move on because
we'll talk about Jimmy Kimmel's
grandstanding and of course that's just
a litany of factual airs question of the
day are you still able to watch
late-night usually I'm able to separate
the art from the artists we've talked
about that but at what point is it too
much at what point does a propagandizing
become so blatant that you just have to
tune out it's it's become really hard
and I was it that was the biggest gun
fan huge Conan fan I can't watch it
Jimmy Kimmel went up and of course is
this is the rule rather than the
exception crying talking about the Las
Vegas shooting and listen this is the
first off let's address a tragedy
absolutely I think that every side both
the left and the right care about lives
lost we just have different solutions
and of course I believe that one side is
more informed on what are actually
pragmatic solutions versus the other but
let's walk through Jimmy Kimmel's recent
number one trending diatribe course we
pray for the victims and for their
families and friends and we wonder why
even though there's probably no way to
ever know why a human being would do
something like this to other human
beings River at a concert this is
important because it sets it up it's a
really simple answer why it's called
evil yeah it's something the Left
refuses to acknowledge exist because at
that point then I was in the situational
ethics and they no longer function you
need to have a base of some kind of
principle listen it's horrible it
doesn't mean that you have to comprehend
evil on an empathetic let it is horrible
it should be absolutely disgusting but
it's not a complex question why would
someone do it evil what led them to
their evil will then we'll get it and
what allowed them to commit that act of
evil and what's the best way to curb it
moving forward that's the discussion we
should be having let's move on there are
a lot of things we can do about it well
we don't which is interesting because
when someone with a beard attacks us we
phones we invoke travel bans we build
walls we take every possible precaution
the metric doesn't happen again
currently an American buys a gun and
kills other Americans then there's
nothing we can do about that and Second
Amendment I guess are yes more fathers
wanted us to have a que 47 is the
argument I assume now I don't know if
Chuck Schumer is writing this one for
him as well as what happened with the
health care issue but um yeah Second
Amendment founding fathers just because
you act as though it's absurd doesn't
make an absurd our founders wanted to
have so just a few things we'll list off
here that he was wrong about ak-47s
that's an easy one just go and watch one
of our previous videos as a Second
Amendment for muskets only not only if
you understand the wording in the
history of the Second Amendment did it
of course apply to modern-day weaponry
but even back then there was a Puckle
gun the jiren donee air rifle
there was actually a letter written of
marque and reprisal to a private ship
they were allowing them to personally
have cannons it was written of course
you're gonna have cannons you never
protect your ship do it the idea that it
was only relegated to muskets is so
quickly and thoroughly debunked that
we've done it we won't waste a ton of
time when I hear then he goes on to say
hope of a person with the beard let's be
honest about what he's talking about
here he means a brown person what's a
beard this is the whole identity
politics as though if it's Muslim we
care but if it's a white person we don't
care okay let's let's go with that I'll
admit to a certain degree of that why
because of a consistent pattern of
behavior based on ideology and outlier
is just that an outlier but if you can
actually look at a correlation between
people who follow a very specific a
political prescription as well as a
religion as we do with Islam guess what
it should be relevant because that comes
to the discussion can we do something
about it so let's go to why someone
might think someone with a beard could
be a little bit different than just the
random white guy who's out of his mind
or white supremacist who the left loves
to scream about okay this is one thing
that's important because I saw this at
Vox I call this the 9/11 fallacy where
the quote is since 9/11 a hundred and
six people have been killed by far-right
violent extremists in the u.s. 119 have
been killed by Islamists so it seems
comparable now if you include one day
earlier nine
that puts a number over 3,100 some would
say significant there might say now I
get you can say what we shouldn't
include it we should include it but
again you're starting after an act of
global terrorism committed by the guys
with the beards glow and this is just a
united state statistic so you see this
at Vox you see people like Jimmy Kimmel
parody Islamic attacks globally that's
the important number they account for
more than 74 percent of all deaths from
terrorism Isis Boko Haram Taliban al
Qaeda okay there's nothing there's
there's no surprise there so if someone
who's brown does it with a beard
shouting out Allahu Akbar doesn't matter
more no it means that we have more of a
semblance of a motive and if we see
other people shouting Allahu Akbar we
have to recognize a pattern of behavior
now he doesn't he goes on this I love
this he says we're because of this we go
we invoke travel bans we build the walls
just skims over it well okay you say
there's nothing we get does that help
stop terror attacks securing borders and
profiling we can mock it but does it
work they work everywhere they've been
implemented from Israel to Hungary
Israel experienced a 90 percent drop in
terror attacks after building a fence in
the West Bank
Hungary cut its influx of migrants from
several thousand a day to less than 40
just by rent for a couple offenses and
the important thing to remember here
again Islam is an ideology why would the
beard why would the garb matter because
it's a representation of what he
believes a belief that prescribes him to
kill other people contrast that was his
shooter no no affiliations motivations
yet or history of crime yet would
securing the border stop that no we're
putting up a wall stop this guy probably
not with anything short of a complete
and total gun ban stopped this guy no
and by the way that wouldn't work either
No
so what does Jimmy Kimmel hauls are
cheap to rent yes what did you make you
might want to say do you want to be
Minority Report or you arrest people for
crimes they have yet to commit since the
beginning of time there been bad people
committing bad things because evil lives
amongst us it brings us back to that
point if you acknowledge evil then you
can be honest about the conversation
that we're having next clip every one of
these shootings of murder used automatic
or semi-automatic rifles everyone
weapons you know use them for
self-defense
incorrectly designed to kill large
numbers of people in the shortest
possible amount of time this
I reportedly had ten of them in his room
apparently legally at least some of them
were there illegally why is that allowed
okay couple things you know those who
probably have ten in their room people
in your security detail Jimmy Kimmel
yeah bet you they probably have a lot of
scary black rifles that you don't know
about but because they do you get to
sleep at night and be escorted to and
from your Hollywood studios so here he
just says some things that are factually
completely incorrect he says all of
these mass shootings doesn't even say a
lot of them he says all of these
nationalists would use again the first
lesson Jimmy Kimmel don't use those
don't use absolutes when you have no
idea as to what the hell you're talking
about okay when you're dumb and horrible
always everyone try and cover your
tracks a little bit not everyone out
there if it's an argument for truth you
don't you do it but when you're a dumb
baggage like Jimmy Kimmel it pays to not
take chances let's assume he weren't an
absolute simpleton and as soon as he
said far more mass shootings not even
all we'll give him some more leeway no
more mass shootings committed by the
assault rifle it's not even true if we
take mass shootings meaning four or more
take any shootings the FBI data show
that in 2012 only three hundred and
twenty something of over eleven thousand
people shot in the u.s. were killed by
rifles of any kind they're committed by
handguns far more another thing he does
word trick or you've talked about this
he conflate two automatic with
semi-automatic it's like it's like
comparing a hamburger and lasagna
they're both food it's not the same
thing
nearly all guns today sold for those who
don't know and again they're banking on
you not knowing Jimmy Kimmel is banking
on you being as moronic as him pistols
semi-automatic most guns that are sold
today semi-automatic most there in the
years defensively semi automatics but as
far as in practice a revolver acts like
a semi-automatic on a technical level
there isn't a semi-automatic re
chambering of around put one trigger
pull one round one bullet that's what
semi-automatic means fully automatic is
heavily regulated and basically it's not
available to the average centers and he
goes he says there's no defensive
purpose for this guns incorrect there
are no defensive uses they're actually
used to say far more lives than they
ever take that's the bit that's the
story people don't talk about we know
according from the United States Census
Bureau that at least a hundred thousand
to three million somewhere even the left
has to acknowledge it's somewhere close
to two million cases each year of
firearms used
now why is there such a discrepancy
because it's hard to measure how many
lives are saved by someone brandishing a
gun and never actually using it on fire
yet guns are used to save more lives and
yes that means the scary black rifles
they're used defensively far more than
offensively so again if you go oh what's
a semi-automatic and automatic you don't
know and hey there's no defensive use
for these firearms I guess that may you
could actually start to believe some of
the bullcrap coming out from Jimmy
Kimmel luckily there's more that we can
debug today this morning she said it was
not the time for political debate and I
don't know we have 59 innocent people
dead it wasn't their time either so I
think now is the time for political
debate well I'm glad you think so Jimmy
it's not like it would be time for your
comedic monologue this is the arrogance
of the Hollywood left City he presumes
to speak on behalf of everyone else okay
in this context let's take this these 59
people died in Las Vegas at a country
concert how much do you want to bet but
at least a plurality of them would hate
Jimmy Kimmel speaking for them it's you
know in February he also signed a bill
that made it easier for people with
severe mental illness to buy guns
legally that's actually not true okay
and this is one thing the Billy's
talking about it was actually reversing
an Obama administration rule that
actually took second amendment basic
rights away from seniors who were
declared incompetent to manage their
pension or disability payments even the
ACLU came out against this Obama rule
okay so let's just talk that piece of
legislation we need it we need to deal
right here with some pragmatics and the
philosophical when it comes to the
Second Amendment so no he's wrong he's
incorrect he's not explaining what that
is go to the source that we just listed
hopefully you can learn more about that
bill but again people talk of this
conversation well if you're if you're
the mentally ill okay this is important
we needed to find what is mentally ill
now keep in mind if you look at the four
dissenting Supreme Court justices on the
hello versus DC case they don't believe
you have the right to own a firearm at
all again this is important the legal
argument is not oh it's only four
muskets the legal argument isn't well it
should only be revolvers or pump shotgun
the only legal argument made at the
Supreme Court is you have no right
period to private firearm ownership
period ever period that's the argument
that they make so you need to understand
into that to then okay scale it back
when they say mental health what do they
mean well they want everybody to be
banned from having any kinds of firearms
do you really want the federal
government in control as to your right
to self-preservation your god-given
right to self-preservation because
you've taken a xanax you think it's a
slippery slope it's actually been
proposed it's so crazy right now there
are loopholes in the law that let people
avoid another party they bind on online
or at a gun show no no okay go and see
we did a video on this gun show loophole
a hidden-camera video it is it is
completely false first online loophole
it doesn't even exist now the gun show
loophole comes to this idea of private
transactions that usually occur between
family members okay
Obama was the one who popularized this
myth and he used that term we actually
went to the gun show in Indiana remember
not kids you heard the famous when they
were that he referred to and no one
would give us a gun through the gun show
loophole you can go watch the video
maybe just really done and picked a
really bad exists it's still a thing
bunk so many times saying because people
like Jimmy Kimmel who aren't doing their
job of writing comedy don't know the
difference between an automatic or
semi-automatic rifle and people are
getting their information from him hey
Jimmy what's the revolver why do you
pull something and something comes out
of there I want you determining our gun
control legislation several one trend on
YouTube it's a myth that was popularized
by Obama and it was such a it was such
an unbelievably blatant lie even
Washington Post gave it two Pinocchio's
which apparently is a valid system of
rape a valid newspaper next clip by the
way the House of Representatives will be
voting on a piece of legislation this
week it's a bill to legalize the sale of
of silencers for guns this is what
they're working on we have a major
problem with gun violence in this
country and I guess they don't care and
if I'm wrong on that fine do something
about it cuz I'm sick of it
you think some films of course again
this just goes to show you this is one
of those arguments anyone you know out
there who's pro-gun control buy them a
gun
that's a hashtag gift a gun buy them at
done they'll never be pro-gun control
again they'll never be gun control
proponents again I should say they'll
never be anti-gun activist again because
right they'll go through the background
check so understand what's necessary
classes even better sign them up for
concealed carry course ok this is one of
those arguments that is very simple to
describe it is an argument between
completely uninformed people who know
nothing about firearms and firearm
owners that's it you don't get the
firearm owners who side with someone
like Jimmy Kimmel so uh he goes
suppressors by the way this is important
he talks about the spread they don't
make it whisper quiet and it's actually
common practice in Europe again strict
gun control but if you're a hunter it's
considered rude to not use it yeah for
noise pollution for hunters nearby
silencers are designed to protect
hearing for hunters and shooters right
let's put this again into the pragmatic
let's talk about the Vegas shooting okay
you're trying to figure out where the
gunshots are coming from so if there's
no silencer let me give you a difference
it would be pop-pop head down oh I think
he's up there okay a silencer would be
head down pop-pop oh he's there it would
be that much of a difference hitman
Hillary been watching too many
double-oh-seven films what I'm talking
about tonight isn't about gun control
it's about common sense commentary about
gun control ever come from allowing
person to have weapons that can take
down 527 Americans at a concert you know
in June of last year the NRA fought to
make sure people on the no-fly list can
buy guns they aren't using it on the
plane they're allowed to own a very
dangerous gun who thinks that makes
sense are you noticing a theme here yeah
again it's not a fundamental human right
to get on a plane it's not a fundamental
human right to get your your Southwest
Airlines peanuts by the way I love the
biscuits in Delta Dara they are
delicious I wish I could buy this
restore me when you send me the message
but you noticing a point here there's no
flowers you can't even get in a plane
but you can buy okay again completely
uninformed
verses all it takes is one quick search
so you know what the no-fly list is it's
not a terror watchlist it's not an
official list you don't have to have
committed any crime be involved with any
terrorist organization or even have
looked at somebody the wrong way you can
be put in enough light
how do we know because thousands of
people have been put on the no-fly list
with no cause due process or any means
of retribution even slate said the US
government is putting Americans on its
no-fly list
on a hunch you can look up the names you
can look up a list of names just to
people I think was Senator Ted Kennedy
and Kennedy nihilist so this is again
they're hoping you don't run a quick
search on the no-fly list Jimmy Kimmel
who decided that he was going to go up
and by the way cry from 0 to 60 it
wasn't like it came over him he cried
immediately I wonder was he crying in
the makeup chair was he crying in the
groom he walked out crying he's hoping
that you just don't run a rudimentary
search on the no-fly list I would
encourage you to please do so in the
comment below if you learned something
next clip maybe I'm nuts but I would
like to think we could put politics
aside agree that no American citizen
needs an m16 or ten of them nobody has
one and 16 there select-fire auto rifles
not sold for civilian use what's your
point last clip I can't do this much you
know I want this to be a comedy show I
hate talking about stuff like this no
you don't I just want to you know laugh
about things every night but they don't
it seems to becoming increasingly
difficult lately all right this is gonna
sound callous
it just means you suck at your job if
it's increasingly difficult you're a
have you had any communication or
reached out to anyone with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation or anyone who
might be involved with actually
investigating antiphon has there been
any reach out to them yes I would say in
advance of this and even afterwards I
know I know the chief and his team have
been reaching out to sheriff to a
variety of resources know everyone we
know at the FBI
none of them have spoken with you and no
one from the police said that they gave
you an official statement so I'm
wondering you give a statement for the
police you haven't spoken with anyone
over there who would actually be
involved with the investigation
Chris what's the truth here ma'am
fallout we did this answer the video
last Thursday people watched it I think
let me ask you this question of the day
beforehand okay many of you are new
conservatives I want to know where you
always aware of the implicit media bias
and how severe it was or do you think
it's only gotten worse recently I've
heard this or do you think it's always
been this bad and it's just harder to
hide with new media looking at a comment
below because we've been running into
this now the video that we released
where we went undercover to antiphon by
the way not gay Jerrod shirt is on sale
in honor of him brass balls we
appreciate it over 12 million plays
across YouTube and Facebook multiple
attempts by the remove the video with no
responses directly from YouTube so keep
this in mind both people who committed
criminal acts admitting to it on camera
and then public interviewees like Lex
Scott who said she was one who said that
Ben Shapiro most dangerous man in the
world but it's a violation of her
privacy to show her interview to show
really very publicly yes so this is
what's been going there been many many
attempts behind the scenes to get this
removed thank God for a lawyer bill
Richman Fox 13 local in Utah ran this
story okay should be noted Fox 13 is the
place that passed on the story what we
were showing of the footage next to the
police so they have a little bit of an
axe to grind and they ran this story
with the University of Utah spokesperson
Chris Nelson who basically said that
according to the police who reviewed our
footage there was no credible threat by
the way later on that very same article
they talked about how a court document
should note that one of the girls in the
video was arrested yeah that's a
footnote yeah it's just headline bias at
that point it could have just read large
crowd or insult Ransa
arrests made but it didn't so first off
we actually trying to get a hold of
Chris Nelson we left a voicemail
from looking for answers we'll see if he
calls us back he agrees Chris Nelson
please leave a message and I'll return
your call at the tone please record your
message when you've finished recording
you may hang up or press one for more
options hi this message is for mr. Chris
Nelson this is Roman Monson calling from
a dalit at Dallas Herald online I'm
calling a because I'd like to clarify
some some information surrounding a
recent video that went I guess viral
online regarding an tyfa on your campus
and any subsequent arrest thereof or
what false information is out there of
course as you know with anyone with a
blog in youtube can release anything
nowadays so it would be a tremendous
help if you could call me back at it'll
only take a few moments of your time
that's a roman months and at the Dallas
Herald I look forward to speaking with
you take care we'll see if he calls back
later in this segment it's almost like
what the magic of editing we've already
called him oh so a couple of things
people need to understand why does this
matter
we've decided I bet this happened in
Lansing Michigan you've heard me talk
about this where the the unions
committed more crimes and you could
watch in a lifetime and of course there
was media sponsor a couple of lives from
local media that then get picked up by
national media local media is a it's
it's the farm team but a lot of national
media they don't send out their
reporters they don't have the resources
so they rely on their local affiliates
to give them the stories on the ground
and they often rely on local community
resources specifically colleges their
spokespeople so it's this never-ending
vicious cycle of Lies yeah that people
need to understand careful journalists
so there can be a lie in the local Fox
13 and then all of a sudden that can be
so we've decided at any time there's a
lie on this story we're gonna drop them
a web we're not gonna let it go so you
can try it if you want but this is an
argument from truth so what happened
specifically before we get to the phone
call with mr. Chris Nelson there were
several ants for members okay who were
on our video one actually went through
with an attack her alias was honeybee
okay so you can see her being arrested
and she changed her cover photo to
honeybee okay what did we do with this
video a lot of people didn't realize
this wasn't clear we coordinated tactics
in person we got footage of honeybees
weapons before anything happened and
handed it over immediately to the
and you can see in the footage her
handing a knife to Jared and in the
footage a pink taser on this person
honey bee who was arrested we handed
over the police you should tell them
that's not good here I head over to the
police mmm who thought it was such a
critical threat and valid threat that
they directly took me to special aiders
day out on the ground special agents
from the FBI exactly so let's be clear
that by the way people from the FBI who
won't necessarily be available for
comment just so you cannot know behind
the scenes but we'll give you too much
information we can so she's arrested why
because honey bee used a Taser on
another person at the rally she used
that pink taser
okay she's now facing felony charges for
aggravated assault so how do the media
and the University of Utah try well they
try to downplay it Chris Nelson the U of
you spokesperson he tried to do damage
control with a local news so he tried to
say well actually we were in reviewing
the police reviewed the footage there
was no credible threat here and actually
even been Shapiro
he thought this was true that the police
said this if you read the story there's
no author no byline and there's no
source from any one of the police let
alone any Federal Bureau it would of
course be involved in investigating a
group that has been classified
officially as a domestic terrorist
organization so if you read the article
doesn't say anything like that we'll ask
him about that when we call them so
let's get to some of the inaccuracies
here Chris Nelson refers to a
pocketknife in the article he says well
you can't arrest someone for a
pocketknife oh gee Chris we know that in
fact the weapon used was in a
pocketknife that was what she is handing
out among ice picks it was a Taser yeah
an aunt if I said they had shotguns in
their car assault rifles ak-47s this was
the same station again keep in mind that
turned down the story of all of this
footage journalism yeah so it comes down
to this who is Chris Nelson because he
is the only source here saying police
reviewed footage whose police apparently
Christmas is the only person and does he
have an axe to grind this is important
because this gets picked up by national
news from one source with no reference
or byline okay so obviously he's a
University of Utah spokesperson we know
that wants to minimize any bad
collateral damage something you may not
know he's a confirmed far far left
progressive let me show you he in turn
for the Clinton White House
he's a delicate for Utah Democrat
convention Tita Democrats their
convention he issued anti-trump
statements on behalf of the university
by the way so public say when he
recently made on behalf against Donald
Trump's potential ending of daca saying
he's deeply troubled by pegan X decision
so you may think oh he's just a
classical liberal mmm the spokesperson
for University of Utah the only source
of reference for this article by the way
since we left that voicemail yeah
underground twenty rounds drive is gone
completely protected wasn't that way two
hours ago Wow he's tweeted about white
privilege microaggressions and just a
few weeks ago he tweeted directly an
article that mentioned ben shapiro
and i didn't believe in white privilege
and how it actually exists you know who
they cite the other they say peggy
mcintosh does that name ring a bell
she's the author of the white privilege
test that we took last week that absurd
was terrible test so this is the
university of utah spokesperson this is
the only source listed when people send
me this email i said well what do you
think about people saying there's no
credible credible threat in the footage
this is the only place it comes from
nowhere else keep in mind that somebody
was arrested who was caught in our
footage and again nakiye has been
communicating directly with federal
investigations we've been as compliant
as humanly possible and here's the
problem with media and again the way the
system works the people who have no
respect for an ongoing investigation
that people have no respect for those in
the front lines who are actually their
safety is at risk so they cannot reveal
a ton of information these are the
people who just release information with
no sources or byline or they just make
it up whereas people who are beholding
the truth saying you know what we really
don't want to step on the toes of some
feds out there yeah we really don't want
it we really don't want to make anyone
look bad or hurt anybody's investigation
usually remain silent but and our
twitter profiles are still set the
public our profiles are still set to
public so this is chris nelson and we
want to get to the bottom of it so not
really a prank call but we decided to
call them hello Roman Munson hey how are
you Oh mr. Nelson I'm doing well how are
you sir well that was quick I appreciate
you calling you back so quickly so
sometimes it's
sure sometimes it's a waiting game
listen I was just calling I hope I
didn't catch you to bedtime - to clarify
some information surrounding this I have
you you you've no doubt seen this
undercover ant a video that occurred on
your case right I just see that well
yeah from the I forget what his name is
the guys who produced it but yeah I've
seen it this okay no since you work
there on campus I was just questioning
first off how do you feel about its
authenticity you know I'm not sure we
have a university any position on it you
know I know that the gentleman and I'm
blanking on his name I know right I
don't they you know he was there you
know our police he chatted with our
police officers do you mean the man the
man who made the video is that yes oh
steven crowder i have it right in front
of me yeah yeah yeah yeah yes yeah so so
you know in terms of him being there you
know he was certainly there in terms of
the authenticity of that content I don't
think we have a position on it I would
tell you just in the university's
perspective we enforced a no visible
weapons policy you know mask policy it
was for most intensive purposes a really
nonviolent protest issue decided we have
to arrest sure three other people
detained there was not a host of
knighting on campus that night right you
know I would sit there were two arises
from what I understand two arrests okay
and do you know where any of the people
included in that footage arrested are
they included among those arrested so so
I would have to I'd have to go back to
just let you make your own determination
on that yeah again from my perspective
and looking at the woman who was
arrested and taken to jail it looks a
lot like the person he was talking to
but he and I think that III don't have
any way of validating certainly or
anything sir I don't want to put you on
the spot or or have you speak out of
turn I know
you mention that you spoke with the the
police department in a local article
with with Fox 13 could you give me the
name of the person there the contact who
said there was no credible threat that
Fox are at the police who issued the
statement yeah so I was speaking on
behalf of the police I was beginning be
happy to cease Police Department so our
our chief is is the police of chief of
police and so again you know I think so
it's may there was the one who said
there was no credible threat from the
from the footage correct correct correct
okay
and and again I think the incidents of
the night hold up to that I mean I think
there was there was a very visible
police president there was a very
significant police presence behind the
scenes as well and I think that any
incidents of violence that popped up you
know are sure we're very good to kind of
intervene before so surely I you know I
think if there had been a credible
threat they would have reacted and like
possibly arrested somebody yeah sure
let me ask two more questions I know
you're I know you're busy I'm sure
especially after this you're probably
getting inundated with calls I
appreciate you taking the time let me
ask you I know as someone who's
obviously been very public about your
more progressive views do you worry at
all that with the video evidence you
know you see this on some right wing
blogs that your statements might be
taken they're taking them just as damage
control have you seen any blowback there
and how do you best manage that
interesting question
you know the University's position is
you know we have to balance these and
values that the university has a
free-speech of equity and diversity
respect and none of these are more
important than the other so I really
didn't have to balance them so you know
on our universities on campus you know
the night of not illegal to have a
pocket knife in your pockets you know
even state law allows people in Utah
even on our campus to have concealed
weapons if they have a concealed weapon
permit so sure on you know any visible
weapons that night and in general I mean
if you walk across campus
with with a with a rifle you're gonna
get stopped by police pretty quickly if
you walk across campus with a Oh
certainly yeah I know you have these
open carry activists who just walk
around with their assault rifles it's
there it's very it's very unnerving and
unnecessary but sorry I have a dog here
in the in the office with me I apologize
he hears about the assault rifles and
gets riled up yeah what I would say is I
you know I again I'm representing
University I would say we have people
who are very passionate you are very who
were very passionate about us making
sure we allowed this we had people who
are very very passionate demanding that
we cancel this event and so sure again I
think is from the university's
perspective it's trying to balance these
needs and again I remember a free-speech
perspective we are we're unless there's
a very credible threat of violence
against the speaker or the speaker sure
themselves is trying to incite a crowd
to violence you know we are we're gonna
mostly hold two we were always gonna try
to hold to this idea of hosting and
again you know as I've said in the media
reports yeah yeah you know every week
we've got interesting speakers on this
campus it's you know mr. Shapiro
certainly had a lot of attention sure
and I know you're not a huge fan of his
personally you know I you know I know
you're not huge yeah I know I believe me
I know you can't necessarily speak of
that but I've uh I've combed through the
the social media and Twitter as well I'm
tracking with you I understand this
can't be official from the University
final question here I know you mentioned
obviously anyone can have pocket knives
on campus you know but the fact that
this lady who was later arrested Jenna
Martin was on video handing out weapons
and had a Taser and she did use it for
the assault later on and was arrested
have you had any communication or
reached out to anyone with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation or anyone who
might be involved with actually
investigating an tyfa has there been any
reach out to them I would I would
definitely say our Police Department
have been in contact with all sorts of
police agencies including federal law
enforcement I don't think I'd be in a
position to confirm anything more than
that but sure
yes I would say in advance of this and
even afterwards I know I know the chief
and his team have been reaching out to
sure to a variety of resources well the
reason I ask is because you spoke on
behalf of the police and you know
everyone we know at the FBI
none of them have spoken with you and no
one from the police said that they gave
you an official statement so I'm
wondering you give a statement for the
police you haven't spoken with anyone
over there who would actually be
involved as the investigation Chris
what's the truth here man the
investigation into what exactly in
anti-fur the arrests the people who
would be actually involved with national
security measures none of them have
heard from you haven't reached out to
any of them
oh no one from the police department or
the FBI so I'm wondering who made the
statement it seems as though it's you
speaking on behalf of the police which
seemed at the very least misleading
especially would consider it would seem
to be a conflict of interest given you
being a delegate to the Utah Democrat
state convention your track record
seemed as though there might be some
conflicts of interest here and nobody
knows you nobody spoke with you mm-hmm
well we don't investigate tithi as the
University our goal and our Police
Department's goal that night where I can
prevent violence on campus we don't have
a position on Teva you know anyone in a
position jiva position I'm speaking for
the police when they didn't in fact give
you those statements or the FBI
do you've a position on that I don't
think I have spoken on behalf of the
police in said they had based on
evidence they had I didn't see a
credible threat no again I think the
event itself because of that you know I
think the event was a non-violent event
except for a couple of arrests and a
couple of interventions but the arrests
stemmed directly from footage and
information that couldn't have otherwise
been known outside of that footage like
code names and their weapons and their
motive and what they planned on doing
do you not find it curious that the
person who was arrested was a person who
was caught on camera handing out weapons
with a Taser expressing motive and that
coinciding with the fact that no one
officially outside of yourself issuing a
statement would seem at the very least
intellectually irresponsible if not
dishonest to allow that to go out to the
press
