Figured that I would share this shower thought here I've been playing with about the beginnings of religion.

So here's the basic jist of my theory, and it starts out back when man was still struggling as hunter/gatherers and before the domestication of dogs and other animals. These ancient people's roamed around in packs following behind herds of whatever large prey animals were native to the area in order to obtain their food. You know what other animals followed behind these same herds of large prey? Yep, wolves.

The wolves, being large opportunistic predators of course would occasionally pick off a person or two when it was the easiest meal. Humans being pretty intelligent realized this, and to keep their camps from being attacked at night while they slept and we're most vulnerable, they started leaving whatever meat that they could spare on the outer edges of their camps to subdue the beasts so they could rest.

This goes on and on over many generations. Slowly the wolves and humans relationship grew to the point that the wolves became domesticated, and the humans now kept the wolves in camp to serve as protection. Humans being creatures of habit however kept on putting food out at night because it had been inscribed into their brains over many generations that the only way that you can be safe to sleep at night is if you leave food out to appease the beasts of the dark.

Many many more generations pass and the original context of why they did this faded. In order to justify these actions people start making up their own stories of why they do it, because "well my dad taught me to do it, and his dad taught him" wasn't good enough. And so they made up stories of the "angry gods" that would come and kill them if they didn't leave food and drink for them at an altar every night. Setting the stage for people in power to realize that they could use these stories in order to scare and manipulate people to do what they want and turn into what religion has become today.Who is everybody‚Äôs top 5 guests of all time? When you respond with your top 5, please provide a little explanation to your choices as there are so many reasons we might find people the ‚Äúbest‚Äù.

As an example, you might choose Uncle Joey for his material he brings to the podcast or the sheer amount of times he‚Äôs been on.

Or, Steven Tyler and Mel Gibson, due to their ‚Äústar‚Äù status. (Don‚Äôt worry, they aren‚Äôt in my top 5.)

I just want to get an idea of who everybody feels is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù guest.You're the problem. Give it a fucking rest. His close friend died because of a fucking drunk driver. No one cares how much you love your dog, stop making this about your own stupid fucking dogs.I just realized...she thought that Valerie Jarrett was Jewish!   Like those people haven't faced any historical dehumanization...more recently than African Americans.   The world of political commentators consists solely of individuals who have clinged on to a predefined ideology, are attempting to create a business, and those who only see the world's issues as black and white. 


I want to puke in my mouth when internet fuckbois paint the narrative that people like Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens are "intelligent" and should drive political attitudes. What the fuck does Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens know about complex issues like climate change,...jack shit! Yet they have strong opinions because it's what their team believes. It's one thing to have biases and another to deny facts and be so sure of your stupidity in the process. The equivalent could be found on the left too.


I can't think of a single moderate, rational political commentator out there. If anyone knows one let me know.I made this into a medium/steemit article.

Please save and share!On one of his recent podcasts, Joe was talking about how dumb it is that so many beneficial products are illegal to purchase in many countries.

Of course weed was mentioned, but he also brought up some sort of **cream that can be used to treat bodily pains**? I can't remember the name of it or the podcast it was from (although I am sure the guest was a dude, *maybe Steven Tyler*).

Anyway, if one of you guys remember, I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me the name. Thanks!We've previously asked that people stop using the "report" functionality as a "I don't like this content, remove it from the sub" system.

With the political guests becoming a more common thing on the sub, the abuse of the reporting system has escalated.

Reporting content doesn't train a spam filter of any kind.  Reports go to mods, who have to review and approve or remove content.  I don't think we've received a legitimate report in at least 12 months, probably closer to 24.  I think someone posted some pirated content a few years ago.

Be forewarned, we've started forwarding every fraudulent report to admins.  I believe the response from them is to start banning accounts from reddit, but I'm not positive.

If you dislike content being posted by another user, you have a few options:

* downvote it and move on
* ignore the user via RES
* block the user via https://www.reddit.com/prefs/blocked/It looks really nice but super expensive, is there like a cheap chinese knockoff?

What happened to Joe's blog? I used to read a blog post titled, "Where the fuck have you been?" Wondering if anyone has a link to this blog post or maybe a screen shot? It was inspirational. They had mentioned in the previous fight companion last Sunday, that they were going to do a fight companion tonight. Anybody have any idea if that‚Äôs still happening tonight?What animal was Joe talking about that is like a bear but smaller and lives in trees. It was from a podcast earlier this year and I thought he was talking about a bearcat but they're in Asia and I could've sworn he mentioned somewhere in south/central AmericaThis Sub Reddit gives the best opinion on Human Optimization and High level problem solving.

**Have you guys tried the "Neuro" drinks** that you could buy at most Gas Stations?

I'm specifically **talking about the Blue, Stress one** , has anyone had like a stage 5 panic attack get eased by this? Or is this more for helping create a calm environment? 

I've never felt much from the stress one, I think.

However, **the Sleep one has melotonin, And Melotonin fucking works.** I tried the orange sleep Neuro a few nights ago and I slept 11 hours ( I usually get 6-7 ).

I believe they have a **Red, Energy one. Idk how that works compared to a monster.** I rather go monster, and have. Never tried the energy.Thinking about organizing a group to get a private tour like he was talking about on the podcast. Figure we would need like 10\-15. Would anyone be down?Sounds like Doug Stanhope but I don't think they have actual issues.I've never watched the fight companions but I'm looking to get into it. Is there any way to tell when one will be on?ü§î I'll photoshop anything you want related to Joe Rogan, just give me a description of what you want or pictures you want me to use and I'll look into it. 

TRY IT OUT. Can you really believe in .orgs?Think it would be an interesting podcast. I really like that woman. Anyone had that idea before?I know you can find his tour dates but like the random comedy clubs he hits. I'm in the LA area for a few days and wanna see if I can catch him, Joey Diaz, Tom segura, Bill Burr, Theo Von, or any of the JRE regular crew. Any idea where I can find out Like woodworking, glassblowing, or blacksmithing. It would be sweet to see what kind of shop he could make and see his progression as he as all the best people help teach him to get better.Joe has been a big advocate for bare-knuckle fighting, so it's cool to see this show happening in America. Out of eight fights, seven have ended in finishes. Bec Rawlings just won her fight by doctor stoppage, and Ricco Rodriguez is about to fight in the main event.Found this episode super fascinating if you guys know of any other wildlife biologists or similar Joe has had on can you please let me know. Thanks!I was listening to a fantastic podcast recently, and now I cannot remember or find it, can you help me?

The guest was male and was into his fitness aids and trying to find the optimum performance of his body. He was using aids such as pressure boots and taking many different supplements and followed strict protocols in his diet and nutritional supplements. At one point he was pointing out that he has a live\-in maid etc. [Sappywritinginc ](https://www.sappywritinginc.com)

The podcast is called Doe &amp; Elk Productions; me and my girl talk about cool stuff and with other. The first epsiode was a fucking mess; my buddies came over and got drunk while we did it. The second and third are much better!! Better every day, right?I've been following JRE for 3 or 4 years now, and decided to subscribe to the subreddit not long after. It's been recently that this sub has gone completely toxic, pretty much consisting only of complaints about guests, quality of shows, etc. 

I agree, the quality of shows has started to decline, the Howard Bloom seemed to epitomize this, but after doing a podcast for 8 years, you can only beat a subject so far into the ground before its just completely dust, which seems to be what the users of this sub continue to ask for (conspiracy theories, etc.). 

I would like to see more comedians as well, but understand that after appearing on JRE, many comedians have gained substantial popularity, like Duncan Trussell and Theo Von, and have subsequently started their own podcast.

After a recent episode with a popular guest, Jordan Peterson, users were barred from discussing anything relating to Jordan Peterson, which is the exact antithesis of what JRE continues to preach, free and open dialogue. 

The JRE is Joe's show, where he talks about things that interest him and his interests are obviously broad, which works because he has a broad audience. People complain about episodes as if they are supposed to be tailored to them, or a specific group of people. Joe will have on a hunter, a dietician, and a geologist in the same week, appealing to 3 different crowds, or specific peoples. I will admit, I'm not the biggest fan of hunting podcasts, aside from the conservation discussions with Cameron Hanes, yet I don't complain about it, because its Joe's show, and some people do enjoy the hunting pods, explaining why he continues to do them. Just skip that episode and realize there may be another episode that will provide more interest to you later that week, or even later that day. 

Joe puts out nearly 10-15 hours of content a week, surely you can find some entertainment in that, and if not, there are plenty of other podcasts out there that can substantiate your thirst for fucking conspiracy theories.

Stay frosty young bucks.

Edit: To clarify: I am not asking for positivity and only decent remarks about the show, I want to encourage open discourse and debate, which I figured this sub would be more about. I should have been more clear in my original post. 

Edit 2: This is my exact mindset on how to improve dynamics of this sub, to promote dialogue between users who enjoyed their respective episodes. It would provide for much greater content in my opinion. If saying an episode sucks, give your opinion why, don‚Äôt complain that it‚Äôs another hunting podcast, because some people look forward to them, instead wait two fuckin‚Äô days and see if you like the next guest. Also, not at all bitching about the memes. plz keep making these fuckin eddie memes. Anyone else disappointed? For all his talk over the years. For all the speculating, and he doesn't even give it some attention.Makes it just feel so good.I'm sure Joe has had a lot of democrats on (like Sam Harris), as well as republicans (like Ben Shapiro). Also he has had on 'alt right' or very conservative people (like Candace Owens who works for Turning Point USA which is anti "leftist propaganda")

Has Joe had on people that are to the left what TPUSA is to the right?

Thanks.Love both these guys so much and the two completely different mindsets made for a great podcast. Activated by saying "Pull that shit up Young Jamie"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUgPHPIvO5E[Ari on HuffPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-aB-cwZucA)Most boring sport ever like what the fuck. And it promotes sneaker culture, which I think anyone who's into sneakers that much needs to be boiled to deathThis is probably my 3rd time listening to episode 911 and sweet baby Jesus it is the most entertaining shit. Is it still the most viewed/listened to JRE? Love to see Alex back with Theo or Burr, drawl for shureThere was one of those phony interviews made from out of context clips. They edited it to have Rogan liking hookers and hunting the homeless? I‚Äôve exhausted my Googlefu and my YouTubefu. I come to you hat in hand. Joe has asked people like Duncan and Redban if they will do a Quake LAN party, all have agreed. Wheres it at JOE?! I wanna see them stream it!

"Where you at ~~George~~ ^**quake** ?"Did Joe ever put that fire pit in his new studio? He mentioned it in the beginning of episode #911.Id much rather listen to shills and quacks than the conversational flow being interupted. But really, Joe  got this thing right. Near the end of their latest podcast they mention that Tom will be the next weeks guest, and Bert was also an option. Does this mean that the two podcast universes will collide? Does Joe even know about H3H3? Would be awesome to see them on eachothers podcastsAnd no, it's not Fritz Haber you fucks. In this video you see them but I can't identify any specific breeds. Anybody better at identifying or has he ever talked about it? https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgp151mnyEH/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1u59wff471b14I keep reading mis-informed stuff from Covington.

Just wondering if Joe has deigned to reply?Running 100 miles doesn't pay you a goddamn thing other than the wealth of the knowledge that you can push yourself to the extreme or anything else. Whether its someone that becomes really good at playing chess or someone who is good at martial arts or whatever it is. There is a great feeling in overcoming these difficult things because life is never just this constant state of "I'm at a 9 all day and when I am with my wife, I hit 10! YAY! And I stay like that." That's not real. What's real is when you push through things like feeling angst &amp; being alone &amp; not having things. But when you come out of it, and you've had these uncomfortable feelings and you get this reward. You push through this, you came out of those uncomfortable feelings with newfound appreciation for Time. This respect for your own existence, carving out your own space, that's where it all comes from. It comes from life lessons and the lessons that are learned through struggle. The human organism, the animal that we are, needs constant stimulation because it evolved trying to find food, and escape enemies, and find shelter, to escape nature, escape the elements, all to survive. And there is this great joy you have in taking care of your children, than you can protect them from the enemies &amp; elements and feed them. And its also the great sadness you see in losers. When I see a loser, I see some guy who's 43 years old living in his parents basement and he hates the fucking world. I'm like, that was a baby! A baby that somebody just gave shitty nutrients to. Whether that is nutrients in the form of food or nutrients in the form of thoughts &amp; ideas &amp; examples. And this kid developed horrible, self\-defeating patterns of behavior that has led them to this point. Probably never will escape it and might just wind up sucking on a gun. That is the world we live in today and I think it's because we have been fed this line of horseshit that your supposed to seek comfort. I don't think you are, I think you're supposed to seek lessons and you're supposed to seek difficult tasks &amp; accomplishments, by doing things that are hard to do. Sometimes those last 20 mins I don't want to be there man, I definitely don't want to give it 100&amp;#37;, I think I can cheat, kinda half\-ass it. But if I don't and I get through that struggle, I WILL have a better day. I better do it again tomorrow or something else because if I just think "well tomorrow I'm just gonna coast &amp; eat Twinkies &amp; watch TV, OH HELLO SADNESS MY OLD FRIEND, HELLO DEPRESSION" because when you're not doing anything, it makes you feel like shit. That is just part of being a Human Being. We can pretend we are something other than what we are, we can pretend "not me man, I'm cool, just chillin' doin' nothing" BULLSHIT. You're a fucking human being. You evolved from 100's of 1000's of years of hunters &amp; gatherers and people that were struggling. Those human reward systems were carved deeply into your DNA. And if you don't respect that, if you don't respect the mechanism of happiness &amp; fulfillment &amp; the things you really need to do to survive, in order to feel satisfied in your life. Comradery, Love, Family, Friendship, Struggle, Testing Yourself, Learning. All those things are imperative, they are all a giant part of being a person.In the interest of introducing friends to the show, of which I have about a 50% success rate, I've assembled this starter pack on YouTube. 

Curious to hear some feedback. Who should be in the playlist and shouldn't be. 

But keep in mind the goal: getting people hooked on unique, informative and insightful podcast conversations.

Note: some of these are guests I don't particularly agree with on a lot of things (cough abby), but who I still think have something important to contribute. 

Some notable people included are Sam, Shane, Gavin, and Louis Theroux.

Sorry if this is a common question here, but I'm just genuinely confused about this. Why does Joe allow young Jamie to keep his life? He never scrolls to the right sections, he never knows which way to scroll, he always clicks the wrong picture, I mean DAMN, you know? It's just what in the fuck? 

We all know George Rogan is a huge gun fan, so I'm sure he doesn't usually let people that cause these kinds of problems live in his spare time. I don't understand why John hasn't used some sort of bow and arrow, or rifle, or firearm, or even some sort of sword or crossbow on Jamie yet. 

Does anyone know why this is? Thanks I'm so confused. Motherfucker's Instagram got me hungry for expensive meat with too many jalapenos and custom knives.Help would be greatly appreciatedlearned a few things [since my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/8ocori/what_prominent_leftists_has_joe_had_on/). Steven Pinker was recommended there, and I realized I was more interested in hearing Joe's discussion on anti-capitalism.

first ones I can think of would be Abby Martin and Peter Joseph. Russell brand probably as well. Any others?


Thanks.It would be less cringey if Joe sat in silence when a guest made an unfunny joke rather than doing that terrible fake laugh he does.

‚Äúaaaahhhh‚ÄùEpisode #1127 with Jesse Itzler just hit me hard. I‚Äôm listening here at work and he starts talking about time, and a new perspective of it. He talks about his parents living in Florida and how, hypothetically, if they live 5 more years that he doesn‚Äôt have 5 more years with them. He sees them twice a year...that‚Äôs 10 more visits. That‚Äôs it.

My grandparents are in their mid 80s. I see them once a year. Thinking about roughly only 10 more times seeing them got me teary eyed here at work yo!

I gotta change thisI love the JRE podcast, and have only become interested in MMA through listening to Joe‚Äôs interviews with people in that world. I feel like I am missing a ton of basic information about fighting, but it seems like a major problem with the current MMA world is judging. Why not eliminate decisions and judges altogether and just let the fighters fight until someone actually wins? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just uneducated about this sport and there is an obvious reason for the 3 or 5 round structure. I'm a big Joe Rogan fan. Ever since fear factor and the early days of the ufc. Joe says he doesnt read comments on youtube nor instagram. He also disables comments on his youtube potcasts. So..My question is,  WTF is he doing?

Why do all this damn potcasts back to back some times 9 hours talking to random folks about different thinks and snapping at certain people while being very humble at others? Did Yung Jamie get reprimanded for changing the camera to him when he talks. He never used to do it before but started doing it heavily during the fight companion with Shwabby and Eddie Bravo debacle. I noticed he started doing it more on the next couple episodes. 

That all has stopped. Did Joe lay down his cannoli on Jamie and tell him to cut it out. 

I'm not saying Jamie got punked, I'm just saying look into it - Eddie bravo I'm not at all telling anyone to stop smoking, but if you think it might be fucking with you might wanna try cutting back for a bit.   


 I was doing all of the right things otherwise (Exercise, therapist, good nutrition, yoga, meditation, Sauana, Sulforaphane) and so far my best 2 days of my depression/mood in the past 2 or so years have come on these two days of not smoking, the days otherwise were totally unremarkable, nothing significant good or bad happening.   
Didn‚Äôt Joe film his Netflix Special in Boston, like months ago? Any idea when it‚Äôs supposed to be out? I‚Äôve tried Googling it, but admittedly I‚Äôm fresh out of Alpha Brain and/or I don‚Äôt have Young Jamie at my disposal, so I came back empty handed. Powerful Reddit, do you have the answer?Jesus christ the guy is good. He's on top of everything they say, Rogan doesn't even have to ask anymore that Jamie has already googled it really deep and finds anything they might be talking about.

And he also has pretty smart stuff to add everytime he talks. I almost felt him wanting to basically knee Eddie Bravo in the face when he got deep into the conspiracy shit on that one podcast.


Young Jamie if you ever read this, I appreciate the shit outta you man. Mad respect, the podcast is way better because of youSo far I listen to the popular ones here and there, but I enjoy most of his episodes, subjects I wouldn‚Äôt even think about. I wanna start from an episode and just listen in order instead of jumping around. Where would be a good point to start from, I heard that in the early days he mainly used bring on celebs but I wanna listen from when he start bringing on interesting people. Any suggestions on what year or episode he started doing that? Thanks.Says it was rogangod who put it together Ate an edible it was super strong. I think im going to get in trouble.Just wondering if there have been any guests on the podcast talking about dogs and our long relationship with them. It would be a cool podcast.Looking for a pair of tickets.  Thought I'd give the sub a shot.Listening to some of the older episodes. He brings up how hes writing a book in a fuck ton of episodes. Anyone know why it never came out? Like the title says, I adore both of these guys, I admire them both a lot, and I love listening to what they have to say on the vast majority of topics. But [here](https://youtu.be/nFYvmTWHhnc?t=25) it's just so crass and absurd how they use the suicide of Chris Cornell as an opportunity to mutually masturbate about how un-suicidal they both are. It would be understandable if they'd both just clarified before discussing it that they haven't experienced suicidal thoughts as a kind of disclaimer to acknowledge that they're about to talk about something they have no personal experience of, and that probably was their original intent. However, it very quickly just degrades into both of them stroking their own egos while they humblebrag about how mentally healthy they are. 

Though I'm relatively sure that both of them are in pretty good places in their life, the fact that they feel the need to repeat "I've just never ever had suicidal thoughts" "Yeah me neither, I can't even understand how that would happen" "Yeah same here, I can't even begin to comprehend it even as an abstract concept because it's just so far from something I would ever do" "Same here, I actually don't even physically comprehend the meaning of the word because it's just a concept that is so alien and distant to me" and this process repeats for several cringey minutes until they mercifully change the topic. They then go on to actually have a really fantastic podcast, it's just a shame about that beginning.

From what I‚Äôve heard on the Pod it has some pretty awesome stuff, Archery rand, Gym, Floatation tanks? Its days like these

that you wake up and find out anthony bourdain died

and the sky outside is grey and the wind pushes past your cheeks

and you drink your coffee out on the porch

you regret not saying hi to him

that one time you saw him on 27th street, leaving renzos

with long strides, impossibly tall

like the patterson\-gimlin footage

Its days like these

the laughter feels far away

thunder booms in the distance over the tops of the buildings

you get dressed for work

its days like these

when the man you wanted to be when you were old

kills himself in a paris hotel room

suddenly you can see it, in the pictures people post of him

the pain around his eyes,  looked like laugh\-lines before

he had an 11 year old daughter, a beautiful italian girlfriend

with tattoos down to her wrists

you wonder how he did it

you dont wonder why because we all know

the quiet desperation men carry

around with them like a squalling infant

Its days like theseI originally heard about Tom through joes podcast, and have loved him since. Seeing him live was absolutely crazy and the energy in the room was insane. It was like volcanic eruptions of laughter. Would recommend. Lsitening to the first Theo Von podcast and Joe mentioned out Joey Diaz found his mom dead while he was tripping on acid.   Was this story discussed on any of his episodes with Joe and if so does anyone know which one?

Thanks Thread is to post daily challenges to ourselves to push the limits of our mind.  

I‚Äôm going to start with do 100 push-ups, doesn‚Äôt have to be in a row. 

Disclaimer: please don‚Äôt jump in any freezing bodies of water. Look into it.I started listening to this bald monkey ramble back in September. Many times i have heard "pull that shit up, jamie", "high level problem solving with dire physical consequences", "you fuck", "that chimp weighs what? 400 pounds? Jesus those will fuck you up", and "thats O-N-N-I-T dot com, keyword Rogan", and so on.

After a while I started to REALLY miss my days of practicing Judo and wrestling, missing the great body high both gave me after a tough workout, but I was a bit intimidated about walking into a dojo and starting martial arts again. But I did it, and for the past couple of months I've been practicing BJJ and Muay Thai, and I AM SO GLAD I took that leap, i feel more flexible, stronger, and more confident in the way my body moves.

And I have Joe mothafuckin Rogan to thank for repeating it over and over about how good it is to do such a physical activity. 

Thanks, Joe, maybe one day we can do DMT in a float tank while on AlphaBrain so we can really zone in and focus on our trip, you fuck.Hey im looking for inspiring or motivation podcasts with inspiring people Last night he called Anthony B. a pussy for committing suicide, leaving behind a thirteen year old son. From my understanding him and Joe have a pretty good relationship but I can‚Äôt see that anymore after ignorant comments like that. 

What a prick. No Joe.  What you are describing is what an engineer does when he's designing a bridge or what an airline pilot does every day.  Not what two ape/men with nothing better to do with their brains involve themselves with for the entertainment of similarly stupid people.Can anyone tell me what the name of the cuban mens gang that would wear all white that joey diaz talks about?Joe Rogan at Ufc 225 https://imgur.com/gallery/YoZVgZAJoe Rogan after a spinning backfist from Yoel Romero.During the UFC 225 broadcast last night, Rogan commented on the bizarre behavior exhibited by Mike Jackson.

At many points during the fight, Jackson could have easily gone for the finish. Perhaps two easily placed strikes on the basically defenseless Punk would have sufficed. Instead, he chose to look off into the distance and casually grapple, or jab CM Punk's mid\-section.

At one point Rogan remarks (something to the effect) that if he was to be conspiratorial about it, he'd guess that Mike Jackson was stalling in order to get paid out for some kind of gambling result where he wins by Unanimous Decision.

Someone call Eddie Bravo...we've found something for him to Look Into...I think it would make an amazing podcast if Rogan brought an SJW onto the podcast. The guest doesn't have to be all that famous or well known, but if they are willing to debate over various SJW taking points with Rogan or even another guest, it would make a great listen.Anybody else?I cant remember which podcast it was where he went into detail describing despicable me 3 in detail. About shrooms I think. Not the Nick Swardson one. Can anyone help?I recall him saying he rubbed cream on his legs, but can‚Äôt find the podcast. Also what brand would be useful in my research to deal with my own pain.Just saying. Hey guys I wanted to build a list of some of the best episodes that have taught you something or that you found to be educational. My friend laughed off JRE when I recommended it to him as a podcast that can educate you on something you might not know about and referenced the podcasts with [Sapolsky] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmt_PkIfBE) and [Walker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T07P-PkuyU

28:55All those pictures of marshall just make me so fucking happy, but i dont really want to see anything else from joe on instagram or whatever. Anyone got the hookup? :-) For a self proclaimed optimist, Joe seems to have been pretty negative and down in the last few pods, it showed especially on the episode with the sultan of sourdough Prof. Papa. Papa was clearly leading the conversation in a generally more positive, chill direction and Joe seemed to be stuck in a rut and borderline obsessive on downer topics, rehashing SJW topics, etc.
Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I hope Joe doesn‚Äôt get sucked into being a cynic by how wacky people and society as a whole can be.This popped up on my youtube account and Im blown away at what a scumbag cokehead he comes across as. Bitching about his child hood and calling Anthony Bourdain a faggot. Hope he strings him\-self up when the coke run's out.. No need for this stuff when the reasons behind his suicide havent even come outIn recent episodes, Joe has discussed both topics. When talking to Candice Owens about climate change he admits he's a dummy on the topic and will listen to the 'vast majority on the scientists' on this issue. However, when it comes to the Sphinx stuff with Schoch and Graham Hancock, he seems to just completely accept their evidence despite the vast majority of Egyptologists disagreeing with their view. 

I enjoy the discussion on both the topics, and can imagine what Hancock etc would say (Majority hold ingrained views, unwillingness to admit wrong, adversarial etc.) but still think it's funny that Joe just accepts the majority re climate change. Especially when he poorly recounts the Older Sphinx theory to Tom Papa and sounds absolutely mental. 

To clarify, I am a complete believer of climate change. I guess I just would've thought Joe would be more of a denier. Maybe it's simply that there's no climate change deniers that have intriguing and interesting evidence. Maybe if a denier smoked joints and interspersed their research with random Ayuhasca experiments Joe would be way more on board with climate change deniers. 

Thoughts?I'm trying to get me and my girl tickets for her birthday for the comedy chaos show at the comedy store tonight in Hollywood (June 12) but it's listed as sold out.

I've tried looking at StubHub does anybody know any other sites to check?

I also called and they said that we could go early and try to get in from the standby line has anyone ever done that before and know what kind of odds you would have?

Or does anyone have any tickets that they want to sellHi team,

Relatively new to JRE and I don't know where to start. I was thinking of going right back to the beginning but that's a lot of time.

Mostly I've been listening to episodes regarding science or philosophy, but I wouldn't be against listening to the more comedic episodes either.

Seriously?  The amount of posts over the last few months with titles like "How many good friends does Joe have?", "Is Joe a good dad?", etc., is weird to me.  Has anyone else noticed this?  Is it decepticons or what?! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8WOiLhwctE&amp;t=1h6m37s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8WOiLhwctE&amp;t=1h6m37s)It seems like every time I open up a new podcast discussion it's mostly a circle jerk about how bad the guest is and how they had to turn the podcast off. Why are you even still here? Rogan routinely has conservatives on, and that's not going to change. He also smokes a lot of pot, and that's not going to stop anytime soon either. I like listening and my life has actually gotten better form health and productivity tips I heard on the podcast. I also like being introduced to new people. If you guys don't like it please stop listening. 

Edit* No one has answered my question. Why are you subjecting yourself to something you don't like? There are so many other forms of media to consume and people to talk to. Why are you on this sub shitting all over each episode? Are you just trolling? Do you feel rejected by Joe because you assumed he was gonna be Liberal on every topic? Are you mad that he's so pro Gun and hunting? Did you ever really like the podcast?This is my new account, but all my time here and I've never seen a female on this subreddit much less heard one in the wild talk about this show. My gf is a SJW so I know she wouldn't like it.

Any girls here or is this place a dick diner?Is there any way to listen to the JRE with audio only, no video, via an app or website other than youtube? I am about to do a 20 hour drive and wanted to listen without burning up my data[hhhhnnnngggg](https://imgur.com/a/Ewgruba)Basically, I'm looking for what you guys consider to be the essential episodes of the podcast. I'm thinking guests and conversations along the lines of Paul Staments.As far as I know she died of being shitfaced to the point of toxicity. Joe and Kevin Smith are talking about her dying of WDs, and I know Joe has repeated that line repeatedly. Am I wrong about how she kicked the bucket?When I woke up this morning, the joe Rohan podcast had turned into Kenneth Copeland ministry's, which I have never heard of and I'm not subscribed to itTheo Von  JRE was a great listen  In the Dave Rubin podcast he talks about how he would have focused on Alex Jones' Sandyhook trutherism if he had known about it and mentioned about Ted being on the podcast soon. I don't think Joe is necessarily afraid of asking tough questions but I think this topic will get real uncomfortable, real fast.

Ted's love of girls under 18 is a matter of public record so it's not like he can just say it's all just the "fake news" media trying to destroy him because he loves Trump/America/Hunting/whatever. I have a feeling that if it does come up, it's going to be quickly brushed aside for topics like bow hunting or how bad the hogs are in Texas.I've tried searching on google, but can't find it. There was some animal in a bathroom that was making crazy sounds. It was on several recent JRE episodes. Does anyone know when Nugent is coming on the show? In the Rubin podcast Rogan said he was coming on the show but I don‚Äôt know when. Does anyone know? I've been seeing it all over Reddit and Youtube lately. I've found like 3 on youtube but is there somewhere that has all the vids one place.I think this was an older white guy with a deep voice.

He did probably 90-99% of the talking. I know with some episodes the conversation is more back-and-forth but in this one Joe said very little.

He mentioned that the Ice Age ending was not the beginning of civilization but the "rebooting of civilization."

I only listened to the audio but this episode was videotaped as well because at one point the guest showed a chart of historical temperatures and Joe made a comment that audio listeners should check out the video to see that chart.

Any ideas?This has been a thought experiment that‚Äôs rattled around my noggin since I was about 15. Excluding suffocation, how many kittens would it take to kill Mike Tyson? Assume the arena is free of any boundaries and the supply of kittens is as large as you see fit. We‚Äôre talking 3-4 month-old domestic cats, not those fucking monsters they keep in zoos that can knock over three professional wrestlers with a fart.I'm trying to remember what was the cringey episode and timestamp where joe tells this story? Anybody want to help me out?Why do you this? Maybe you do this to get yourself pumped or to get the blood flowing. Is this why? Is this why you do this? 

I see you grinning, and it is from ear to ear; you are grinning so dramatically, as if you know a secret, that no one else knows.

Unlike, your previous challenges, which all started out fast and furious, this one feels more calculated. 

This time, you are applying patience, entering into temporary adversity; your instinct encourages you to come in slow, feeling it all out. Remember don‚Äôt travel in too close because you don‚Äôt want to be vulnerable. Conserve your energy this time, and this challenge, will not finish you off.

Playing this game, I can see it in your eyes, you are rethinking your strategy, and your confidence seems to be shaken. Clearly, you are rattled, as these challenges never happened to you before, and now you are caught off guard. This time, it didn‚Äôt work, but next time it will. 

Facing adversity, you are feeling utterly defenseless, thinking you cannot do anything physically, your emotional drive reduced to yelling, but this time, you know it doesn‚Äôt pay to ‚Äúmouth-off‚Äù 

Facing a decision, choosing to not react; applying patience and strategy this time; it‚Äôs your win if you consciously act.

This is how you completely demoralize doubt. Keep your mouth shut and from now on focus on your game plan. Preparing yourself for embarrassment, this is just another reason why it never pays to ‚Äúmouth-off‚Äù 

Think, then act, and adopt your win. 

The universe rewards calculated risk and passion. 

Considering how much Joe loves this phrase, we should come up for other phrases that cover all aspects of living.My friends and I are having a debate. I‚Äôm curious what y‚Äôall think He had ari shaffir on, and ari was explaining and getting mad at redban coz he was messing with his trip at a ufc event. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-mqe6SO1HE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=48m40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-mqe6SO1HE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=48m40s)  


Even Theo Von acknowledges that something is off about having a shit ton of kratom-pills on your table. Schaub has even said in the past that he had an oxy-addiction after getting an MMA-injury.  


Do you think Schaub is going down a slippery road of kratom-pills and decadence?I do, and I don‚Äôt find her annoying and I look forward to her appearances. I disagree with some of what she says but I also think ideas are fluid and the ideas she presented during her recent appearance were unrefined as a result of it being an unscripted face-to-face conversation etc. 

I also feel for her - like she‚Äôs been through a lot recently, I think she mentioned her father had passed away on her most recent, and most disliked, Rogan appearance. It could explain why she might have been ‚Äúoff‚Äù compared to her previous appearances - being in a state of grief. 

I don‚Äôt find her to be too laugh-out-loud funny but I enjoy her rapport with Rogan, they seem like they‚Äôre friends in real life. I love the episode when Rogan shows her R Kelly, that‚Äôs a classic moment.

TL;DR - I don‚Äôt find her irritating, enjoy her appearances. Bit confused by the hate.He's anti-sugar but surely he can have a little bit and not feel bad? Why not try an experiment with the ppv audience by providing a way for them to vote on the fights? It would not need to be the deciding vote. It could just be in addition to the traditional judging system and used as a comparison and an added incentive to get the ppv. If after a certain period it was deemed to be superior to the present system, it could replace it and become a much bigger incentive to getting the ppv. Most of you would probably fault the idea with the obvious lack of high level knowledge in the fan base, but as Rogan has said, there is already a lack of high level knowledge in the judging system. Also there is this argument.

I wrestled in highschool and am in a wrestling club right now in college to keep the rust off my moves. How easy would i be for me to go from wrestling to mma. I dont know striking so im joining a boxing club next semesterSo,  I didnt notice anything too different dream-wise for most of the week.  Then last night I had the most insane dream ever.  I dreamt I was Donald Trump, and for some reason I had to climb and go down a slide (12-18ft long).   I remember while climbing it, having a panic attack and thinking "I'm an old man! I can't be doing this!".    Then I went down the slide and was myself.  I was then showing people I could take control of other people's bodies by touching them, and then saying a magic word.    Fucking. Batshit. Crazy.  I don‚Äôt know of much, just the [Tito press conference ](https://youtu.be/exrCogOOuRs).
.. does this have anything to do with the taking of immigrant children now happening under the trump administrations policies? Man, I hope not.Any other Marc Maron haters here? This guy is seriously top five worst interviews of all time. Shut the fuck up Marc, and actually listen to your guests. I'm once again suffering through a shit show with Holly Hunter.

Couple examples that come to mind are any studies about red meat consumption and studies about marijuana (two subjects where I more or less agree with him) that claim negative results.

The really dishonest point he almost always makes to dismiss them is that rhetoric: **"since most people who do \[such or such, like eating red meat\] also have a tendency to do \[such and such, like having bad eating habits\], then those studies are obviously flawed."**

Does he not even understand the very *concept* of a scientific study? For it to be considered serious, a scientific study **has** to make sure that they have taken account of those kind of biases. That's why they study various samples, use placebos, etc.

By using this argument, Joe is not only appealing to personal assumptions ("we all know that people do this or that"), which should always be taken with huge barrels of salt when trying to get the facts right, but also he is basically claiming that *every* negative study *ever* done on consumption of red meat or marijuana (for example) was done by simpletons that never thought of isolating samples of people that would not skew their results. I find that to be awful, Trump-level bullshit with no real means to back it up.

I keep hearing him use this fallacy in his show, and really wish someone would point that out to him. It's not even about being right or wrong on the matter, it's about using fair and honest arguments to defend your point.

EDIT: removed a "stupid" in there that was not very constructive

EDIT 2: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG5wriXHA8w&amp;t=1m49s) to a random example [as requested](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/8rr5c2/anybody_else_tired_of_joes_lazy_dismissal_of/e0tsr1p/)https://youtu.be/vp_NSYIRQFMI am the only one that thinks it weird how many people listen to a guy for hours and hours and then constantly bitch about the things they don‚Äôt like about him? I know he‚Äôs not perfect and he definitely does and says things I don‚Äôt agree with, but he has for sure made more of a positive impact on my life then a negative one. I just find it strange that people follow a guy and then critique everything he does on a forum he‚Äôs never going to see.Hunting trips...Joe riding his dick all day on social media...like a good boyfriend. Only explanation. Joe is a 5‚Äô5 homosexual Prepare yourselves to hear about it for the next 20+ episodes along with the naturally occurring dynamics of predator vs prey.

Link to Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/BkJi_rbno9k/People on the tfatk sub f#cking roast him and it is straight up some of the funniest sh#t. They just go hammer on him every time he pretty much opens his mouth. B b b b b beasts when it comes to a roast. There is still this kind of love for him though. Sometimes I say schaubisms. Kinda stupid but what ever. 

Much love from Australia. Lights on clothes off, no hiding her under covers or paper bag or anyshit like that. And that makes me sad. 

Feels like you get to know a man after listening to him for hours a week.I read a bunch of articles that said raw Kale is actually bad for you etc So unsure if I should have them or notI'm not an MMA person and I have a lot of comedy podcasts already. This is pretty lazy of me to do so I appreciate any input.I haven't been into a lot of the recent guests so I've been digging back through older episodes. The early episodes are not good, lots of dead air and overall meandering, I mean that less as an insult and more that Joe has gotten a lot better at keeping things rolling and interesting. 

So, what do you sonsabitches think is the oldest point worth going back to? I've only checked out a couple earlier than ~400.

Also, what do you think was the peak period for the show? A lot of my favorites seem to be in the 5 and 6 hundreds.Just got a free picture frame and need a beautiful Rogan quote to put in there. Not necessarily looking for a serious motivating quote lol but has to be decently SFW. Suggest away!!! I've just discovered this sub after years of being a Joe Rogan fan and it's hilarious. Has Joe ever discussed this sub on any of his podcasts? I would love to see his reaction to some of the shit here.I think it‚Äôs his highest praise.

1. He said it about Chris D‚Äôelia‚Äôs response to Logan Paul

https://youtu.be/y9RF9b6NXKI?t=1m27s

2. He said it once about a witty Twitter response by burger chain Wendy‚Äôs

https://youtu.be/YREcqb3EYqs?t=1m48s


His Diaz impersonation is spot on, has there ever been a podcast where Joe Rogan goes into his Joey Diaz impersonation with him in the room?Im interested in the motivational part of his Podcast and not in the soldiering. Which Episodes can you recommend?

Thanks in advance.Thanks in advance!Haven‚Äôt watched any episodes with Joey Diaz. Which was was the best in your opinion? Those are great and they are still funny. Those random ones are weak.Gotta love himAri tweeted out ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard for me to not believe you‚Äôre not an addict when you just put your nose to a public toilet seat.‚Äù Recently and Joe was talking about tweakers on the Kyle Kingsbury podcast. Maybe it‚Äôs all bullshit, but I thought it was curious enough to ask you silly bitches your thoughts. I'm in Russia. I don't know why. I'm just there as a tourist or something.  Apparently, I did something to piss off somebody important. Some guy comes up to me and says "We have to get you out of Russia now! You need to go home!"

This dude is driving me to the airport, and a crazy "Baby Driver-esque" car chase ensues. I remember seeing a car run off a railing of a mountain and exploding, and the whole deal. 

So we get to the airport, and I'm being chased all the way to the ticket counter, where the attendant tells me that my name has been flagged, and I can't leave the country. 

Everything went all "Sopranos" after that and went black, and I don't remember anything else. 

This intense dreaming shit is real. I don't ever remember having dreams like these while I was smoking. 

I just wake up absolutely fucking baffled. Hey, can anyone tell me which episode/episodes Joe talks to Eddie about conspiracy theories? I‚Äôm pretty new to Rogan and love the show so much, I‚Äôm hooked. I often see in threads it as a running joke Joe and Eddie arguing about flat earth ect. Does this happen every time Eddie is on or if not can someone tell me the best episodes I should check out?

Help appreciated

Many Thanks

Hi, im 23 years old and 125 pounds. I usually only eat once a day, maybe an apple and a gronala bar or something like that. Maybe some junk food when I smoke. 

Just too lazy and brain blocked to really eat more than that (maybe im brain blocked from lack of food)

Want to work out and bulk up but r/gainit uses language I can't understand like 3x/4/3x and shit like that.

I want a fit bro to help me, a skinny guy who's never worked out, to help me develop a plan. Im willing to pay 5 dollars for this service via paypalIs Jamie the only on that assists joe during the podcasts. I‚Äôve seen a few times where Jamie is in the middle of looking something up and the camera angle will switch to Joe because he is talking now instead of Jamie. Is Jamie the only one that is working on the set? If so, dude is even cooler now.He‚Äôs so biased and never gives any other games a chance. Talks about Fortnite 30 seconds ‚ÄúJaime pull up quake‚Äù ‚ÄúJaime type in quake‚Äù 

Lol joe news flash there are other good games beside quake So after listening to Joe drone on yet again about how good he feels after doing cryo, i feel i need to remind the rest of us, who aren't living in California or even the US that contrast showers are a wonderful thing that makes you feel like a million bucks and costs nothing and doesn't require you to drive anywhere. The working class' cryotherapy.

I don't want to say that cryo is another SoCal health fad which commercializes a very common household thing (remember kale?) or that cold showers have been practiced forever (my grandpa made me take them so i won't be sick and that was in the 80s USSR). Maybe cryo has greater reduction in inflammation, i don't know. All i know is that i just did 5 minutes of contrast shower and i feel like the fucking Hulk.

When done in the morning they kick start your system, generally improve your immunity, improve your cardiovascular health and much more human optimization.  

Sorry, I mean don't forget, it's O N N I T, get 10% offsorry he has transformed into a little biatchJoe's lifestyle is a bit contagious. He has a way with recommending things and making it sound so awesome. JRE made me try floating for the first time, and now I understand just how important nice merino wool socks are when hiking long distances. What is something you learned, bought and/or started doing because of hearing about it on the podcast?Don't know where else to put this so I'll ask here. Is anyone else having a problem rewatching JRE on the YouTube app. I'll start watching and about twenty second into the video it stops and says stream off line.  I can watch anything and everything else on YouTube but not old episodes of JRE. I watched the live play through of Dennis McKenna and want to rewatching it but it stops and so do his other podcasts? There was a JRE where Joe Rogan was talking about his DMT experiences and that if he saw a UFO land nearby, he‚Äôd be chill about it. This is because he thinks DMT is so much more amazing. Has anyone read this book/pamphlet? Dennis said that he and Terrence wrote it so that anyone can figure out how to grow mushrooms in their basement. Is it really that easy? Or is it outdated since it was written so long ago?Had no idea who the guy was. Heard him on JRE and thought he was hilarious and seemed like a genuinely good dude. Watched his special and nearly shit my pants multiple times. I cannot recommend it enough. 

LOOK INTO IT! I know the podcast is on a couple dedicated podcast sites, it's posted on youtube and the revenue from the channels that post clips of the podcast go to him as well.  I imagine there is some revenue coming from the main JRE site along with a few other sites.  Then you have the sponsors...  

I've seen numbers thrown around before but I don't know how accurate they are.  I saw that one guy did some math but didn't include a lot of variables.  
  
Can we do a "r/theydidthemath" thing here?  I'm sure we can figure out what an average sponsorship pays.  Someone has to know how youtube revenue works; how much he is probably getting per view on youtube at this point, average up the views from all the big JREClip channels ect, come up with an accurateish number.  

What do you think?  
Without knowing any of this info I'm going to place a guess that a single average episode of JRE will bring Joe $50-75,000 over the course of a month.  Frankly I think I may be a little low.  
I'm just really curious how much b-b-b-baaaank Joe is making off of this, I know it's a lot and the number doesn't matter to me really but I'm still very curious how his podcast income compares to TV stars and such.
Look into itI didn't see anythingSeems like he never misses a podcast for a cold or anything like that. I‚Äôm sure it would suck talking for 3 hours if you had a sore throat. EDIT: Found out a little more about it here:

https://youtu.be/XRvMtbFM3Dw?t=36m30s

Sounds like Redban was interrupting, bringing the conversation back to himself, etc. Thanks to u/Proud_Russian_Bot for the pointer! 

EDIT 2: u/otek024 brought the following evidence, which is very interesting too, and probably the whole reason:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBq0kuoNBKA&amp;feature=youtu.beAnyone else going to see Joe in Boise?Joe is playing the Ricoh Colliseum in Toronto for JFL on Sept 29th. I‚Äôm thinking that JFL picked the venue because playing in a stone walled hockey arena doesn‚Äôt seem suitable for a comedy show. 

He‚Äôs said himself how the comedy suffers when the crowd is too big and this will likely have a crowd of 8,000+. I bought tickets because it‚Äôs my first time going to see him live, I just wish he played a theatre instead of an arena. 

Any other GTA reddtiors going to this show? They start talking and chimpanzees and stories and creepy dudes in the woodsI liked Jimmy Dore and Kyle Kulinski's appearances on the show, I would be interested in seeing more left wing commentators and professors come on.I remember reading a post that basically hyperlinked all of the random data points that Alex and Joe dropped throughout the show. I don't remember if it was here or on a conspiracy sub.

I like to get drunk and listen to that episode every now and then and I always come away wanting to know more about what the fuck he was saying about the link between Predestined knowledge (Darwin, DNA, etc), global control, and the elites.

Thanks!Grab the popcorn guys, Alex is calling out Joe for having a "globalist agenda" podcast and is telling him to pick a side. Either "him or the globalists"

https://youtu.be/Vg4dOkO4J6ELooking for a book about psychedelics and how regardless of background, age, etc the person always sees about the same thing. The book was either about that or how art under the influence around the world is very similar. 


I‚Äôm sorry how vague this is, I believe I either heard about this book on a Kevin Pereira podcast or maybe Kevin‚Äôs own podcast, Pointless. It must have been 2-3 years ago too. 1 - What is this George Soros conspiracy thing ? The nazi shit Alex was saying ? I don't understand what is happenin



Edit : 2- Joe said Alex what right about certain stuff .  Can you give me an example??? Or something Alex said that turned out to be true A quote that I had wrote down as my motivational quote of the day. Thought some people here might also appreciate it.

‚ÄúPain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you're running and you think, 'Man, this hurts, I can't take it anymore. The 'hurt' part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.‚Äù. - Haruki Murakami

Woke up at 2:30 a.m.  on  Monday morning my local time to put in some extra miles before I have to leave for work at 6. How do I say this without sounding like a colossal douche nozzle. .

I've buckled up for many JRE episodes the past couple of years. Mostly listening to it on runs, doing work around the house etc. The last half-dozen episodes I've tuned into I feel that everything that I'm hearing has been said at least a half-dozen times on previous episodes. I'm not getting anything out of new content and I'm starting to get bored. Its bittersweet because it was great when I discovered the JRE and I feel a bit bummed to start tuning out, but my taste has matured toward more substantive content. I think I will tune in when its really a guest I am interested in, but no longer will be downloading every other episode thats not about MMA or bow hunting. I am thankful for how the JRE introduced me to Sam Harris, Jock Willink, Tom Segura, and others but I think I'm good for a little bit.Was hoping to find this  sort of list by visiting the sub.

I'm getting tired of pulling up JRE every month on youtube just so I can google every name and find only MMA and Stand Up Comics.

Just recently got finished watching the interview with Robert Schoch.    It reminded me why I initially got into Joe's podcast.

Besides the obvious reply of  Graham Hancock are there any science (fringe science included) oriented podcasts that you would recommend?
.


*EDIT 7/7/18 ... The new Hamilton Morris podcast is sick as fuck



Aside from Jordan Peterson, (no hate, I've just heard it already) who are some psychologists who have been featured on the show good or bad? I love psychology and I would love to check it out.I've just seen the season finale of Westworld and there's a lot of talk about free will in us humans, do we really have it or is it all in our "code"? and stuff like that. Also I really liked philosphical talk in a recent Firas Zahabi episode. What are some other episode that cover the topic?I usually don't watch the podcast on youtube/ read comments, but I saw his most recent best of the week video &amp; read some comments. Every single comment was either (what I presume to be) jokes about him being a deep state agent, or people vehemently defending shit like Trump's family separation policies &amp; other far-right, infowars level insanity.

What's the deal with that? I know YT is generally pretty cancerous but plenty of youtubers have created audiences with fairly civil comment sections. Why can't the Joe Rogan experience?I think if he got sucked into The Last Of Us we‚Äôd stop hearing about Quake so much, as if it‚Äôs the only video game that ever mattered. It would open his mind to the evolution of gaming, and how it is dominating the entertainment market/making movies obsolete. Just my opinion. Need to get me some kettle bells.Just wondering, noticed he drank two of them in the episode with ari. Must be some kind of all organic stevia energy drink because we know joe wouldn‚Äôt drink something full of sugar Joe has acknowledged that Roseanne did the exact same thing with Susan Rice a few years ago, yet he still takes her at her word when she claims she didn't know Valerie Jarrett is black. This seems silly to me. I'd like to hear him discuss it in more detail and explain how he reconciles that inconsistency.

What do all of you think?I'm looking for a podcast that: 

Is not promoting an agenda.

Has a variety of guests I'd normally not hear. 

Long format conversations. 

Without mma and unfunny comedians. 

We have been working on some updates to the [JRE Podcast Search Engine](https://fluiddata.com/search?channel_id=9853). Many people have requested the ability to search within a single podcast episode, and now you can.  When you find the specific Joe Rogan podcast episode you want to search just click the episode artwork and it will take you to the [episode search page](https://fluiddata.com/episode/view/28589667?term=look%20into%20it&amp;ts=6038.96).

We've also started implementing some podcast transcript analytics.  On a couple of the pages you will see cards with topic and people mentions.  For example, in the episode view  you will see several cards including one for "Mentioned People".  You can click on one of those people and it will show you where that person was mentioned in the podcast episode.  You can also check out the [home dashboard](https://fluiddata.com/home) to see what is trending among all podcasts.

Let me know if you have any other feature requests.*I don't know...*A few pods back Joe was talking about a documentary on Netflix about all of the German settlers in Argentina, how towns are built to resemble Germany, etc.  Anyone know the name of the doc?Has anyone noticed that the cameras are not in focus? They‚Äôre slightly blurry / out of focus and the backgrounds behind Joe and guests are sharper and more in focus. Jaime or Joe needs to simply readjust and turn the focus lens a few degrees...I think Jocko Willink and Tom Segura's (You Mom's house with his wife Christina Pazsitsky.) Which others?What episode did all this coyote talk originate from?I love Kevin Smith and I thoroughly enjoyed their episode.

If anyone can point me in the right direction that'd be great thx.In waterpolo it‚Äôs easy to assume big guys have an advantage, but some of the greats are under 6 feet. A look at the rosters from the 2000‚Äôs might lead one to believe they need to be absolutely enormous. This is not the case. There is not really an ideal height and weight. But there are things that would predispose someone to have an advantage in waterpolo ex:having exceptionally long forearms in relation to your humerus. Or being a foot taller than the guy guarding you.

From a kinesiology perspective, what truly predicts success in professional sports is power to weight ratio. If you don‚Äôt believe me, ask 5‚Äô9‚Äù Nate Robinson in the NBA. Tony Azevedo, was only about 5‚Äô10, but one of the best polo players ever. He could send that ball through almost any imaginable path in the air under pressure and find the back of the cage.He was almost a Floyd Mayweather of waterpolo, coached from a young age til it was like second nature. Because there are no weight classes, size will greatly affect play style. 

Take Japan, they‚Äôre not very big, but went to the finals moments only to lose to Hungary by one this month. Hungary went on to lose the championship game to Montenegro in an overtime shootout.

Japan is about 5‚Äô8‚Äù average. 2018 they‚Äôre beastlier than ever. They create incredible opportunities on the inside and their defense is explosive. You can‚Äôt give them and inch of space or they swim the ball right to the goal and pound it in.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:2016_Summer_Olympics_Japan_men%27s_water_polo_team_roster In


Now I don‚Äôt have anything from 2018 but from 2016 Hungary was easily 6‚Äô4 average, honestly, maybe 6‚Äô5. Really large people. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_‚Äì_Men%27s_team_rosters

They only beat Japan by one last week, and had a completely different play style. They have this lefty, Marton Vamos. If he‚Äôs open anywhere within 10m he has a f‚Äî-king lazer cannon. Japan had to do everything in their power to hold him off. This created space inside, where they have a hole-set who looks like he ate shrek. They aren‚Äôt as explosive, but they are absolute freighters who can‚Äôt be left open anywhere inside half court (think steph currey), so the opponent constantly is needing to adjust their defense and leaving new opening.


Now Montenegro from 2018. This is the most accurate statistic too because this is the team that just barely won the fina championship. They‚Äôre about 2-3 inches shorter than most Hungarians, and lighter. However, they‚Äôre more explosive than Hungary. Physically, their players all carried a lower body fat percentage. The look like UFC 185‚Äôers-205‚Äôers.  Buncha Luke Rockholds but ganglier. They‚Äôre big enough to handle the physical powerful style imposed on them, and used their speed and size to create openings the Hungarians couldn‚Äôt close. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro_men%27s_national_water_polo_team

The craziest was how evenly matched almost all teams were this year. It was like watchin lightweights stomp heavyweights sometimes. Then in other moments a 6‚Äô6‚Äù Hungarian would stuff a shot from a 5 foot 6 Japanese guy so hard you‚Äôd wondered if they were supposed to be playing the same sport. Crazy shit.

Edit: I love nothin more than a QB threadin the needle for a clutch play. Here‚Äôs the Hungarian lazer cannon version of Tom Brady. https://youtu.be/6SK8Jik5p5g


Joe mentioned on his last podcast that he was using Kratom and I was wondering if any of you guys were using it as well? If so, what kind do you use and for what? What kind does Joe use and why? How's it been going for you or your friends and what does it help with?Is there a way to lookup who will be coming with Joe for upcoming shows? Particularly the Vancouver show Dennis McKenna, Ari, Hamilton Morris, Duncan...not that I‚Äôm complain at all. Prolly one of the best weekly lineups in a while. Just wondering if there was any thought process into this and whyQuite like the app but Rogan is the only podcast that it won't play. Constantly telling me every episode is unavailable every time I try to pull that shit up.

It's craaaazy.

Anyone else having this problem?Alpha Brain has a guarantee that if you don't like the product, you get your money back and get to keep the product. What's stopping someone from using this to obtain a free bottle of Alpha Brain? What's the catch? Are there conditions in the fine print?anyone remember that quote? i think it was with dr attiaI just watched his podcast with Duncan and noticed him talking about it briefly in the beginning, it looks small and slim. Over the past few months, /r/joerogan has experienced some interesting swings in membership and content. With the closing of the Rogan Board, some more divisive guests appearing on the podcast, and just general sub growth, there has been a lot of changes in the culture of the sub.

Many of the mod team have been moderating in the sub for 5 or more years. For many years we‚Äôve held to the policy of being extremely hands off, allowing for voting to dictate what the sub deemed to be of value.

After reviewing a number of subreddits that fall roughly inside the podcast‚Äôs universe, we found something very interesting. /r/joerogan has a lot of threads that are not generally liked. Take note, that the following screenshot is from a sub about twice as large as /r/joerogan

https://i.imgur.com/mFYje6G.png

This is the ‚Äúnew‚Äù from the sub we are comparing. Now look at the ‚Äúnew‚Äù from /r/joerogan.

https://i.imgur.com/u9uKU0Q.png

After seeing this comparison, we reached out to the mods of the other sub to get some feedback. One of the topics that came up was whether or not we utilize banning. When we showed them a list of the banned users, they were dumbstruck.

https://i.imgur.com/NGPg0Z9.png

The general thought by us and the mods we reached out to, is that there‚Äôs a lot of shitposting going on. A lot of posting that could be wrangled into a weekly discussion thread, leaving real, quality content to more viewable on ‚Äúnew‚Äù and to hopefully be better received.

Here are the list of changes we will be implementing immediately.

1. Rule 1, Don‚Äôt be a cunt, will be changed to ‚ÄúBe civil‚Äù
 * violating this rule will be a bannable offense. If you want to use racial slurs, be a cunt in general, etc, take it elsewhere. This is subjective, we know that, so consider yourself warned.
2. The ‚Äúno Peterson‚Äù rule will be removed.
3. A weekly ‚ÄúGeneral Discussion‚Äù thread will be created. This is where you will ask for fanny pack recommendations, ask why the sub hates Rogan, ask about other podcasts to listen to, etc.
4. The response to rule violations will be:
 * first offense, warning
 * second offense, 72 hour ban
 * third offense, permanent ban

As always, we are always open to suggestions from the sub.  We will also begin looking to add a few more mods to the team. Active sub users are welcome send a modmail if interested.

The goal of these changes is to make the sub a more friendly place to enjoy JRE related content.
This is where you ask about fanny pack recommendations, why the sub hates Rogan so much, whether or not Rogan visits the sub, etc.Ive been noticing a lot of people "calling out" joe for flip flopping and molding his views to whoever his guest is a lot recently because of his interview with Nugent. i honestly dont think thats a fair statement and here are my reasons. 1. he has multidimensional views on issues, i guess people forget thats a thing these days. 2. he obviously had nugent on predominately because of his hunting stuff. why would he be antagonistic and start a debate when he has no interest in debating. 3. if ted says crazy shit, let him. let people hear first hand his crazy views and judge them themselves. Joe is not a journalist, hes not an intellectual and hes not an interviewer trying to ask tough questions and he never was (hes said this himself numerous times). hes a guy who wants to talk to anyone and everyone to hear what people have to say and have interesting conversations. Plus hes usually fucking baked for these things which doesn't really put you in a confrontational state of mind. if yall disagree, id love to discuss this but idk i guess that flip flop sentiment has been annoying me lately, especially because of how douchy people articulate that opinion on youtube ( i know i shouldnt even look at youtube comments but i cant help it XD)With the Joe Rogan message board being shut down and all the posts getting deleted I decided to repost this OP from 2012 because it was one of favorite and I don't think it should be lost forever. The name of the poster who wrote this did get lost though, so if anyone remembers it let me know all I'll update the OP. (edit: 'Voodoo Chicken' was apparently the author)

This might be the craziest Bath Salt story you ever read. Warning: Long Post

The story begins when a man named, John McAffee goes to college, gets a degree and launches a handful of successful technology startup companies in the early 90's when the market was hot. One of those companies -McAffee Anti-Virus, eventually sells for roughly 100 million dollars and he is set for life.

He then "invents" a new "sport" which mostly involved rich white guys with way too much money and time on their hands flying high speed experimental aircraft very close to the ground. Not surprisingly, one of these old white rich guys dies doing this and the family decides to sue John for 5 million dollars.

John sells all of his US assets and moves to Belize, where they coincidentally do not recognize US law and anyone seeking any sort of compensation from John as a result of any US ruling will probably never see that money. Also, the age of consent in Belize is 16, so he wastes no time in shacking up with a girl 50 years younger than him.

So far, this is all a fairly normal "white guy problems" story. But this is where it gets weird.

Apparently, while in Belize John discovers something called, Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) which happens to be the active ingredient in what is now commonly known as "bath salts" and he likes it. Sadly though, at some point the market shifts and the quality of commercially available MDPV deteriorates -so John sets out to make his own high grade MDPV.

That's right... he begins freebasing bath salts... the same shit that makes people eat your face off... he starts making the "crack" version of it. In his quest to make the ultimate face eating zombie powder, he begins posting on a drug forum asking for tips and advice.

&gt;Hello Everyone. I've been lurking here for years and just recently decided to join up. I'm hoping to get some help here.

&gt;I'm a huge fan of MDPV. Not the white hydrochloride - it's inconceivable that anyone on the planet would willingly put that into their bodies -- I'm talking the freebase form. I think many of you that don't bother to freebase it yourself have at least tasted the freebase version when it was widely available as "tan mdpv". I think it's the finest drug evere conceived, not just for the indescribable hypersexuality, but also for the smooth euphoria and mild comedown.

&gt;My question is this: How can I more easilly separate the oil from the precipitate using some mechanical means?

&gt;Here's the nightmarish process I've been going through so far:

&gt;First I precipitate and then place the container on a foot vibrator for 30 minutes to raise the first oil (the oil is heavier than water, by the way):

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/ypK4gWw.jpg

&gt;Then I painstakingly touch each droplet with the point of a hyperdermic, which causes the oil to climb up the needle. Then I slowly extract the needle until the surface tension at the top allows the oil to float.

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/y0n5tk5.jpg

&gt;I can only do a small amount at a time or else the oil collects into a ball large enough to sink again. I draw off the oil with a filed down needle point and then spend another 30 mitues of vibrating until the next batch rises. As I proceed, the droplets become smaller and smaller until they are barely visible. The complete extraction takes 5 to 6 hours.

&gt;For anyone who freebases mdpv, by the way -- the oil is dangerous beyond belief. When I first started doing this I accidently got a few drops on my fingers while handling a used flask and didn't sleep for 4 days. I had visual and auditory hallucinations and the worst paranoia of my life. It's all the bad aspects of white mdpv times a hundred. If you think the comedown from the white mdpv is bad, rub this oil into your skin. You'll be begging for a hundred milligram dose of the white in exchange. Use rubber gloves.

&gt;Anyway --- can someone tell me how I can mechanically separate the oil from the precipitate in less than 5 hours? I definitaely don't want to use a reagent. I'm not a chemist or any kind of scientist by the way, just someone who refused to accept the "new mdpv".

&gt;Thank you.

You see, somewhere along the way while John was trying to freebase bath salts he seems to have stumbled across an entirely new drug. At least, that's what he thinks. Every chemist and chemical company tells him what he has is still just plain old MDPV and that's not surprising -considering all he is doing is concentrating it, but he is convinced his freebase is still somehow "diifferent". Like the alchemists of old, he has magically transmuted the properties of the mundane to the truly divine... and by "divine" I mean after ingesting just 5mg of his magical bath salt zombie crack, he and his 17 year-old girlfriend had wild untamed monkey sex for 8 straight hours.

Naturally, members of the forum are skeptical that he has found the Holy Grail of bath salts -especially, considering John freely admits that his freebase method is a bit sloppy, rudimentary, very time consuming and rarely produces the desired drug. Hence, his coming to the forum and asking for advice in the first place.

&gt;If you do try it, here is what happens (the white HCL is on the right, the precipitate left out for 24 hours in water and air is on the left, the precipitate after 48 hours is in the middle. It continues to degrade all the way through dark brown over the course of a week. The color in the center is what you're looking for in terms of best characteristics. When dried it remains stable):

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/W1HY1Qr.jpg

&gt;Note: The above posts are simply freebasing instructions for the HCL form of mdpv. To my knowledge there is no synthesis involved or transformation into any chemical other than mdpv.

&gt;P.S. DO NOT TOUCH THE OIL. Extremely dangerous. And never take more than 5mg of the tan colored form at one time.

The good news is, when you are a millionaire living in Belize freebasing bath salts you have plenty of time on your hands to make more bath salt crack to freebase with your 17 year old girlfriend and post about it on the Internet!

&gt;I just tried it with 10 ml of water, 200 mg of pv, 150 mg of soda, and no heating, and you can see the oil residue on the sides of the beaker, so 100 ml and cold solution should be no problem - (although to FULLY recover your pv you do have to heat it). I didn't wait for the powder to fully precipitate before I took the pic - you can see it just starting to form the slightly darker thin layer on the bottom - just wanted to see if the oil was produced and precipitate would begin.

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/VwfyZ1s.jpg

&gt;I can only assume that your pv is something other than pv.

&gt;If you do get it right, here's what it should look like after 72 hours of evaporation. (I scraped the lower half for drying for the next pic):

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/fLFyJNf.jpg

&gt;Here's the lower half after drying and before grinding back into a powder:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/yH1yjO1.jpg

&gt;After 96 hours of evaporation you get the following. It's still very good, but not as good as the previous color:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/aeFP9Lw.jpg

&gt;Both of the above colored forms are highly potent. Don't eyeball dosage. If you're used to the white pv, you will certainly overdose on this stuff because it is three times heavier by volume than the white stuff. If you achieve a color similar to the first one above, then it's potency is hard to overstate. Always weigh it and never do more than 3mg at a time. 3 mg of this is not much larger than a pinhead.

&gt;A side note: heat IS required to begin the transformation. For example, if you don't heat the solution at all during precipitation you will be left with a light yellow substance that has exactly the same poor characteristics of white mdpv. If you don't provide enough heat the same thing will happen. You'll know when not enough heat has been applied because after 24 hours of evaporation your mix will have a light greenish yellow cast, with no orange tint. There will be no tan hue. It will look like this:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/8jicqYD.jpg

&gt;If the oil has a nice egg yolk color to it, then the heating has been perfect:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/0PQuTc7.jpg

&gt;If the yellow-green color happens, don't worry, you haven't lost anything.. Add water, pour it back in the flask and heat slowly as described in an earlier post (two saucepans) for a couple of hours. Redo everything and the tan mdpv will appear.

&gt;There are dozens of things that can go wrong during this process - none of them irreversible. And there are a few possible end products that might look like the tan, but aren't (overheating the solution, for example, produces something, after evaporation and drying, that looks exactly like tan mdpv but merely gives massive, incapacitating headaches when bumped -- no euphoria, no high, no hypersexuality). If you run into problems I'll be happy to help.

Meanwhile, rumors begin circulating around Belize that the eccentric millionaire who lives in their neck of the woods is becoming increasingly... eccentric. He spends days on end and all hours of the night hidden away in his jungle compound with a small harem of teenage girls... just what the hell is he doing in there...?

&gt;I've processed 23 kilos of this stuff in the past year or so, and bump it myself every day - in fair quantities the hypersexuality... is beyond belief. I have had a number of acquaintances (both male and female) who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn't stop.

&gt;In all honesty, a first time user, or a user on a large dose, when presented with food, will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner. If alone, they will figure out a way to fuck it, or shove it up their rectum. This is not a joke. Everything on the Tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid. If only visually. I will not, anymore, let anyone on Tan be alone with my dogs for example. (I have 14 dogs). Twice in the past year Tan users (one man, one woman - both after major massive doses, to be fair), attempted to have sex with one of my dogs. One user (again after a hugely massive dose), was arrested in a local village here for publicly molesting strangers. Fortunately, in my country, such a crime is punishable by a small fine at worst. So perhaps the appetite "suppression" that initially comes on is really an appetite "disinterest". Water though!!!! - dehydration is a major danger throughout. Force yourself to hydrate when on the Tan. It's way worse than MDMA, especially in higher doses, in terms of suppressing thirst. Watch your urine. If it gets darker, stop what your doing and drink water.

&gt;Over the past two years I have played with mdpv using ether, tuloene, xylene, baking soda, galacial acetate, vinegar, water, ethanol and dirt from my garden(the bacterial connection). I have precipitated, heated, frozen, incubated, dissolved, evaporated, combined and separated every possible combination of precipitate, solution and oil. In the process I have come up with substances that were less than enjoyable to ingest. I am my only test subject for these experiments. I temporarily blinded myself for three hours after drying and ingesting a brown goo that appeared after five days of incubating an odd gray precipitate after an ether/acetate experiment with pv. I once ended up with a dark brown substance that looked similar to the darker tan pv versions. It gave me an incapacitating headache that lasted 4 days. I had overheated the pv oil during precipitation and created something horrible. I got PV oil on my skin and didn't sleep for 72 hours, during which time hellish visual and auditory hallucinations had me locked in the bathroom where I hid in the bathtub for 30 hours. My first hit of the acetate salt that I created from the tan had me hallucinating again for a few days. I had not considered that the salt version of the tan freebase might have dosages measured in micrograms. I should have guessed from the huge residual slush left over from the Acetic Acid wash. But I didn't. I bumped 3 milligrams. 300 micrograms is a large dose.

&gt;What I'm saying is that my body is barely being held together, and what little cohesion is left is the result of vitamins and pure will power. So I just don't have the courage to go down the acetate road. The HCL road has used me up.

&gt;You should have seen some of my forum posts on other boards when I was overdosing on pv.

Holy shit! This dude claims to have discovered a psycho-sexual drug so potent, you will rub your dick into a bloody stump after rage fucking the family dog after just one bump!

What do you do when you are a millionaire living in a third world country who has discovered a means to produce the ultimate sex drug and you have a harem of 17 year old girls addicted to it?

Buy better lab equipment and start passing the shit out like candy.

&gt;And this might be the place to talk about "Pure Tan". My first post in this thread alluded to the process, and visually showed some of the procedures. I purposely obfuscated a little, because, well, I did a lot of work to figure out how to make it pure, and it's not really necessary for the average user anyway. The quick and dirty, which anyone can do, is well explained above and produces, IMHO, the finest chemical ever to appear on this planet. I'm a perfectionist, however, and spent the better part of this past year honing a purification procedure. I won't talk about how to do, because it wouldn't be germane to the average kitchen cook. It requires, among other unwieldy implements, a rotovap:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/36zxTSR.jpg

&gt;An Airclean system:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/kdRWgoj.jpg

&gt;A reasonably powerful microscope that will connect to a computer (so you can do detailed, microscopic measurements), and an incubator:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/Zsn7vx0.jpg

&gt;It's not a fun process. Five consecutive full 12 hour workdays will produce only this:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/gJBzWqJ.jpg

&gt;A one milligram dose of this, whatever THIS is, is scary. A 10 mg dose, unchaperoned, would be unquestionable fatal, or at least massively harmful - mostly from the uncontrollable insanity it would bring into your life. Keep in mind that the end product of the "quick and dirty approach" that I outlined contains less than 10% of this substance (precipitate, unavoidable loss through evaporation, mdpv contamination, etc.), so a 5mg dose of the "quick and dirty" is a good time. A 5mg dose of the pure would be a time you would never forget, and probably never want to repeat.

&gt;What I do here, with my friends and acquaintances who, rightly, worship this stuff, is mix it 50 to 1 with ground up Excedrin, and wrap it in 25mg doses:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/kw0jmx4.jpg

&gt;Why Excedrin? First, large doses of the Tan is socially harmful, at the least, and people are people. They don't use the best judgment sometimes. Powdered excedrin, bumped or plugged in doses of more than 200mg in a single day, will cause massive pain, bleeding and discomfort. It is a deterrent to crossing the line into extreme danger. Second, daily use of the Tan causes a a slight background headache for some users after a few days (me included). 25 mg of Excedrin powder, bumped, removes it entirely. But.... since people are people, a number of folks have figured out how to remove the Excedrin by mixing the batch in a large quantity of water. The Excedrin remains in suspension for 10 or 15 minutes. The pure Tan falls to the bottom almost immediately. They siphon off the suspension and are left with an extremely dangerous substance. Dangerous because it is utterly impossible to measure a safe dosage of the pure substance, without possessing a scale costing thousands of dollars.. there have already been harmful events with people who have "purified" my Excedrin mix.

&gt;A local brothel owner (prostitution is legal in my country) talked me out of a large amount of Tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers. The idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product. It worked for a while, and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses. They began leaving and running off with customers - some after a single contact with the customer. Two of these men were married, had good jobs, and children that they loved. It has to be obvious, even to the most casual observer, that this is massively disruptive and borders on insanity.

&gt;If a person takes a large dose of the Tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time, then truly terrible things happen. A number of men, and women, have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product (which is why I no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends - everything else is cut 50 to one). Twice, users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs. Again, even the most casual observer will see the danger in this.

&gt;I have distributed over 3,000 doses exclusively in this country. They call it SPT (I named it) and it is a seriously hot underground topic here. I know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this, and hundreds trying to get samples, which I dole out with meticulous care. Anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn't get any more.

Now... in case you think our man is simply obsessed with the singular pursuit of his "tan" (his name for the his special MDPV crack) you should know he is open to all avenues of exploration as evidenced by the following photos he shared with his new drug forum friends.

&gt;"Tan" is not the only thing that has come out of mdpv, and I am not the only person producing stuff. I try to keep track of all the recreational products on the world market, looking for constituents that provide evidence that other people are walking down this same path:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/HwMYB8B.jpg

&gt;It also contains trace amounts of a Salvia Divinorum based product. I've been playing around myself with combining tiny amounts of Salvia based chemicals with the Tan - Hugely Awesome, but I can't get a dosage that works for everyone yet.

&gt;For those of you who have tried Salvia, you will recognize the leaves below - the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/8cPqdCH.jpg

&gt;Salvinorin-A, the active ingredient in Salvia, when processed correctly, yields a hypersexual compound that surpasses the Tan (if you can even get mind around the concept), but Its side effects for even a tiny overdose are debilitating (uncontrollable shaking, frothing at the mouth - which oddly doesn't detract from its sexual appeal if both partners are on it). So minimal doses are required, and the effects of these small doses are additive when combined with the Tan. The Salvia based Chemical in this Bolivian brew is different from the one I use, but very close. I've been trying to figure out how they made it.

So... what to do after you've exposed yourself on the Internet as a rich third world drug fiend sex addict?

Simple. Post everything about yourself short of your social security number before the drugs wear off:
&gt;I suppose it's time I should introduce myself.

&gt;My name is John, and my main focus is the effect of medicinal tropical plants on bacteria, and vice versa. I don't need to tell you my exact location, because it doesn't really matter. "Imagine there's no country", as another John once said.

&gt;To do any decent research in this field, I had to be near tropical plants. Jungles have tropical plants. So I moved to this place:

&gt;until supplies could arrive, after which I built the lab:

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/hTVlLli.jpg

&gt;And stocked it with stuff that I would need in order to do research:

&gt;Then, I went about the task of bringing some small civilization into the heart of darkness:

But of course, after a three day bender freebasing bath salts and fucking your teenage harem girls the paranoia finally sets in:
&gt;]Ok. So I did what I came here to do. I've had fun and I hope I've given some of you food for thought. But I have to get back to the real world. The on-line world is more of a distraction than the self induced effects of the many experiments I've done using my own body over the past year or so, and I have work to do.

&gt;I'm going to delete all of my posts in this thread. I'm afraid that unless I can answer questions for people, the information will be more confusing than helpful. I myself won't have the time to log back on here. I may lurk again from time to time though. Two days should be enough time for those of you in the middle of making Quick Tan to ask your questions and get your answers. Those of you I've given my email to in private messages: That email address won't be valid in a couple of days. Those to whom i gave my phone number: Same thing.

&gt;So ask what you need (if anything), before i move on. Not trying to be dramatic, I just can't spare any more time away from the work. I've been on a semi-sebatical since I started this thread.

&gt;You are a good bunch of people.

However, a few more bumps of the zombie sex crack and John is back with gusto describing his sexcapades with teenage girls under the influence of his mystery drugs!

&gt;Impossible to stay away from this thread. The dance is seductive.
It is entirely possible, I believe, to break every known sexual taboo and indulge in activities that many would describe as "monstrously depraved" with the one that you love and have both partners feel elevated by the experience.

But then John disappears again with one last cryptic post.
&gt;I have photos of the boss fucking dogs in my safe at home. I think my job is secure.

Where did John disappear to? Well, perhaps not surprisingly -after admitting on a public forum that you are experimenting with powerful hallucinogenic sex drugs in your home lab with teenage girls and then passing this stuff out to "thousands" of people, the cops are going to be a tad bit interested... even if it is a third world country and you are worth millions of dollars. So on May 2nd of this year, the GSU (Gang Suppression Unit) raided John's home. During the raid they found a cache of firearms and a 17 year-old girl along with piles of cash and large quantities of mystery powders.

He was charged with running a meth lab, after so many locals had reported the effects of this crazy drug that he was manufacturing and distributing. Of course, the catch is -MDPV is perfectly legal in Belize... and therefore -so is... whatever the fuck he is making with it until it can be identified... so they let him go.

Now anyone who has had any experience with meth, speed, MDPV and the long, sleepless binges that usually follow suit can tell you one of the unfortunate side effects is massive paranoia after prolonged use... even John admitted he was not immune to this. In fact, many reporters who spoke to John around the time he was posting his "research" spoke of his increasingly bizarre and paranoid behavior. I would imagine having the Gang Suppression Unit kick in your doors with AK-47's would probably not do much to alleviate that paranoia either.

Which is why I was only partially surprised to read today that John McAffee is now wanted for questioning in the murder of his neighbor, Gregory Faull.

Apparently, Faull was annoyed by the constant barking of McAffee's 14 dogs who lived just 300 yards away and were presumably very loud sex partners -so he filed a complaint with the local police. When that failed to produce results however, Faull took matters into his own hands and began poisoning the dogs. The day after the dogs were found dead -Faull was found in a pool of blood with a bullet in his head and now John McAffee is on the run -reportedly afraid that the police will kill him.I really need to give a speech at school in an hour and I just realized this would be a helpful aid, and I do not have time to skim it again.

If anyone can quickly find it without too much work that would be so helpful.

ThanksEDIT(6/30/18 @ 5:37pm pst):  Rogan has discussed this previously and answered my question [during a discussion with Ari](https://youtu.be/p9ulSZyzRtg?t=1h58m36s) addressing suicide and what, if anything, could have been said to Ari to help him through his own struggles with moderate depression.  I only caught the beginning hour of this episode initially and missed this discussion.  Thanks to u/yourmother-athon for the heads up.  

TL/DR: Why does Rogan shy away from, or actively avoid for that matter, the discussion of certain mental health topics?

Also, just a quick heads up, I got a bit caught up writing this out for reasons that are apparent towards the end.  I'm not blaming Joe for my situation, that wouldn't make sense. But when a topic that actively affects you every single day pops up on a JRE episode... when it happens to fall within an entire field in dire need of a jump start in terms of its discussion in society...  when that opportunity presents itself and is literally shit on and treated as if it didn't exist, well hopefully you can understand where I'm coming from.  

Some context: 

I just started listening to the most recent Duncan Trussell episode, and right off the bat Rogan completely changes topic after Duncan brings up a personal story about a guy with bipolar disorder who committed suicide while experiencing a manic episode after an Ayahuasca retreat.  He doesn't just change topic either, he completely veers off and takes Duncan down a completely unrelated comical hypothetical about having to use shit for drug tests to try and get his mind off of what he just brought up.  It really struck me as odd.

Now, I have to admit upfront that this hits close to home as I myself have been struggling with bipolar disorder for 7 years now.  It hits even closer because my initial manic episode was triggered by mdma use.  So, for me, it always pique's my interest when people discuss drug use and mental health and how various substances have been shown to either trigger manic episodes/psychotic breaks, cause severe depressions, or, on the flip side, be used for treatment.  Why?  Because the state of treatment for most mental health is absolute shit.  That being said, I'm not the type of person who discourages drug use because of my own personal history.  I have nothing against them.  

Getting to the Question:

Rogan's diverting of conversation when mental health issues come up isn't specific to this episode either.  I know he's done similar types of things when depression, mental health w/ drug use, add/adhd and other things have come up as well.  My question is what gives?  Why is there so much unease and a lack of in-depth discussion when these types of topics come up?

I've seen this issue come to light a few times before in this sub, usually buried deep in a thread tied to an episode, and the answer has usually been an unsure hypothesis that it has something to do with his distrust of big pharma.  I see where that could play a supporting role, but I feel that there has to be something more substantial that he has never stated on his podcast.

You may be asking why this matters at all:  

I have a clear bias as I have Bipolar, but the big thing is that ANY conversation on mental health is a win right now.  No joke, most people I talk to where my issues come up are so off-target about what Bipolar actually is, it isn't even remotely comical.   

Rogan has no obligation to me or anyone else who deals with mental health shit on a daily basis.  I get that.  But I love how diverse his episodes get when it comes to the topics that are discussed in-depth.  It's why I listen to almost every episode.  Usually nothing is off limits, but mental health seems to always get pushed to the side or avoided.

I admire Rogan for his constant pursuit of new technology or methods that better health in general.  He's always bringing up the latest shit on stem cells, and recovery methods that figthers are using that could be potentially game-changing for recovery practices in general.  He goes hard on mental health to an extent too!  I mean float tanks and meditation have been his thing forever, but for whatever reason whenever the gnarly side of mental health comes up its on to the next topic.  

It really fucking blows y'all.  I don't wish some of the shit I've had to endure on even the people I hate the most.  It's brutal and absolutely soul-crushing.  Which is why i get so frustrated when Rogan avoids talking about this stuff.  I wish so much he would just entertain the conversation when it comes up.  I don't think he realizes how bad of a state mental health treatment is here in America.  Any discussion on the current state of treatment and how progress can be made would have a big impact.

Consider this:

For us Bipolar males, our life expectancy is still 10-12 years less than those without it.  One of the most commonly prescribed medicines today, Lithium, hasn't changed since the 1970's.  It even dates back to the 1870's as a solution for manic episodes.  It doesn't target the mania either.  It just nukes your brain so you don't feel anything at all, good or bad, essentially turning you into a zombie. And you get a fun thing called "memory fog" which makes it so you can't remember what you had for breakfast by about noon.  

ECT is still a treatment, and is often times still recommended to those in psych wards.  Literally electric shock therapy.  Like hook up electrodes to your head and shock the shit out of you until your symptoms die down.  And you run the risk of getting retrograde amnesia because of it.  

Psychiatric hospitals are fucked.  Rogan even touches on this when Regan and de-institutionalization is brought up.  But it never gets elaborated on in terms of what it's actually like now and how that many years without proper funding have actually affected things.  I've had to go through multiple stints in these things, and while they are there to try and help you and the intent is good, a lot of the time Jail is a more welcome environment.  

I know Rogan doesn't have time to research everything in the world.  I know he can only have so many interests, but the ugly side of mental health does have some ties to drug/psychedelic use and it seems like they should at least be discussed when they come up like in Duncan's appearance.  Yea, shit isn't fun to talk about.  Not everything is rainbows and smiles, but that doesn't make it any less important.

I wouldn't be surprised if this dude from Duncan's story was trying to pursue some type of treatment for his disorder and inadvertently triggered a manic episode.  The current state of diagnosis, treatment, and maintenance of Bipolar Disorder really is fucked and I wouldn't be surprised if this individual got fed up that nothing was working and tried another route.  I've had my own journey in this regard, and it has taken me 5 years of trial and error with a host of different legit-prescribed-by-doctors medications just to find one (Depakote) that hasn't lead to another manic episode within a year. I can only hope the stability will continue past the 2 years its provided so far.

But that was after having to endure 2 years of doctors not being able to give me a diagnosis after my initial manic episode.  That was after 5 total manic episodes, 8 psych wards trips, 2 jail stints, a summer being homeless, a summer living in a recovery facility, a suicide attempt, and 2 lost engineering jobs (already working for them, not potentials) all in 5 years and all thanks to this disorder and the lack of any tangible developments in mental health treatment overall in decades.  

It would have been really interesting to hear what Duncan had to say about what happened.  But no, I couldn't try to glean anything from Duncan's story about parents who came to him to try and hear their child laugh again cause he isn't there to do it anymore.  Shitting into Tupperware for drug tests talk will have to suffice.  I remember a really old episode where Joe and Brian got into a heated argument about Brian not naming the episodes correctly and just generally being sloppy back when the show was on Ustream. Does anybody remember the episode #?I swear he thinks anyone with more than average energy and drive is on it... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMSRAz2VZqk

He's almost as funny as a developmentally delayed sixth grader mimicking people on public transportation as everyone looks at each other, wondering where his parents are.I just listened to the crowder episode. Jesus is that man a bore. What does he even do for fun? Does he have any hobbies? Or does he rattle of conservative talking points to anyone who will listen in his free time? He claims to be a ‚Äúcomedian,‚Äù but I don‚Äôt recall laughing at a single one of his so called jokes. 

The worst part is, that probably ~75% of what he says is utter horseshit. He‚Äôll tell one truth and two lies, and if you‚Äôre not that well informed you can‚Äôt tell which is which. 

After watching this tragedy of a podcast, I decided to do a little research into him, and I came across an article that he wrote about losing his virginity on his wedding night. Never in my life have I heard anyone so smug and arrogant about never getting their dick wet. I can think of no worse fate than having his physical embodiment of why human sentience will be our downfall bouncing on top of me. I don‚Äôt know how his wife does it. I‚Äôd sooner convert to a Jehovah‚Äôs witness and ramble on about Babylon and secret desert fortresses than be married to that disappointment. 

And what the fuck is wrong with Joe just agreeing with this imbecile? I know it was a pity podcast, but have a spine mate. 


TLDR: fuck you Steven Crowder

Edit: just because I don‚Äôt like liars doesn‚Äôt make me a triggered SJW. I‚Äôm not triggered, nor am I a SJW. I am just someone who believes in healthy discourse, which New England Steve Chowder isn‚Äôt great at. 

Edit 2: also it‚Äôs obvious that Stevey boy is geeked out of his mind of some sort of stimulant, most likely Adderall. Which makes him a pretty big hypocrite when it comes to his opinions on drugs. This guys totally okay with popping pharmaceutical meth like they‚Äôre tic tacs, but marijuana is the devils lettuce and should be outlawed. Talk about flawed logic and ideological blindness. Its in line of apparently, supposedly, he said she said, i heard, from what i have heard, im guessing, presumably or something like that fuckkkkk

It's making me crazy lol help the brother outOr maybe its just my internet.. lolOn the current live podcast with Joey DiazThere are names of leftists and liberals and even Minority activists whose names have been listed over and over on this forum. I think it‚Äôs suffices to say that Joe is not interested in actually debating people with whom he has these major issues with or even trying to see if there is not some misunderstanding on his behalf what he claims to have a problem with. 

I really think a lot of this anti-left is BS talking points nonsense is coming from a sheer misunderstanding of what these people are actually talking about an issues they may have and just denigrating them into ‚Äúidentity politics‚Äú is inherently deceitful. 

Black lives matter for instance. Jordan Peterson seems to think that BLM represents every black person, and that BLM is it self literally the black panthers or some sort of black nationalist organization. He could not be further from the truth, and you can tell because none of these guys actually debate anyone or even talk with anyone they claim to have these in here problems with. It‚Äôs a complete farce. It‚Äôs one huge exercise at reinforcing center right wing and far right wing ideology under the guise of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äú. Sam Harris does this shit too. We talk about needing dialogue...and what do they do? They go to have talks with Ben Shapiro and David Frum. Where‚Äôs the ‚Äúdifficult conversations‚Äù there?!Just binged all the episodes and holy shit. Amazing storytelling about some amazing stories. Banks laundering billions of dollars for the cartels and getting a slap on the wrist, big pharma pumping up prices by 500% just to make the shareholders happy, fucking maple syrup mafia up in Canada. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. The payday loan episode will make your blood boil. Been thinking about this one alot as of recent and was wondering what the joeroebros might be thinking.After Listening to Paul Stamets #1035 I tried Lions Mane on his endorsement...and it was pretty profound.

Main benefits: Super relaxed, and significantly more focused.

       I tried Alpha Brain for a week and felt literally nothing.  AS soon as I tried Lions Mane I felt the effects within a day of taking it. I couldn't believe it! I can work all day and wont get fatigued mentally  (ie., vision doesn't get blurry after staring at a computer for hours and I don't get headaches after long hours of concentration..)

           Also, I feel really relaxed when working after taking Lions Mane when usually I would get really stressed.I bought capsules from a health food store and they are  400 mg a capsule. I take 2 of these in the morning and feel a significant effect. This is blowing my mind considering Alpha Brain is 50 - 60 dollars and you can get Lions Mane for 15 -20 Online. If you are studying for long hours or are in long periods of intense, highly focused work I'd strongly recommend Lion's Mane supplement. There is actually something to this ...I‚Äôm not used to tobacco but got some cigars and have smoked one close to bedtime for the past few days.

I have dreamed that giant birds are ripping flesh from. My back and I am running around with a sword murdering superheroes.

I have dreamed that I am in a submarine filled with people I know and I am running around with a flintlock pistol in a gunfight with fish men.

I have dreamed that I am some kind of missile and am bombing Weird sporting events that I do not understand.

I wouldn‚Äôt characterize these as nightmares, but as bizarre and vivid dreams.

My girlfriend has told me that I am snoring in an unusual and unpleasant way.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?Hi, I've seen clips of Rogan's podcasts over the years and enjoyed them, recently been binging. I started with Jordan Peterson and then Niel DeGrasse Tyson and really want to find more great podcasts.  I geeked out on the NDT episode and would like more science/cosmology based ones to watch.  I watched the first couple Randall Carlson episodes and really liked them, even though the content was basically identical.  Can you guys recommend some good ones?It feels like trying to stay awake and keep drinking when you're already  drunk. There is a part of your primitive brain telling you not to let your faggot body win. But the only people who do that all the time are alcoholics. 


I'm pretty far left and liberal but its so tiresome to argue  against Jordan Peterson's supporters. Give me 13 diet coke and whiskeys and I'll stay up all night fighting over nonsense if I have nothing else to do. But even that is wearing thin  I'd fucking rather just go to sleep and lucid dream while I wait for the caliphate to take over. 
Maybe I just haven‚Äôt watched enough of Joe but you people *constantly* nail mimicking him. Sometimes I can‚Äôt tell if he actually said that or if you guys are just shit posting.

Probably both.

10/10 Joe Rogan impersonationsWhen Jamie brings something up the screen is so bright it makes Rorgans head shine like a light. Why is it so bright? Is it 5k or some shit?I've wondered this for years.

1) Use a single wide angle camera so that I can watch reactions as well as speakers. - So much vital information is being lost here.

2) If you insist on single focus deep zoom camera (Whatever it's called). Write a script so that it automatically switches to the camera angle if a microphone's input peaks a threshold for a short duration of seconds. This way when jamie is busy, it doesn't get stuck on one person.Anyone else finds that creepy?My name is Ben Greenfield. I'm 33 years old. I believe in taking care of my chakras, and a ketogenic diet and a rigorous kettlebell routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy from listening to binaural beats for 10 hours, I'll diffuse some essential oils while I ram my asshole with a glass rod using killer bee honey as lube. I can do it for hours now. After I turn off the diffuser, I use a Nigerian dwarf goat dung mask. In the shower, I use a structured water filter to align the oxygen molecules in my body. Then a home made coconut oil cocoa nib spirulina kombucha enema. And on the face, an exfoliating Swiss chard gel. Then apply a grass fed whey facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my chakras. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no WiFi signals, because WiFi signals close your calcium gateways and makes you look older. Then miracle noodle moisturiser, then an anti-aging cricket balm followed by a final round of stem cell injections in my dick. I have a hard time remembering all 100 or so of the ranked UFC fighters. Obviously Cormier v. Stipe in July is going to be huge as well as Ferguson v. Kabib...

I'm personally excited for the Cerrone fight on Feb 18th. I think that's a great card. James Vick is my favorite UFC fighter and he's finally getting good fights at 12-1. Tbh I think he will fight for the belt in the coming years, whether he fights Conor or whoever takes it from him.

I'm curious to see if there's anybody coming up I should be watching out for... the JRE MMA shows aren't that great of an informative source IMO bc it's too all over the place and, again, I have a problem remembering names.
It's really not around on YouTube. He doesn't seem like he'd be very funny. I remember one time he was talking about a bit he had about fucking a dolphin and that doesn't seem too funny to me.He seems tones down a bit. 
Fight companion never seems to have Bryan, Eddie and Brendan combo anymore.See here: https://jrelibrary.com/upcoming-guests/

Should be interesting. Pinker has been requested many times as a guest over the years. 

I hope Joe will let him talk the majority of the time, the same way he lets Sam Harris talk, whenever he's been on. What was the name of that bible app or website he mentioned. Where everybody was able to comment or put there own interpretation? Sounds super interesting to dive into I started making a post about Chevy Chase being a guest, but seriously, get Cambo for fucks sake. I‚Äôve heard Joe mention this site but real fake news.com has no content and I can‚Äôt find it googling. I was looking at an old clip of Jordan speaking with Joe about religion, and he mentioned a guy named Jerry Manderin. Any idea who this is, I tried a google search and didn't find anything. Thanks.Tom Segura's new one is perfect.Totally ignorant on this subject and curious.Rogan froths on him, calls him the funniest man alive etc. But i rarely find myself laughing when a Diaz episode comes out, he‚Äôs not unfunny but I think rogan gets way funnier guests on. Just want to see if I‚Äôm alone on this or not!Does anyone know just how much bitcoin Rogan/JRE, or however that worked, ended up donating to Justin Wren?How about a weekly thread listing other podcasts that frequent JRE guests have been on. I love everything Jordan Peterson is on, and I was super pumped to find more podcasts from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/7uxafi/it_was_a_good_week_for_podcasts_bill_burr_on_your/ as well as a few others)Not to long ago I remember Joey Diaz talking on a Church of Whats Happening podcast about Barry Sea.  He was a pilot who flew smuggle planes for the CIA and the contras.  At one point Joey references a movie he saw about it and says something like "Barry Seal loved mind altering substances" Does anyone remember which episode this was?  And I am sorry to ask on a Rogan subreddit but I couldn't find much better places to ask.So I went to go see Bert Kreischer last night here in Boston and decided to take 4gs of shrooms. I got the tickets because I‚Äôve only seen him on Joe‚Äôs podcast, but have never watched any of his stand up. I had very low expectations, which explains me taking so many shrooms. I arrived tripping sac, and was immediately disappointed by the crowd. I‚Äôd say 65% of the people were there for the wrong reasons; I‚Äôm talking about the people that ONLY know him from ‚Äúthe machine‚Äù story. Let‚Äôs just say these people were fucking weird. 

The show starts and I‚Äôm feeling good. Bert comes out absolutely hammered. He‚Äôs literally stumbling around (9:45pm show). I‚Äôm already laughing my ass off by just seeing him. He starts his routine, and it really didn‚Äôt even feel like a routine. I felt like I was getting fucked up with someone, and they were making me laugh by just telling stories and being themselves. Bert was a naturally funny guy and an AMAZING comedian. He doesn‚Äôt seem canned, rehearsed, or scripted like Joe sometimes does. In all, it was an absolutely mind blowing show. I was blown away and laughed harder than I have at any of Joe Rogan‚Äôs live shit. I‚Äôm just here to say that I don‚Äôt think enough people really appreciate Bert‚Äôs live standup. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but his live shit is far better than Joe‚Äôs. Besides the shitty ‚Äúbrad‚Äù type dudes yelling out ‚Äúdo the machine!!‚Äù every fucking 5 minutes, it was phenomenal and much better than I thought it was going to be. I have gained a lot of respect for Bert and he now goes down in my books as one of the best comedians of our generation. Everybody, disregard the whole ‚Äúmachine‚Äù story and start opening your eyes to who he is as an actual comedian. 

Side note: He did in fact do the machine story, but very reluctantly. You could tell he was fed up with it at this point and kind of ran through it very fast (which I‚Äôm glad happened). To all those people who came just to hear ‚Äúthe machine‚Äù story, fuck you and open your eyes to real comedy. 

Edit: I grow shrooms and eat them quite often. Everybody shitting on me for being on shrooms and calling out the fans, please try to be realistic here. By being there for the "wrong reasons", I mean that they were heckling Bert by screaming out "machine" quotes trying to make people laugh. A lot of people were being very drunk, loud, and obnoxious. They cared more about trying to make people around them laugh than the actual comedy. It's an Amazon original series from the creator of Gilmore Girls. It's about a housewife in the late 1950s who pursues a career in stand-up comedy. The thing I liked about it was how it showed the main character, Midge, bombing at so many of her shows. And, it portrays the evolution of her jokes and routine. This type of stuff is discussed constantly whenever Joe has a comedian on and they talk about their early days. I think anyone that is a fan of stand-up comedy might enjoy this show. Is it all HGH? I love Joe, but if you look at News Radio Joe vs Joe now his head has swelled. Just curious.I live in this country and I can't think of a single personHey everyone, I was hoping to find more episodes like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3uwKvnKTik)

I know that I should be looking at fight companion episodes but which specific ones in addition other JRE episodes would you recommend. Thanks so much guysPaul Stamets went on about Big Portabello.

And that's fucking hilarious. I run a podcast wiki network called [Podpedia](https://podpedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), and am looking for podcast wikis to add to it. A podcast wiki can host content such as episode transcripts, summaries, and fan art, and can serve as a informational database for podcast listeners. If anyone is interested in creating a wiki for the Joe Rogan Experience, create an account on Podpedia and I can help you create the wiki. A basic to do list would be to create articles for podcast episodes, a list of guests that have appeared on the podcast, and to upload fan art to the wiki.I have seen these two terms conflated time and time again. This is another instance where the left and right are just talking past one another.

Globalization is the increasing trend of interconnectedness and capital flow between sovereign states that make up our world. This has been going on for years, and barring a major global catastrophe, will likely continue to increase. This is NOT what the right means when they say "globalism". 

Globalism is the idea that our planet should have no borders and a single, unified world government run by the plutocratic elite. This is what the Alex Jones-type people are screaming about, and to be fair to them, they are right to be yelling. A government that massive by default would have to be totalitarian and dystopic. That is the only way to get the seething masses of humanity to fall into lock-step like that.

For sure, discuss and hold people accountable for their ideas, but don't just dismiss them because you THINK you know what they mean.In a response video posted today, everyone's favorite Seltzer boy outlined talks he was having with the JRE Podcast pointing out near the end of the video that he will be coming on the show come February 27th.Neil Tyson &amp; flat earth guy. 
I personally think i‚Äôll enjoy it no matter how bad it goes. I like when there‚Äôs back and forth on the show. 

What are your guys thoughts on it? edit - i linked bad:
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/04/trump-twitter-russians-release-the-memo-216935

"On Tuesday morning‚Äîthe day after the House Intelligence Committee voted along partisan lines to send Rep. Devin Nunes‚Äô memo, alleging abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, to President Donald Trump for declassification‚Äîpresidential adviser Kellyanne Conway was confronted with the idea that Russian trolls were promoting the #releasethememo hashtag online. She was offended. Russian trolls, she told a television interviewer, ‚Äúhave nothing to do with releasing the memo‚Äîthat was a vote of the intelligence committee.‚Äù But her assertion is incorrect. The vote marked the culmination of a targeted, 11-day information operation that was amplified by computational propaganda techniques and aimed to change both public perceptions and the behavior of American lawmakers.

. . .

This bears repeating: Computational propaganda‚Äîdefined as ‚Äúthe use of information and communication technologies to manipulate perceptions, affect cognition, and influence behavior‚Äù‚Äîhas been used, successfully, to manipulate the perceptions of the American public and the actions of elected officials.

The analysis below, conducted by our team from the social media intelligence group New Media Frontier, shows that the #releasethememo campaign was fueled by, and likely originated from, computational propaganda."

more sample text:

"Use any basic analytical software to scroll through the early promoters of #releasethememo, and you‚Äôll see most of the accounts meet basic criteria for bot/troll/cyborg suspicion‚Äîwhat the Atlantic Council‚Äôs open-source intelligence research group DFRLab describes as ‚Äúactivity, amplification, and anonymity.‚Äù There is also a consistent theme in the list of identities‚Äîthe repetition of certain words (deplorable, Texas, mom, veteran) and certain first names; use of an American flag emoji at the end of the name; specific numbers or patterns of numerical sequences associated with bots; names changed to hashtags, or frequently shifted between trending right-media topics (Benghazi, NFL boycott, the memo, the emails); photos that aren‚Äôt faces, or not unobscured faces, or certainly not of them if they are.

There is little chance an organic or incidental community, even of friends or acquaintances, would look this way online so holistically, tweeting together in such tight intervals. Several of the accounts involved in the initial promotion of this hashtag have subsequently been restricted or suspended by Twitter. Online data analysts said many accounts used to promote the hashtag were recently created, with more being created and disappearing after the hashtag appeared. Thousands still had the default profile photos. CNN‚Äôs analysis found that hundreds of accounts created after the hashtag first appeared were fueling the viral trend."

"A recent analysis from DFRLab mapped out how modern Russian propaganda is highly effective because so many diverse messaging elements are so highly integrated. Far-right elements in the United States have learned to emulate this strategy, and have used it effectively with their own computational propaganda tactics‚Äîas demonstrated by the ‚ÄúTwitter rooms‚Äù and documented alt-right bot-nets pushing a pro-Trump narrative.

This gets at a deeper issue: The problem with the term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is that it is completely wrong, denoting a passive intention. What is happening on social media is very real; it is not passive; and it is information warfare. There is very little argument among analytical academics about the overall impact of ‚Äúpolitical bots‚Äù that seek to influence how we think, evaluate and make decisions about the direction of our countries and who can best lead us‚Äîeven if there is still difficulty in distinguishing whose disinformation is whose. Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher with Oxford University‚Äôs Computational Propaganda Research Project who has helped to document the impact of "polbot" activity, told me: ‚ÄúOften, it‚Äôs hard to tell where a particular story comes from. Alt-right groups and Russian disinformation campaigns are often indistinguishable since their goals often overlap. But what really matters is the tools that these groups use to achieve their goals: Computational propaganda serves to distort the political process and amplify fringe views in ways that no previous communication technology could.‚Äù

------------------

we should all be more wary of social media. The more you read about it - bots, foreign tampering, targeting phishing attempts, about the ability of political campaigns to data mine our posts and tailor messaging suited for us, etc - the scarier it gets.Does Joe read these? 

Mexico is attractive not only because of tax incentives but also no safety restrictions. If you die in a Mexican factory nobody cares.Several years ago there was a phrase he used to cite (from someone else) in regards to virtue signalling. It was something along the lines of:

"Your need to appear down is eclipsed by your something something something."Would love to have people to keep each other accountable and get JACKED togetherAre there any books Joe has said that he has read, recommended people to read, said he is reading or going to read, or books people have recommended to him?  

I know that this might be a duplicate post so I‚Äôm sorry. If so then link me to the original post please :)

Thanks in advance!

I barely have an hour to dedicate to a workout, as if I'm gonna do another 45 minutes of smashing my joints with kettlebells and other masochistic exercises just to feel like I did before working out.

Joe advocating BJJ then saying how fucked up his neck and back is doesn't do any favours either. 

Anybody can beat up someone who has a fucked up neck, regardless of their training, is my point. 

Why work out to get stronger if you just get weaker, and need to torture yourself to get to normal again?I think its really good and funny.  Hopefully I can get it made and get Joe Rogan to do a cameo![Link](https://www.fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/)

Hunter S. Thompson‚Äôs Letter on Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life
In April of 1958, Hunter S. Thompson was 22 years old when he wrote this letter to his friend Hume Logan in response to a request for life advice.

Thompson's letter, found in Letters of Note, offers some of the most thoughtful and profound advice I've ever come across.

******************************************

April 22, 1958
57 Perry Street
New York City

Dear Hume,

You ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal‚Äî to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.

I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.

‚ÄúTo be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether ‚Äôtis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù (Shakespeare)

And indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you‚Äôve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don‚Äôt see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect‚Äî between the two things I‚Äôve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.

But why not float if you have no goal? That is another question. It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty. So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he‚Äôs not after the ‚Äúbig rock candy mountain,‚Äù the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?

The answer‚Äî and, in a sense, the tragedy of life‚Äî is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It‚Äôs not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.

So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?

The answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on ‚Äúthe meaning of man‚Äù and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term ‚Äúgod only knows‚Äù purely as an expression.) There‚Äôs very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I‚Äôm the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.

I‚Äôm going to steer clear of the word ‚Äúexistentialism,‚Äù but you might keep it in mind as a key of sorts. You might also try something called Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, and another little thing called Existentialism: From Dostoyevsky to Sartre. These are merely suggestions. If you‚Äôre genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you‚Äôre doing, then give those books a wide berth. (Let sleeping dogs lie.) But back to the answer. As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.

But don‚Äôt misunderstand me. I don‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt BE firemen, bankers, or doctors‚Äî but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires‚Äî including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.

As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal), he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).

In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life‚Äî the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.

Let‚Äôs assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow (all pre-defined paths, of course). And let‚Äôs assume that you can‚Äôt see any real purpose in any of the eight. THEN‚Äî and here is the essence of all I‚Äôve said‚Äî you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH.

Naturally, it isn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds. You‚Äôve lived a relatively narrow life, a vertical rather than a horizontal existence. So it isn‚Äôt any too difficult to understand why you seem to feel the way you do. But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.

So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to look; I don‚Äôt know what to look for.‚Äù

And there‚Äôs the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don‚Äôt know‚Äî is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.

If I don‚Äôt call this to a halt, I‚Äôm going to find myself writing a book. I hope it‚Äôs not as confusing as it looks at first glance. Keep in mind, of course, that this is MY WAY of looking at things. I happen to think that it‚Äôs pretty generally applicable, but you may not. Each of us has to create our own credo‚Äî this merely happens to be mine.

If any part of it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense, by all means call it to my attention. I‚Äôm not trying to send you out ‚Äúon the road‚Äù in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that‚Äî no one HAS to do something he doesn‚Äôt want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that‚Äôs what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You‚Äôll have lots of company.

And that‚Äôs it for now. Until I hear from you again, I remain,

your friend,
Hunter
This is not a shit-on-Joe post. I am looking for a constructive discussion of the show.

Once all the world‚Äôs celebrities and academics have heard of the tragedy of Fritz Hauber, the show can‚Äôt just stop. What do you think Joe could do to keep the format fresh and interesting for years to come? It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs made a huge investment into this being his future.

What about multiple hosts? Other hosts having shows on his network? A platform for lectures from guys like JP?  The debate he‚Äôs hosting is exciting and a cool step forward. 

Any other ideas?If not, any reason?After 2 opponents dropped out, this bout actually happened. The fight starts around the 7:15 mark. 

[500K ppv buys, easy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lOtEzwWX9yg)Im rewatching that episode with Paul Stamets and Paul refuses to speak about the negative side effects of Portobello mushroom or essentially his life will be at risk. What the actual fuck. Anyone have any more information on this? John Anthony West recently passed away after experiencing rapid health decline following his victory against cancer. It is unfortunate to lose someone of such a caliber. 

R.I.P.

[Here's the podcast for those interested.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGu7MLp574A)

[Source] (https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=john%20anthony%20west&amp;typd&amp;lang=en)I've thought this listening to past podcasts and it came up again in the recent Joey Diaz one. They were talking about Kevin Hart and some Iglesias guy selling out the Staples Center and seemed completely mind-blown by the 21,000 capacity.  
  
My question is this - is it really such a massive ground-breaking achievement or are Rogan&amp;co. just stuck in such a cliquey LA bubble that they just think they are the centre of the universe and nothing is happening elsewhere. I only know about the UK but comedians are playing sold out arenas most weekends. I've noticed that Daniele Bolelli has disagreed with Jordan Peterson on Facebook a lot. I'm wondering what you guys would think of a podcast discussion with Danielle Bolelli and Jordan Peterson? It seems to me it would be a fun and interesting podcast.Most of you probably knew it was coming in between the words, herniated and disc Just sayin' ya know.For fuck's sake, there are professional Russian athletes in the UFC, what the fuck was he talking about? Does he think the Russian Federation is the USSR? 

If you're talking just Russia, there are many professional sports there, like football, basketball, hockey and many other ones where athletes earn more than enough to live from them. There are Russian MMA organizations for crying out loud... Can someone make a starter pack of whenever Cameron Hanes comes on the podcast?  
Listing things like Ethical hunting, elk,bull,more elk and bow hunting.I remember that podcast when he first tried it and he was actually into it. Does he dip now? Cuz it looks like it's in his bottom lip but I never see him put any tobacco in.Joe just announced plans to set up the conference room they have and have lan parties to play video games. 
Mentioned using twitch as well.


It just can‚Äôt disappoint Psychedelics, iso tanks, and philosophers 

mma and concussions I‚Äôve been trying to find the name of the guy, that his ultimate goal is to recreate his father. I‚Äôve heard Joe mention it a couple times but can‚Äôt find the guys name.
 A few years ago I was listening to a JRE episode and he did a quick impression of one of those languages that uses clicks and other odd sounding noises. He just did it in passing and the guest didn‚Äôt react too much but it made me laugh so hard I had to rewind it like 20 times. I want to say he had Kevin Smith on maybe but at any rate, I just remembered it and wanted to laugh at it again. Anyone remember this?I've been reading about how the CIA assisted the Taliban and found some disturbing information.  

Local communities in the Middle East and South Asia have schools for children similar to Christian Sunday schools.  In these schools they typically teach everything from math to religion.  In an effort to sway the local populace to side with the Taliban and against the government and Russians, the CIA (with help from the University of Nebraska) designed books for the students, one named ‚ÄúThe Alphabet of Jihad Literacy‚Äù.  These were issued from the 1980's to the 2000's and even locally reprinted for distribution.

Here are some excerpts from these books.

"T" is for "topak," or gun. How do you use the word? "My uncle has a gun," the entry reads. "He does jihad with the gun."

‚ÄúOur religion is Islam. Muhammad is our leader. All the Russians and infidels are our enemy.‚Äù

‚ÄúKabul is the capital of our dear country,‚Äù reads the entry for the letter K. ‚ÄúNo one can invade our country. Only Muslim Afghans can rule over this country.‚Äù

"Oppression is forbidden. The Russians are oppressors. We perform jihad against the oppressors‚Ä¶"

"The Mujahideen missiles rain down like dew on the Russians. My brother gave me good news that the Russians in our country taste defeat‚Ä¶"

I always just assumed the CIA was more supplying the Taliban with weapons and intelligence but they really brainwashed GENERATIONS of children.

Below are links to prove this isn't a conspiracy but a fact lol.  Also there are many books on the matter.

https://wondersofpakistan.wordpress.com/2010/02/20/a-is-for-allah-j-is-for-jihad/There is a lot of hate on this sub for Joe. I've been listening to the podcast for four years. The first year was the honeymoon year and he could do nothing wrong. Fast forward to year three and was just about as annoying to listen to as my wife.

The solution, I went and fucked around with some other podcasts and he is becoming a lot easier to listen to, I'm also far more selective than I ever use to be. What I don't want to be is some bitch who comes on this sub just whinge about the good old days.Wouldn't this be an amazing podcast?https://youtu.be/qNAScKkzgtg Am I in a bad mood, or did anyone else feel the same way?  He‚Äôs just rapid fire steamrolling over Duncan, or at a minimum topping Duncan‚Äôs over-the-top ideas with his own. It sounds competitive or something.  I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I‚Äôm just being an asshole because I‚Äôm at work.  I have some suggestions for the website and I was wondering where I can contact the site administrators if that's even possible? I can't find any way to contact anyone about website issues. Any help would be appreciated.What links do you guys think Young Jamie has in his favorites ready to be pulled up at a moments notice? The chimp testicle/brain post made me think of this. I‚Äôll start.

I'm just curious to know if he's ever considered having him on, or if it is even likely Elon would agree to come on.

What do you guys think?Has a new marijuana come out?He takes 4-6 months off from podcasting. Goes on a big Asia tour and has experiences down there, hunting in Australia/Africa, spends more time with his family, reading, getting new perspectives, etc, even things like volunteer work.
Then the anticipation of his return, and with distance from all the identity politics and recycled thoughts he mentions on almost every podcast. That would be fascinating. 

Edit: im not saying he SHOULD do it, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôd be interesting.
Edit 2: oh, so nobody thinks this would be interesting, ok. 
Edit 3: oh, people actually do think this would be interesting, ok :)I don't think I've missed an episode and don't remember a reason given.This is just a little observation, anyone notice how joe used to be so against the moon landing being real and things of the like, he says on video that he can lee his mouth shut he just wants to know the truth NASA cia nsa whoever I just wanna know. After that he changes his mind on the moon landing and space travel and the like, now he has a massive new studio with ALL the perks. I could be looking to far into this and he may just be absolutely killing it at life but seems like a coincidence.. I'm watching this Duncan episode and they're talking about the moon landing.  Joe will say on countless episodes that he is over that conspiracy theory.  Jamie starts speaking up a little, he clearly did some research the last few episodes and....Joe won't have it.  He fucking hates when Jamie boy tries to "beat" him in a discussion.  It's very strange after them knowing each other for what?  3 years or so?  It's so obvious, Jamie qualifies everything he says with "I could be wrong" or "I wasn't there".  Obviously he feels the need to do this every time to hedge his bets with the big man.  Joe should chill on that, or low key just tell him "hey don't speak anymore unless it's to back me up".Ok I know this is a long shot but I'm looking for an episode with Duncan. Its a really old episode, but at one point they starting going off on something about aliens or vampires or something. They were imagining an alien race that forces you to suck their cocks, and it gives them life force, something like that. I can't remember the details but it had me laughing so hard and I haven't been able to find it since (they might have mentioned the movie Twilight). Anybody else remember this?I think religion is going away first, there seems to be a lot of people realizing its bullshit. But between banking and government i dont know which people will outgrow first. Joe ‚ÄúJaimie can you pull this up‚Äù Rogan Anyone else think Joe was acting differently during Duncans #1075 podcast? He was super defensive at points, way more loud and constant talking, and wouldn't stop interrupting

 I love Joe and think he brings up interesting and great points but its annoying when he has guests on and ends up speaking more than them. I couldn't help but think he's on something more than just being high off weed or that fucking caveman coffee or whatever. Hes way too ampedI've never heard him describe heterosexual sex in way that didn't sound like a gay man repeating things his straight friends say. He could be bi, of course, but he has a pretty intense appreciation for masculinity. When has he ever described a woman with the same passion as he describes Francis Ngannou or Yoel Romero? No longer wanted association with the group of uniques there, and it's gone.

210,000 members and 250,000 threads. I have a friend who is convinced high cholesterol is caused by eating red meat. I know I've heard Joe talk about it with numerous guests that are experts in nutrition. Does anyone know what episodes or what guest I could reference to find this topic? Around 2:23:00 of the recent Duncan Trussell episode, Duncan brings up the emergence of white nationalists and how some people are treating them mildly and giving air time to people like Richard Spencer. Joe immediately cuts him off and goes "Who's doing that??...I think you're exaggerating. I think you mean Steve Bannon."

Dude, literally your pal [Dave Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLFMECRN2Xg) had a 1.5 hour conversation with the dude. How can you challenge something so confidently when there's an example of someone you know personally participating in it?

I'm not even making a claim on whether or not it's valuable to talk to people with ugly ideas like Spencer and figure out what they actually believe. There's certainly an argument to be made that it's better to get them out in the open. It's just super frustrating how Joe will shut something down when he clearly has no idea whatsoever about it. Sounds like the RB is gone (or at least on hiatus).

Post your memories of your favorite or memorable threads.

I'd have to say the one that I remember the most was this guy from a southern state in the US that decided to live in his car and people on the RB would send him money and meet up with him when he hobo'ed into their town.  I don't remember a lot about him, but he had a podcast on how to be a 'ladies man' (or something) and he was having trouble with his own wife and eventually one time he got really drunk and posted nudes of her (which were gone by the time I woke up and read the thread again).  

The other memory I have was of the one guy who Rogan befriended and had him out to visit and the guy was really socially awkward and ended up 'feuding' with Rogan a lot on the boards (gay crush or something).  He was a mod at some point, but then he was eventually banned and he came over here to Reddit where he posted in /JoeRogan2 (or something similar).  Maybe his Reddit username was Steal_From_Asprey or something?

Jesus Christ my memory is shit... :(

Post your memorable/favorite threads.
Has anyone tried sprouting their own broccoli like Dr. Rhonda Patrick mentioned one of the times she was on? Curious to know if anyone tried it and saw any noticeable benefits.

Also, feel free to either praise and/or blast Dr. Patrick if you know her theories are or aren't beneficialIn the recent Trussell episode, Rogan talks about how science was born when Descartes had a hallucination/angel visitation where he was told that "through number and measure, nature can be conquered."

This is an anecdote I assume he got from Terence McKenna, but does anybody know whether it's true? Other than McKenna, last time I tried looking into this I could only find a description of a vivid dream Descartes had (not an angel visitation) where his dream self suffered a sudden limpness throughout his whole left side, and had to take refuge in a university against a very strong wind. 

Like Terence McKenna I happen to be an avid reader of the I Ching, and I wonder if McKenna didn't conflate his story with the following text (from the 60th Hexagram, "restrictive regulations"/"limitations"): 

&gt;...The superior person creates number and measure, and examines the nature of virtue and correct conduct.If Eddie could just get high enough, he would see that the world is a globe.Not a big deal and I am not Christan *per se  but it is mentioned:

John 6:54

Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last dayDoes anyone remember what podcast this subject came up on? Joe and a guest were discussing the future of autonomous cars and how they could possibly own and pay themselves off.Ok bros think I might have fucked up. There's this dope taco place but I ended up just going alone stoned out of my mind. I have tons of people I could have gone with, some even girls, but I just felt like chillin alone. I think I got way to paranoid! Feel like People talking about me and a nice old man tried talking to me wgen i got up to get my food and he knew i was baked but he loved it

Fuck yea tacosIs this sub lost to Brogan memes and edgy 4chan schlubs? I just feel like it's all about getting the laugh and not the substance of experience we all signed up for back in 2011. I think Kyle is a great debator and correct on most issues and I bet Rogan will agree with him a lot. I'm not sure whats gonna happen with Jimmy, I know he is happy to talk about conspiracies. I'd love to see Jimmy dore on with eddie bravoOn the Duncan Trussel show that just happened. I was listening and at around 1:23:00 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5018&amp;v=qNAScKkzgtg) Duncan says something that Joe doesn't entertain for long.

Do you think that there has been some intense shit discussed and he cant talk about it on air because of the sensitivity? Or he could just play it off wacky guests talking wacky things. 

hmmmm...This repeated meme by Joe has been my biggest rage inducing, screaming at my dashboard, part of his podcast for the past year or so. I don't know how many times I've heard Joe say some variation of "*ONE* guy being the leader of 350 million people... making all the decisions for 350 million people... just crazy". Yea Joe, it is crazy. It's almost like America literally agreed with you, and broke away from monarchy to create a nation where "ONE GUY" *isn't* the sole "leader" of everyone... 

&amp;nbsp;

In one episode he literally said we need something like a "council of elders" and I almost lost my shit.

&amp;nbsp;

Joe, buddy... have you heard of:  
[Supreme Court](http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/09/28/896/504/694940094001_5592115198001_5592107426001-vs.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1)  
or  
[Congress](https://www.americangrit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/congress006-1.jpg)?

&amp;nbsp;

I want to scream this at him every time he brings up how "crazy" it is that one guy is the leader of everyone in the country...  
#HE'S FUCKING NOT!I'm curious if Joe has ever mentioned that his house in Bell Canyon is literally a few miles away from the worst nuclear meltdown in US history?  Joe seems like he lives a very health and unpolluted lifestyle, I'm sure he know about the history of the area he lives in.  I wonder if he's ever brought it up in any of the podcasts.

https://data.nbcstations.com/national/KNBC/la-nuclear-secret/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Susana_Field_Laboratory#Accidents_and_site_contaminationI just don‚Äôt understand how Joe can truly believe that Jones tested positive for steroids cause he snorted cocaine which was cut with creatine that came from a dodgy vat in China. ‚Äú I totally believe it ‚Äú like wtf man, Jones has tested positive for steroids on TWO occasions. I don‚Äôt buy the dick pills excuse either, whoever sold the steroids to Jones probably told him if he tests positive just blame it on the Dick pills. 

Like is this guy that fkn dumb to believe such a stupid story. Matt Brown seemed a bit dumbfounded by Joe‚Äôs stupidity when talking about the cut cocaine. 

I have a feeling that the UFC is giving Joe a little hand to push specific agendas.You know what I'm talking about? For example he does it at the beginning of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0nZSAXk28c).

Is there a name for that? What is it supposed to represent, if anything? He does it all the time in his periscopes and I love Uncle Joey but that shit does annoy me to no end...I‚Äôm genuinely asking. 

When I see he title and links to his podcasts I assume it is a fan sub, but when I start reading content everybody is shitting all over him. Is that true disagreement, satire, a mix?

I‚Äôm perplexed by the culture of this sub.Duncan is consistently one of my favorite guests and favorite people. Just an awesome and cool guy. I'd love to be friends with him and be more like him.

But when he starts talking about conspiracy theories or the DMT realm or interdimensional whatever, I pretty much have to skip ahead or shut the podcast off. I know some of it's in jest and metaphorical, but he also seems to genuinely believe some crazy shit, so it's difficult for me to get any value from what he's saying. I've taken psychedelics before and am familiar with many of the feelings and ideas he's talking about, but he really takes it to another level, into what feels like pseudoscience woo woo.I've noticed a few very old, very few comment accounts recently.Cause my Mike gets lit the fuck up. I don't think I've ever heard Joe talk shit on any imaginary character other than Mike. This isn't a rhetorical question, I'm genuinely curious.

I know it's been a somewhat consistent trend with this subreddit but I think it's crossed over from minority to majority recently as far as the amount of people criticizing and shitting joe in subreddit posts and especially the podcast thread.

This doesn't seem to be every now and then, it consistently every single podcast at this point. Not all, but a majority of the critical comments are sarcasm, mocking, insulting etc. as opposed to a straight out disagreement about joe's views or a unemotional criticism about his character or the show.

It seems undeniable to me that a majority of you guys don't like rogan or the podcast anymore. Why do you guys still listen to him?I had never heard of Prof. Pinker before listening and didn't know anything about him; however, I found pretty much everything he said was measured, intelligent, and insightful. 

I live in a large suburban development. And I'm amazed by the pessimism in regards to crime, quality of life, and general state of things I hear from all the people around me. I always tell them, "This is the safest and best time to ever be alive." And the all disagree. 

Good to hear someone else trying to spread the word.The rough quote is: ‚ÄúI hate people who whinge about exercise like ughhh it‚Äôs so hard, shut up, you remind me of a baby‚Äù 

Or something along those lines

Episode would be great if anyone knows, I can‚Äôt remember anything about the episode as a whole I'm seeing a lot of memes and shitposting getting upvoted all the time on here. It's cool, and I see absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I'd be more interested in a deeper and more nuanced discussion of the podcast.

I feel the subreddit is headed the way of most mainstream subs (lower effort content, completely unrelated gifs and memes get upvoted the most), and I'm wondering if now would be the right time to branch into a different sub.

There would be a greater emphasis on takeaways from episodes, critiques of guests' views, reviews of episodes, etc...

Does something like this already exist that I'm not aware of?Why do you guys hate on Joey? What did he do that you guys hate his guts and downvote every good comment about him? (You can debate whether he‚Äôs a funny comedian or not, but I want to know what the man did wrong)Why, when and how lol?So I‚Äôve been considering getting one of his higher primate fanny packs but can‚Äôt seem to find any other pics, info or any kind of review on it. Any leads?Is it true ‚Äî as presented by Chris Kesser on JRE #1037 02:31:42-ish ‚Äî that an ad agency created the condition ‚Äúerectile dysfunction‚Äù? That it wasn‚Äôt a medical condition before the ad agency‚Äôs involvement? 

Or did they just come up with the name of something that was an issue?

OR a little bit of both?it's one of those sayings that initially makes sense because when we think of racists we think of white people e.g. The KKK, The alt right Richard Spencer etc.

 But then when you engage your brain he's saying that of all the 65 million people who voted for Hillary there are zero racists? It's just that ridiculous view that only white people can be racist. 

For example some of the most racist people I've met are Asian. 
I guess part of the reason is that they know they can get away saying things that white people can't. I don't live in the US but are there really no Mexican American Clinton voters that hold racist views on black people? Come on. Around 30 minutes in on the podcast Johann talks about depression and abuse. When he said the simple line the doctors used ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terribly sorry that happened to you. That should have never happened ‚Äî would you like to talk about it?‚Äù I broke. I wasn‚Äôt abused but I witnessed it in many forms as a child and had a really tough time with depression. Someone just saying sorry really hit me deep. Anyone else get a bit of a reaction to that?i didnt know this was a place people go to crank off to joe roganSo, I've been listening to this podcast; I'm about 2/3s of the way through and they've been debating changing society as a cure for depression.

Joe seems more inclined to say change yourself, which may be true in the states, but coming from he U.K. (As with his guest) society isn't the same beast. Even in parts of America, Joes failing to recognise so many people simply can't change themselves because they are a mould of their society. These sub-cultures are more set, comparative to his flowing world of L.A. 

Would just like to hear some discussion around the matter, from people around the world. ...and young Jamie is fucking zooming in on a picture of bigfoot while Joe and Schaub discuss it. Can't make this shit up.Is whole wheat and other grains like oats really bad for you? I looked into What‚Äôs With Wheat and it didn‚Äôt seem very scientific. ...when in reality he has complex opinions that don't neatly fall into the ideological traps of right or left wing politics. Fuck off with your T R I B A L I S M.Obviously bleu cheese will always be a GOAT moment but any other very notable highlights that get you every time?
Me personally is from #669 when Joe asked 
‚ÄúYou ever have a girl you dated kill herself?‚Äù
And Diaz responds
‚ÄúNo...But they shoulda‚ÄùJoe loves his sound bites, such as 

"Vegans have a hard time getting B12, its a real issue"

But of course he believes that not because he knows anything about sources of B12 but because he heard it and that is good enough for him.

Simply being informed on foods with B12 shuts it down.

What are some of your favorite sound bites from Joe?r/Tower7

I have looked into it, and if you don't upload some ridiculous shit, I will kill the sub. Last warning!Apologies if someone has already brought this up but if you haven't seen the show yet check it out, some very good episodes and plenty of variety with the guests- its on Netflix now. Seems like Rogan would be a prime guest with his interest in Comedians, Cars, and Coffee... Get on that shit Joe! 

Former NBA player Jalen Rose was recently on Bill Simmons podcast. I found it annoying that after almost every statement Simmons made Jalen Rose would say, ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù. On Schaub‚Äôs latest appearance on JRE he has begun to do this as well and I find it to be really agitating on two levels. 1st: Everything Schaub does is 100% derivative. 2nd: Repeatedly saying ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù after someone makes a statement is a subtle way of implying that you‚Äôre a source of authority. Either Schaub has stolen this dumb ass tick from Jalen Rose or this is something they teach ex-athletes turned commentators. I have never noticed this from Schaub before and find it suspicious that as soon I get annoyed by Jalen Rose for it I start hearing it from Schaub too.Can I get a list of the podcast joe has done with astrophysicist and science like guest? O the real deep podcast guys about simulation theory and all that jazz. Truly a philosopher for the ages. The dmt video sounds interresting to watch, can't seem to find it thoughEvery YouTube episode has some version of Joe "Something" Rogan as the top voted comments.
For Example:
Joe "My 7 year old is hilarious" RoganÔªø
Joe "I got an indoor archery range" RoganÔªø
Joe ‚ÄúAcquiring stuff isn‚Äôt important, let me tell you about my cars and lobster dinners‚Äù RoganÔªø
[Examples from Tom Segura episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nznRgMaGna4)
Can someone explain where this stems from?Rogan is a bastion of free speech, Rogan himself being a long rifle/bow hunter. I'm Canadian, I own a 12 gauge shotgun, 10 round 22., 30-06 bolt action rifle. Can we here at r/joerogan have an open discussion in regards to bipartisan gun control. I know most Americans agree on background checks, gun show loophole, mental health checks etc... but the lobbying of the NRA hold such legislation back. 

I care about my southern neighbours and want a solution, is there such a thing? 
Spare me the knives and cars argument both things which are a key to modern life in 2018. Round Earth Shill? Flat Earth Denier?  Flat Earth Disinformation agent?

Wonder who it will be.Brendan Schaub is fucking retardedIs anyone else kind of over Joe talking about this. Ok, so the guy was murdered. Joe acts like its a fact that it was a hit. It is suspicious, but just because he was Clintons opponent doesnt make it true that he was murdered by the Clinton's. In Joes world there has never been a botched robbery I guess? It happens all the time where someone tries to rob somebody and ends up panicking and shoots them then flees empty handed. Shit happened to my friends uncle. A robber is not looking to kill most times. So if the robber says "gimme your wallet" and the victim goes for the gun and is shot it makes perfect sence for the robber to instantly bolt without his prize. Its called a botched robbery for a reason. Not that uncommon. They think thats exactly what happened to my friends uncle. The killer was never found either. I'm not saying it could not have been an inside job but Joe loves to take suppositions as fact then fly off the handle. Full pockets are not proof of a hit man.It was said in the run up to the election, right afterwards, and all during the first year of the Trump administration. Now we seem to know it concretely.

Joe Rogan absolutely helped normalize Donald Trump. 

Theres no way he didn't. 

Look, Joe might say theres things he disagrees with Trump on, but  the sheer laser focus on every follicle of Hillary's head, from conspiracies about her health, to people she may have had killed, to things about how corrupt she is, to comments about her political leadership, to flat out sexist statements about her being shrill and unlikeable revealed an extreme bias. 

Every second spent focusing on Hillary, he ignored how ludicrous Trump was, he ignored how dishonest he was, he ignored how Trump was emboldening the very alt-right elements that people were all too friendly with until the very moment Richard Spencer got caught [Sieg Heiling on camera](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/richard-spencer-speech-npi/508379/). 

Look, Hillary isn't perfect but I think its pretty obvious to even Joe that she wouldn't attack his pet issues like drug policy or the environment to the extent Trump has. In fact, Joe has even criticized Trump for those things. But what Joe doesn't realize is that he had a choice, and he wet the bed.

And not only did he wet the bed, he told his millions and millions of followers and subscribers over months and months of agonizing propaganda, seeding, and massaging of ideas that Hillary was quite literally the equivalent morally and politically of Donald Trump...and in many cases, worse. 

Joe's constantly in the top podcasts. In the English speaking world. He's generally always at the top of the charts. Always has been. 

So when do we seriously assess how influential his meandering placating of Donald Trump and his incessant need to equivocate Hillary Clinton when we know on every level that they are NOT the same. Isn't the premise of so many right-leaning thinkers, and conservative guests Joe has had on, that the reason Democrats and liberals are dysfunctional is in large part due to the fact that the political candidates they're producing aren't "pure enough"? 

And yes, I totally get it and agree that HRC was a terrible candidate, but steak wasn't on the menu for the last presidential election.  And voting 3rd party is still akin to throwing your vote away. So like it or not, it comes to which candidate would be serving out country better right now: HRC or Trump.  And as much as I HATE HRC (and trust me, I did, I voted Bernie), there's no way in hell she'd be the trainwreck Trump is.  

There's a time to be idealist and then there's a time to be practical.  We're learning that with the special elections, that having the right candidate for the right region is the only way to be successful.  And only having candidates that fit an exact mold and adhere to certain ideologies is  unsuccessful in reality.
On the episode #1078 with Jimmy Dore, Joe and Jimmy really downplay the investigation into President Trump. It's dangerous to brush this off as "bullshit". Joe is clueless on the inner workings of politics, like most Americans are so its unfair to blame him, but there are tons of red flags between Trump/associates and the Kremlin. Far too many to ignore.

NPR has a good podcast called Embedded that lays out all you would need to know about the special counsel's investigation. The latest episode has me convinced we are barely at the tip of the iceberg.

https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embeddedI LOVE comedy and usually enjoyed Rocks material... but that was probably the most painful Netflix special I‚Äôve ever seen. I don‚Äôt care about the controversial topics he touched on... It was the fact that none of it was funny. The punchlines were terrible.

Seemed like a quick cash grab... He admits that divorce gutted him.
This really needs to happen and if possible they should have a child together. Would likely be the next Messiah.I go to a 40k+ school in Philly, not over the top liberal, but still a good 75% of college students are liberal, I have a joe rogan experience sticker on my laptop (and an onnit one) and it gets a lot of attention, surprisingly for mostly girls. I had 3 girls this year start a convo with me about my sticker and explain how much they like the podcast and how smart Joe is, etc. No guys have said anything to me about it haha. I rag on Joe all the time for abandoning his crazy conspiracy side but turning into an unbiased host really expanded his audience. good for him, smart business decision. If you guys have more questions (maybe questioning some of joe's views of college) lmkhttps://imgur.com/2KkgXes https://imgur.com/TNoUCJq
His latest podcast with Duncan Trussell they were talking a little about gaming, and Origin who makes some good gaming computers got at him about helping him build some for his LAN thing he wants to do at his studio. Anyone think Rogan might get into some hardcore gaming, and maybe do some twitch? Listening to the most recent podcast, I started thinking about the idea of a crypto for comedy.

If Tony started doing say, a weekly free show somewhere in LA. It‚Äôs basically free, except to gain entrance, you‚Äôd need to pay in Tonybucks. BUT, no worries, you‚Äôll also get say, 1000 free TonyBucks just for showing up, which you then use to get into the show.

You keep doing this for say, 6 months. Hopefully, at this point, the loyal fans all have TonyBucks (rewarding loyalty with ‚Äòequity‚Äô for their support, so to speak). There‚Äôs maybe say, 100k TonyBucks ‚Äòin circulation‚Äô, although at this point, the only use for the currency is to get into Tony‚Äôs otherwise-free show. Maybe you could sell some limited edition T-shirts, also only available for purchase with TonyBucks.

Then, the real test. You cut off creation all new TonyBucks. You hold a HUGE show ‚Äî get as many comedians together as possible ‚Äî something so big everybody would want to go.

Only catch is: only way you can buy tickets is with TonyBucks.

So, suddenly, anyone that wants to go to this show is going to have to buy TonyBucks off people that already have them. THE MARKET WILL LITERALLY DICTATE THE PRICE. So, if you have people paying $1000 for 100 Tony Bucks, the value of a Tony Buck would be $10 (US).

Now that you‚Äôve demonstrated the value (and potential) of TonyBucks, it‚Äôs time to get other Comedians in on it. If you can slowly make TonyBucks the currency of standup economy (paying off all the comedians and clubs that go along with it with huge ‚Äòequity‚Äô in TonyBucks), and if you have the largest reserve of TonyBucks (because of course you do), you essentially become your own FED. Since banks/landlords probably won‚Äôt accept TonyBucks, you can liquidate part of your holdings out into the market in exchange for fiat, if you need to.

Then, power and greed will inevitably corrupt and everything will go to shit.

But goddamn that would be a cool experiment.

ps. I am very, very high rn.Been watching a few older episodes with JAW and Graham Hancocks lately and really want to watch 'Magical Egypt', I've not got ~$100 to buy the series and not enough time to watch them if I rented it.

Could you guys be so kind to point me in the direction of a way to source the original episodes? 

Appreciate the help, thank you! Joe mentions the Crypto exchange that got hacked where $170M of Nano got stolen, but it doesn't seem like he really knows anything about Nano itself. For anyone interested, Nano is a Cryptocurrency that's kinda blowing up right now which offers instant and free transactions. See r/nanocurrency for more infoTo say Joe Rogan is more entertaining than EVERYONE on twitch is accurate. 

To say Joe Rogan gets hard for gaming is accurate.

He could be getting paid millions a month for playing video games. He's done with podcasts as soon as he realizes it.

edit: Joe Rogan as Joe Rogan in UFC 2018

"We're gonna setup a LAN room and play DeathMatch"That's the story I've chosen to believe. Unless you have something hotter than Stormy and MelaniaJust wanted to say it.gi-gan-to-pickathus  

probably the hardest I've laughed at something Brendan has done, ever.Hey! 

Can anyone remember the two YouTube channels Joe and Cameron Haines mentioned watching in that recent podcast? 

I‚Äôd really like to check them out! Don't we all love to just hate on everything Joe talks about?  For me today it is his love for the keto diet.  He recommends it to everybody.  Uncle Joey will want to have toast for breakfast and Joe tells him to drop the bread and just eat straight butter.  Just one of the most annoying things in the world.

The diet works for him, doesn't mean it is an end solution to everybody's weight problem.  He has such a limited scope of view and really isn't open to other ideas once he has decided something worked for him and therefore must be the ultimate solution to everybody else's problems.  From bowhunting, to podcasting and BJJ.  These are the ultimate activities somebody can undertake to cure depression and almost any other disease. 

Are you fat?  Keto is by far the ultimate solution to your problem.  Nothing else will work better than Keto.  That is just not true at all.  I am a bodybuilder and I have been trying a very low carb diet for the past 6 months.  I have stalled in weight loss at 180 lbs and cannot go any lower.  I played with the diet and decided to reintroduce more carbs and drop the fat.  I lost another 5 lbs in the last 3 weeks.  My body just happens to do better on a higher carb diet and fats were keeping my bodyweight from dropping.  

Pretty sure if everybody took his advice, half of us would be overweight depressed cucks who shoot arrows at the neighbor's kids while high on DMT.  Look into it folks!Saw a Joe Rogan Experience podcast a LONG LONG time ago that had 3 or 4 people in it, including Joe and Joey. I only remember a tiny snippet where the 3rd guy (cannot remember who) is telling a story about a party and Joey comments something along the lines of ‚ÄúJoe, that‚Äôs a fucking party right there‚Äù 

Can someone help me find this podcast??Quick thingie: been listening to Joe for years, I actually really like him and his show


The most aggravating thing I've seen coming from Joe recently has been his inability to recognize his own shortcomings as far as his perception goes. 


Case in point: On the recent Duncan podcast, he reiterated the incredibly stupid stance that the video footage on the moon looks staged. He keeps harping on the idea of how fake it is and how it's impossible for the things in the videos to actually have happened. "They're jumping around like they are in a bouncing house! There is NO WAY someone could get up off of one knee like that! etc. etc. etc"


Here's my gripe - Joe doesn't have any idea what 1/6th Earth gravity would actually look like. How can he be so sure that his criticisms aren‚Äôt actually just his lack of understanding of Moon physics? Does he not realize that his critiques are super shallow and that there are people who are much much smarter than him who would LOVE to unveil that NASA faked some of the footage (but can't)? 


Joe can be really on point most of the time with his assessment but for some reason this one flies way over his head. Even when Jaime tried to make some counter-arguments, he shut it down with some kind of emotional, bro-ish outburst of expletives. 


I usually hate pointing out this kind of thing because it comes off as useless bitching but for Joe to perpetuate bogus conspiracy theories like Eddie is below him. 


Anybody else notice this? Am I crazy to have this critique of Joe?I had to turn off yesterday's episode when he started talking about how he and his friends fled from a house party as kids and the kid in the back yelled at them to stop the car because there was a red laser from a rifle on him. I rolled my eyes so fucking hard. This is Liberty Township, Ohio? Population of 37,000, they had lasers on their rifles that they took with them to bust up kids partying?

I've tried to give him more chances but holy shit he drives me crazy. I remember back on [JRE #510](https://vimeo.com/97872458) he told Joe very matter-of-factly that he had perfect pitch, then couldn't even describe what it meant. 

The dude just rubs me every possible wrong way. No idea why Joe thinks the sun shines out of his assFine, Joe. So why don‚Äôt you take a page out of your own goddamn book, accept this new challenge and fucking do something about it? Joe constantly rails against people who don‚Äôt put in the work and just accept their lot in life. That‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôs doing every time he says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know shit about politics or science, I‚Äôm just asking questions‚Äù.

Well Joe, maybe it‚Äôs time after more than a decade of  podcasting for you to sit down and finally learn something about the subjects you harp on every. Single. Podcast. I hear him mention this a lot on the podcast. I don't eat white bread or anything, I actually dont eat any bread. But I always thought "whole wheat" stuff wasn't bad for you? I eat a decent amount of brown rice though. I‚Äôm a fan of JRE podcast and I‚Äôve recently been noticing phrases/sayings come up pretty often and that got me playing with the idea of making a ‚ÄúJRE BINGO Card.‚Äù What Joe Rogan sayings or phrases would you put on the card?

Here are the ones I‚Äôve come up with so far: 

Obviously the free space is ‚ÄúLook that shit up, Jamie‚Äù

Others include:

Referring to an athlete as ‚ÄúJAAAAAAAAACKED!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs within the realm of possibility‚Äù

Referring to the election as ‚Äúan outdated popularity contest‚Äù

Joe getting way too intense trying to explain a weed induced hypothetical fantasy scenario. 

What would you add?I have no home, please guide me. Olive Garden 7 Butthole.

Real talk though, I'm already having withdrawals from the RB and need a new place to lurk.https://youtu.be/LkMcLLSN-ig

In said link you will find a video in which Joe gets mad at Redban for telling a bad story about Olive Garden and Sushi. Do you think Joe made it worse by confronting it and dragging it out or do you think he was right to call Redban out?

I feel as if Joe could have been more relaxed about it. They're all just talking right? Yet I do see his point that it derailed good discussion and didn't leave much room for further discussion.I think Theo Von is a hilarious guest, and a good story teller. He has a tendency to start talking about some retarded ass shit, in a way that's somehow charming and attention grabbing.

Edit: episode 925It something I still don't fully understand and I can't find a good explanation of what it actually is. If someone can explain or has a link to an article about it it would be much appreciated. 

Every post or comment section literally tears him apart. Do we not all listen to and enjoy the same podcast? Yeah he‚Äôs not a perfect human being but shit, I can go to any subreddit and they‚Äôll treat their celebrities way nicer.The Russians intervened in US elections to elect Trump, why can't we interfere in Russian elections to elect The Machine?Has he ever gone into detail about which grandparent it was or what county/part of Ireland they were from? If he ever says Mayo for Sam I'm gonna stop listening
I listen to most of his podcasts when I'm at the gym or at work, but the MMA episodes are not optimal without the visual. I was listening to a podcast with Jack Murphy, who is a journalist that also served in the 5th Special Forces Group as well as the 75th Ranger Regiment. He has a lot of hard to get sources within the Army and has pretty unprecedented access.

He's written on the slaying of his former 5th SF Group peers in Jordan, which was covered up by both the US Army as well as the [Jordanian government](https://sofrep.com/90080/mother-jordanian-murdered-3-green-berets-claims-gov-gave-medal-killings/). He's also written on [drug use](https://sofrep.com/79161/wild-west-culture-drug-use-operations-permeates-seal-teams/) within the SEAL Teams.

On a podcast last week, he threw a tidbit that was rather interesting. Several years back, there was a prisoner swap where the US sent multiple jihadists back in exchange for disgraced soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who had abandoned his post and been captured by jihadists, leading to a lot of US bloodshed in various efforts to recover him.

The swap was either panned or praised depending on the aisle you sat on. The terrorists we sent back did indeed re-enter the battlefield, some in very high ranking positions within terrorist groups.

However, Murphy says that he has sources telling him it wasn't actually a true swap and that it was largely a disinformation campaign by the US government.

He alleges that the jihadists we returned were actually due for release anyway and in a last ditch effort to get something in return for nothing, the US pushed the narrative that they were open for a swap. The jihadists bought the narrative and agreed to the swap, not realizing they were going to get the imprisoned jihadists back anyway.

It was a pretty big revelation, given how even the US media bought the story, including a condemnation from US politicians on the swap.

Starts at the 51 minute mark.It's painfully obvious that he is juicing. From his triple sized head that looks like a red balloon about to pop, to looking very youthful when he's just injected and terrible and raggedy when he's coming down. We've even seen him ornery and short tempered with guests a few times.

So when will it be Joe? You're 50 years old. When will you stop the juice?I've seen a few times where things get heated, but am wondering if any of you have some good episodes where a debate gets confrontational, or very argumentative.JRE #671 - 45:00 in.

Bryan mentions Nate as a possible matchup for Conor and is immediately shot down by Joe. Is Bryan Callen the worlds best MMA mind?Night before UFC 223, (going to that too) just got my ticket for Rogan's show too, shaping up to be the goat weekend. anybody else spending the weekend in Brooklyn?So maybe it's because I'm not in the states but what app can you stream the podcast from?I prefer to spend a lot of my time alone, I find that podcasts help scratch the same itch that socialization does most of the time. 

I feel as though my social circle has never exactly been robust, and that making friends is a bit rough, maybe this is a reality that others find uncomfortable. 

Just looking for other people's stories/experiences.I've never really intentionally watch comedy specials. Occasionally I'd catch one on Comedy Central or whatever. I recently watched Tom Segura's and Joe's most recent specials. Tom's was incredibly funny. I though Joe's was rather mediocre.

What specials do you recommend out of Joe's guests?Can someone help me understand what joe was saying on the Tony hinchcliffe episode on the topic of crypto currency and how band, performers, or entertainers would use it as their currency? How would they benefit from it? I, for whatever reason, could not understand. Thanks in advance!I haven't heard anything but I just checked Joe, Bryan, Brendan and Eddie's tour dates and social media it seems like they are all home today. I remember someone last week mention Cowboy fighting this week and it peaked Joe's interest but he didn't say anything about a fight companion. Here's hoping they do one. Also, it's Joey Diaz's Birthday tomorrow so bringing in Mr Immigrant Mentality himself  would be awesome . Need an opinion here. When I was in college a couple years back I was dating this girl from halfway across the country. She'd fly out to my college town for a week or so every month to hang out. One of our let names for each other were "nig nog" like "hey whatcha up to nig nog". Neither of us are racist and she's actually from a real liberal city but it was just a cute name.

So one of the first times she's visiting we throw what we called nigga night. We put on this shitty old movie called "Gayniggers from outer space" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayniggers_from_Outer_Space), we made fried chicken, had some watermelon and fried some of that up too, and washed it down with some grape soda while we watched the movie.

Is this racist? It's certainly playing on stereotypes but we didn't say or do anything to a colored person because it was just me and my ex.Just wondering if it's worth a watch for a laugh, any specific episodes etcFor me I had never explicitly thought about the fact that I'm ultimately the one responsible for everything in my life. Maybe that's a "duh" for some but for me it's been a huge boon. Armed with this idea I got more done in late 2017 than I have in most of 2016/15Does anyone know how to hear old archived episodes that aren‚Äôt in iTunes Podcast app, it only goes back to like late 2016 or so I think but there are older episodes I‚Äôd like to listen to rather than watch on YouTube. Any help is appreciated, thanks!Thought my dad might enjoy listening to Rogan at work, and he's really into hunting. However, I usually skip over the hunting &amp; UFC guests.

Inb4 running hills with my dogRogan could be talking about the wheel being invented or Holm knocking out Rousey and he will say the same thing. "You know, when you think about it......wasn't that long ago."

Damn it Joe,  something was long ago.

If it's Joe is there a clip of him making it?Half this sub is getting mad at rogan now for not having the same views as a lot of users here. 

 When did half of you start watching this show anyways because Rogan has always been conspiratorial but we have threads whining about him not full on believing the Russian narrative?  

Or a bunch of posts about how Joe isn't being responsible with his vast audience like he personally owes you people to only have political guests who match up with you.

Plus I see people complaining about all the peterson posts  and yes this shouldn't be a peterson sub but literally 80 percent of the peterson posts are from r/chapotraphouse users and r/enoughpetersonspam users who organize brigades.  

Go search up joe rogan in the chapo sub they blame him for the rise of the alt right and use this sub as a battleground now to spam shit about peterson and sam harris and how Rogan is responsible for trump and the facism rising.Genuinely curious to see 1, what you think his actual perspective is, and 2, whether the majority of people on here think he's accurate. Can't find this podcast, please help.Before you downvote me into oblivion I just wanted to say that some links in the podcast and the Youtube page that give articles or archives of said articles when dealing with current events.

I would like people who binge this show 3 years from now or more have some semblance of a reference. Some people might not know who Bret Weinstein &amp; Heather Heying are, let alone why they are important to our "current" zeitgeist.

If you say something like "Google it." I understand we shouldn't promote laziness or just handing people information to consume that is slightly unethical to hand people biased media as a benchmark, but Google and other search engines use filter bubbles so everyone gets something different in their search pages, and the topical nature of these issues will make it hard as hell to google an article from 6 months ago let alone 3 years ago.
Joe doesn't do big earthshattering events that's not what this show is about, it's about what interests Joe which can be very esoteric at times.Hey guys

I just wanted to say thanks to joe for clearing up things for me, after struggling for so long Joe pointed out that I should just make pottery.

I quit my job and bought some clay, granted I'm now homeless and me and my partner and 2 little boys are living under a bridge but it's all worth it when my wife looks at me with a twinkle in her eye proud that I have pursued my dreams.

I know you are looking at me saying "Hey Hermes, we can't all.just go an make pottery" and I understand, there are other options like making curtains or maybe glass blowing, if you pursue your dreams you can be just where I am now.

Thanks to all and reach for the stars guys.I wanna check up on this guy to see how hes doing after that hurricaneJoe really dragged his feet on this and never really addressed the fact that he did a complete 180 on the matter and Trump's potentially treasonous behavior. Now he's just repeating the MSM line on the Russia investigation...which happened to be right all along. 

But what changed?

Its not like the multiple news stories and lines of evidence weren't all pointing in this direction. 

Oh, but wait...one time an NYTimes sports column said Conor McGregor didn't literally look like a bloody pulp, therefore the section of the paper on politics and national security is inherently corrupted. 

I really dont get how this guy thinks and I find it kinda juvenile. -Owen BenjaminBut I still enjoy him. He understands martial arts and isn't dumb in every aspect of life, but at the same time his method of thinking is...bad.

I first really took note when he was on with Alex Jones and was spouting some real stupid shit, but then when Alex said something that he wasn't '*on board with*' (I think it was a subconsciously calculated move to appear like he is capable of some critical thought) he did the whole "Oh well that's just crazy dude!" I really can't stand when people do that. I'm not very smart myself so I can't articulate exactly what about that behavior bothers me, but it just screams dishonesty to me. I wish I could unpack that more but I can't, it just made me think "This mother fucker is dumb."

And then I saw him on a different podcast randomly on YouTube and he was talking about his experience on DMT (or Ayahuasca, can't remember that detail) and the way he prefaced it with "Yeah I saw God, I know what it's like to go into another dimension" (or something to that effect) and it inspired me to deconstruct him even more but, again, I'm too dumb (alcoholic and depressed, brain is forever fucked) to really nail down his flaws. Or if it's even worth my time. But to me, he comes off as a permanent 15 year old who just discovered the idea of mysticism, philosophy, and conspiracy theories. 

Maybe I'm just an asshole.Joe seems to think marriage is kinda stupid, too.

Or maybe I'm reading too much into it.  But he also can't hide his enthusiasm for some of his female guests.Different media channels has trackers or whatever you call it, so you can see what sex and age group listeners/viewers belongs to. He has said that his listeners are everyone from X to Y, but some real stats would be cool. 

Someone tell Rogan to tell young Jamie to pull that shit up.How about a thread specifically addressing what you DO like about the show?

For me:
The constant learning/motivation to learn more.
The virtual company of strange and interesting conversation.
Exposure to opinions I would never have been exposed to otherwise. (JBP, Russel brand, Duncan Trussel)
Picked up my yoga practice again after hearing Joe would rather give up MJ than yoga.
It‚Äôs got me writing again and working towards goals I‚Äôd long held as impossible. Happens around the hour and 26 minute mark. Referring to Sex at Dawn he said ‚Äú that book is a pretty good strategy for getting people to go to bed with you and feel sophisticated about it.‚Äù    I love it and think it‚Äôs hilarious when guests talk shit about each other‚Äôs ideas, and I‚Äôm really interested to see if Ryan responds to it on another podcast. The next ‚Äúshrimp parade‚Äù should be nice and awkward.I know this conversation has been done to death but me and the missus are planning to try the diet, and there's so much fucking conflated and paradoxical information out there. So dudes, what's the best version of keto, what's the deal with natural sugar, how much protein and so on? Thanks! Back in the 90's his head looked normal, even a bit small for his body, back when he looked about 170 lbs. Nowadays, he's about 200+ lbs and his head looks like it could have other planets orbiting it. How does that happen?why is joe spreading false info

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/may/23/newt-gingrich/claim-slain-dnc-staffer-seth-rich-gave-emails-wiki/   http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/04/11/justice-is-served-but-more-so-after-lunch-how-food-breaks-sway-the-decisions-of-judges/

"The graph is dramatic. It shows that the odds that prisoners will be successfully paroled start off fairly high at around 65% and quickly plummet to nothing over a few hours (although, see footnote). After the judges have returned from their breaks, the odds abruptly climb back up to 65%, before resuming their downward slide. A prisoner‚Äôs fate could hinge upon the point in the day when their case is heard.

These rulings were made by eight Jewish-Israeli judges, with an average of 22 years of judging behind them. Their verdicts represented 40% of all parole requests in the country during the ten months. Every day, each judge considers between 14 and 35 cases, spending around 6 minutes on each decision. They take two food breaks that divide their day into three sessions. All of these details, from the decision to the times of the breaks, are duly recorded."

"Danziger thinks that the judges‚Äô behaviour can be easily explained. All repetitive decision-making tasks drain our mental resources. We start suffering from ‚Äúchoice overload‚Äù and we start opting for the easiest choice. For example, shoppers who have already made several decisions are more likely to go for the default offer, whether they‚Äôre buying a suit or a car. And when it comes to parole hearings, the default choice is to deny the prisoner‚Äôs request. The more decisions a judge has made, the more drained they are, and the more likely they are to make the default choice. Taking a break replenishes them.

There are several other ways of explaining this striking pattern but Danziger ruled all of them out. It wasn‚Äôt the case that a few individuals skewed the data, for the pattern was consistent across all the judges. The results weren‚Äôt due to discrimination, for the judges treated the prisoners equally regardless of their gender, ethnicity or the severity of their crime."

------------
Raises some interesting questions about potential problems in our justice system and even about the idea of punishment as justice itself.

Also seems like evidence of the idea behind being "hangry."Just even from the posts today you can hover over the names of different users and it will show you how long they have been a member. There's a theme with most of these accounts posting dumb shit loosely related to the podcast. All the good content is from users &gt; 1 year. All the random shit is users &lt; 1 year. I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast for awhile now and think this guy does a really good job. Figured I would post this here because people who listen to jre might be interested in the topic he‚Äôs currently doing. Essentially it‚Äôs on the Silk Road and it‚Äôs creator Ross Ulbricht. 


Most the other episodes people probably won‚Äôt be into unless you like true crime, but if you like the guys style I would also recommend the episodes on Jonestown. 



http://casefilepodcast.comOr any new forums set up?David Goggins. I was so relieved once David said he was gunna b on the podcast. Go and check it out .So I was listening to burnt chrystlers podcast and I have to give props to Lena chrystlers because she produced the best idea any person, Polly or bi, has ever graced the world with. The next challenge should be a man's ice dancing competition with Uncle Joey as the emcee. They get 5 weeks if training to come up with the best 3 min routine.

I think we can summarize that this sub is obsessed with Jordan Peterson and saying the words shit and fuck.Honestly, I think that he's most definitely 100% (*one hundered percent*) skadoosh, that's fersure. Furthermore, I know that monkey *will* rip 100% of your face off, just *BOOM SKADOOSH* your face is gone. That's fersure.


Edit: I forgot this sub only allows positive things about Rogan and how great out divine HGH headed leader is. Let me take some alpha brain and go jerk off a chimpI'll start: Joe 'Jamie pull that shit up' RoganTitle says it all. Between the 3-4 hour podcast, float tanks, stand up, MMA, psychedelic trips and running hills when does Joe see his family? I assume it‚Äôs the 1 hour from when he gets home til when he gets baked and chases coyotes through his yard?I couldnt sleep and went on youtube at 3am and watched the david goggins podcast 
This motherfucker is intense its cool him finally being on the podcast after hearing joe talk about him for so long and researching him cos of joe

Inspirational as fuck frJust now catching up on this podcast today, and this guy just seems very intelligent and convincing.

Figured that I would make a post in case someone decided skip because he wrote for huffpo or just because they didn't want to listen to a writer/journalist guest.

[8]Joe is an intelligent human, as evident by the fact that over time his opinions and worldviews change as new evidence presents itself. Some of this evidence came from his short-lived (bring it back!) show "Joe Rogan Questions Everything." Eddie Bravo should start his own show, maybe called "Eddie Bravo Will Believe Anything" where he goes through a similar process of interviewing experts and listening to testimony on certain topics just to see how radically different the dynamics and outcomes would be. I would definitely watch this show! I remember watching an episode a while back (at least a year I'd say) where Joe had some guy on who was the son of someone who used to either be known for doing a lot of research on drugs (I think specifically acid but I might not be remembering correctly) or he was just famous for being someone who did a lot of drugs. I'm a little fuzzy on the details so I just can not seem to figure out which episode this was. 

Anyone have any idea which episode I'm remembering?With the confirmation that Joe is currently in talks with the guys from Twitch (recent Dom Irrera podcast), what do you hope to see him and Jamie do on there other than the podcast?Bret and his wife were in the other day talking about biology and sex. Make a you wonder how much of a freak in the sheets she was on her younger days huh? I guarantee Bret got laid hardcore after that podcast after all that sex talk. Hell, it was making me horny even at work!I went to an all boys junior + high school.

We had private buses to ferry us to and from out testosterone filled educational hell hole.

I caught that bus for 4 years, and anytime it went past a remotely attractive femaie, someone would yell:

&gt;"Show us ya tits"

It never worked.

Women would look disgusted. They would complain to the school. We'd get yelled at by our teacher or detention or yard duty or some kind of punishment.

And yet, people still did it. It makes no sense. No-one ever got to see boobs, and instead just got in trouble.

And then it happened. Not on my bus. But my friends bus. They were cruising past a university, it was a warm day, and some hot girl was walking along the sidewalk when their bus was stopped at the traffic light.

Someone yelled out "show us ya tits" and she did it. By all accounts there were glorious as well. Perky, bouncy like the best breasts can be.

Apparently, the whole bus was in stunned silence and then erupted into loud cheers.

In the next 24 hours, every single boy in that school heard the story of the girl that showed her glorious breasts to the boys on the bus at least 227 times.

That means that over a thousand young men, suddenly realized that "holy shit, this works, sometimes" and decided to continue doing so, in the hope that they too, would be the person to trigger such a legendary story.Anybody got any ideas? I love the jacket and think its super fun, and I really want to see if I can find the same one somewhere but couldnt find anything on google. Thanks!I‚Äôm listening to the podcast now and I heard David Goggins mention something about how he had a muscle balled up in his head. Does anyone know what muscle that was? He said the muscle ‚Äúball‚Äù went away when he started stretching but I couldn‚Äôt really understand what muscle he was talking about. I like him a lot, I always have. I loved it when he was on the podcast.

I even enjoy his podcast, though it's very echo-chamber-y...

Problem is I've recently listened to his podcasts with Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson, and he was completely outgunned.

It was almost embarrassing how unskilled he was, and he behaved so poorly in the Harris interview too - it undermined every small kernel of validity his points might have had. Not that I think they were particularly valid.

He's gone down in my estimations substantially now. It's a shame, his failings are so apparent across the web and I've just grown frustrated by the fact that nothing will seem to reach him and 'wake' him up to being reasonable and coherent intellectually.

Honestly, I now am starting to view him as very child-like and juvenile in his approach. 

I know lots of folks hate him going in but does anyone else feel the similarly?I've heard this a couple times now, Does Joe really see no difference between processed white bread and say a whole grain bread? He seriously states grain is awful for you, we wouldn't have survived as a species if it wasn't for grains.Been a while since Mr Jose Rogan and the boys did a companion, will they be doing one this weekend?So I had too much MCT oil this morning, and I‚Äôm basically pissing out of my ass, do any of you have any remedies that you have done to solve this? I want to see neil degrasse tyson make this guy look dumber than he already is! Is this really still happening? Im beginning to think it isnt gunna happen!Anyone have any leads on this? Maybe the earth debate?Has Joe ever done a Q&amp;A on a place like Reddit? I tried searching but couldn't find one. Even an episode like Sam Harris does where he answers the highest rated comments would be rad as hell.He described kosher as a barbaric way of preparing meat, by hanging a live animal by its ankles and slitting its throat to drain the blood.. Except thats Halal meat

Halal food is that which adheres to Islamic law, as defined in the Koran. The Islamic form of slaughtering animals or poultry, dhabiha, involves killing through a cut to the jugular vein, carotid artery and windpipe. Animals must be alive and healthy at the time of slaughter and all blood is drained from the carcass.I asked the Jordan Peterson reddit and didn't get any results. I've looked him up on my own and I'm seriously unimpressed. What is so great about this dude? Months ago i had seen on Youtube a clip on which Joe Rogan was making a pretty good impersonation of Joe Pesci. Unfortunately i can no longer find it. Does anyone know the JRE episode # or a link on Youtube to view this?I had to listen to the bit about dinosaurs and pterodactyls 3 times because it sounded like utter gibberish. Then he says he doesn't know if pterosaurs had "batlike wings" because "they're" saying  dinosaurs have feathers. Even though he just read that pterosaurs aren't dinosaurs. Does anyone have that video where this happens and Joe give him a subtle death glare? They were talking about music.

EDIT: https://youtu.be/XSdWHeSf86U?t=4m25sI mean, he *is* 95. Probably best to get him on the show sooner rather than later.&gt; Over the next decade, he grew from just under 4'10'' to a shocking 7'1''. During this period, Rainer also began developing a severe spinal curvature.

...

&gt; In [Rainer's case](http://www.businessinsider.com/adam-rainer-was-both-a-dwarf-and-a-giant-2015-1), this was caused by a **tumour on his pituitary gland which led to an overproduction of growth hormones** in his body. This was the reason behind his strange appearance, for Rainer didn't just have abnormally large hands and feet. He also had a protruding forehead and jaw, as well as thick lips set over widely-spaced teeth.

Seriously though, he looks like [Joey](https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/54c16b51ecad04b745d0d29b-1136-379.jpg) - I just couldn't help making the "growth hormone &amp; pituitary gland" reference for Joe, it was too perfect.Didn't see anything online just hoping I was wrongFormer CA FF here and I wanted to share my experience with con-crews out on the line. I think Joe's misinformed about some of this stuff and it's come up in more than one episode, so I figured I'd share my experience. (My experience: I've worked with many con-crews over the years and have had conversations with some of the guys and their respective supervisors)

* Joe makes it sound like since the fires were so bad we had to call in cons and pay them them jack shit to fight fires for us. This is incorrect. Con crews exist year-round, all over the state, and are highly trained. I've personally requested a con-crew on a brush fire I IC'd. 

* The guys on these crews sign up for it. There's often a waitlist to get on crews (this is what I was told by several inmates). 

* Talking with some of these guys, they told me they sign up because they get certifications from the training they receive, which help them; 1) Get out earlier, 2) Get a job once out.

* They told me that if they break any prison rules while on the waitlist, they're taken off the list. Apparently these spots are in-demand.

* Most con-crews that I've worked with are about 12-20 guys deep, with 1 supervisor. I've never seen or heard of an inmate running off, hurting anyone else, or causing problems. 

* These guys are GREAT at what they do. They work their ass off and are always welcomed. 

* They wait in the same chow lines as everyone else at basecamp and get nothing but respect. 

* I don't know how much they get paid. I never asked. 

Tl;DR - Con-crews are year-round all over the state (CA, at least). They sign-up to join, are well trained, and are generally well-liked. 

There may be other FF's that have more information, or have had poor experiences with con-crews, but overall my experience was very positive. Ever since his flat earth lunacy came to Joes attention, he hasn't had Eddie, Shaub, and Brian on. I guess all good things must come to an end.See him on here a lot, and have seen Joe talk about him.  What's a good one to check out?First off I want to say I am not a Jordan Peterson nut. I do appreciate his work and social commentary but I feel rather exhausted by what has been repeated ad nausiam at this point. Also I don't really agree with his make up argument.

My point of posting to this link is to discuss this editing of the video. The interview was roughly 2 hours long from what I read. Yet they clearly spliced answers to questions that were minutes apart. After watching this it seems to me they just edited in every tense reaction of Peterson. There was a point in the interview where the interviewer kept asking the same question over and over again and having Peterson answer multiple times to the point where he got fed up. And of course that was the cut they used of him.

Anyways what do you people think? 

Here is the link in question 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=434&amp;v=DZrSrZpX5l8 Excuse if this is a common question: I finally have some extra time on my hands and want to dive into something new. I already know my way around audio equipment, sound systems, studio recording and music gear and could probably sort everything out as is. I was just wondering if they‚Äôd ever mentioned what kind of schooling they had or if at all. I‚Äôm guessing general audio engineer and video editing classes to start? I've found a great example here of why there's so many active Tony haters on this sub, we've got all the flavors here, everything squeezed into about a minute length, the over confident, zero humility, whatever it is. The best part is him defending amy schumer in a "valley girl" kind of way with him staring deep into Sam's eyes while saying "she's fun--y. She's fun--Y" 

it's a cringe typhoon and I'd recommend the whole episode if you're in the mood for it
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ltSYQ9r0kmg&amp;t=28m11sHe said something like "I don't really like social media, social media is full of people pretending, like oh look at my pretend perfect life" shit hits home so hard. i fucking hate social media, yet if I wanna have any friends or contact with friends I need to use it. I re-listened to the last 7 or 8 minutes when he talks about buidling his brand, but he didn't say the quote during that period. anybody remember it? time stamp would be amazing. thanks.I seriously think that the comparison to hieroglyphics and emojis was first coined by jre. I‚Äôm watching that movie with my 4yo daughter (crap movie) but they reference the comparison in this movie and the only other person I‚Äôve heard talking about this is joe.So, with some recent martial arts IG posts by Rogan, I took to Youtube to further jump down the rabbit hole. I ended up on [DK Yoo's page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaFPh_ms6WL9p9Sg4pkekqg). In short, he's apparently a South Korean Special Forces trainer who's trained in 15 different martial arts. A lot of his vids are flashy AF. He demonstrates some great speed and body movement like a dancer.

Now I've browsed some older threads around Reddit about his stuff, but didn't see anything land here. So I'm curious what you all think.

I'm really fascinated by the youtube comments though. I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a mix between:

‚Ä¢ Praising the movement itself (within the demo context it's shown)
‚Ä¢ Criticizing the practicality of it all outside of the demos

What y'all think?Anyone elseGoing through one now and just listened to a recent one with Duncan and Joe. It was really helpful with Joe's low threshold for bullshit and Duncan's introspection.

Was wondering if you guys knew of another like that?..Is because he doesn't want to face criticism. A lot of people who are fans of the podcast (myself included) seem to find his stand-up pretty cringy. I've yet to meet anyone who actually enjoys his standup act. I think a lot of the factors that make it hard to sit through are correctable, and on the podcast he's not an unfunny guy. If you look at old recordings from Louis CK's act when he was young it was similarly cringy, but somehow he was able to adapt himself. Joe on the other hand seems to not want to adapt himself to fans reactions; he's said for example that he doesn't look at internet comments because it's not relevant to what he wants to do with the show. I think that approach doesn't leave the podcast with any room to grow and throw out what people perceive as negative aspects, but since it is already so strong it doesn't matter in the long run. However, this same weakness when applied to the world of comedy leads to a mediocre act that maybe is kept relevant by Joe's celebrity status and friendships in the industry.What other podcasts do you guys listen to? Looking for some different to listen to, hopefully a little shorter then JRE but educational and funny. Hey y'all, I'm trying to find a story from a past JRE episode. My memory is a little hazy, but I believe Joe had a kickboxer or some other kind of fighter on the show. They were talking about a martial arts master who was buried (or fought?) and wore a white belt because he always saw himself as a student. Can anyone help me find this episode? Thanks in advance, cocksuckers.Haven't seen him nor any of his buddies on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee in four seasons... Awfully peculiar. Look into it.So I listened to a JRE with a guest that kinda saw global warming as a scam. He was one of the founders of something like green peace and has a PhD is environmental science or something to that effect. I listened to it a while ago while I was at work, and wanted to go home and do my own research, but I forgot about it. I recently remembered about it and still want to do that research but I want to rewatch it but now I can't find it?I‚Äôve been on a space kick, and love JRE. What‚Äôre some good ones to check out?I‚Äôll be heading over to New York from the UK for the UFC 223 card, as I was doing a little research of the area and such I thought I‚Äôd have a look and see if there would be any comedy shows on while I‚Äôm over there. I noticed Joe was playing in Brooklyn the day before 223 and managed to scoop tickets. That was a few days ago now and I just had the thought pop in my head of who, if anyone would be his opening act. I had a google around and couldn‚Äôt find any info on it though, wondering if anyone has an idea of who it may be or if this is something that‚Äôs released nearer the time?I understand JRE can be watched on youtube when it's live, but are there any podcast apps or anything that broadcast it live just in audio form? Or do I have to use youtube?I watched a JRE podcast a little while ago that focused on the guest's story of depression and alcoholism that was eventually cured by testosterone replacement therapy.  Unfortunately I can't find the podcast, does anyone know the podcast number or name of the guest?That is all. Then I see guys like Sam Seder are 51 and I realize Joe is just sliding into far right wing bullshit and theres little I can do to stop it other than find the right time to hop off the train.

This is increasingly painful

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
CocksuckahhhRegan: I remember talking to somebody years ago who said she could astral project.

Redban: Squirt from the butt?What are you guys reading or what have you read that you really recommend? Looking for mostly non-fiction but I don‚Äôt mind the odd fiction book once and a while too. 

I just read Ready Player One and actually really enjoyed it. Reminded me a lot of my child hood and the movie is coming out. I‚Äôm not normally into that kind of stuff but it‚Äôs a good read for anyone that grew up in the 80‚Äôs or early 90‚Äôs. title speaks for itselfIs there somewhere to see who will be on the upcoming shows or when they are? Fairly new to the JRE.

And at the same time, what are some of the best episodes to check out?I did in and out of Joe Rogan so probably have heard about 10 in my time. I was just wondering which episodes are relaxing or easy to fall asleep to? I‚Äôm not really into all the political stuff because I‚Äôm not from US, or comedians because they‚Äôre just trying to make each other laugh.If Joseph James Rogan has only been right about one thing it‚Äôs this. Whether you‚Äôre unhealthy, getting in shape, or grating cheese off your abs, it‚Äôs important. Don‚Äôt wait til you‚Äôre 40 or even 30. Lots of young people push through it. Joe himself competed and trained at a high level with hypothyroidism. Personally i‚Äôve seen a lot of athletes and regular people improve on a day to day basis- or perform better at school/work when their energy wasn‚Äôt being overly tapped in training and recovery. Take care of yourselves cocksuckers. That way when immortal gorilla dna is ready to be spliced with humans, we can get on that waiting list early. I'm sure this has already been posted, but I am a new listener to the JRE podcast. Who are his best guests and which ones should I listen to first?
I can handle flat earth it‚Äôs stupid but it‚Äôs so ridiculous no one will pay attention. This shit scares me though like imagine being a parent or a student effected by this shootings and someone tells you that your a crisis actor or something.  There are some crazy people out there and many people including the sandy hook and Florida shootings have gotten death threat and whatever else cause of people spreading this around. I like Eddie but he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hurting anyone it‚Äôs just fun‚Äù but this can hurt people.  It might be detrimental to becoming a championship level prize fighter or a comedian, I guess?, but if you just want to be a normal person who isn't homeless, I would argue it can be a pretty good thing.

In a lot of ways, and I don't think he means to, Joe has got some real millionaire thoughts for the common man. March 15th to the 730 show.  

Edit:  Asking $40Apologies if this has been brought up already but Lawrence Krauss is the next man to be publicly executed by a jury of his peers.

I really like the guy (I still use the word like), though he recently started revealing himself as one of those slow pitch science verbal diarrhea guys, sort of like a standup comedian of sorts, I just heard him repeating himself a lot and it was a bit disappointing since I regarded him a cut above the degrases' and coxs' but anyways his statements in the article to BuzzFeed, (I guess they corresponded via email which must have been pretty slimy feeling for the guy at BuzzFeed to be getting statements from someone about the stinkpiece you're writing) but his statements make him look really bad. And I think the guy's married too so "youch".I‚Äôm new to joes podcast but realized pretty fast he tends to bring some badass dudes on. I was wondering what would be a ultimate top 5 podcasts to motivate the fuck out of someone? There's so many and I don't know how to find it. He talked a lot about how if you line up the world from one end to the other, we couldn't ever agree on divisions between races or genders so they should be done away with. Argued that race and gender are constructs that have only brought negative things. What was his name? Does anyone remember?I just saw Marlon Wayans had a special on Netflix and just about every other comic.

What is the deal with Callen and NetFlix?He had bits about hunting, elk meat, vegans, feminism, humans always picking sides etc.

And his head was fucking huge.

It was awesome.I don't use the word triggered seriously but Jesus I can't take his conspiracy shit anymore. I had to unfollow him off Instagram. I love to entertain the idea of weird shit and weird conspiracy shit. 


But there's a certain line you draw. Man, people's kids are dead. Not one sign of respect for the parents? or any sympathy? Just straight to the conspiracy theories? I don't ever anything wish anything bad upon the Bravo family, but how would Eddie react if any of his family was caught up in something like this? 


Shit man I work in NYC, I've been within close radius of two terrorist attacks so far. (Home depot truck and port authority guy) That shit was real! There are horrible people out there who do horrible things! These conspiracy theories sound like shit made up by people who can't fucking comprehend with what happened so they come up with some bullshit. I don't know. I can't be the only one who feels this way. Hey guys, I've taken a few of the different products (TPC, Gut Health, ect...) but the expense per month is on the high side. are there any comparable supplements out there that would be good but are easier on the wallet? 

thanksJust October. It would be super size me. Interesting to see if his percention changes at all. There's a couple to choose from and considering they're 3 hours+, I want to make sure I listen to the best one first. Thank you.Ari, Tom and Bert shouldn't have to do that corny yogaAnd it honestly fucking sucked. I thought I'd be more productive but I did the same shit it was just less fun.

I'm sticking with it though. #prayforjoeDay 1 is in the can - onward to Day 2! 

Don't forget to #prayforjoeAny episodes with proper science people or other podcasts to check out for the low down on medical weed? Hey fellas, im thinking about taking the keto diet for a spin, and was wondering if Ol‚Äô Joey Big Weed has any podcasts detailing it completely, cause i know he preaches the diet.and what will Joe say if Jones does start up on his nonsense?He said it was a shitty comic and the first person that came to mind was D'Elia and his "baby's" I don't mind him but was surprised to think Joe thinks he's shitty I want to find the first podcast Joe says that so I can see his face when he realizes he will start saying it whenever possible. My favorites are the JRE and hardcore history but alot of the other ones I've tried have sucked. I'd really like to find one that talks to people about bad ass outdoors adventures, but I haven't found many that are satisfying.

Which ones do you guys enjoy?I'm fairly new to the podcast but I've noticed recently that when he's boozing and smoking he's kind of annoying and rude. I first noticed it when I was watching the End of the World podcast the other day. Joe would just go on these rants about nothing and try SO hard to be funny but came off just sounding uneducated. Even Burr said something like c'mon Joe, you've been traveling long enough to not actually believe that.' But I noticed it even more today. I love Les Stroud so I was stoked to go back and listen to him on the podcast but Joe wouldn't even let him talk or take him serious. Granted they were talking about Bigfoot but he wouldn't even let Stroud get a word in without belittling him and trying to make him sound stupid. Like Stroud would start talking about an interesting story from his adventures and Joe would just chime in with something like "Why waste your time with something so stupid. Orcas are way cooler." I couldn't even make it through half the episode. 

Tldr drunk Joe is annoyingDoubt you'll see this, but if you do, try this.

Since JRE is big on YouTube with people who watch the podcast, when Joe and guest are talking about a video clip or article, would it be possible to minimize the studio video feed to the smaller P.I.P screen in the bottom right?

Makes it easier to follow and be more "engaged'" in the situation.

Do it up Y.J.!Every time Joe says 'We don't have a gun problem, we have a mental health problem' I cringe.


Australia has a mental health problem, the UK has a mental health problem, Canada has a mental health problem but there are no mass shooting there the way we see in America.

It is such a stupid, arrogant argument when you think America is the only country with a mental health problem, when really you are the only country with a gun problem.Episode: TBD	
Guest: Russell Brand,	Comic, Actor	
Date: TBD

Russell is currently on a promotional tour for his book Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions, I'm currently 100 pages into it and really enjoying it, I waited 800 episodes of JRE to hear Russell Brand and Joe Rogan talk Consciousness and Self Improvement only for (and I mean no offense) Jim Breuer to wreck that podcast, this time I hope for 3+ hours of tips and experiences of how to evolve and upgrade oneself in this human existence from Joe and Russell.Hey guys, so I've only recently been listening to JRE (around 3 weeks now) but it's quickly become one of my favorite forms of entertainment! The episodes with Proffessors Jordan Peterson and Bret Weinstein were by far some of the best things I've ever watched. I guess this leads me to my question, what other episodes are there that are as deep/engaging? Over the weekend my wife and our 13 year old son were talking about history and got onto the topic of World War I.  The following discussion occurred....

Wife: I don‚Äôt remember, how did World War I start? 

Son: I don‚Äôt know.

Me: Oh, that was the assassination of Ferdinand.

Wife: Who?

Me: Franz Ferdinand, like the band

Wife: Ferdinand...was he from Spain?

Me: No, pretty sure it was Hungary

Wife: Hungary?

Me: Pretty sure

Wife: ([How did World War I start?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I))   ‚ÄúThe trigger for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary...‚Äù

Wife looks at me in curiosity....

Me: [#joeroganuniversity](https://youtu.be/btf5RMYTG5M)Who the Fuck is Fritz haber &amp; what tragedy befell him (i'm 100% seriously i always see stuff about him on this sub and know nothing about him)Skeptic tank is similar to JRE in that it's a loose interview that goes on lots of tangents. I think it's more entertaining and thought provoking than JRE because Ari is genuinely curious about his guests and what they say. He asks genuine questions, lets them answer without interrupting, and lets them tell their stories. 
Joe acts like a know-it-all and puts down his guests and their ideas. He is not open minded on many things, as we notice when he discusses depression and addiction. 
Let's put it this way: Ari would never tell his guest to stop taking his preventative HIV medication. A lot of Texans shit on In-and-Out. I am not one of them. A lot of Texans will get mad if you say you like In-and-Out. I personally like their burgers. A lot of Texans might shoot you if you say it's better than Whataburger. Your wrong, but I won't hold it against you. But to have the audacity to say that Whataburger is *ok* is just offensive. Joe you should be ashamed of yourself and I expect a twitter apology to all Texans. This is an offense we cannot ignore. 
I remember when I started listening possibly mid 600s, he had the guy on who worked in the Canada equivalent of Seaworld. That was very interesting and different. I used to love listening to something I knew nothing about. I would love a few more experts on something he has yet to cover.He knows a lot but I never hear him talk about the Roman Empire. The ancient Romans were my favorite empire and the most interesting and facinating but he never talks about them. Idk why he refuses to learn about them.Just doing some personal research, was hoping some long time listeners might remember. ThanksWe could kill baby Hitler later, but first things first.I'm on mobile so you'll have to find the article yourselfJoe Rogan has mentioned before that he uses an app for yoga. Does anybody know what app he uses?On opposite dayThis dude gives legit theories on Atlantis. Most of you are too new to have seen this one. Go and watch it now.In his close group of friends I mean. Personally I don't find Tom Segura to be that funny. Good dude tho.https://sports.yahoo.com/campus-anthem-battle-cheerleaders-vs-sheriff-powerful-lawmaker-232611605.html

I saw this and found this interesting. Not sure if he's commented on this, but I wonder what Joe thinks about thins like this? He has been pretty vocal about free speech on campus when it comes to things like Alt-Right speakers being protested on college campuses, so I wonder what he thinks about this issue.Often when I have to do some thinking about my life or stuff I can think better when Joe is having a talk in the backround. Because completle silence while thinking is kind of more stressfull.

I also listen to Sam Harris and stuff sometimes.According to my calculations, I need at least 2800 calories a day to gain weight and muscle so I don't have to be a skinny skeleton anymore. If I can get girls now, I can only imagine what I can do if I was in shape. 

Problem is I have so much student debt that I'm pretty poor. How can I achieve the needed calories with my very limited food money?Here's some reading material.

Guest request threads were getting out of hand so we'll keep them all in here. The best part about this is that all the guest requests can be sequestered in one thread and Joe and Jamie will go on not ever giving a fuck about what people request on this subreddit. I'm not saying Joe doesn't respond to requests but I feel his twitter is a better avenue for this type of thing.

Anyhow, request away. All new guest request threads will be deleted.

[Guest Request Thread #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/6mylr2/guest_request_master_thread_2/)No but really. I don't know anyone in this city and we can talk about chimp balls and the benefits of a ketogenic diet. I cant find it anywherehttps://i.imgur.com/fVrQYA4.jpghttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_pill

It's called a digital pill. We all know how fucked Abilify is, with all its side effects. Now the government tracks you to know if you're a good slave or not.

Just kidding haha. But the tech is pretty cool and could def be misusedWhy are we taught to ridicule ourselves, and that self love =being selfish/narcissistic? I was raised by drug addicts/alcoholics and had no idea that my own self image was negatively affecting every aspect of my own life. 

Yet we're taught that self praise=hubris and some twisted idea=stoicism. 

Self love and self  empathy for me, each have done more good and healing that hundreds of hours of talk  therapy.  After hearing all the ads, I decided I'd like a healthy snack. 5 bucks for one little snack bar.

Not the fucking place to get foodDays yonder, i used to loathe his appearence on the fight companions. But noe hes my favorite. I can't say why or how but i actually love Callen now. He's who I would be most like if in was twice my current age.

How have you all felt about him throughout the years?For those who don't know...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem

I'm interested what you fucks would do if you were high af and had to make this decision.

Pull the lever and kill the one person tied up, or would you not interfere and let 5 people on the main track die?Watching the Danaher podcast and that hat looks ready to bust. Ol Joey chrome dome is gonna need a 10 gallon hat for real. Ive watched a lot of episodes, not all but a lot and especially the good ones and ive heard him call guys the "baddest man on the planet", "baddest man alive" multiple time on and off the podcast. But it wasnt just to Stipe. Mighty mouse, Fergersom, hell i think even Conor..

Just find it funnyEddie Bravo is the shit fuck yeah spitting the truth whats my slogan be like joe rogan thats rightDonald Trump on Jeffrey Epstein:


‚ÄúI've known Jeff for fifteen years. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."


[Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein)


Now you know why he‚Äôs still covering up pizzagate. 


Look into it. 


I loved her loosely base on science theories. I love Eddie, but his theories are a little wild. 

I even gave her music a listen after this podcase.... It's pretty bad though IMOA trend recently in the sub has been to rush to create a thread with an opinion about the current or very recent guest.  There are podcast threads for a reason, keep the discussion in the podcast thread.

The recent podcasts are all listed in the sidebar.

If you're about to post about a recent guest, and your title looks anything like one of these following examples, stop, don't post it, go comment in the podcast thread.

1. I like {guest name here} because I want to have their baby
2. {guest name here} is wrong about {subject} because I'm an internet expert and know better than them
3. {guest name here}'s podcast was the best because of the tacos
4. video Joe just mentioned to {guest name here}
5. Joe looks {insert adjective here} while explaining {insert subject here}

This is only for going forward, we won't address anything from the past.

*--brought to you by code word: onnit*Sometimes i get the urge to just listen to Eddie chat some shit. What are your favourites?I wanna curl up and cry.Max was declared unfit to fight Friday morning due to a bad weight cut. Max was determined to make the weight but the doctors had the final say. The MMA Gods are punishing us for our sins.They are still in negotiation but it looks good. Would be for 5 round main event, it hasn't been confirmed if it's for the belt. Raging Al missed 155 by .2 pounds this morning.So, this morning I woke up to find out that my snapchat messages are parsed and collected, sent to some central server and used for advertising. Even if you DONT TALK ABOUT A PRODUCT. 

Some backstory: I was sending a female friend a snap of my view/stream of me peeing off of a small bridge  it was very pretty. 

The convo went as followed:
Me:Sends snap of me peeing off bridge
her:were you just peeing in that snap?
Me:Yeah, are you jealous?
Her:I mean I would totally do that too if I was able to.. I just wouldn't make a video of it.. 
Her:Actually I would totally do that. 

The very next morning I woke up with an advertisement for a "female urination device". This was never talked about outside of that snapchat convo, and a product was never explicitly mentioned. 

Heavily considering unplugging from snapchat/facebook. And maybe chilling on some of the google products and moving to services that don't do questionable things with your private convos.
So for those who missed it trump basically said America are attacking Syria and directly threatened Russia. What will happen in the coming days weeks? Rogan: Look at this guy, he‚Äôs an ANIMALLLLL

Schaub: He‚Äôs gotten Ja-Ja-Ja-Jackkkkked

Rogan: JAAAAAAAAckkked

Schaub: Straight AaaaaaaN-i-MalI'm a lazy man and I don't get home from work until almost midnight. By then, everyone is sleeping and I can't be making a ruckus in the kitchen making a full meal. So my go-to has always been a nice warm bowl of Angel hair pasta, buttered up, no sauce, maybe sometimes pan fry some garlic, onions, and tomatoes and throw those in.

Now after listening to this motherfucker shit on spaghetti for the past many months, I haven't even eaten my favorite meal in weeks. Before, I could eat half a box and not feel bad, but now I can hardly eat a bowl without feeling that "lumpy gut" thing he talks about. Not to mention the psychological aspect of Rogan's words ringing in my head everytime i try to take a bite. "Carbs are so had for you man, pasta is the worst". 

Fuck Rogan for this 
And noticed that pretty much every single guest star comedian on the show has been on the Joe Rogan podcast, often multiple times. All that's missing is Louie CK himself. So what gives, when will this happen? Is it just a coincidence that they share the same apparent circle of comedian acquaintances?This keto thing got me really curious. 

Have they ever talked about strength/powerlifting on Joe's podcast with a keto diet?

I know he had Mark Bell on but I don't think he was using a ketogenic diet when he was breaking recordsI listen to roughly two podcasts a day slaving away at my office job, so I've gotten tired of hearing the same Rogan talking points since I've heard every episode for the past 4 months.

So I decided to go back and listen to the early early ones on CastBox (which is a great app cause you can lock your phone and it will still play, unlike YouTube)

I actually really enjoy those older episodes, it felt more free and silly and the first couple with Joey Diaz were stupendous. I definitely see why he got rid of retard Redban, but I actually like his input cause I'm a retard too so it's like he's my voice to Joe.Just a thought I had this morning.

We update the sidebar with new podcasts, but because of limitations of reddit.com, we have to trim off older guests.  Going to keep this post updated as well.

If you [search this sub for Jordan Peterson, sort by new](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/search?q=peterson&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all), you'll see that in general, people don't appreciate posts about him.

Your support or opposition of him aren't adding anything of value to the sub.

So, we're going to test out not allowing any threads about Jordan Peterson for a week.

After a week, we'll reevaluate if forcing discussion of Peterson to other subs has negatively impacted /r/joerogan.On podcast number 10 he said it's the Congo that used to be grassland a couple thousand years ago with the swimming antelope and in a recent podcast he said it was the Amazon And it was some of the best stand up I have ever seen, even now decades later. I can tell how he influenced modern day comics. Absolute legend, I can see why he is so well regarded.

Edit: This was from 1979, I looked up the wiki and says the box office was $15m+ so what? It was in movie theaters and grossed that much? If so I find that pretty amazing amazing .By guilt free I mean what hobbies do you not think to be a waste of time? For example I like playing videogames but I play a minimal amount because I consider it a "junk food" hobby. I thought with the amount of freaks on here we'd get some interesting things to try out. Mine are playing guitar, kickboxing, hiking, reading, writing, and watching films. I want to get into mountain biking and surfing, I'd also like to write more than I currently do. Also what are your junk food hobbies? I for one spend entirely too much time on reddit, I have a desk job and am on it all day. I also waste a ton of time watching random stuff on youtube. I have been starting a lot of Rogan episodes lately but just throwing in the towel half way through.  Not sure if it has been the recent guests or what but halfway through I just get bored and I bail.  Think it is the random ultra marathoners, random weird diet doctors, professional bow hunter crap that I just haven't been into I guess.  Some of the MMA episodes have been pretty cool tho.Does anyone here NOT use old.reddit.com?Someone recently claimed that he was, but every time I hear him talk on it he's pretty neutral.  This even seems strange to me.  I hope his house is safe this fire season. Lost to right wing cucks, conspiracists and men who sold their souls to trump and police unions. If so why not?


With net neutrality looming, I feel like anyone who has a voice and makes their living from the internet should be speaking up. There's no way that this helps their outreach or makes their lives betterNot saying he isn‚Äôt - just I‚Äôve never heard him say anything more complex than a grade 11 science class or cursory google search would provide.  Has anyone found any advanced lectures by him? I know his whole thing is trying to make it accessible, but... yeah.We are making a change to the rules of the sub and wanted to let the sub know.  For many years, we have been extremely hands off moderating content.  We've used the "let upvotes and downvotes decide" mentality.  Unfortunately, the time has come, where that moderation policy is no longer effective in certain situations.

Our one rule is "Don't be a cunt."  Obviously, this is extremely subjective by design.  There are some subscribers that simply refuse to follow this rule.  Their threads and posts account for a large portion of the mod queue that we wade through on a daily basis.  We commonly miss real reports that we should deal with (reddit rules violations, posting pirated content, etc.) because we've grown numb to the mod queue.  This apathy comes from so many petty reports of users that other users simply dislike.

Reports don't go to reddit admins.  [I've asked previously that people stop using it in an attempt to game some nonexistent filtering system against their personal enemies.](/r/JoeRogan/comments/5lt03b/please_stop_reporting_stuff_that_you_dislike/)

Starting now, if we will begin banning users that continually post content (threads or posts) that do not add anything of value to the sub.  What is and is not of value to the sub will be determined by a review of the user's post history in the sub.  [This is an example of a post history that will no longer be acceptable.](https://i.imgur.com/Tm6LSNn.png)  This change will likely affect less than 1% of the sub.

If we identify a pattern of poor quality content being posted, we will notify the user that they need to increase the quality of their content.  If they refuse, they will not receive another warning.  Circumventing a subreddit ban via creating more accounts, is a violation of Reddit's [Content Policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/suspensions) and can result in your account being [suspended](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy#section_prohibited_behavior) from the site as a whole.

**tl;dr** If you shit post, repeatedly, you are in violation of Rule 1 and Rule 2 and will be warned.  Continue and you will be banned.Any of you guys have any type of life guidance or philosophy books that might align with Joe or Joe has put his stamp of approval on? Would be a great Christmas gift. I've only been listening for 4 or so years. Has there ever been an earthquake during an episode?
I discovered Obadiah Parkers cover version of Hey Ya because of Joe Hogan, when they were talking about it I wanted him to name names so I could look it up but I had to google it because he didn't. I think its only fair that Joe Hodge gives a shout out to the people hes talking about. People who creates videos that are so great Rogan himself mentions it should be rewarded with having their name mentioned on air.Hey guys,
I want to ask you what your top 10 favorite podcasts of all time are.
I need to download some at my brothers please because I don't have a good internet connection at my current place because im moving so i'm downloading a bunch at once.

Please exclude podcasts with other comedians (I just don't like them for some reason).

Here are some podcasts I already watched and loved (I probably watched more but I can name those on top of my head):
- 801 gary johnson (loved it)
- 858 Jesse ventura (loved it)
- Both jordan peterson podcasts 
- 911 lol
- 919 Neil degrasse tyson

Just name any interesting episodes with interesting people (I really like the scientist and political ones)

thank you for your helpThere's a [fair bit of data](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C23&amp;q=mediation&amp;btnG=) talking up the benefits of mediation. 

Dr. Rhonda and Tim ferris both talked about compassionate meditation this week. The take away from both of them talking about it and my research says, Compassionate mediation=Happier, more mindful person. the way your brain activity looks under an MRI goes a pretty drastic change. 

Why not try it?

Anyways, at most you lose 13 minutes of your time. 



[Here‚Äôs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz7cpV7ERsM) a youtube video you can follow if you're interested. 


I love the JRE and Joe Rogan for what he has given the world, but for someone talking about self improvement he has done little to improve his behavior during interviews. Since he speaks about self improvement a lot, its only fair and reasosanble that we discuss improvement in terms of words and thinking, not just running hills/hunting/weed/bjj/Fritz Haber.

I'm extremely grateful for what the JRE offers for free, and I would even pay if JRE became subscriber based, but Joe could benefit from stepping up his game in terms of listening to guest speak and then processing what they are saying and then respond accordingly.

Over the past months, I've noticed how some potentially good conversations has gone out the window because Joe is unable to participate in the conversation started by guests because hes not educated. I'm **not** saying Rogan is dumb in any way, I think hes a great guy that has provided me with a lot of insights into life as not just as a human but also as a man.

**I'm not saying he should change the format in any way**, what I'm saying is that Joe should develope the ability to play in a higher league in terms of philosophy and conversation ability. I use these terms loosely, what I refer to is of course the extra tools you get from higher education as one example. People have brought up the subject before, that Joe could benefit from taking a course or three at university level, and I agree. By broadening his mind not via drugs, but academic progress, he can become an immensely powerful host and interviewer. Powerful, powerful Joe Rogan 2.0.

edit: To clarify, and this is important in case it gets misunderstood, higher education is not just about learning about a subject, its also learning how to think and process data in a specific way.



I haven't watched any episodes with Burr or diaz. I see both have many. What would be the best episodes for each to get started? 

Going on a long road trip and need something to listen to.I almost never do things I fail at. It makes the idea of failure into a big scary monster. I wanna defang that fucker, any ideas?Can someone link me to modmail so I can message the mods? I'm on mobile and i cant find it On the Sobert episode they made it sound like there was another one in addition to that came about a month ago.  I feel like they mentioned it on the episode. kudos when kudos are due. I didn‚Äôt doubt you, but you called it. Imagine if a group of early humans are out away from the main group and lightning strikes a tree near them. It's probably the first time any of them have seen it, ever. All of a sudden something that's almost as bright as the sun and burning hot spreads around them and the temperature of the air increases to a temperature they've never come close to experiencing. The smoke from the burning shrubs and leaves makes it hard for them to see and breathe. Once they make it out and get back to the rest of their group or community they absolutely reek of a strong odor that none of the members outside of the group have smelt before, ashes and smoke. they MAYBE brought back a burnt branch of a tree or anything to show to the rest of their community. Could you imagine the mind fuck?  If you haven't listened to the [MMA 45 podcast with Justin Wren &amp; Rafael Lovato Jr.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/9ofdtw/), go listen to it.  This thread is in reference to the stuff they talk about.

Justin Wren is fundraising to bring clean water to those in need through [Fight for the Forgotten](https://fightfortheforgotten.org/heroes).

There are 180,000 subscribers to the sub.  If all you monkeys donate $1, we'll easily be the top team.

The team with the highest donations are supposed to win gym equipment.  I vote that we ask Justin Wren to take that gym equipment and renovate a gym of his choice.  I'm sure he knows some gyms that are in need of equipment.As the title states Alex Jones was removed from the guest list after being on it for awhile. Anybody have insight as to why this is? Was looking forward to watching him spew bat shit crazy conspiracy theories and Joe's reactions.Ready.......discuss.

Do you like that the sub allows guest requests now?

Do you want to see the sub move guest requests back to the general discussion thread?

We'll leave this discussion up for the weekend and see what comes of it.Listening to Joe drag out a completely unfunny joke for 25 minutes while his guest is trying to say something interesting is getting too frustrating for me. I still love the podcast, but Duncans Family Hour with Ari or Bert is waaaaay easier and fun to listen to.

I just liked it and wanted to bring some attention to Duncans podcast tooI feel like they'd really play off each other but then again Joey wouldn't like going down the deep rabbit holes about consciousness and other weird topics that Joe and Duncan usually get into.

oscar video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUMxWSF0W0What I'm looking to listen to are episodes of the JRE where he's had guests on to explain or debate the various things that Joe will often make fun with his right leaning guests. For example, was there ever an episode where a "social justice warrior" came on and talked to Joe about what social justice is etc. Or a show like the one with Steven Crowder and Not Gay Jared, but from the left's perspective? Stuff along those lines. Any recommendations?

Note: Do not recommend Abby Martin episodes to me. Do not.I started listening to his lectures initially to tear into his "religious, zealous, idealogy" and found that a lot of what he said makes sense, even if he says it in far too many words sometimes. 

If one were to actually try listening to some of what he says in his lectures. He's not a religious nut so much as a traditionalist. 

He firmly believes that you should always speak the truth, that that outcome is the best outcome that could have come about, regardless of the consequences. 

That you should set your sights on the highest good you could imagine, and better yourself then go towards achieving that goal. 

But he gets labeled as a cruel or misogynistic person by folks who don't much like their ideas challenged. Consider me baffled





I had all 4 shows open waiting for 2 hours before it went on sale and all were sold by 12:01You become dumber. Yes i speak from experience. It only seems like valuable knowledge but it is mostly professional people talking to stoned ape.

Sadly, it was too sealed up for me to get a whiff. No way in fuck id eat that shitSmh no podcast for days. Guess he's just done That is all upvote if you agreeI submit to you a game called Rainbow Six Siege. The replay value on this game is off the charts. It mainly focuses on tactical realism, while keeping balance with character abilities and weaponized gadgets. Ive been playing it for over 2 years and the game is supposed to be supported for at least a few more years. Definitely give it a shot seeing as you are into these first person shooters. Granted, R6S is a giant leap away from Quake Arena &amp; Fortnite.

EnergyFeelGreat.ELKGrillingOrganic.I've been listening to Rogan on and off for a few years now and I have my own personal opinions on Masculinity vs. Paying for sex and I happened to be listening to JRE and was wondering what he has mentioned about the topic , If any of you fellow listeners can recall. Does anyone feel like when he says hello freak bitches he's actually insulting the fans secretly.  Like for instance he is saying you guys are weird for having time to listen to my 3hour podcasts all the time... As in most people with lives don't have time for such things?   Ive listened to this guy for months, the only thing to do at work. He's constantly brainwashed me into thinking carbs are so bad for you. Yesterday I spent over 100 dollars on groceries and didn't buy hardly anything carb heavy.

Well, I told some people in r/nostupidquestions and guess what? They said that Joe Rogan is WRONG and carbs are actually good for someone who's underweight and trying to put on mass, like me.

So don't let him brainwash you It's hard to say exactly what I mean, they just both seem to have stories ready for literally any situation. I wanna believe Joey so bad but good grief he sounds like the old guy at the office lying about his life to fit in with the young guys. I haven't been watching Theo Von long enough to tell if it's a bit or what but in his latest podcast he claims he knew a guy whose name was half of conjunctivitis lol tell me I'm just analyzing some stand ups way too hard. /r/redesign is upon us and we're going to take this opportunity to update the [sub's banner image](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kjpCu4UBLBYQV4F1.png).

Rules

1. submissions close June 5, midnight EST
2. 1900px x 64px
3. [send submissions to mods via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FJoeRogan)

Mods are give the option of tile or fill for background.  Make a sub of your own to test out header backgrounds to see which mode works best for your image.

After all submissions are in, we'll create a new thread for voting on the new banner.Maybe I spelled that wrong. But that documentary (or however you'd call it) is a great one to watch baked. Im in the mood for something non fiction though We need these I can't sleep.It seems to me at least that Joe may be at peak levels of experience, despite his intake of Alpha brain and testosterone I'm just not sure he can intake much more information. His main areas of expertise being bow hunting, keto, coyotes, elk, 90's UFC fighter stats, Fritz, globalism, hack comedy, hallucinogenic drugs and dark bathtubs. No doubt he knows more about these few subjects than any man to ever live but I'm just not sure where Joe Rogan's experience goes from here. But go ahead and keep tryingNobody from JRE interacts on Reddit as far as we know.  Post your guest requests here, but don't expect much to come from it other than other redditors chiming in about whether or not they like the person you suggested.

[Guest Request Thread #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/7gn5no/guest_request_master_thread_3/)

I‚Äôm not looking for the ‚Äúdude, weed‚Äù podcasts, but one particular episode discussing research at John Hopkins helping veterans suffering from PTSD and bipolar. 

Really appreciative for your help!!!I have a feeling Elon is going to annoyingly excited and long winded, I'm excited it'll likely be interesting regardless. **edit** we have removed the rule: https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/9dwb64/guest_related_content_rule_change/

&gt;Use the official guest thread for discussions, screenshots, memes, etc about that guest.

This has been a sub rule for a while.  The justification for it being that as the podcast has grown in popularity, so has the rush from redditors to post the best meme, sound bite, or video clip from the current or recent podcast.  Add to those, the screenshots and links to news website about recent guests and the amount of threads/content for each guest reaches an overwhelming amount.

Add to all that the threads that people start simply stating their opinions about the current/recent guests because they refuse to join the official podcast discussion thread (for what I can only assume is karma-farming) and the guest related threads get out of hand.

The goal isn't to stifle content creation.  As an example, /r/mma mods push memes to /r/mmamemes.

The biggest issue with this rule is that we can't push all guest related content into the official thread, forever.  If a guest was on 2 months ago, it doesn't make much sense to push a news article about that guest into the official thread that is now 2 months old.

We are a pretty hands off mod team.  This rule causes active moderation.  Personally, I feel like it has helped the sub since we implemented it, but what do I know.

The mod team would like to get feedback from the sub on some options.

1. leave it as is, push guest related content into the official guest thread
2. open a new sub for current/recent guest related content (memes, screenshots, audio clips, video clips)
3. do away with the rule
4. something elseWe are removing the rule:

&gt;Use the official guest thread for discussions, screenshots, memes, etc about that guest.

If you received a ban related to this, please message the mods and we will remove the ban.

Please be aware of this rule though:

&gt;Post quality content

It's subjective for a reason.  If you want to shitpost, or only have an opinion about a guest, use the guest threads.We are updating the sub rule about guest requests.  Currently, guest requests need to be made in the general discussion thread.

Moving forward, guest requests can be made using wikipedia URLs.  If a person does not have a wikipedia page, then make your guest request in the general discussion thread.

Workflow:

Does the person have a wikipedia page?

 - yes - then post that url
 - no -then make the request in the general discussion thread

Wikipedia URL rules:

- don't use mobile urls.
- don't use urls with crap parameters `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan?monkeys=inspace`

Why the change?

This is now really the only rule that we have to get involved with to enforce.  The reason for the rule was that everyone wants to post "Check out my neighbor, he's hilarious, Rogan should have him on" threads.  By using Wikipedia as the gatekeeper, it will cut down on the amount of time having to moderate this.  Prior to the rule, we could see a dozen people a day post the same "I want to see {insert person that is currently trending on twitter}" threads.  Reddit won't let reposts from the same url happen, so we won't have this issue anymore, while allowing famous people to be discussed.Joe often shits on standard 9-5 jobs. He encourages people to try doing things they are passionate about instead of joining the rat race. Fair enough, solid advice.

Joe has also said that not everyone is actually capable of achieving this. Not everyone can become a successful podcast host or a famous footballer etc. Right again. 

**I'd like to hear what Joe recommends these people, who will be employed in mediocre jobs for the rest of their lives, should do to reduce suffering and find some kind of meaning.** Maybe I'm alone, but I think it would be more interesting than listening to the standard "Yeah, jeez, I could never cope with the standard lifestyle most people have going on."

Joe is a cool guy and I love listening to the podcast. Just a small bit of constructive criticism.She‚Äôs pretty funny!Sometimes you'll make a post in this sub and it will be removed by the automod and said post will be cross linked to r/thoughtsandprayers

That sub tends to aggregate posts from several other subreddit but there is no information on the subs propose, creator, mods, or anything else. And no comments on any of the posts there. 

Makes me wonder what the hell it is and I won't rest until we uncover the secret Chimps...WON‚ÄôT tear you apart?! the entire atmosphere in the room was more exciting, friendly, relaxed and informal. they were just hanging out. Joe let his guests speak, his jokes were actually funny, and to be perfectly honest... I like Redban better than Jamie. Redban's stupidity balanced Joe's pseudo-intellectual rants. I mean the dude asked Neil degrasse Tyson if chicks could squirt pussy juice in space. THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS I WANT TO HEAR! now the atmosphere feels empty, less fun, more formal and often awkward.

also with happened to Joe and Called? they were close and Joe was so nice to him in earlier podcasts. now he just constantly roasts and berates him

50:55

[https://youtu.be/Zp0AthDfqFU](https://youtu.be/Zp0AthDfqFU)It smelled like bullshit to me but I couldn't tell you why. Could someone lay it out for me? In the last year, Joe Rogan closed down his website's forums.  He's also had on some controversial guests.  When these guests are on, and for the week or so after the appearance, /r/joerogan experiences an influx of commenters battling it out with people of opposing views.

Everytime we make a mod announcement thread we get hammered for allowing brigading to happen.  When we ask for proof from the person complaining, they never have proof.  I've messaged the admins twice asking for them to see if something fishy is going on.  Admins insist that nothing is out of whack.

I've been a mod in the sub for almost 6 years.  I know something is out of whack.  We see oddly high vote counts.  We see people commenting that are never in the sub or rarely ever in the sub.

So, using a mixture of Reddit's API and /u/Stuck_in_the_Matrix's [pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/) I have created [botection.com](https://botection.com/).

Currently it is just a script to collect data over time.  This means I keep track of vote counts on all comments over time.  I keep time to respond.  I track how quickly people post then delete the post.  I track anyone commenting in the subs I track, then spider all the subs they have commented in before, and built a list of subs from people commenting in a specific thread.

The next step will be to introduce some natural language learning and a scoring system to try and identify possible bots.

If you have a sub you'd like botection.com to monitor, let me know.  I can add it to the list.

If you're a developer and are bored, I'd love to have some help.  Currently I'm running a LAMP stack, Laravel, Redis and Horizon.  I'm processing roughly 3000 jobs a minuteIn the Lea Remini episode, she was talking about how the scientologists have you sign legal documents without you reading it, and she said "just like you had me do here Joe. I could be married to you for all i know" 

Then she said "why are you shaking your head no?" Almost like Joe was giving her a sign to not talk about that. On other shows he has talked about how the JRE has become a business.

Likely with lawyers and all that stuff. So what kind of documents does Joe have them sign? Maybe a NDA on the adress of the studio? Maybe something saying he's not liable for anything they say on his platform?I‚Äôve never been shocked by the rogan podcast, but the fact that he didn‚Äôt know that blew me away, how did he not know that? I thought he was the one I learned that from. vote trump, join the NRA

this shit is supposed to be shown to kids that are three years old

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRfyKLt4hNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRfyKLt4hNU)Can we just start spamming this hashtag when Joe won't let a guest finish a sentence?

Joe must have missed his morning workout or something. Today's podcast was fucking annoying, especially coming from Mr. "I've become a lot kinder and a much better conversationalist after having done 1k+ podcasts". 

You can watch Shooter just hang his head when Joe interrupts from the millionth time Joe always looks like he has a huge dip in his bottom lip when he talks on his podcast. Idk why but this bugs me My father quit booze for about a month and then texted me when I was out asking for a half pint of vodka. Then he got pissed when I wouldn't get it. I think he fell off the wagon, who knows if he really even goes to his AA anymoreThis is the fucking problem! Lol. I say that the guy who cuts off his dick and calls himself a girl has a disorder and needs therapy. And all the leftist trans retards say "no. YOU need therapy bc you're a bigot".

This how absurd our culture has become. This is how degenerate and spineless we've all become. Calling a man, a man is now considered racist or some shit. God I fucking hate youevery guy that you hear of who has a podcast connected to the jre is doing very well. bert was making 30k an episode like 2 years ago, he's probably easily doubled or tripled it since then along with the jre. i imagine the church of what's happening now does better numbers than that

tom, bert, ari and joey are probably all pulling a million a year easy from their respective podcasts. tfatk is probably around 5 million. joe is anywhere from *40-70 million* with his billion uniques a month. 

people really don't like hearing this on the subreddit but the podcast industry is making these dudes incredibly wealthy as it shouldYep.

Stick a certain dose per hour and lower it every few days until you are down to nothing. That's actually a really cool moveWow he's ugly. Gives me a decent self confidence boostIf you eat the deer you gain back the damage he caused you. It's a cosmic thingIs that stretch waist stonewashed denim? NEED&gt; trans people have therapists

Why would a trans person need a therapist?If they have a mental condition, then it is morally correct to treat this as a disorder. It is not nice or compassionate to humor and go along with someone's mental disability. For instance, would you support your schizophrenic friend that wanted to cut his eyes out bc he always felt like a blind man? Would you procure heroin and cocaine for your drug addict friend bc they "need it"? This is exactly what you are doing to trans people when you go along with their bullshit.

People like you are spineless and have no backbone or moral principles. Your only moral principles are to "be nice to everyone!" And "just be cool man!" This is the definition of apathy. It's the definition of moral rot.

You are not somebody who would ever stand up for what you believe in, you would never go against the grain to fight for what's right against what is popular. That is why ou see a mentally ill person and instead of actually helping them, you go along with their mental disorder and humor them (when you agree that this is a disorder).

The reason I'm passionate about the whole trans issue is that it is indicative of a larger societal problem: We are giving up basic scientific facts in order to appease a small subset of mentally deranged people. If this becomes the norm in a broader sense, then we will lose everything as a culture. As aristotle said "tolerance and apathy are the last values of a dying society". You are so tolerant when it comes to trans people and you are so apathetic when it comes to the issue I'm raising.

I hope one day you can grow a spine and establish a moral compass for yourself.The medical communities opinion is that trans kids should be left alone until they are 18 bc 90% grow out of it. Johns Hopkins was the leader on gender dysmorphia for 20 years and this is their position. Only now is there a split in the issue and there is hardly any consensus in the medical community over this.

&gt; hateful ass

Seriously, what about anything I said is hateful? Trans people are people with a mental disorder and they need medical help. It's not hateful to have this position.

It's WORSE than hateful to take your position. Why? Because instead of being properly treated, their mental disorder is affirmed and they become even more confused. Just in the same way as a drug addict could be convinced by a close friend "don't listen to them man, your doing fine on coke. Let's get an 8 ball tonight, what do you say?" This is much worse than a hateful person because the person is putting their trust in you and instead of help, you just perpetuate their problem.

But since you are such a mental midget, all you can respond with is "hateful racist bigot!" Like every other mouth breathing spineless leftist. Here's an interesting question that, depending on how you answer says a lot: What is something that you believe is true that almost no one else does?&gt; your drug analogies are stupid

Explain why. I'm the only one making actual arguments. You are just calling me hateful and a bigot. So try for once to use your intellect and explain why the drug analogy isn't applicable here.

Do you at least agree that it is immoral to procure drugs for drug addicts? Why or why not?

And stating that trans people have a higher tendency toward violence is just a fact. It is an indisputable fact that 45% of them attempt suicide. Self harm is legally considered violence. Federal homicide stats include suicides for instance. But stating this FACT is "hateful and bigoted"? Makes no sense. Do you believe that there are some facts that are racist?Two words

You: HATEFUL BIGOT

Not the greatest threat to society, they are a *symptom* of the greatest threat to our society. Which is a loss of respect and care for science, a loss of our values as a society. The entire transgender movement is as anti science as teaching creationism in school. 

Do you support kids being taught creationism in school instead of evolution? Why or why not?Again, 45% of trans people attempt suicide. Self violence is legally counted on violence statistics. Is there something hateful about bringing up this fact?
To show support for Bert.Have you ever done yoga before? Stubborn, ignorant and greedy but to be fair that's how I would describe myself too. His show is now called the "War Room" and he has been pushing the civil war narrative for months now. Predicting mass shootings isn't hard due to the fact they are a daily occurrence in USA.  I'm not really sure what you're getting at, I guess you're just trying to say liberals are fascists for some reason? Regardless the fact is in regards to guns USA made her bed and with 300,000,000 guns on the streets she has to lay in it. In 2017, according to the CDC, there has been a mass shooting 273 days out of the 275 days of this year, on average 33,000 people die a year to a bullet in USA. Well I'm a liberal and I don't want guns banned, I hunt with a 12 gauge regularly. It's the type of guns and regulations on who can own them thats is the issue. I also beleive in free speech and have a bachelors in science. Like I said before though, I agree "America made her bed now she must lay in it", with 300,000,000 guns on your streets it's beyond repair. I feel bad for you and your countrymen that you need guns to feel safe in your homes and on your streets, if that's freedom I will be fine without it.    Canada doesn't ban all guns just the ones that can kill 60 people and injure 400 in under 10 minutes from over 1000 yards away. So sad that he's addicted to the devil's lettuceWell I mean there is a line right? It's just where you draw it, you wouldn't want your neighbours  to have and M1 Abrams tank would you? How about a hydrogen bomb? The 2nd amendment was written in a time of candle light and muzzle loaders I don't think the forefathers had the M249 SAW in mind when putting feather and ink to paper. Yes because rural elderly white men with large gun collections are the antifa's key demographic.

How about this? Let's not be assholes and wait until all the facts come out before we shamelessly politicized this tragedy.I mean I guess it's all perspective, think those people in vegas were worried about a tyrannical government? How about the 33,000 annually that die to a bullet. More people die to a gun in America each year than the death toll of American soldiers in war zones over the last 30 years. According to the CDC 273 days out of 275 days this year there has been a mass shooting where over 4 people died. 

You're not wrong though 300 million guns on your streets is irreparable at this point I'm just saying government tyranny doesn't really matter if your getting killed anyway. Then again like everything else nothing really matters, just apes on an asteroid brother. .... including you.

Do you see how it makes you look like a douche?No no like I said it's beyond repair, America made her bed and now she must lay in it. I agree that there is nothing can be done at this point with 300 million guns on your streets daily mass shootings and piles of dead US civilians annually is just a part of American culture at this point. But I mean if you're starving would you try to find food or just lay down and rot? Well you better stretch your line a little farther than belt fed semi auto's bud cuz one predator drone is gonna fuck your little militias day up. So your argument for the carnage caused by guns on American soil everyday is that someday you may need to take a page out of the Taliban's playbook and go gorilla warfare on the American government in some post apocalyptic world where a tyrant has taken over?  Jesus I wish you had to say that to the face of victims families in Vegas.  Alright well how about you take your "criminals will get guns anyway" argument and apply it to militias in your imaginary future post apocalyptic world of tyrants and gorilla warfare and assume they will get guns too. I'm sure if it comes down to it someone will sell arms to the american people, probably the Russians. LOL I can't beleive I'm having this conversation. 

I don't even care I'm Canadian, I don't even like Americans, I live in a place where I'm safe to walk the streets and go to sleep without a gun near by. I don't know why I even care about Vegas it's just fucking sad I care more about dead american civilians than thier own countrymen. Fuck USA man you fucks deserve the country you have created. I know your political system, I know your health care system, I know the terror and bloodshed you have caused around the world, I know your greed and corruption, I see how you treat your fellow country men and have read about your countries history in genocide and slavery. I know enough to know I have wasted enough time caring about a country that only cares about itself. I'm over it bro, fuck it, let it burn, the vegas gunman may have had a similar epiphany.  Bro he could barely run a 5k, while Bert is clearly a marathon runnerYup, Trump and Jeff Sessions are gonna MAGA by legalizing it. That'll teach those weed hating libtardsWell there is a mass shooting every day in America, according to the CDC, 273 out of 276 days this year thier has been a shooting were at least 4 people are killed. So if you can't talk about these tragedies after they happen then I guess you can never talk about it.  When I said he barely could barely run a 5k, I was kidding. He said it was harder than he thought, and it got him interested in running more. I think he's been running pretty regularly since, and could probably crush a 5k now.

Bert on the other hand sounds like he might actually be a pretty natural runner. Joe doesn't know what he's talking about when he says that treadmills are way easier, and if Bert is only exaggerating a little when he talks about the miles he puts in that's actually pretty good for someone with a horrible diet and an extra 70 lbs on him. If he could lose the weight and cut back on the drinking I believe that he could eventually run a marathon, and honestly I hope one day he does.First it's the jazz cabbage, then it's a slippery slope to the jizz cribbage.It's not gay sex if you're holding a gun and/or bowWhen's that dude gonna be on the podcast??? He'd be an amazing guestWhere do I get some of them turn boots?I like Jocko, I do BJJ, and I'm in the military, but I just can't get into his podcast. Idk I think Its just too corporatey for meReporting does nothing. Place them on ignore or block them.I've listened to a couple episodes and  it seems very focused on issues that business leaders face. That makes sense, because thats what his consuting company does, but I find corporate/office culture very stiff and off putting.Dude I hope he gets Joe into cyclingIn places like and SF LA it might be.What a tardIs there a way to stream this in America?Ya, but Jim Norton shouldn't be taking hiv prevention drugs. That's actually pretty good adviceIt'd be great if I could pay a few bucks to be able to watch Icarus.  I don't have a netflix account.  I wish these documentaries wouldn't hitch their wagon to a single content delivery platform.Where can I pay for the single document?  I didn't realize that was an option.I'm fine paying a little more if it all goes to the content creators.  That's kind of the point of my original post.

I run a Plex server.  I like all my content to be there.  I can download movies to my device for offline viewing if I like.  I don't have to jump between this app or that app or this website.  That's why I posted saying I wish content creators wouldn't lock in to one service.  Just let me pay for the mkv.I want the content for my Plex server.  I don't want to be forced to use Netflix's app.  I like to be able to load content onto my device and watch it anytime I like.

I don't understand why I'm considered tight when I'm asking to be able to pay for the content.  I just don't want to have to deal with Netflix.It might be the average, but average doesn't really mean shit. The median income is about 30k per year.

Also don't worry about me, I'm fine‚ÄúCan‚Äôt put my finger on it, I just like the guy‚Äù-Joe RoganAnd here I am doing some primitive level shit to test clean for weed. I always knew there was an easier way.I mean I'm not American but calling people trying to save American lives fanatics etc...doesn't sound right. 

Such a weird culture you people have, you will socialise trillion dollar wars across the world but when it comes to socialising health care or education for your people, Nope can't do that. 

You will bow to the flag and suck off soldiers while hoarding weapons in your basements out of fear you may have to kill those same same soldiers in a imaginary tyrannical uprising. 

You fear muslims and brown people yet since 2001 muslims have killed under 5000 Americans while mad men with guns have killed in the high hundreds of thousands. 

Trump is phenomena on his own a reality TV star, daddies billionaire, convicted con man is who you elect to represent your country?

I'll never understand America and I've given up trying, entertaining to watch though I'll give you that. Stefan Molyneux. Fuck Texas, separatist scum.  What exactly is "Antifa crap" like star bucks coffee cups and plaid shirts? Makes no sense anyway, have a drink like me. Couple nice rum and cokes feel great. I'm satan. Not a big fan of him pushing substances on others either but the introspection into his family life is a little much, who cares. Yeah I couldn't believe he was encouraging a recovering addict to do drugs. Also he's always talking about people on antidepressants. I just went on them to try to save my own life because I've been close lately to taking  my life. These people don't need to be shamed they are trying to be healthy versions of themselves.I need them to work or I'm going to kill myself. I don't need an out of touch multi millionaire placing any doubt in my brain or convincing me I'm going to be the next mass shooterIs segura funny or just an idiot that gets on stage and knows the right people? Comedy is kinda a sham i feel like half the guys I work with are funnier they just live in the wrong place and don't have the connections. Rippin pepsDownvote me you filthy sheep. Baaaaaaaaaa sheep. Big like dead Ralphi, or Burnt Chrysler? Muhhhh comedy. It's how I do feel faggot. Bout as funny as you. Ralphie may ate himself to death and Hitler had some good points. I should be a shepherd the way the sheep flock to me in this comment section. Gimme your sisters phone number and things will be better gay boy. I completely agree.

Even though I've never met him, Joe Rogan is one of my favorite people I "know". He has this incredible ethusiasm for everything he does and I feel it leads to the over all theme if his show, self improvement. Whether it's bow hunting, or Jiu-Jitsu, or just learning about new stuff, he really throws himself into it. I think he did the same thing for stand up. I don't think he has a real natural talent for it, but through effort and hard work he's made himself a pretty funny comedian. But he'll never reach that genius level, because at a certain point you have to have that raw talent. He makes me laugh, but I personally know people funnier than him. That's okay though, because I don't judge people soley on their comedic chops. I think Joe's strengths lie elsewhere.Thank you Bravo man, agreed. I‚Äôve always felt Joe pretends to be a ‚Äúeveryone should be able to do drugs if they want to‚Äù type of person when really he is a ‚Äúeveryone *should do drugs*‚Äù kind of guy.Unless you‚Äôre implying some strange causal relationship, sea creatures with any form of  bioluminescence will have an evolutionary advantage over those that don‚Äôt. The complete lack of sunlight at certain depths is what really forces fish to be psychedelic.Best of luck moving on from that addiction friend.Alright *everyone* needs to chill the fuck out. This podcast is *inherently controversial*. I mean, this show boils down to people with opinions and personality. It‚Äôs stuff everyone has an opinion on, it‚Äôs the shit most of us argue about with family and friends.

This sub isn‚Äôt going to fit the typical subreddit vibe because the JRE is literally listened to by hundreds of thousands of people from all over the political spectrum. This sub should reflect every angle, and if it doesn‚Äôt people call each other out. This isn‚Äôt a joe rogan fan club, so all you people courageously announcing your departure because of how outraged you are by joe can leave. Good riddance. This sub was never about agreeing or disagreeing with joe. I like his damn podcast, that‚Äôs it.‚ÄúWhat a great opportunity to boost my ego‚ÄùOh there's always something to say on this sub

Fuck Ari

Bert is fat

CoyotesBro give it up, hes just not that into youIDK I'm a relatively successful happy family man and I still really like the JRE. I don't take what he says as gospel, but when I listen to the show I'm always entertained, usually learn something, and usually feel motivated to go out and better myself.

I treat it the same people like my parents treat church. It's got a lot of bullshit, only nuts take it 100% seriously, but overall it's got a good message and I enjoy it.I think later.

Then they make him run the full length of the court dribbling huge basketballs. He will inevitably trip. Then he gets back up, runs as fast as his *widdle wegs* can take him, jumps on a trampoline, catches a basketball mid air, and finishes with a dunk.Is Joe growing a 'stache?

I think it looks cool\#prayforariThose would make sweet kettlebells. KettleballsI think he looks like George with hairIn the latest burt episode I could hear his laugh and he's usually pretty quiet but I really feel it added to the episode. I know there has been a ton of complaining but God damn the latest episodes have been really entertaining to say the least. Pretty sure you can't get aids from the father. Am I the only person this doesn't bother? But here's the crazy thing, Jamie is so good at what he does that I've seen him *actually predict* what Joe was going to ask him to pull up. Now granted, all of us can see some of his requests coming from a mile away (Fritz Haber, Chimpanzees, etc). But I think Jamie really tries to predict what Joe will ask for (I once saw like 15 tabs open on his browser at the start of a show....), and Joe's used to that efficiency, so he gets frustrated more easily.

AND there have been a few times I can remember when Jamie spotted a train of dialogue coming between Joe and a guest, anticipated a connection between where the conversation would go and some new idea/discovery that would be an interesting and organic conversational branch off of that repeated story, and *effectively participated in the flow of the conversation*, without just acting like Joe's personal Wikipedia.

For example, I'm pretty sure I once saw a new guest bring up an interest in ancient history, and before Joe had even begun the familiar descent into Graham Hancockian theories, Jamie had pulled up a news article about some new discovery at Goebekli Tepe (or something like that). He basically hit the fast-forward button so we wouldn't have to hear the same old theories and ended up where Joe would eventually be if he went on another 15 minutes: Goebekli Tepe. It's like Jamie tries to add to conversations that are stale/repeated silently by just throwing up news articles/videos. He just posts shit for the halibut.You don't need to prove efficacy to get fda approval. Merely prove that it won't kill people in excess. And these studies are funded by and presented to the FDA (when the data suits them) by who exactly? Is this based on number of total Americans or on the percentage of our collective weight?What? I liked that show.In a recent podcast with a female guest who was borderline abusive to her dogs, they also talked about R Kelly and this book and the cover of it and the mics was talked about for a whileSomeone here is shadowbanned I think.Gotta get that Deep Sea DThe couple workout videos I've seen Joe put out so far are fucking savage. I'm looking forward to more.One day I want a house as kick ass as his studio1. \#911. Can't stand Alex Jones, but God damn that was an incredible episode. If only Eddie Bravo hadn't been there.

2. All the episodes with Duncan. I feel like these two together really bring out the best in each other, and honestly would perfer it if Duncan was a full time co-host. All of these episodes are hysterical plus I usually learn alot and gain new perspectives.

3. The Bert and Tom weigh ins. I couldn't stop laughing, the one where they come up with sober October is pretty good too. I hope they keep doing stuff like thisThe black Keys - I got mine. It's on the thickfreakness album. Trust me I'd know it's my favorite god damn album.I can't stand Trump, but God damn she's a close second in how annoying she is. Can she just stop lying. She's never going to be president, why still lie?To each his ownPeyote Coyote

It's like game of thrones, but with coyotes doing MMA on psychedelicsThe guy has many, many flaws. He says despicable things (most notably claiming Sandy Hook is a hoax), hes clearly a charlatan who who tricks he stupid out of money, but God damn if he isn't charasmatic. He's almost hypnotic in the way he talks and acts. He's funny, and obviously intelligent in a screwed up way. Plus I love conspiracy theories. Not because I believe them, because I really think 99% of them don't stand up to scrutiny, but I like them because they're like fan fiction for real life. They add an extra layer of intringue to stories that almost certainly have much simpler explainations. They make you feel like you're in on a secret, a hidden knowledge that only the truly woke can understand. I get why people fall in deep to conspiracies rabbit hole, but for those of you that are in too deep, I suggest looking into the details and motives of these theories. When you do, you'll find that in order for most of them to work it they really require alot of leaps of faith, especially when it comes to what motivates the people to carry these acts out.Kriechers always been a hack.

I will give him props for herding the sheep tho, he makes a good shepherd.I forgot her name and knew if I made vague references to her someone else would take the time to correct me. Thanks!Floated once, and it was pretty cool. I think it's like what Joe says, it gets better the more you do it. But as far as things that I'd like to spend my time and money on, floating isn't real high on the list.

Now if I had one in my house, and only worked a couple hours a week, didn't have to be drug tested for employment, then fuck ya I'd float all the time. Maybe when I retire I'll get one.

As for cryo, I'm really interested to hear what people have to say. I work out everyday, most days twice a day, and I'm getting older so I'm starting to feel it. There's some places around me and I've been wanting to try it, but I'd like to hear some real opinions on it.

Edit: so I did some research, it's 20 bucks a session where I'm from. Worth it?These are the bestMeh, I'll wait for the audiobookWhoever keeps reporting shit as

needs to stop.  Respond to the person harassing you or block them.  Mods aren't here to remove comments you disagree with.&gt; That's my opinion

That's the key.  If you don't like what's being said, engage or block the person.

Mods have to wade through piles of "they hurt my feels" reports, and miss the report about someone linking to pirated content on youtube, which is really what the report functionality is for.

&gt;I guess be proud to soak up all that low quality humor, hate and ignorance.

You don't know me.

&gt;thank you for your professional ~~opinion~~ generalization 

Pot......let me introduce kettle.

&gt;The full fledged ignorance of the whole thread is so obvious.

Generalize much?I love my family, but I love his studio more. I think he'd be making the right choiceThe audio podcast still plays the intro.

BTW who watches the show on YouTube? I love the JRE, but I like working out to it, or doing projects with it going on in the background. I couldn't imagine sitting down and watching it like a show for 3 hours straight.Good, fuck Doug Benson that dude sucks.

OMG weed lol. 

Seriously I like weed, I want it legal, but people like Doug give it a bad nameWoah ma. You know guise I didn't tell my parents but I'm starting to think it's crazy that we arrest people for pot. I mean it's just a plant! Did you know George Washington white walled 4 foot bongs hourly? Could be a decoy. Do what you want gonna fuckin die in 50 years anyway, if we don't nuke ourselves first. I know right. I'm funny, I can make my friends and family laugh, but I would never think I'm funny enough to do stand up, and yet I know I would be better at it than Doug Benson.Wouldn't that vaporize it into an uncontrollable nuclear weed winter that smoked out everyone on Earth? The dank-ass fallout would potentially bake all 7 billion of us for over a month....


...did we just solve all our problems and bring world peace?You didn't like my Benson-esque joke?Syatt looks like a tranny Jabba the Hutt. Some people really do need a punch tho. You're one of the only users of the sub that make me hate being a mod here.  You really should take a look at your submission history in /r/JoeRogan and reconsider if you're bringing quality content to the sub, or just being a cunt.

Having to click the "approve" button on your stuff, every day, multiple times a day, is really draining.I don't read the content you post.  Well, at least not any more.  Initially when you joined the sub, I would review all the stuff you posted because it was flagged so much as spam.

After determining that you weren't posting spam, you're just posting stuff that doesn't have much value, I gave up actually checking the content.

I have no clue who Glenn Greenwald is.  I have no clue what George W. Bush Day is.  I have no clue what either of them have to do with JRE.  Unfortunately, as mods, we don't block content based on our subjective review of the quality of the content.

Does that help explain what's draining about dealing with your posts in the sub?Which leads us back to what I originally said.  Maybe you should evaluate the quality of the content you are posting.

My opinion of your post quality has nothing to do with this conversation.  The sub's opinion of your post quality does.  Which is why I'm here complaining, publicly, and directly to you.Well, a few things.  Every single one of your posts gets reported.  This only happens with a very tiny fraction of the sub's users.  That's one indicator.

Indicator two, your threads generally have a "stop posting here" vibe.  Ignoring this doesn't mean it's not true.

Indicator three, generally your threads have a &lt; 50% upvote.

Indicator four:

Are you trying to say that we can only have an opinion on a hugely important issue relevant to geopolitics and billions of american tax dollars **IF AND ONLY IF** we have also studied (insert unrelated region here)?

edit: interesting downvote ratio on this comment. I guess reddit believes you have to know about pakistan in order to have an opinion on Israel.

edit 2: here is the scenario run down  
Me: "I think what the Palestinians went through and are still going through is amoral"  
You: "but what about Pakistan though?"  
Me: "Ok, yeah that seems not cool, I think my original point still stands"  
You: "No, you have to talk about Pakistan every time you talk about Israel or else you are a hypocrite"  
Me: "Idk that seems kinda irrelevant. Did the individual humans who were hurt by the state of Israel need to know about Pakistan?"  
You: "Dumbass"  Yeah there is nothing wrong with Jews seeking a state.

We'll one problem; there were people living where they decided to build it.

Israel's solution: kick them out with violence where applicable, make them second class citizens elsewise. A lot like what America did to the first nations.if you could maybe read up on the subject more before contributing to conversation any further **that'd be greaaaaaat**&gt; An entire conflict explained in a sentence

not my intention. im providing a counter point to whomever i responded to.

&gt; explains Arabs being 1/5th of Israel proper's population

oh, you mean currently. not like 1940's population, which was like 3 times that 20%. Maybe read the rest of the sentence? " make them second class citizens elsewise"

&gt; A lot like what America did to the first nations.

&gt; Makes total sense

cool we agree. good talk "bruh"good talk bro.you can look through my comment history to see my contributions to this thread.I'm promoting informed discussion by asking the ignorant to stop poisoning the thread.the person I responded to was justifying Israel's right to exist because the Jews were kicked out of everywhere in Europe. I said this justifies them having their own state to protect them. This does not give them moral authority to take over other people's land. that is my counter point.

you can go back to what I said, and I never said Zionists kicked out "all" of the arabs. I've seen figures for the Nakba around 700,000 people. Perhaps I could throw in a pointless percentage vs numbers comment here?

**Are you denying Zionists forcefully removed Palestinians from their land?**

the first nations people population is closer to 10% of what it was - oh shit there I go with percentages again.

your nonsense about growing population doesn't justify a response. first nations have had growing populations over the last 100 years. that is what human (like all animals) do, they reproduce.I never even brought up who owned the land. You are attacking a strawman.

I said there were people living in Palestine and the Zionists - Zionists being people united by ideology (of the Jewish right to a plot of land) - used force and violence to expel the Palestinians.

&gt;My "nonsense" complete shit on your "argument" so that's saying a lot about your "nonsense" in and of itself.

and here I thought I was communicating with an adult.no, I think you learned to not comment on things you are ignorant of.scenario: bill cosby is on trial for drugging and raping a series of women.

defendant: "but what about all the rapes that have happened in Sri Lanka since the war ended?"

me: "thats whataboutism"

you: "dumbass"

TLDR: other people doing bad things doesn't make your own bad actions go away. This thread is about whether or not the state of Israel has committed crimes, the answer to that is independent to the history of Pakistan.&gt; A) ignorant (you)

I laughed.

I don't see how your example is "insightful" or relevant. I thought my example clearly stated how whataboutism can be used to point out someone trying to derail a discussion. Your example is poor because the person making the initial statement is having that exact statement questioned.

Does the formation of Pakistan into what it is today have anything to do with *having an opinion* on the morality of Israel? I don't think so.

&gt;[saying "Whataboutism"] doesn't change the morals of the actions or make anything go away

am I understanding you here? the use of "It" was confusing. My position is not that saying "whataboutism" changes the morals or actions or makes things go away. My position is not that saying "whataboutism" negates the legitimacy of "You stole from me last week. Were you wrong then?"

My position is that when having a conversation about the crimes of the state of Israel, bringing up the crimes of other states is irrelevant.so lets take a person who has studied Israel and the regions history, say for 20 years. they've read documents, first hand accounts of what it was like during certain periods, they've read laws by the various governments going back 2000 years.

Unless they also know about Pakistan, they know nothing about Israel?

that is your argument, apparently.

here is the scenario run down

Me: "I think what the Palestinians went through and are still going through is amoral"

You: "but what about Pakistan though?"

Me: "Ok, yeah that seems not cool, I think my original point still stands"

You: "No, you have to talk about Pakistan every time you talk about Israel or else you are a hypocrite"

Me: "Idk that seems kinda irrelevant. Did the individual humans who were hurt by the state of Israel need to know about Pakistan?"

You: "Dumbass"In what other situation does giving context release any being or group of their moral responsibility?

person A murders someone

Please use the youtube video url: https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/79plsk/joe_rogan_experience_1031_jamie_kilstein/No worries.*Oh. My. GAWD*!I listened to most of the podcast while doing work earlier today. For the most part, this was an interesting episode.

To get the negatives out of the way, there were a lot of moments where the podcast went offtrack during some interesting points while Kilstein was talking about the shit that went on in his life. First there was the usual bitching about progressives, SJWs and Liberals from Joe. I honestly get annoyed at this because Joe, while saying there are assholes on all sides, preaches way too much about a small portion of Liberals. I feel like Joe isn't very well informed on certain things and only goes by what people around him tell him. 

There are so many points where I wish I could just tell Joe directly "I get it, some Liberals call people racists, misogynists, Islam/Trans/Homophobic. They don't represent the entire left and they're not the only people attacking others over different political beliefs. Can you please just talk about fights and Joey Diaz fart stories instead?" He makes too many one-sided statements that are judgemental about the left, which makes it hard to take him seriously on social discussions. 

Now if you haven't stopped and hit the downvote button yet....

I was really intrigued while hearing Kilstein's story after the accusations came out. I felt like he was being upfront about being a fake male-feminist thinking with his dick instead of his brain who suppressed so much from his life because of an image he tried to uphold and people he tried to impress. It was refreshing to hear him admit that he was full of shit, judgemental, and fake. I also liked how he admitted that he that he never read articles about certain issues he claimed he was interested in and just shared it cause it fit with his agenda. 

Everything he claimed about his personal life was pretty interesting. His claims of being a pariah and having suicidal thoughts were pretty deep. Because he admitted to being a fraud, I ended up being skeptical about how honest he was being. I could see him being depressed and wanting to kill himself after the accusations came out, along with him being upfront about faking his beliefs. At the same time, I think he was trying to get fans of JRE who didn't like him before to change a negative opinion about him into a positive one.

The entire explanation of the accusations and saying he was in a "behind closed doors" open relationship seemed sketchy. An ex-girlfriend being vengeful is pretty realistic, but given Kilstein's past and admittance to being a phony made it hard for me to find his story credible. There has to be more than he's letting on, cause a guy just doesn't peace out from his family and friends if he's innocent. 

Really in the end, I sorta came out of this feeling bad for Kilstein. He seems like a guy who realizes that he burned all his bridges and is trying to build new ones. The scene he got big in won't accept him, so now he's gotta get in good with another one. I also got the impression that he was a guy who just wanted to laugh at comedy people in his social circles wouldn't accept and eat bacon double cheeseburgers without being judged by his friends.

Overall it was a solid discussion that would've been better without the constant preaching about progressives/Liberals. I think people who wouldn't give this a listen should give it a chance. It should be interesting to see what happens with Kilstein in the future.Have you suddenly stopped being a racist?

He hates on Trump all the time, he talks non stop about universal basic income, he's not a right-winger. He's got some conservative opinions, and he's got some liberal ones. You know, like a normal well adjusted person.There is a lot of SJW/Liberal talk in the opening. After that the discussion becomes about various things like the Hollywood sex accusations. Now they're talking about Donald Trump's presidency. No. They're talking about colleges and Liberals now.Yeah. The fact that he admitted he never read articles and just shared them cause of the titles was pretty admirable. Just a glutton, Alcoholic and above all else a shit comic.  Thanks Dr whattheepersonNo source?I dont think Joe would ever say he has all the answers. He seems very humble about his intelligence and is constantly changing his views as he gains new knowledge.

The JRE is a self-improvement show disguised as a stoner-comedy show. The overall theme, other Fritz Haber facts, is making yourself better physically and mentally.Lashing out at father figures for attention is a typical  sign of daddy issuesI agree with you.

I mean I'm not black, I've never have filmed myself having sex, nor have I ever been to prison, but one time someone was talking on their cellphone in a movie theater and I gave them a real mean look. So ya[Sure about that?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War?wprov=sfla1)Nyet comrade. The senator has no criminal ties to Russia, that is fake news put out by moose and squirrelIt's like a conversation manPlease no. I really hope this isn't true, Dustin Hoffman is an American iconPlus they really get into the technical/business side of their job that I really don't care about.

Also, am I the only one that doesn't really enjoy standup? I love comedy in other forms, but standup rarely does it for me. Joe and the comedians he has on are funny and interesting on the show, but during standup I feel like the humor is very forced.I think he's Centrist-Libertarian who comes off as someone with right wing beliefs mixed with left wing ideologies.

TL;DR version: 

Joe comes off as conservative cause of free speech, comedy, criticizing Liberals/Progressives all the time, ignoring the things conservatives/right-wing people do, thoughts on Islam, having Alt-Right guests, and his thoughts on economics. While he comes off as that way, I think it's only cause he's been influenced by right-wing people. Personally, I don't think Joe knows enough about politics to really lean Left or Right. If he had more Liberal or Progressive guests that talked about Liberal issues, this topic would be totally different.

Long version:

I think Joe's been coming off as conservative lately because his podcasts have been heavily critical of Liberals/Progressives. I'm a Liberal myself, but even I think that a guy like him is a target for the SJW/Feminist movement who want to police celebrities for what they say. He's a white, male comedian who has some fame and he doesn't want to see people get unfairly demonized. With that small fringe of the left going after stuff like comedy and jokes becoming a huge deal in recent years, he's going be understandably passionate about that subject. With a lot of right-wing people preaching about "free speech" so much, Joe will naturally be inclined to side with them on that matter. 
 
To go along with Joe possibly siding with certain right-wing people because of free speech, I think the amount of right-wing leaning guests on Joe's podcasts created this image that he's a right-wing guy. You go on YouTube and you'll even see self-described Alt-Right or conservative channels posting his clips of him talking about SJWs and Islam. Also, when Joe talks about economic inequality, he sounds like a conservative. I don't think he really understands how economy works or what causes economic inequality, but when he talks about it. he sounds like he's spewing talking points from Fox Business by just saying "well that's the price of freedom man."

What it all boils down to is this; I don't think Joe really understands enough about politics to lean either way. It's just all perspective. If Joe had guests that were Liberal/Progressives that talked about minorities still facing tons racial discrimination in society or how Republicans are trying to pass terrible bills in Congress and the Senate that hurt the working class, everyone would be saying "man Joe is such a SJW cuck." Plus you never really hear Joe go off on conservatives/Alt-Right guys who do fucked up shit like he does SJW/Progressives, so there's that.

I‚Äôve listened to too much of his podcast, Burr has a heart of solid gold.Exactly, we like CK the entertainer, but it‚Äôs clearly an act. Its a masterpiece of comedy, but it‚Äôs rehearsed and practiced nonetheless. But Burr doesn‚Äôt really put on an act, he is 100% who he is at all times and doesn‚Äôt give a shit who finds it entertaining or not. And with thousands of hours of conversations, a real douchebag would get exposed quickly, unlike Burr.

For example, I‚Äôve heard Burr berate himself for mistreating a cashier for like 30 min on TMMP. IÔ∏è would listen to it and be like ‚ÄúJesus dude the guy probably forgot about it already‚Äù, but he would sincerely regret being a dick to people. It‚Äôs like every episode to be honest.

Thanks friend, that‚Äôs been  seriously bothering me.Because he is a good thinker. Good thinkers know how to organize their thoughts into a coherent system, so that all of the parts are related to one another. That‚Äôs why he can go on and on and it isn‚Äôt overwhelming; you can follow a clear line of logic that connects the first thing he said to the last thing he said hours later. Sam Harris is like this too, IMO.

Most thoughts are one dimensional, even Dan‚Äôs, because we don‚Äôt need to have a complex view of everything we encounter.

He overplays the tough-conservative bit to the point of caricature, allowing him to win over people like Joe while also expressing some genuine opinions.This guy is just naturally funny, glad he‚Äôs still filming specials.I respectfully disagree. The situation is extremely delicate. These people have been basically bred in captivity, they are completely ill-prepared to adjust to anything we would consider normal. It is drilled into them that SK filled with shitty cowards who should be punished. Who takes over if Kim is gone? What happens to their government, their people, their infrastructure? The Kims are smart, they need their people to need them. You better believe Kim is using the dependence of the citizens on him as a weapon against the US. 

There is no solution other than capitulation. Drop all sanctions, send aid, and learn to live with a nuclear NK. Why? Because 1) Kim is not suicidal, and any offensive action on his part = no more NK, and 2) the clusterfuck of the nuclear situation rests squarely on the shoulders of Bush and Obama. Many opportunities for de-escalation have been destroyed by political buffoonery.

Look at how hesitant NK is to actually cross the line. They always dance around the possibility of action, but never provoke a military response. This is not the behavior of some reckless child, it‚Äôs calculated to show enough strength to get the US to back off.

Remember what happened when Gaddafi gave up his nuke program to please his American allies? Regime-change. That‚Äôs the message we are sending: give us your nukes and we will peacefully neuter your country, or don‚Äôt and we‚Äôll do it by force. Seemed to work really well when we tried it in Iraq, right?

English is hard.I think there is a legitimate level of entertainment value in it though. I definitely laughed my ass off when I saw this.Don't mangle the headline.Why doesn't joe talk about THIS on his podcast? 
Should probably make a thread about it here anf tweet at him on Twitter too. I know I tweeted to him and Duncan about net neutrality this morning. Fuck things will go downhill fast online if net neutrality is repealed. Could I have you explain why NN is garbage? Also, why would i want to give my ISP power to censor info and throttle my data?There is so much wrong with your understanding of the situation, it's going to be hard to respond, but here goes.

&gt;it forces businesses into very specific business models

Which business model is that?

&gt;it limits the choices for consumers

Hard to limit choice when most everyone only has one choice to begin with.  You know, because ISPs sue anyone trying to run new lines in a city.

&gt;That technology would have to be shelved because the regulation says that all bandwidth must travel at the same rate

WTF?  No.  Net Neutality says that ISPs can't slow down traffic.  It doesn't say anything about not being able to deliver all content equally at fucking mach 10 speeds.  You must be joking, right?

&gt;Also, if you introduced the ability to not have the internet seen as a utility, you allow new businesses who have new ideas to enter into the marketplace, creating more competition, better quality, and lower prices.

Except internet access is not a utility.  Google common carrier.

&gt;Why wouldn't you charge people more to take in more bandwidth.

Consumers are charged more.

&gt;Fuck that, give me choices.

We're trying, but ISPs fight it at every turn.  ISPs are the only people supporting getting rid of net neutrality.

&gt;In a true market system

Except that's not what we have here.  We have [government granted monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-granted_monopoly).

&gt;Everytime the government becomes involved, services worsen and costs rise. 

I'm going to put a note on my calendar to PM you in 2 years if net neutrality is trashed so we can discuss how much your internet bill has increased, because that's what's going to happen.So for instance if SpaceX accomplishes their goal of blanketing the world in internet via cubesats and their bandwidth is higher than their competition then they will be regulated to provide the exact same speeds as copper wires that traditional ISP's use? (Assuming SpaceX's internet has higher bandwidth).

The other thing I question is, isn't there already enough bandwidth for consumers to use for videos/gaming? So then you'd be giving the ISP's a reason to simply charge you more for what you were already using.

As for freedom, I only have a choice between two ISP's where I live. It's commonly known they charge the same rates for the same service and they are basically a duopoly. I want freedom too, but there isn't true capitalism or even a real marketplace when it comes to the internet here (and from what I've heard online, in many places across the US) - I don't want to fork over the right for them to censor what I see or throttle data from specific sites because if and when they do that, I won't really have an alternative to use.&gt; So for instance if SpaceX accomplishes their goal of blanketing the world in internet via cubesats and their bandwidth is higher than their competition then they will be regulated to provide the exact same speeds as copper wires that traditional ISP's use? (Assuming SpaceX's internet has higher bandwidth).

Nobody is forcing anyone to slow anything down.

We want the government to forbid ISPs to purposely slow down traffic depending on its source.

The ISPs want to be able to extort consumers. "If you don't pay us more, we will slow down {insert competitor's website here} to the point where it's unusable."  "Oh, you want to game on Steam, well we, your ISP, own {shitty gaming network} and if you don't pay us extra, we will make Steam unusable."&gt;  So, say there is a new technology that can handle certain bandwidth much better than other bandwidth. That technology would have to be shelved because the regulation says that all bandwidth must travel at the same rate, otherwise you are creating an unfair situation.

That's why I'm asking him about being forced to slow down new technologies and to back up his claim. I understand why Verizon/FCC are doing this and what they have to gain. So far I'm pretty pro NN, most arguments against NN are saying that repealing it encourages freedom in the marketplace but there are generally only two players in most cities so competition has already been thrown out the window. Keeping NN in tact seems a lot easier than repealing all the prior regulation that has encouraged these duopolies and frankly I don't have faith in our system to properly regulate capitalism so these duopolies don't arise.

So I'm left wondering why those who are anti NN are in favor of letting them censor info/websites or let them throttle our data. They really need to be able to back up that repealing NN will ensure competition and if their argument is that it's one of many steps needed then I'm sorry but that's next to impossible given our POS government. The anti NN argument is weak if it requires us to transform most of our existing laws.I knew I would be disappointed by engaging with you.Thanks for the reply but can you answer any of my questions from above?

Recently they have been throttling data, did you not see the scandal about Netflix? I don't believe they've had the right to censor data for 20 years, can you back this claim up with a source? They will definitely be able to censor if they please if/when NN gets repealed. 

Also, in order for your way of doing things to work, we'd need not to just repeal NN but all of the prior existing regulations with ISP's. The government is too inept to respond to something like that. Keeping NN in place with the duopolies is far more simple and achievable given our POS government.

Lastly, I would love for you to clarify - regulating for possibilities vs. regulating for _____________? What does regulating for possibilities mean?/r/iamverysmart is that way.Put it in the guest request thread.Repost: https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/7eikin/a_selftaught_rocket_scientist_who_believes_the/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=JoeRoganNever! /s 

I have. In fact I think that‚Äôs one of the cornerstones of retardation in our whole system. Apparently one side is pro regulation and one side is anti regulation. Both ideas are quite extreme and stupid. There is an amount of regulation needed for any industry and i have yet to encounter something that doesn‚Äôt need any regulation at all because there are enormous negatives to any situation that are extenuated by our technologically advanced society.

What‚Äôs been done so far to the Internet has not yet broken it. While it‚Äôs terrible that I have such a poor marketplace, it is still functioning and I would welcome more competitors. That being said I want to know what‚Äôs broken about it that needs to be fixed? If it‚Äôs because Netflix is using too much bandwidth then the market actors can work with each other to negotiate a deal. I also need proof that a company is using too much data that it drowns the bandwidth to a detrimental point. If there is enough, then I‚Äôm glad that our infrastructure is being utilized as fully as it is - especially if it costs next to nothing to send electrons over wires. I can‚Äôt justify what amounts to be a quarrel between two businesses over resources to require our gov to give the keys of censorship to a duopoly that has obviously worked together to keep control of the market.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt have faith that we can repeal all the laws that put us here in the first place where we just have two ISP competitors in most areas (geographically speaking). Our gov is not functioning and the decision making is focused on implementing the extremes of either argument. I do have faith that if we properly regulate going forward that we can stop this consolidation from happening further in this scenario and in other types of markets that haven‚Äôt been consolidated yet. 

Regulations exist to stop abuses of power. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not an anarcho-libertarian. You need basic services in any society if you are to be prosperous and work together to achieve more lofty goals that require shared resources and stability to work toward a common goal. There is balance of regulation needed.

Prove to me that NN is a bad idea and that it‚Äôs not working. Prove to me that classifying it as a utility, as a basic need, for the common man in an increasingly connected world is a bad idea. Prove to me that it‚Äôs worth it to allow these corporations the possibility to censor data and increase the cost of the internet - and what value I would receive from paying them more? 

If it‚Äôs about bandwidth usage then there has to be better solutions than handing them the rights to choose what data I see. Anyways, don‚Äôt I pay for an amount of bandwidth that they are willing to provide me? Who gives a shit what I do with that bandwidth and who I open a connection with? They gave me that amount of data to do what I want with. If they can‚Äôt stomache me using it then they shouldn‚Äôt have sold it to me - and their competitor can in return offer me the same package and hopefully follow through on it. Seems like something the market can already settle without repeal of something (NN) that ensures providers can‚Äôt use their position of power to control the information I see.That‚Äôs (one of the ways) where we differ. I would encourage gov to regulate for possibilities especially when the magnitude of impact is large.

If NN means that it is now a utility then I‚Äôm glad because it is so important that everyone needs it to function in our increasingly connected society where more and more things are being done online. I don‚Äôt see the benefit in allowing the ISP‚Äôs to have the possibility to decide what data I can and can‚Äôt see. There is no upside to that that I‚Äôm willing to trade for something so integral to having a functioning internet.

If NN means they can‚Äôt force me to pay more for a service they already provide then great. I can‚Äôt justify paying them more when they haven‚Äôt sold me on the upside of paying them more to not throttle my data. It is absurd especially given the big telecoms track record - like when Verizon took all that gov money (our money) to install fiber networks and instead only completed half the job and pocketed the difference in cost. Great that‚Äôs what I was hoping for. If they settled the bad width issue outside of gov, then why do we need NN to be repealed to deal with that issue. If NN regulates that they can‚Äôt censor my data that is a huge win IMO and helps keep the net free. 

I want sources to read so I can see how gov regulation stopped google fiber and how it killed small ISP‚Äôs. Maybe those are the regulations that need to be focused on repealing/fixing. I don‚Äôt see how making the internet a utility automatically forces out competition/creates a monopoly? I‚Äôd need sources or examples to show that is a likelihood.

Once we‚Äôve allowed these telecoms to get so big I just don‚Äôt trust them anymore (not just because they are wealthy) because they hold so much power and have demonstrated their willingness to fuck us over so much. The potential for abuse plus the need for the internet as a basic right/utility for the ordinary American means there has to be regulation IMO, which may mean the gov forces the market into monopolies or duopolies which sucks (all though I‚Äôm not convinced this has to be the case, for instance gov owns highway infrastructure but many entities use it commercially - why can‚Äôt the internet be like this?). If it consolidates to one market actor then I‚Äôd want gov to be very involved because the company would have us by the balls - we‚Äôd have to use them for everyday purposes and pay any fee they put in front of us or risk serious disadvantage. Then I‚Äôd definitely want the government because at least they can be held accountable with our votes as shitty as they are. Without competition I‚Äôm in the camp that thinks a corporation would be worse than gov.&gt; So, because everything won't be perfect immediately, we work with a known inferior solution. Fucking brilliant.

This known solution IMO is better than your step backwards in the hopes that all regulations can eventually be repealed (a moonshot) which is the only way your solution really works. Even then you still have these titans of industry thatve been built up who will be competing with small start ups in an industry with enormous infrastructure/start up costs. You‚Äôd have to break up the large ISP‚Äôs at the same time to level the playing field from the boons of their previous reign as one of the monopolies. There does not exist the political will or competency to achieve this large of a task and not fuck it up.

Which establishes that the ISP‚Äôs have had a clear history and pattern of fucking with NN and wishing to circumvent it if possible. So, yeah, not hitler levels of baby death, but no ones hyperbolically made that suggestion - however the ISP‚Äôs were doing exactly what we‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôll do should we repeal NN.

He's saying we don't need net neutrality because it's a solution to a non-existent problem.

There's not a problem because the fucking FCC has been forcing ISPs to abide by net neutrality rules up until now.  The fight for net neutrality isn't about adding regulations.  It's about keeping regulations we already have.  Fucking asshat.

It's hard to take someone serious when their podcast's audio isn't synced with the video.

Then he goes on to say "internet is faster than it's ever been."  He tries to say net neutality is about protecting or forcing ISPs to give us faster speeds.  That's a straw man argument.  Net neutrality isn't about connection speeds in general.  It's about not allowing ISPs, which we are beholden to because of their monopoly, to dictate which content we are allowed to see.

Here's an analogy that this idiot can understand.  Say you have a turnpike authority.  They own the only major road between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.  They tell UPS and Fedex that they can only drive 20mph.  But, if the companies pay the toll, plus an extra fee, their trucks can drive 70mph.

That's what net neutrality is preventing.

I don't know who Dave Smith is, but he can fuck right off.&gt;You realize that the FCC and Net Neutrality have only been a thing since 2015. What happened for the two decades before that where the FCC didn't regulate the internet? Oh yeah -- nothing. 

Because new problems are never created after the fact.
&gt;
&gt;"Net Neutrality" has been a thing for 2 years and your doomsday scenario where ISPs suddenly start censoring content or blocking websites doesn't seem feasible in a  free market. Monopolies generally exist as a result of government intervention.

ISP have run out of throughput, so their ability to increase speeds has slowed. This means their profit margins are at risk. They are looking for new revenue streams. What justification does a publicity traded ISP have for wanting to do away with net neutrality? Profits.


&gt;*You know where that type of censorship does happen though?* Countries like North Korea or China where the government heavily regulates the internet. 

Something something Nazi Germany

&gt;I find it hilarious that people like you are begging for the FCC to regulate the internet -- an agency known for censoring media, getting in bed with big business, and distorting markets.

Wait, is the FCC good or bad?

&gt;Also, why is it all of a sudden a natural human right to be able to access the entire internet? I'm afraid these regulations really just keep competition out.

Your fears are unfounded, but people are commonly afraid for silly reasons.

&gt;Interesting that SOPA and all these internet regulatory bills couldn't get passed, but now they are using the FCC under the guise of "neutrality" and "freedom".  This is a complex issue and it's not as simple as you make it out.

Prior to the FCC enacting net neutrality rules, the regulations weren't needed because ISPs weren't threatening extort content providers.If all users used a VPN, the ISP couldn't discriminate.Whatever clown reported this post as

I watch Kill Tony regularly and constantly think to myself ‚ÄúSTFU Brian‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt add anything to it when he talks. 98% of the things he says never land as funny with the crowd. His timely sound bits can be funny but if he gets a good laugh he‚Äôll over extend that one and use it 12x more times. Fuck that wanna beYea his voice is kind of annoying tooAlcohol, drugs, exercise, work, fuck some new women. Jamie is the Zodiac killer?  How many people that you know that I've killed themselves from anti depressants? You ever been to the funeral of a 18 year old that blew his head off?It's just curious. Ive spent lots of time listening to Rogan and Burr and have never heard an earthquake. [ha](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/897/718/c5f.gif)How dare you.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening now?!‚ÄùAdderal reacts the same way crystal meth does. There's essentially no difference to our bodies if consumed the same method/dose.&gt; It‚Äôs weird to hear talk of SJW‚Äôs wanting to censor speech, and then see the exact same thing, in practice, on the other side of the spectrum. Thoughts? Am I missing something?
 
Honest question that isn't meant to insult you, but how old are you? I imagine most people under the age of 25 aren't aware of how badly conservatives tried to censor things in media and pop culture in the 90's and early 00's. Christian/Republican censorship has been going on forever, and this isn't a surprise to me. Yeah I thought it was a great idea to bring that skeptic Michael Shermer on with Graham Hancock. Learned a ton from that debate.The same maneuvers were witnessed in the 50s and 60s. Is it believable that we had the same advanced technology back then?One trick pony. Barely holding it together imo.Why do you love him? Do you have something more than a completely one-sided relationship of simply listening to him talk, or do you know him personally? He doesn‚Äôt know you exist, and you only know him from podcasts and the internet, I‚Äôm going to guess. So, why on earth is your life better for him existing?Why did you put love in quotes?Because what he‚Äôs describing is unconditional affection, ‚Äúdespite him manipulating people to suck his dick I love the guy‚Äù,  ‚Äúdespite him kidnapping people, I love the guy‚Äù. That‚Äôs what you would say about someone you actually love because you have a deeper relationship with the person. Not a complete stranger who has no impact on your life. He doesn‚Äôt know Joey Diaz, and neither do you. That‚Äôs completely unreasonable to have loyalty to someone simply because they make you laugh, especially when they brag about the terrible kind of shit that he does. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bdabb/a-neuroscientist-explains-how-he-found-out-meth-is-almost-identical-to-adderall

https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bdabb/a-neuroscientist-explains-how-he-found-out-meth-is-almost-identical-to-adderallhttps://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bdabb/a-neuroscientist-explains-how-he-found-out-meth-is-almost-identical-to-adderallSince you're an expert in interpreting comments, what does this mean:

&gt;Joey Diaz is a degen, a scumbag, a career criminal, and I absolutely love him to death, my life has been improved for his existence

Does it mean he just thinks he's funny? If so, all the negative shit he listed is irrelevant, and there's no reason to even say them. Hitler was good at giving speeches. So what? Why preface the fact that he makes you laugh with a list of the most disgusting qualties, as if we would expect them to make him less funny? 

Does it mean he loves him as a *person?* If so, that'd be absurd. And apparently we both agree. He doesn't even know Joey as a person. I would 100% agree actual love should be reserved for your family and friends and people you know. It's stupid to have that same love for a comedian you don't even know. 

Or does it mean "I don't give a rat's ass what horrible things he's done to other people becuase he makes me laugh, and that's all that matters to me. I'll give him a pass." This is what *I* think he means. Because:

&gt;This is not Harvey Weinstein wielding immense power throughout an entire industry, it's a no-name sweating bullets powder-nosed local comic bluffing to get head from people looking for 5 minutes of stage time, not forcing anyone to do anything, just dissembling for sex in classic degenerate tradition.

See that? It's really no big deal! So all your talk about Joey Diaz being sorry and how I'm misunderstanding him is irrelevant, becuase the whole point of his comment was that there's basically nothing to be sorry for, and it's not that bad. 

But if u/RomanSenate wants to defend himself instead of some random guy doing it for him, he should "have at it".
Wow dude lol. That's quite the anti-intellectual route for someone who confidently tosses around "retarded". If only I could just get enough people to downvote you, then I'd be right! Until then, guess I'm wrong :(Good God dude you keep making assumptions. I'm not against Joey as a person. I'm against the idea that what he did wasn't that bad, and that his entertainment value makes up for the shitty things he did. That is retarded and deserves to be challenged. You're the one talking about how awesome it was that he apologized. But the above comment said nothing like that, in fact saying the opposite, that it *wasn't that bad*. You don't even agree with that if you're the one defending Joey based on his apologies. I'm fine with Joey if he did apologize and attempted to make things right, I'm not ok with glorifying the shitty things he did, or acting like they don't matter.&gt;literally nobody here is saying otherwise

.

&gt;This is not Harvey Weinstein wielding immense power throughout an entire industry, it's a no-name sweating bullets powder-nosed local comic bluffing to get head from people looking for 5 minutes of stage time, not forcing anyone to do anything, just dissembling for sex in classic degenerate tradition.

.

&gt;and that his entertainment value makes up for the shitty things he did

This is exactly the implication in the original comment.

I'm agreeing with you in that the apology was a good thing. But this is the opposite of the implication of the original comment.I say that in context of the original comment. Why would you claim to love any celebrity to the point that you can just accept him manipulating others to give him a blowjob, and kidnapping people. That type of love is genuine love, I'd say, but completely misplaced when it comes to a comedian who doesn't even know your name, and whom you don't even really know yourself.You made my day that much worse by reminding me that this dude exists. Come on man. Specific examples here would really help. 

meso/Endomorphs are super bullshit science btw.The ending was amazing. That sucks for himWhen you're getting millions of podcast downloads a month you don't worry about crumbs.Looks like a lot of this is motivated by his last podcast with Bret?

Was it worth watching? What did they talk aboutRoger Ver to talk about bitcoin cashhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40006985Thanks. I'm clearly a pro at this xD (In reality I threw this post together in like 5 minutes before leaving for an interview. Trying to write every morning, even if it isn't a novel and just a reddit post.This is true. And why I live Joe. Man the anti intellectualism is pretty bad here if these are the kinds of responses we see. I think comparing city to national politics is a little silly. Maybe the ego issues carry over one and the same. Joey Diaz. I just don't think his humor is funny to me.i'm actually curious about this. Are chimps grip strengths nutso enough to cause damage when grasping?I meant the other fucknuts hating on your observation of joes apparent confusion. I'm on your side. 
YA FUCKIN IDIOT.Try to just let people enjoy what they enjoy. No need to get triggered by other people's consumerism.

Or don't. 

get pissed. But I bet ur day will be better/healthspan longer if you just focused on shit you have control over.God damn that‚Äôs ignorant. Come on Ben!The first podcast with him was great, Gavin is a genuinely funny dude. I wish he would stray more into the comedy scene than the political shit. He much more like-able when he‚Äôs not dedicating his existence to pissing off SJWs.The Amazon original ‚ÄúMad Dogs‚Äù was like that. First episode was fucking *incredible*. Next episode was decent. Then it tanked hard and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to even finish it.How long has this been around? I thought I saw this back in like ‚Äò06.To each his own. I give them massive credit for that first episode though, had me hooked.I agree too! I thought I was going to hate it, I didn‚Äôt picture myself as anything like their target audience, but it definitely had a good first season.We got one Elon! Come get ‚Äòem!Whew this dude is getting wrecked in all kinds of ways. Yeah 09 sounds about right actually.For every fanboy of JP, there‚Äôs an equally passionate hater foaming at the mouth whenever his name gets mentioned. Let people like what they like. Promise you'll be happierYou said you "hate people". That's different than not liking a sweater.

For some people doing the corny thing and fitting in is what makes them happy. They have strategies to meet their needs, everyone does. But if you get upset about the strategies of others (and everything else you don't have control over) you'll just wind yourself up. Tell me how you really feel. Well he paid for it.I absolutely love how the first critical point is the guy suing her is a cunt, which is justified.

Yet the final conclusion is illiza is a cunt, which is justified.These comments are level headed and reasonable. Dangmight as well directly plug them people are lazy.This is the same situation as the dude in the hallway.I have a cousin who I think has CTE could you link some soucres you found useful?Yeah the Tom Delonge one is up there as ‚Äúmost unexpectedly awesome‚Äù.

Our education system is so formulaic and and memorization-heavy that the idea of words changing simply because so many people use them incorrectly is like heresy.Get the fuck outta here you bitter fuck. If that‚Äôs what you see Rogan as then why are you even commenting hereThis is awesome, thanks for posting!‚ÄúHow dare you illegally expose my illegal activity!‚ÄùI think it‚Äôs fair to say it‚Äôs not a partisan issue in the sense that both parties really are only playing to the current mindset of their base. I don‚Äôt believe the Democratic Party is just filled with compassionate and and freedom-loving politicians who only want to protect individual rights. It‚Äôs about getting elected and staying in power, which means their position could change on a dime if there is a more efficient way to achieving this. I‚Äôm too jaded to think it‚Äôs anything more than that.It‚Äôs weird cause if I‚Äôm in a crowd of people I don‚Äôt notice this.Paul Stamets.That‚Äôs a shitty list. JRE should absolutely be on there.It has something to do with the wetware in your brain and I would also bet it has to do with the fact that your vision is shit on it's peripherals. 

wetware=software our brain uses, in this case the "software" used to process faces, and each eye is sending it a different signal for what it's trying to make into "one face" things get fucky.Because you can read biomarkers from skincolor. Hes been running hills since last year I think. But cardio isnt going to influence how much fat you hold in your face.He seems so fucking anti-fun it's amazing he has a wife. I wonder if she's equally anti-fun?This would be amazing because Joe knows how to ask the right questions to get incite into the trump administration Sulforaphane is one thing. Non eating sugars is another thing. Basically the paleo or a keto diet. I'm sure their system isn't much different from either of those diets. Jfc. Excuse me a moment gentlemen....It's fun doing BJJ high but any striking martial art no thanks. Your reaction time will be way slower and the anxiety from knowing your going to be hit was way to much for me. Bag work and cardio stuff is more enjoyable for sure. As far as combos ya you'd throw some stuff you normally wouldn't. You'd be a lot looser but no doubt you'll get hit way more.  is there a joe rogan quote AI yet?Kind of a little sad for Joe. He never talks about his wife, and the only thing I've heard about her now is that she's overly concerned with her image of seeming "Normal" despite being married to a ball of muscle who openly talks about psychedelic use and chimp balls for a living.Nothing wrong with a little dude love.Read "The Happiness Advantage" by Sean ahker it changed my life.

 It's written by a world Expert in positive psychology, Harvard alumni. I could finagle a link to the audiobook if you want. Worst case is you learn somethingI want to see joe in a leather vest and fanny pack. 

That's all. Would be hilariousOr maybe his wife is Illuminati.I acknowledged that's the only thing I knew about her. I guess I was kinda saying, weird that the only thing we hear about her is her "cracking the pussywhip" essentially in a story.

I don't think joe is pussywhipped for the record, I'm sure it's a respectful adult thing that has it's moments.Noone challenges his viewpoints, (tyrone's) and Joe's trying to get him to see that maybe everyone and everything isn't conspiring against him. He really respects Woodley, but woodley doesnt respect himself. He seems to take everything personally. He's world champ but still isn't secure in his abilities or image as a "successful/happy person". There's also Aubrey Marcus, I know most people hate him but his trip reports are some crazy shit.I hadn't thought about those points. 

Yeah I don't think Joe would ever be actually critical about the UFC sadly. So I kinda agree with you there.

I like hearing those dudes talk about something they love :3I didn't listen to that. He came off as extremely bitter and sadJust now seeing this comment. How were you not following your own advice?What about a Drackstin cap?, or hell, even a windtrack phalafer!You are very, very lucky. I have seen this shit in real life. But then again, you may be pretty left. I have met people who called me racist for saying that men and woman were different physically in some cases. I tried to explain to someone why the Holocaust was actually worse than most young college kids realize, but they started calling me a **Holocaust Denier**. I know someone who equated taking off shoes in class to physical violence. The kind of people who claim that white women have it worse than any other group. It‚Äôs real, I see it everyday. Nothing like dead lifting while the barrel of a gun and loose ammo in your fanny pack slam up against the shaft of your penis.Maybe for you bro, I go HAM in the pocket.I want to see Joe get Mel high....now that would be a show!LOL Jamie just instagrammed a picture of a paper pad with a clicker pen on it. All it said was JRE #1066Good point, in retrospect. He was pretty candid, I haven‚Äôt heard Gibson‚Äôs episode yet, is it what OP says?I feel like that horse could seriously fuck that human's (guy?) life up.This dude has some awesome videos. Joe: " What if the cloned monkeys fucked the the AI and we had some sort of monkey robot hybrid... did you see the chimp that was fucking this bitch and ripped her face off?"Just read that thread and it already made my week.Tuned in and the first thing I hear is "That's how crazy the left-wing has gotten."

Yeah, the left are the ones going crazy. Not the ones on the right [who are harassing people while armed and claiming they're in this country illegally.](https://www.rawstory.com/2018/01/get-country-navajo-lawmaker-harassed-arizona-trump-supporters-accusing-illegally/) Nope. It's "the left" and their hats.

Joe has really lost me these days.Also Cumia on Legion Of Skanks was great (I think it's out Monday for non-subscribers) Real Ass Podcast (Luis J Gomez')It‚Äôs not an app im pretty sure it‚Äôs a website called Biblehub.I‚Äôll check it out. Good to know. Maybe for you bro.I was kidding maaaaaaan. Just joshin‚Äô ya. What‚Äôre you trying to read? The JRE reading list isn‚Äôt necessarily the best. Do you want war stories or diet books?Does Jocko have a diet book?That‚Äôs the Wednesday post diet workout. I‚Äôll call run out there like Naurto.For those looking for a summarized version with no personal opinions thrown in: 

Sam thinks that Joe's podcast has been too slanted politically to the right (although he brought up Joe seeking out left-wing guests) and that it isn't good that his platform is only putting out one-sided political narratives out there to so many people.There was also talk about people like Steven Crowder using platforms like Joe's podcast to bring their ideologies to the mainstream. 

There's more to his words and nothing I wrote is a direct quote, but that's the gist of his segment.Andrew Ulces is a damn savage.If you don‚Äôt like Lee you‚Äôre a douche.  This guy comes across as close minded, someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to drink responsibly and a douche bag. I mean, maybe I'm wrong here and someone correct me, but if you‚Äôre older than 25 and get bedridden from Drink, you made a mistake. He just seems to be intimidated by Rogan and someone who is keen on labels, be it for himself or others. The sniveling snarky way he opens up is a real turn off. Why not talk about Limbaugh? Thanks a lot. Good stuff, Segura was on his most recent episode. Where can i find the clip of him trying it for the first time?It  probably just banned itself  Holy shit. That comes up on my search bar too. I‚Äôve never even looked for that. I do not actually. Pyeongchoe? Oh god, do any of you still go to r/trees? Damn, although it sounds like you could also say that it‚Äôs entirely the thought of the helicopter pilot, he should have known not to allow that to happen. Just a thought bros! I‚Äôm not talkin bad about hunters.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt help Trump get elected‚Äù I think it‚Äôs absurd of him to say that, I love the show and don‚Äôt like Trump and whatnot. But when he tries to say that he trashed both of them equally, that‚Äôs absurd, in my view. Regardless of where you stand on Seth Rich, he has accused Clinton of murder multiple times and his pre election criticism of Trump was never as harsh. I think he very clearly was for trump in 2016. But hey hey who knows.

Edit: I‚Äôm also not angry about this. If someone disagrees let me know. Neil DeGrasse Tyson? COPüëèüèøY üëèüèª RIGHTS üëèüèæHe totally did. I hate trump and love the show. Rogan got that dude some votes. I doubt it. I do think him and Josh Barnett could have a good podcast with Josh talking about Japanese pro wrestling with Joe. I imagine Joe would be more into that style than WWE.Do you remember which episode he let Duncan loose? I want to listenYea dude this was one of my favorite episodes in a while. My favorite part was the ‚Äú100,000 year simulation discussion‚Äù and how long before they would suck a dick lol. 

I listened to this at work and had to watch it the next day to get the facial expressions. Someone has relationship issues....let‚Äôs go back to your childhood Zormm. Tell us why displays of affection make you uncomfortable hahaWell he was high haha, he mentioned it at one pointTony never elaborated on anything. I just watched this this morning and there were numerous times joe paused to let tony talk and all head get is a sentence. I felt like joe had to carry this one, was trying to fill space because tony wouldn‚Äôt really talk for more than a few sentences.They need to do another one of these.

What would be a good combo of people? I‚Äôm thinking my dream combo:

Rogan, Tom Segura, Christina P,  Chris D‚ÄôLeia, Burr, Bert, Joey Diaz, Ari, Callen and Schaub, StanhopeI like the dynamic of Callen n Schaub, they play off each other well. I like when their guests on Fighter n The kid team up on CallenYea I kinda got that sense too. These guys are super busy, I wonder if sometimes they commit to these things and are just burned out when they get there after a busy few days.I thought about him hahaYessss! that was a great episode, I‚Äôve been meaning to relisten to that oneYea he was awesome I really liked the Henry Rollins episode Yea you‚Äôre right....Danica Patrick, CT Fletcher, Billy Corbin, Dan Carlin....bunch of nobodies. GtfoWell I'm 4/4 Irish listening from Dublin.All those downvotes hard to swallow sweetheart? No need to get salty with me ; )Lol god you are lame. Love juice and fun stick? What are you, 12??Remember who it was? Was it the one with 2 different people?Lol I don‚Äôt know we should ask his dog Holding on by a thread with shaved chest and cowboy boots with no socks lolThose are perfect. Powerful thanksLook into it Joe " remember the comedy scene in Boston " RoganI call my mother and other loved ones a cunt as a term of endearment on daily basis, you are completely correctWhy don‚Äôt they pay for a dog walker? Wag is a great app and not horribly expensive Alpha Brain infused Keto Kibble and Kombucha in the water dish for Marshall hahaA+ comment right here I was talking to Willie Main whose parents dogs only get walked once every few weeks. Wag is just taking them for a 15minute walk lol...get them exercise, far from raising themGood stuff. This is hilarious.Unless there is a cure for the damage he is doing, shouldn't runners create a safer means of doing the sport? Easier terrains/ergonomic friendly footwear.Episode 1000 with Tom Segura and Joey Diaz was absolutely one of the funniest Totally disagree man. I think people have to get off reddit and get onto Twitter. I had to unsubscribe from all of the defaults. Way too toxic. This is a good community, r/Rogan has many comments like yours and most of this sub is the exception to how toxic Reddit can be. I think more of it comes from The_Donald. But that‚Äôs just me. Lee voice ‚Äúoh my goddd‚ÄùFirst thing I hear is Joe talking about "the left" "limiting free speech" and how they "limit the free discussion of ideas."

So this is gonna be one of those podcasts. *Clicks X button*&gt; It's bad enough in America 

lol no it isn't. Shut up.&gt;  How about the fact that you can go to prison in Britain for an insensitive tweet?

I'm not British, so I don't give a shit.

&gt; How about the fact that Anti-fa is trying to suppress dialog and free speech?

A few protesters starting shit at a handful of college events.

&gt; For a person who listens to JRE you're really close-minded.

Naw dawg.&gt; Enjoy being a leftist, I was one too when I went to high school.

Oh fuck man, you totally got me with your contrived attempt to try and insult people who are Liberals. No more, please. I can't handle it. /sIn other news, innocent teenage school shooting survivors are getting death threats from conservatives. More at 11.This is the same network that gets upset over people saying "Happy Holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas" and angered over athletes not standing for a song. What a joke.I'd say just start at the beginning and move from there. I feel like everything with him pre-250 is 'Must Hear" stuff for fans of JRE. Too many gems in that era. 

Also seek out his appearances on the Icehouse Chronicles. He's brilliant on there too.lol Fox News.Snake snatch make matchHe‚Äôs a blowhard. All chattry from his school house amphetamines. As someone who takes anti depressants I 100% agree with Joe. 

They don‚Äôt work as they should if you eat garbage, don‚Äôt exercise, drink and have erratic sleep. 

A low dosage of an SSRI, eating Ketogenically, wake up every morning at the same time, stay away from booze, and try to get 20-30 minutes of exercise a day eliminates my anxiety/depression almost 100%.

It‚Äôs hard to maintain, I fall off the wagon often but it‚Äôs a good game plan that I try to keep up.Good for you man! You got this!Everyone has unique metabolism systems and baseline serotonin levels. And it‚Äôs all in moderation too, if you drink heavily every night and eat a whole pizza your serotonin levels are going to lower and take your mental health with it. That‚Äôs just a fact.I still eat like shit every now n then and drink too much on occasion, but I‚Äôve done a lot of trial and error with myself. I can go about my day, I just know life is easier with the above gameplan for myself. More energy and motivation to get shit done.I really liked the most recent one with Duncan Jerry SeinfeldI was on the website waiting since 9am and they were gone by 12:01. It's beyond ridiculous Weird I kept with it until 12:45 and never got inBut anyway congrats man hope it's a great time :)Thanks, I already saw most of the tickets up on Stub hub by 1pm and they were already a bit out of my budget but that's okay, there's more important things to stress about in life :)A friend of mine linked me to 24 with Eddie Bravo, then I caught the Joey Diaz and Bill Burr episodes episodes after and became hooked. I miss those days in a weird way. The single camera in Joe's place with comedians and MMA people dicking around had such a cool vibe to it.

I gotta say, even though he ruined some good discussions and funny conversations, I miss Redban's stupid quips.If anything he‚Äôll go on Stern. Elon Musk from Poland signed the petition.I completely  agree with you as a runner myself. Don‚Äôt let all the downvotes get to ya, gotta love mob mentality and reddit shaming. You‚Äôre just being realistic and putting his achievement into perspective. No he does notJesus Christ, Metzger is really on some shit right now. He's just rambling on and on about SJWs and feminists without having any real points while Owen Benjamin is inserting himself into the conversation once in awhile. He's sort of all over the place and hard to follow.

Now he's flipping out over Joe calling him out about Schumer's show stealing bits. He's having a straight up meltdown right now.There's no way the weed and coffee made him to jump off the way he did when I commented. It's either pent up frustration or something besides weed and coffee.he says he does it in episode #1090I just had it on my phone since that episode, sent it to a buddy a while back. Randomly found it on my phone again and thought I‚Äôd share, always puts a smile on my face. Have a good day : )&gt; I never met these SJW people but then again I haven't lived in America since the early 90's.

&gt; Maybe there has been a SJW takeover and they are indeed really pervasive and obnoxious.

I live in Los Angeles. Not once have I had to deal with any SJW bullshit. Joe just needs to stop spending so much time on the internet and get out of his bubble.Thank you sir!&gt; Now obviously this is anecdotal from my own experiences but the crux of my point is Joe living in L.A is probably surrounded by tons of lefties and a much larger percentage of radicals on that side than most, which he probably has resentment towards which is why there's such persistence. Grass is greener I guess? Maybe if I grew up around the far left environment I'd feel similar.

LA native here. It's really not full of "lefties" and "radicals" the way that many people not from the area might  think, so I don't think Joe really gets his viewpoints from living in LA (especially since he lives about an hour from the city in a rich suburban area). I get the feeling that Joe isn't the type of guy who is surrounded by genuine LA people and sorta lives in a bubble. When I hear him talk, I feel a genuine disconnection from reality and how people are.

Believe me when I say that while LA is mostly politically Liberal, there really isn't much SJW lunacy here and that there is a false perception of how things are. If anything, i see more radical religious groups (Christians and Catholics mostly) with signs about "sinners' and shit than I do Liberal protesters. I mean if you go to a Liberal Arts college or a UC campus you'll probably run into a dozen SJW people, but there are few of those around. You'll meet some pretty crazy folks and lots of cool party people though. Lots of great tacos too. 

Oh, and the weed here is great as well as affordable if you're not getting it from places like the Hollywood or Pasadena areas. I'm really looking forward to this. I miss the Redban days. Olive Garden. 7.Hating or disliking that guy is pretty hard to imagine. He‚Äôs pretty likable no matter what your politics are. And now Joe is going on a rant about "the left" again. This was a good podcast before that, but now he's just rambling.haha I haven't fucked with stuff from Venice Beach.I usually get my stuff from the valley around Studio City and North Hollywood. Lots of quality 1/4s for around $50-60. So many other places have 1/8ths at those prices hahaYou‚Äôre easily triggered. I have thought of it. It's because Joe comes off as misinformed and I don't find him entertaining when he talks politics. &gt; This one just bothers you because you take it personally.

Seems more like me finding Joe's political ramblings about the left to be annoying and boring has you bothered. Get over it, would be my suggestion.I think redban can be funny and insightful but isn‚Äôt the best conversationalist, doesn‚Äôt really flow very wellHow far in when this happens?‚ÄúYou see there is a real problem, *eyes widen* a real problem in this country. It‚Äôs toxic tribalism, everyone has to pick a side. Team female, team liberal, team this, team that. It‚Äôs really bad man, really bad. *pulls mic closer* And the left is just egging on these so called alt right, I guess they‚Äôre calling Jordan Peterson alt right!‚Äù

Heard some variation of this about 100 times now lolThe PodfatherI agree, I really hate Redban tbh. On kill tony he brings nothing but awkward interruptions and random impressions that don‚Äôt really fit to what‚Äôs going onI agree, I would take Joey Diaz, segura, Duncan anyday over fatbanCan‚Äôt wait! Something like 40 fights!??I had a solution. I stopped listening because I didn't want to hear the same tired shit from Joe. You're the one being a whiny bitch all because I have an opinion that obviously differs from yours. Settle down, you triggered snowflake.It isn't so much that "my team" being criticized. It's just that Joe comes off as angrily misinformed and annoyingly repeats himself every time he brings the subject up while never making new or valid points. Well shit, where do I begin? Do I start with him constantly rambling about how a small group of people on college campuses somehow represent one side of an entire political spectrum? Or how he assumes that the top priority for Liberals is forcing people to use proper gender pronouns? How about the bullshit narrative of Liberals trying to silence people they don't agree with? SJW culture?

I don't know exactly what he said on this podcast cause I tuned out. All I'm saying is Joe makes too many stupid generalizations about Liberals these days and that I'd rather listen to something that isn't someone repeating bullshit for the 1000th time.I've heard him say it a few times, but I'm just paraphrasing. And "Liberal mainstream media" doesn't focus on any of that shit. I never hear about efforts to stop people from speaking on a college campus. I never hear about gender pronoun laws. The only time I hear about or see shit like that is when Joe talks about it.

Here's the thing, if Joe brought up how some Liberals think banning all guns is the solution to gun violence I'd listen. Sometimes I agree that Liberals try to force diversity in politics. That said, he spends the majority of his rants about Liberals bringing up the same talking points, and it gets boring and annoying. I'd honestly just rather listen to him tell fart stories.&gt; But go ahead and keep pretending like this isn't a serious problem.

It isn't a serious problem. What you brought up was something that is a problem to a small part of the world. 

&gt; Also, do you realize that popping up in every episode thread and bitching about Joe's opinions on "the left" is more annoying than him actually talking about "the left".

Well maybe if Joe didn't waste so much time talking about SJW culture, people like me wouldn't be bitching.Honestly it isn't. YouTube is a private company and can do what they want. If people are bothered by their "censorship" they can use other sites.Well I'm American. I don't have to worry about that because it won't happen here. We're going to have to agree to disagree on this. In the grand scheme of things, there are bigger problems (at least in America) that need to be addressed than a privately run company choosing what type of content they allow on their platform. While you have a valid point that corporations do control the main ways we communicate, that still won't stifle free speech. At least not in America.Again, gonna have to agree to disagree. The choices a private company makes isn't a big deal and the only hyperbole around here comes from people like you who think free speech is under attack because YouTube's choices. 

&gt; Soon Reddit‚Äôs going to do the same thing

Reddit has already been pruning subreddits and shadow banning users for years now.  YouTube demonetizes pro wrestling videos as well. Whatever they're doing isn't motivated by political ideology or trying to censor people based on their political opinions. They're doing shit that appeases advertisers. If you want to have a discussion about sponsors pulling advertisement money from YouTube prevent people from making money from ads, that'd be a valid discussion, but what you're arguing in regards to censorship from a private company has no merit in my opinion. Again, we have to agree to disagree here.

You can say I hate anything "conservative" all you want, but really in the end I just don't agree that YouTube's business practices are worth bringing up when talking about censorship and free speech. When it comes to free speech, at least in America, the real threat is Net Neutrality, how telecommunication companies want to do away with it, and how the head of the FCC is a former lawyer for Verizon is helping those corporations get their way. YouTube is not shutting out people from their platform based on political ideologies. If anything, it seems like conservative channels are thriving on YouTube at the moment and that nobody is losing access to certain opinions. Monetizing videos is a different topic, but as far as censorship goes, YouTube is a blip on the radar when it comes to the issue. If they got out of hand, nothing is going to stop someone from creating a YouTube rival and overtaking it. People need to realize that YouTube can be replaced. Look at how places like MySpace and LiveJournal went down when Facebook and WordPress got big.

Verizon and public communication companies like them want to control what people like us get access to and what apps/programs we can use online. Ultimately they want the FCC allow them to have the power to decide what sites and services people can use. Those utility companies can shut off access to sites like YouTube, Reddit, and whatever they want. Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, and others like them are a billion times more powerful than YouTube and are the ones both Liberals and Conservatives need to be aware of."I want him to explain Flat Earth to me." 

Eddie Bravo trying to convince Pat Miletich the world is flat could be the funniest shit in the world.

Edit: Joe's response is great too. "It's gonna be frustrating."As much as the political talk from Joe annoys me, he kept it minimal and didn't spew the usual anti-SJW stuff. The rest of the podcast wasn't bad.Yeah, but Hillary....Joaqu√≠n "El Chapo" Guzm√°n is a notorious Mexican drug lord. Dude escaped from prison a few times. Dunno why OP thinks his cartel has beef with Rogan though.Can't forget that Trump's daily diet consists of multiple McDonald's and KFC meals.Thanks man.Up ur aul oneSo many good episodes! You‚Äôll be entertained for a long time hahaIt's worth a watch.This was such a classic moment with so many great lines. "Everyone gather around, did you hear Galileo? Did you hear what Galileo just said?

"I love my sling, I love my catapult. Anybody that try to take my catapult away, gotta come through me."

"I love my scroll, I love carving in rock."Damn auto-correct haha"They take out Trump, they take out Pence, and Pelosi steps up..."

Stopped listening here as this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. If Trump and Pence are removed, the speaker of the house Paul Ryan will take over. Unless like 18 people are removed after Trump, Democrats are going to have to wait till 2020 before they get a chance to get one of their own in the White House. 

Molyneux is straight up fucking dumb.I have a hard time believing Democrats will want her representing them after 2018. There's been a lot of talk from Democrats about replacing her from her leadership role after the 2016 election. 

With that said, I doubt that any Democrat will get into the White House until after the next election, even with impeachment. Joe just said he has a video of a circumcision saved on his phone. Between that, and his comment about thinking about buying a male real doll for jiu-jitsu practice, this has been wildest non-Eddie Bravo, non-Alex Jones, non-Joey Diaz episodes ever.National park entry fees vary(seems the more popular they are, the higher the fee) but the most popular one, smoky mountains doesn't charge a fee. That being said, camping is almost never free. Only at primitive sites from what I've seen.That‚Äôs so weird! He blocked me. I‚Äôve never even been to his twitter or tweeted at any of those dudes. That‚Äôs trippy. I like him too. Anyone have any idea what‚Äôs up?TR went hard bro, don‚Äôt hate. He was using AlphaBrain. I‚Äôm racking my brain, this is a very curious situation. I‚Äôm not mad or whatever. It‚Äôs just weird to imagine him not only on my page but then blocking me. I mean,  the most famous person I‚Äôve ever interacted with with was a New York bike blogger. What‚Äôs a block list? Only time I tweeted at him was about a bombing in my city. I wonder, does it make me a bitch if you listen to a grown man who blocks people like me on twitter? So many ways this could go. I mean, Joey isn't in the sorta shape Rogan is and I doubt he's practiced his karate in forever. He does have his blue belt in BJJ, but Joe is a double black belt. 

It all boils down to this: if the three Joes can keep distance and throw spinning wheel kicks, they'd win. If five Joeys piled onto one Joe, and the rest were going around stomping heads of the Joes under the Joey Diaz dog pile, then I see the Joeys winning. Why? We‚Äôll tweet at him too much? Sorry for asking so many questions. Everytime an Uncle Joey gets taken out you hear Lee Syatts high pitched laugh/giggleSo the uncle joeys would win if it gets taken to the water lolI honestly don't think he's ever straight up said he's a Libertarian. In fact he said he voted for Gary Johnson because he came on his podcast so he was like fuck it Let's be real guys, 1/2 a Joe Rogan could destroy 30 Bobby Lees.Lizard people. It‚Äôs a dig at lizard people. The answer to his question is survival. I don‚Äôt give a fuck how far away the voyager is or was. I want shit that‚Äôs mine. I gotta eat. Sources, mijo, sources. His defense of drunk drivers is insane. So no source. You‚Äôre just privileged.Disagree on this. I feel like there are too many episodes lately where Joe tries to force "thought provoking" discussions with people more educated than he is, talks endlessly about hunting/outdoors stuff, or rambles about SJW shit. If anything, there have been less episodes where MMA and martial arts are discussed.Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. Yeah it was. It was Gavin McInnes, and he said it made folks better drivers. Nothing wrong with people watching him for different reasons. Personally as someone who has been listening since the early days, it seems like Joe hasn't had balance on his content lately (not in the way you describe it) and is trying to feature more social/philosophical conversations these days to appear as if he's an intellectual. Eddie talking about "gun control propaganda" now. Here we go.

Edit: He had to be told by Joe those kids weren't tearing apart the constitution. Fucking hilarious.

Edit 2: Joe talking about psychiatric drugs like clockwork.oddly motivational lol, I relate alotThis has been the worst podcast Joe has ever had. Just a bunch of inane rambling about conspiracy theories and pro-Trump/anti-Hillary nonsense. They're just finally getting to the MMA talk.This has gotten so much better now that they're talking about kickboxing. Worst JRE/MMA Show/Icehouse Chronicles/Fight Companion/Whatever Else episode that Joe has produced. The difference between this podcast and the examples you bring up is that those podcasts are intended to be about those topics. This episode was just all over the place and full of nonsense. Sometimes I feel (and hope) like he's faking some of this stuff just to fuck with people.In Mastering The Rubber Guard he had a segment talking about how he loved to prank people growing up. After that he showed pranks he and the guy who plays Rentao Laranja pulled off on students. That segment always sticks with me when I hear him saying crazy shit. Wish it was still on YouTube.I want another Bravo and Alex Jones episodeNaw. InfoWars shouldn't have published false information as news.&gt; I think Joe is a great example of **balanced and intelligent** masculinity.

hahahahahahaha

I love Joe, but that line is just hilarious.Joe is more like a pseudo-intellectual meathead. He tries to have interests in certain things like science and stuff, but really he's just a dumb jock. Nothing wrong with that, but he's just not as cultured or insightful as people think he is.&gt; But some right wing religious laws have been proposed, things that would literally discriminate against non-Christians. 

Before people ask for examples: banning gay marriage, banning gays from adopting children, making abortions illegal, and letting business discriminate against people based on religious beliefs under the guise of "religious freedom."Brendan made a stupid joke about UFC on Fox using mostly black analysts when Yves, Karen Bryant, and Tyron Woodley were doing a broadcast one night. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLk9hMRcTXkYou're really not good at mental gymnastics.The current teachers strike movement is a bigger deal to be honest.This dude is obsessing with a kid's pubes. What the fuck is wrong with him?The part where he says "we get it UFC on Fox, you're not racist." Was it funny? Not to me. Was it dumb? Yeah, but honestly it felt harmless on his part. Stupid, but harmless.Not gonna lie, I liked this song a lot in high school thanks to my girlfriend. &gt; buried by mainstream media, to protect their corporate overlords.

I can't take this part seriously. If you don't think mainstream media outlets would be jumping at a chance to shit on a competitor (ABC), you're obviously not paying enough attention. 

In the end, an amusement park strike isn't something that will capture the attention of people who watch mainstream media. There are way too many bigger things going on to care about.Disney doesn't own MSNBC. Disney don't own CNN. Disney doesn't own CBS news. Comcast wants to buy SkyNews from Fox, who are also in talks with Disney. The whole "mainstream media is covering it up maaaaaan!" talking point really doesn't hold water here.

And again, people aren't going to care about this Disneyland shit. It's an amusement park (regardless of how big it is) and what's going on there isn't as newsworthy as the current matters facing teachers today. You can say that this is real news, **and I wouldn't be one to argue against that**. I'm just saying that I don't buy into this being something buried by the media not owned by Disney for corporate interests, and that people won't care about Disneyland workers when compared to so many other things that's being covered in the mainstream.I'm really not interested in getting into a battle of "what ifs" about a hypothetical MSNBC reporter and the contrived scenario you came up with. I'm also not interested in discussing the number of employees at a business, especially if you're just going to be dismissive of my points and just go to "BUT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WORK THERE" talking points without trying to understand what I'm saying to you.

&gt; Who has said that MSM should choose between reporting on the teachers strike or the Disney strike? 

I didn't, nor was that ever my point.

&gt; You are arguing against a point no one has made. 

Actually, I'm presenting counterpoints to this line you said:

&gt; this is being buried by mainstream media, to protect their corporate overlords.

Bottom line is this, whatever reason the "mainstream media" has for not devoting endless amounts of coverage to isn't because outlets are trying to "protect their corporate overlords." I know that "mainstream media" is a boogeyman among JRE fans now, but I simply can't take seriously your reasoning that this isn't a major news story because people want to protect Disney. I'm not saying major news outlets are innocent, but this shit is just reaching for reasons to be mad at "mainstream media."Yeah. Got shut down awhile ago.&gt;  I'm not getting into what ifs, I'm using a hypothetical to explain to you why they wouldn't mess with Disney even if they aren't directly on their pocket, which you seem to be dismissing as some sort of conspiracy theory when it's simple logic.

Your hypothetical scenario was a giant "what if," and it wasn't even good.

And I'm not "smugly dismissing" you, nor did I misunderstand what you said. You just don't understand that not everything news media outlets do is based on "protecting corporate overloads" and that this isn't one of those cases.You're reaching. There's no point in trying to have this discussion with you if you're not going to understand where I'm coming from. I feel like I'd achieve more if I tried teaching my dog how to shit in a toilet and flush.Yeah. You are reaching. The mainstream media lives for sensationalism and ratings. If this had any juice, they'd be all over it for ratings. 

Besides, negative shit about Disney has been reported countless times, so your entire point of people in media being afraid to report this shit as to not offend them has no merit.&gt; Well, at least you are finally addressing my arguments. 

lol I've been addressing your arguments. 

I've already said what I said. There's no point in trying to convince you that you're reaching on this one thing trying to connect it to corporate agendas. I've acknowledged that the media does fuckery, but if there were more juice to a story rather than people trying to make a livable wage (way too common of a story these days) then there is no doubt media outlets would be trashing Disney. Any other details? Sounds sad.Look into it.&gt; Dana White said warrant is out for Conor McGregor‚Äôs arrest. His plane can‚Äôt leave New York.

Apperently#HOW DO YOU NOT LOVE 'EMIsn't he fucking awesomeLook into itThese really are hilarious.r/titlegore One of us I guess. 
&gt;Unless someone really has it out for him and is religiously watching his show just to get material for hate memes, which would be pretty sad.

/r/thefighterandthekidHe never talked about doing ketamineIt's the most recent redban podcast I believe. The UFC is absurd. Football is absurd. The most popular fiction/reality shows on TV are all shit in my opinion. WWE is no crazier than your average Pharmaceutical Commerical. All TV is nuts.He wasn‚Äôt taking his alphabrain, dude. ‚ÄúBitch, we‚Äôve been doing this for literally thousands of years, move to LA‚Äù You mean odds, you dumb fuck. ‚ÄòWHAT DER IS THE OVER UNDER ON &lt;INSERT VAPID TOPIC&gt;‚Äô.  Save your formulaic 15 year old input for real life kids younger than you who haven‚Äôt heard this shit every single day and might be impressed by your improper use of a tired, pathetic, stupid rhetorical question.Bro, you seem down. Have considered eating steak 4 times a day and doing hot yoga? Find a buddy and start a podcast.I‚Äôd do more yoga if I had the money. The faces, eyes, and emotions of the people surrounding him make him even more alien by contrastIt's an extra cushion on his chair, not like an actual restaurant kids booster seatJust have a look at Wayne rooney"The only way to be punk..."

Reading this just makes me think of kids in middle school who use to try to be "punk."This has been settled for many moons!Schaub: ohhh yeaaaa, his hog is the size of this mic. *motions it slapping on the table* GAAAADoooSHHaha I really don‚Äôt mind him, I watch FATK. I just make fun of his elongated words and annunciations  The Chris D‚ÄôElea episodes are classic tooYou don‚Äôt eat sandwiches, cuzzo?Painfully boringPerfect way to distract people from his lawyer getting raided by the FBI, reports of him possibly firing Rosenstein and Sessions, Comey's book, pardoning Scooter Libby, and his administration trying to discredit the Mueller investigation. I'm sorry, would you prefer I talk about Hillary's emails instead?I'll think about it.Can't say that I buy into her story. Yeah. Then her adding "I must've thrown him across the balcony" randomly just set off my bullshit-meter.You might find it interesting that Rogan at the time was thought of as an asshole. Bobby Lee talked about on his podcast when Callen was on I believe. If not Callen, then someone else from the old Newsradio rang. Or maybe it was Bobby Lee and Andy Dick on TFATK.

Annnnnyyywayyyyy, Bobby Lee and people were scared of Rogan back then.Edmund Tarverdyan The interview in a nutshell:

Host A: "But why would you even respond on twitter?"

 B. Burr: "**Because it's FUN**"Here's the clip I got this from. It came up yesterday on YouTube in the "Suggested Videos" section.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_abCZ-gVoHe‚Äôs not the new anything, homeboy has been around for a while once many circles. I‚Äôd walk through blood and bones on the streets of NYC to have Adam on the show. Why is he crazy?He seems crazy on twitter but when he's on video he seems pretty normalThat‚Äôs a reference to the Norm McDonald Show, it was originally a 9/11 joke. I have a similar feeling when he talks about archery. His compound bow couldn't be more different from barebow shooting. Add to that, that I'm a bowyer who made his own bows and his experience could not be more different from mine despite both of us engaging in archery. In terms that Joe might understand, the difference might be that I'm using some old classic car that I've put more hours in rebuilding than driving. It's not gonna be the fastest or have the best handling or all the features but it will feel more intimate. And he is using a Tesla that is optimized for performance and making it as easy for the driver as possible. It's considered hunting when you eat the rats you caught in your trap. Increases aggressionGood example:

Rogan spent $12,000 on a tricaster system. That is a system which can integrate several video and audio streams. He got it like 2 years ago and only complains. Got it replaced now. Go back to watching his first JREs with CGI snowfall....not the least bit worse experience.

He kept saying he could use the tricaster for skype guests. Never did. I could stream from my smartphone and include a skype-stream and my face-camera. Water we doing?I really hope he gets it into his head that you need to see yourself, the same way he thinks that you need to hear yourself during podcast recordings. He will then force all his guests to wear VR headsets, and Jamir will buy a system that CGIs the faces over the headsets. It will look like snapchat filters and cost $30k.2. Pull that sucker right up to your face
8. My grandma went to jail It's something that isn't easily verbalized. I cannot explain in words why it is different to shoot a primitive bow you have built yourself compared to a compound bow. It's very different, and they're at opposite ends of a spectrum. Maybe look for an analogy that works for you. On one hand you got a lot of personal investment and a very strong body-object connection. The other end you got a modern technical marble that does all the work for you.I'm turning into Schaub, helpppI think I was trying to explain why I personally feel how there is this big disconnect between his and mine experience. We both call it archery. He is talking about something that should speak to me but it's really not connecting with me. 

And when he talks to other people about the hobby with an air of authority, it sounds even weirder to me. I get a similar vibe when he's talking about Quake3. It's just such a small and limited perspective.I think over time if pays off if you stick to deer in your area. But this certainly does poke holes in the theory of the of subsistence hunters. What do you mean?I see now, thank you for replying. Google Fiber is complete shit.Jackie Chan #What an absolute unitThats actually an outstanding answer. Thank you SirYou clearly havent heard Joe talk about this. Rogan says its fine Chiesa got cut since he is  tough and he will be fine. Go to 1:48

https://youtu.be/AnsX8YWq6-wNicky has submitted two of Eddie's black belts though. Marvin Castelle and Ricky Lule.I'm so lost right now :|What else?Nicky didn't sub Geo, but he did sub two of Eddie's black belts. Dunno where Castelle and Lule rank as far as Eddie's black belts, but the meme is sorta factual.I‚Äôm making more, I‚Äôm not in the habit of taking advice from crack babies like yourself. CA PEESH? Goddamnit. Yeah you‚Äôre right. Well I appreciate that. Thank you.Noted for next time. He does the same shit when Bas is inThat‚Äôs one not everyone will get, glad you caught it.The Louis Theroux documentary. Any examples?The one about Big Game hunting in Africa. It gets mentioned quite a bit. I don‚Äôt know, but I know it‚Äôs on YouTube. Good episode, but https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uXyS-74sRTE there it is. &gt; I liked that show before he started talking about Trump non stop and stopped being funny.

Yeah, I can see why you don't find it funny...

Sandy Hook is real. It happened. Nah, I was just saying the original podcast came out years ago- and I'm sure there was some connection rather than just coincidence. Don't get me wrong, Segura is actually one of my favorite comedians as of late. I guess I was just pointing out that it happened, and thought it was sort of interesting, guy.

https://youtu.be/VA4UZMHTjRAThat kid is creepy af lol....totally would have blown joe if he asked Rogan speaks to me, as someone who suffers from depression and anxiety and has known multiple people who‚Äôve killed themselves, he‚Äôs offered a very helpful perspective in the past. But I also understand and sympathize with someone who totally disagrees.I didnt get that, they were laughing because they agreed with him and he was saying the obvious, its very much in alignment with what Maher says.It hilarious how Sam Harris *never* admits he made any kind of mistake.What‚Äôre you looking for?  Diet books of War Stories? 5 Families by Selwyn Rabb, it‚Äôs about the history of the 5 Families of NYC, the mafia. I loved it. You could also read about Enron. A book called Smartest Guys in The Room. Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi (not me) is the actual history of Henry Hill from Goodfellas. Is this stuff up your alley? I‚Äôll keep on going if so. If you think it‚Äôs scary that a private website banned someone calling people Niggers and Faggots, you probably also think the world is flat.Is her room clean though. Isn‚Äôt this the  silly Jackass that was trying to convince everybody to move to Puerto Rico about a year ago?  Goddamn he looked like a moron after that. I mean he has to be one of the dumbest guests on Rogan. Why is he even showing his face in public? If he had any sense of self respect or decency he would just count as millions.Well don‚Äôt I look like a moron.You‚Äôre confused, boy. I‚Äôm not your dad.Would you think I was smarter if I called him a nigger? Dipshit.Wow woke up on the wrong side of the bed? :DOpen deification! Get your lifeFinally an interesting guest that didn't allow Joe to derail the conversation. He almost did though! It was touch and go with those chickens and coyotes!I think you'd change your mind on Rhonda Patrick too if you looked up Novella's critique.

She is a legit scientist but she's overhyping everything. Are you familiar with these countless headlines about possible cancer cures? All of them make the error of extrapolating from in-vitro studies. Patrick is like that. The studies she bases her talks on justify further research but don't justify behavior changes.

In fact, she is like Rogan and Onnit. Sure, you can find some studies that the ingredients in his products have some measurable benefits but there isn't any reason to believe that it actually improves people's livesI skipped this one and Abby Martin's episodeMaybe in DenmarkEddie is certainly getting tired of the shilling going on. Seems Joe is only concered about Thug Rose nowFor one thing, nuclear explosions create fall out which makes certain areas dangerous to be exposed to. Remember? They started talking about it because of the cancer talkI could bet that they would do it for free if he negotiated it with them. After all, it would be a huge segment devoted to their product on a huge platform. 

23andme has sponsored podcasts before. They should have just contacted JoeInteresting to think about.

Maybe drone flying? It ticks off several of his needs.

It is fascinating from a technical aspect. He loves immersing himself with new tech and that is something that you can geek out on even while not flying. Spend lots of time researching and debating with other nerds.

It's a gratifying experience. Bit of adventure, bit of relaxing, bit of competitiveness. You might even end up with cool footage to enjoy during later times.

You can pour money in. That just seems like something that Rogan does. He participates in some hobby and he indulges in the expensive shit. Maybe he enjoys spending money...I mean...it does make sense in a way.

Fuck, marry, kill. 

My choice: joe, eddie, Schwab.

Opie and Anthony was known as the show where the comic went. Bill Burr, Louie CK, Joe Rogan, Boob Kelly , Amy Schumer, a lot of the comics that went big did O and A

Joe Rogan actually credits Opie and Anthony for being the reason he started to do his PodcastI dont see the point in that. All that does is cause the tension to bottle up and come back again even stronger..shit should be sqaushed there and then or it will just eat you up. Embrace conflictNY Times has a good article on this?! Someone likes fake newsOnly if you took everything too seriously. Having a friend that looks at stuff in another way isnt bad. If we all thought the same, life would realy suck. Eddie just questions everything, which makes you think about things. I dont see the harm. People can agree to disagreeJoe "we are all just humans so lets mot have borders or countries but over population is bad" RoganAlso, what if Conor hit Thug RoseBeen making bouch for twelve years and my guts are happy as can be.  I think all of the bad reactions most likely came from impure cultures. Fuck you botThats double champ"Huh, interesting"This same person also said that Rogan's fanbase were a bunch of dumbshits.  Surely that was overstated.Which makes me wonder why he's on the fence.  He usually goes with the scientific consensus, and in this case he seems more timid.Yep.  Just listen to any conversation between him and Eddie Bravo.A rare break from the norm. Appreciated Fam. Love to see a meme set free..Up boat from me"Hmmmmmm....interesting"I got an A in physics and confirm they are the same personProbably that Thug Rose would have done a better jobThats all they know how to do Sir but it never works out

 The nerd is you, these comments are jokes. What is sad is to make assumptions of what other people do or mean just by a reddit comment. The truth is that you probably dislike yourself for liking guys with bleached hair that talk about fashion, but you are ok in my book my dude. The heart knows what it wants, and in your case the butthole knows what it wants too. If kissing guys and meat gazing is what you like doing I aint mad at ya. Gaze away, just leave the people that like jokes alone.

Im thinking he is a high level troll.  When he beat Royler he said, dude was too aggressive. If he would have not been so aggressive I wouldnt be able to pull off the submission..

I dont know, all Im saying is look into itJoe " why cant going to Mexcico be like going to new york" Rogan wants to get in on some of thst Dragon Energy.Hah, you're acting like Joe and Jamie aren't completely set in their ways.

It took him like a year to get a new tv while constantly complaining about it. 

They don't even get youtube.

#TRY IT OUTWoah there jabroni, What's wrong with titty sucking Jaime with an A in Physics here:  This checks out famThis should be good, Taibbi doesn't hold back and is somewhat of  rogue journalist describing the political system.  https://i.imgur.com/xX2M9o5.jpg Mudmaster?

He just needs a little push from Edgy and less Jaime with an A in physicsPiss on me, beat me for 45 years because I‚Äôm a machine within Kick that mule LeeJust had a ‚Äúhunting trip‚Äù with all those in shape guys in Hawaii.

Let‚Äôs push him into negative Karma!Joe will fly to Germany and get stem cells injected in his eyesJaime with an A in physics here: This photoshopped. Remember guys I didnt finish college but I got an A in physicsFunny, he doesnt strike me as closed minded. Id highly doubt Joe doesnt try new things all the timeWas Callen there?? He‚Äôs notorious for it lolHonestly, I think about that meme a lot...Listen I dont care if you agree with me, the data speaks for itself. I am not going to argue or call names over this. Im not here to be taken seriously. You are very serious and digging into this arguement. Fact is you do not know what he likes. If you dont like my suggestion, you didnt have to respond. Especially when your initial comment looks like the other ones that were already in the thread. Thanks for the input though. Take it easy, Lank.Thanks bro!Is there any other books that is similar to the one Taibbi talks about at the start of the show.Who do you think is the hottest male fighter?He‚Äôs Getting thirsty for those kettleballs, take some DMT and lick some kombucha off each other‚Äôs nips in the isolation tankWow-WayyyyLucky those weren't coyotes https://i.imgur.com/ayJGhMr.jpg I eat ketogenically about 85% of the time. I love it to be honest.

I hope people didn‚Äôt take this post as me bashing Joes stance on this issue. I‚Äôm 100% in agreement with him. It just makes me chuckle when I see guests inching towards this dialogue and knowing the knowledge bomb is about to be dropped hahaI‚Äôve tried veganism and Keto extensively. I feel more energy eating meat, but didn‚Äôt have any issue with either. I think the main thing is cutting carbs n sugarWhat are Your thoughts, that make you above everyone else in this thread?#SWINE JUSTICE WARRIORS UNITEI don‚Äôt believe it causes heart disease personally. But the people that do point to tests and studies done on...human.....digestive systems and physiological responsesKeep kissing this fat cunts ass. What a disrespectful piece of shit. Sounds like something Jamie with an A in physics would have doneAbsolute unit Dont show this to the Ex Balitmore Cop that was on Rogan. He said all cops just want to shoot people.He absolutley didYour outrage is misdirected at me. The asshole ex cop said all cops just want to shoot people. As someone who has worked with Federal, State, and local police its absolute bullshit and for Joe to not call this guy out was nonsense. Im going to find it for you and you are going to eat your wordsWith you 100% Edgy is the tits. Keeping the truth aliveThe Rock had a very good saying that people should adhere :

Know your role and shut your mouthI found it crazy that Joe said Eddie was wasting people's time. So disrespectful to your best friend and a guy that has always  questioned stuff along with Joe . Its people like Eddie that spark debate on shit we just take for granted. Nothing wrong with thatI would have loved that, goes to show how cool Eddie stays. As a guest I would have said who the fuck do you think you are. Pull shit up, scroll up and down and keep your mouth shutI believe that as a martial artist one is taught to have the mind of a child so that you are always open to new ideas and methods and thats is where Eddie comes from at stuff. All he says is he doesnt know enough for him to say yes, which is to never commit to any one thing or style( thats how Eddie developed the rubber guard). Science is not a set in stone an is always evolving, so knowing that why would you commit to it. Do I think the world is flat, not really but scientific polls said Donald Trump would lose, and science keeps changing its mind on Pluto being a planet. Why would you commit to a solid yes. Because some guy that got an A on a course tells you.

If Eddie listened to what is "fact" he would have not gone to Brazil and beat the guy that he was told was unbeatable

#Look into it 

Not a bad thing 

Gets tan

Sucks in gut

BoomWell I make 200k, own 6 cars and two houses with my terrible logic and being open minded so keep believing your bullshit boxSWJ Rogan listener: But, but he got an A and Eddie is a moron. 

Eat it fagsThose who exalt themselves shall be humbled. and those who humble themselves shall be exalted

Keep thinking you are the cock of the walk Sir. Its a great way to live life for a while Thats how closed minded you are, I never refuted the Earth and Einstein, but keep hearing what you want to hear to make you feel better.  Ill start using that Einstein knows his shit line, will go over great with the Dark Web intellectualsExcellent scientific retortNo, its beautifulSays the virgin that watches Anime at his parents house.Joe "wait a minute, whats that word..Jamie write this down" RoganGreat points..most Jamie ball licking fags here dont understand this. Well congrats Thats a bible verse SirPeople like a dude that is a Martial Arts Master, 
Teacher , Explorer and is Creative. Not a fag that just pushes buttons and got an A in a classThis gent knows. Follow himAint nothing wrong with thatYup, hes begun to troll the goncern fags. Just look at  the comments here. Eddie is the bestAll he said was he didnt know enough to say yes or no. Its okay to say that in lifeThats the best part. All these fags and beta males saying.." Read a Book". Eddie has over 100 Tenth Planet Gyms, safe to say he is okayüòÇüòÇüòÇ. I need Eddie to ask this so Jamie can say he studied at a library will he was at the UniYou would know you ignorant fuckMeans youre an aethiest, jewish, muslim, agnostic, or fag that trolls malls for cockA lot of fagulas listen to JRE. Thats the problem with smoking weed, it can lower testostorone levels, lowers sperm production, and growth hormone . They also dont now comedy and think they are intellectuals because they listen to JRE while searching for tubesteak at a gym or local mall

Medical research for those that dont just listen to a guy that got an A in physics:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/6090909/I dont toss Bible verses on a whim, but Im sure you toss salads like a proSays a guy with mantits and low testDont you nust hate bitches that argue semantics, shows you how much they arent willing to listen to another side. Its just, Im right and fuck you. A whole lot of bitch in that one and anyone that downvotes thisSeems to me Debating about a guy that debates nukes is a bigger waste of time. Laugh it off and move onLook at all the downvotes on people that disagree with them. Shows the amount of closed mind self hating cock lovers that listen to JRE. Joe should put up a rainbow flag in the studio to appease the SWJs and Homoqueersicles that listen in#Let the downvotes from close minded fags, beta males, and Jamie cum lovers commenceThats not what he means, but go ahead and lose your shit about what a successful guy says. Also, Its okay to stop playing World of Warcraft and love men bro, dont be afraid. Get of of the houseYou are a reasonable man. Unlike the people who lose their shit with whatever Eddie says. I think he is retarded at times too and laugh about it. Take my upboatLike this https://i.imgur.com/Qo0Wia4.jpg It doesnt mean anything to me. I dont believe in it, but I dont say someone is a retard if I disagree with themPot meet kettle 

And talk about some real  r/mallninjashitSteps to be successful and  not go to jail even if you are poor or a minority:

-Own your actions

-Work hard

 -Dont expect things to be given to you (Bernie will never win so College wont be free, start saving or keep credit clean)

-Pick up a trade or go to college with school loans( doesnt have to an Ivy League, people that go to community college do great too)

 -Be responsible for your actions and stop blaming others for shit that goes bad in your life. (If you ever ask why me, you probably will keep asking yourself this rest of your life, the answer is YOU)

BAS RUTTEN SAYS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT:
-Dont date or marry a girl because you think "she is the one." Crazy bitches will ruin you and people dont change, they just get crazier and call the cops on you. You will then probably be ass raped on jail)

#Quit your bitching, its fucking embarrassing

Edit due to a fine person correctly checking me:

LISTEN TO JRE, all day, all night.

 Thats not what they are making fun of.

You probably are a person that thinks someone is better because they get a degree. Reality will tell you No and let you know only assholes think this way.

We are making fun off a man with a whole lot of bitch in him that also thinks this way even though he dropped out of college. 

Get the bitch out of you Sir, you will enjoy life a lot moreThank you Sir! Shame on me. Have an upboat and my appreciation for correcting meYou are exhausting Sir. Typing in reddit isnt practing shit and anyone that says writting is hateful hasnt been shot at or been in a fight. Go outside and enjoy life100% agree. I have alot of friends that grew up with Single mothers and its tough growing up without Father figure and Mom working several jobs. The Military has really helped them and opened a lot of doors. Plus, companies always love Military because they know they can count on themYes, a D in physics ruined my life. This is how regular people talk when you leave the house.

Sorry, Didnt mean to trigger you. Ill leave you in your safespace nowGood bot. Now fuck off a lot Exhibit A of what not to be likeWell thats your dealTrue colors have shown trough. Thanks for stalking me, now kindly fuck off and keep complaining about how "the man" has got you down and how we need a utopian society. Most people have jobs. So we will just keep working and taking care of our family while you sit at Starbucks bitching and moaning your life away and thinking of what other big words you can use to try and sound intelligent. You are an asshole Sir. Pay your school loans like everyone else and quit being a fucking leechLook at how much welders, plumbers and electricians make and add the plus of not having the crazy college debt. You dont have to go to college to see its not adding up. Unless you want to a Dr., Engineer, lawyer and follow a couple of more careers, college is less and less valuableThis man knowsDo it. Too many assholes think that going to a big college makes them better. 

From my experience some courses I took during Summer in community college were tougher than the one I took at thr "Big University" I graduated from.

A lot of people have not business going to college and are more interested in trade and doing things the way you did really helps some that is confused about continuing education answer many questions and learn the ropes of the education system.

Mad respect for people that go to community college and then go to a bigger school. In my experience they are always more mature and want it more. Congrats SirRespect Sir!  You are an inspiration to all and an example to these fucking people that complain about everything. I wish you great success and happiness
I get where you are coming from. Seen that shit happen a lot. People game the system because they canNice try Crybully. You cry about the rich and then say Im playing the victim. Lol, what a pathetic piece of shit.

FYI:
Antifa are a bunch of fags like you and Id welcome a visit from you or them. Anyone can get itNot saying higher education doesnt help, but as more and more people went to school,trade workers became more scarce Joe calls trades "The Passion Arts"

This is simple Law of Diminishing returns and when you add the ever increasing cost of going to school, it starts to make sense less and less.That there is the other problem right Sir. Great point 

I think it goes back to the Opie and Anthony days. O and A always had Mike on and that whole circle still talkBe this guy

Loves to watch Homeland

Bitches about the real CIAWell Im totally not against  what you are saying and you bringing facts to a logical discussion so Im going to look into it. Thank you for such a great discussion and not being a "The System has me down" people. I wish more people were logical like you and I. Problems would get solved. Have a great day and continued success.I know got school loans and didnt bitch about paying them when I graduated or crying that school should be free, leechGreat form there Jaime. Keep the elbows inProbably Schaub, helping joe put this onFall, daytime, drinking college-aged folks. Pretty sure its pregaming.Look into itNever understood that, you could easily just walk into the suicide forest and film a dead dude for at least 3 times that amount of views Young Jamie: (Pulls up entire fear factor series) 


Joe: No... not that one Yes, I kinda feel sorry for him, he seems to have experience a lifetime of being taken advantage of and needs trustworthy good friends around him or hes just crazy i dunnoAre you the new white belt rocking a black giIts the potato earsWe kinda grew out of amanita muscaria (fly agaric) and it's an ancient drug.

And didn't we kinda go back and forth with marijuana? I feel like I've never heard of anyone smoking it in the Middle Ages.It is actually debated whether acrylamide is a dietary carcinogen at allI bet Jamie constantly fact checks whenever he thinks Joe is talking out of his ass, just for his peace of mind.I was watching it on my tv, guess I could have just turned it up a lil and pooped with the door open lol[Hitler died in 1945, so Tim Kennedy is super wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8kl3ox/adolf_hitler_definitely_died_in_1945_in_berlin/?st=JHE4NRDL&amp;sh=09142c93) Your comment is not a drawlHe brags about killing women and children, so he must be.I want more tearing down idiots. He had Crowder back on and acted like he was his best friend. That shit is lame.What the fuck does this have to do with SJWs?Crowder is such a loser.Fuck Crowder.Um, not really?The current concept of an SJW doesn't really fit the past. Plus, do you think John Brown was wrong?Yeah, if it was true its awful and it isn't even true.Ventura is nutty, fun nutty, but Kyle was a lying POS.Oh look, traitor Oliver North.I could see it that way, but dang I wanna believe hahah Probably most accurate answer right here. Really writing this post cause I'm stupid jealous of that skill set hahaOh God, this dude is full of shit.I don't remember saying they weren't funny. I think I was very clearly just asking about the truthfulness.Not trying to rip anyone apart, my bad if it came off like that. Really just wanted to see if anyone shared my sentiments. Appreciate both these dudes on the podcast. Couple downvotes but could see this being completely accurate my man.Considering the concept of what an SJW is goes back a decade or so...

So he wasn't wrong...but he was dealt with? Your statement is confusing.I'm not saying I believe it but the moon landing was fake so it might be true.Door smoking?No one calls weed dope anymore by the way. Unless you're 70.No one calls it dope anymore grandpa. Heroin is referred to as dope, hence "dopesick".Hey, I barely eat avocados...Basketball court for sure. He would be considered a quack even in the Middle AggesSame reaction for me. He is so out of his mind that I can just write him off. Like those Chi masters on youtube. Only funny, not enragingDo you also need to heat up the grill super hot? Garlic salt, onion powder and my eggs scrambled in hot olive oil. Serve with avocado every morning for my breakfast. 

Eat naked with a fanny pack, toed running shoes and listening to NO MUSIC because it makes you weakJesus Christ Eddie, being too sensitive bro. Pulling that passive aggressive description trying to make it sound like it didn‚Äôt hurt his feelings but it clearly didMan, it's like some people here don't even watch JRE or they would know betterLet's talk about the pineal gland because Rogan is fucking stupid about it.

- it is a gland that happens to be in your brain. Don't get this twisted into thinking that it has any bearing on mental processes. It doesn't. It has some connection to the eye to sense light and dark cycles. But not even a direct pathway. It takes a detour through the spine.

- some people grow a pineal gland tumor and get it removed. Those people continue to be fully conscious and continue to have dreams.

- the pineal gland calcifies with age. Do you notice less third-eyey moments in old age?

- the pineal gland doesn't even map onto the eye of horus. The eye of horus if anything looks like a sagittal section of the thalamus. The pineal gland itself would be outside the eye and isn't depicted.

- even if the pineal gland did produce dmt, it doesn't mean that is where the chemical has its effects. You can and we have scanned the brain when people got psychedelics injected. The cortex lights up, not the pineal gland. 

Actually, I recommend watching it because it is funny. Like watching a b-movieBy the way, in that episode, Pollen mentioned a trial on terminal cancer patients. The idea was thst psilocybin might work on patients who are depressed because of their impending death. It was super-successful in alleviating the fear of death which meant that these cancer patients could spend their remaining time being contend with their familyThey also grow wild and can be identified reliably. It was wrong how he portrayed them as easy to mistake for deadly ones.

Know which ones to look for in your area and then identify them using a checklist of sorts. Post id-photos on reddit if necessary. It is really not a big problem. 

Growing is absolutely viable and will not get you into trouble. I am doing it. Prepared a tub just a few hours ago.

Keep in mind. It's a hobby. You have to invest good amounts of money in the beginning (let's say a hundred dollars). You are gonna be clueless in the beginning. You will be overwhelmed by all the available information. You will fail a lot. It takes lots of patience just to see whether something is gonna work out or if you have to start overNo I didn‚Äôt! I‚Äôll have to finish it when I get home, got like half way throughI thought it was weird that he had his own advice show at first, but for a redneck he's pretty in touch.And setting it up the way he did looked pretty douchey.  Saying he‚Äôs trying to do less podcasts and didn‚Äôt even really want to do Theos show, almost blew it off was a high brow moveI love that he brings up Quake when Fortnite is brought up. Every time someone mentions Call of Duty I bring up Wolfenstein 3D.Fake news, reeeeee"The government lies so the earth might be flat!"

Never change Eddie.Yes, he is obnoxious to listen to.Yeah, he spewed bullshit and then got mad he was called out. He sucks.Fuck yeah RLM. Get Mike or Jay on the podcast, oh and Rich Evans.Entertaining because Delonge is insane, yeah. He also said "I can't tell you that" around 50 times.If anyone hasn't seen them, watch Vic Berger's videos on Jim Bakker. The fact that these people exist makes me fucking depressed.ICE needs to be disbanded.Even GSP is scared of it.This needs to happen.Haha no it‚Äôs a picture of joe and his bffs in Hawaii The guy who sticks things in his ass on his show?By his neighbor you big dumb dumb.Hahaha, you called the dossier false.Nothing is going down. QAnon is a nobody shitposter. Fuck outta here.You guys keep saying this and nothing ever happens.They can't talk to the media so they need me *sniff*It was on one of the recent Tin Foil Hat episodes. He kept saying ‚ÄúI want to apologize, I thought you were interested in this stuff. I won‚Äôt talk about conspiracy theories with you next time I‚Äôm on.‚Äù

Theo has to try to make him feel better by saying he was interested ect. 

It was a legit middle school tactic by Eddie Oh good, then all the T_D, mde and incel posts belong to Reddit.He is a cunt.Lol right, trying to make not as bad sounding.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a top 60 breed!!‚ÄùTommy Robinson is a stupid piece of shit.Jesus fucking Christ, this country has so many corrupt and disgusting people in positions of authority.I bet Theo won't tell him the earth is round!Who cares about this dingbat?He is a fraud and piece of shit, no thanks.Alpha brain is all you need broEverything about his felon status to changing his name to stirring up anti Muslim sentiment and screaming at people in the streets.Why are you posting this shit obsessively here?Its like a couple people posting about this shithead and I don't get why.Try it out.https://youtu.be/rask8MYJaB4The turtle is Kotal Kahn holy shitWhen some other people hear that, they think "$$$".

All of these quack practices cost a fortune and she talked about how it consumed so much of her time.

She is a desperate woman that judges treatment outcomes on how she feels afterwards.

Also, she talked about a dislike for Western medicine, but she is actually getting a Western treatment...just Western snakeoilIs this a show or movie? I have a need to watch it now.I think the most important factor is that Cyborg is actively sparring and thus has her timing down.

Rogan has more power than her. He is also stronger and outweighs her.

Cyborg would always be a bit faster and more accurate.

That would include grappling, too. I think Rogan hasn't been rolling for a long time. He mentions it from time to timeYeah, of course. There is a reason that we rely on double blind studies to rule out placebo effects. She is weird for not-trusting doctors when it comes to health.Are you looking for specifically Onnit brand? If not, you should be able to find them all over if you just search them on Google. I would stay with some high-end brands though, just to be sure you‚Äôre getting a good piece of equipment.Spot on. As Halfway said, stick with cast iron and just make sure it‚Äôs not like a Walmart branded kettlebell and you should be good. IMO, Onnit is some of the top tier stuff but you can find others that are just as good for less $.The guy that makes the jre clips videos doesPsychiatry and Western Medicine works on the principle of the scientific method.

That is the only way to ensure progressive therapeutic improvements.

Whatever else you think works, if it doesn't rely on the scientific method, it won't produce anything new.

If it works and receives scientific attention, it will eventually be incorporated into Western medicineScientists spend their time analyzing, evaluating, researching and developing medicines. 

That is also the case with psychiatry. The literature is out there.Friends, nahh...they have no common ground. They can just talk and bond over things.

But they won't be inviting each other over for birthdays and bbq'ing on weekends or whateverrThere have been a few times, I believe once with his buddies during the sober October recap episode I believe. Expressing how he felt about them.

And with Rhonda Rousey I believe, describing the emotional overload he felt seeing her win a fight.Ba-ba-balllllInThose tears GAH-DOUCHEAhhhh I miss that Reddit. Still have a Ron Paul 2010 bumper sticker I can't speak to if he is racist, but he does hold some weird views on things at times.She didn't really say anything about attractive or not. Her point was I guess to say smaller women feel afraid when approached randomly by some guy. I think.Thank you sir, I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure Somewhat reasonable theory..but tell me, how many Stars of Death did you eat before posting this?Haha just messing with you. Interesting theory though!Probably, yeah.Solid list. Who would be your number 6?I dig this list. Maynard and Corgan are/were damn good guests!All hail Greg Fitzsimmons.For looking like an ape?  Well if that was the case she wouldn't have told Joe "I didn't know she was black, I thought she was Jewish." Clearly.  Not that we aren't all apes.  Lol, that guy's other comments are about DMT telepathy. I am deep in psychedelics as anyone else, growing my own mushies but psychonauts can be some of the nuttiest peopleThe point is the woman does kind of look like planet of the apes, but if she knew she was black she wouldn't have said it.  As though it's ok to dehumanize Jews but not blacks.  Unless there's some other reason we don't say blacks look like apes.  And for the record, all I'm saying is that calling anyone an ape ought not to be insulting, no matter who you are.  And Joe caught his mistake right away and laughed at it. It made for a funny moment though hahaBut why would it only be interpreted that way for a black person? This is my point. And my point is that Jews have faced way more oppression, so it's funny that "I thought she was Jewish) is an excuse.I think that was it,

Thanks man!Yeah, I heard good stuff. Gonna try it out.NBC reports in 2013 = fake news?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb6JeX6dvEkYeah, those two ethnicities would also hate to be called Planet of the Apes-hybridsAll this talk and no one is discussing whether ambien would even have an effect like that. Does ambien really get the racist out of you?Like was around exactly half way through Top emotional moment on JRE?? I can‚Äôt think of any other time that comes close https://i.imgur.com/cnOSV82.jpg She's one of these red pillers.  You know she's gonna be straight conservative on every issue.He's a shit comic.  Just raises his voice like Aziz.  Terrible.  Keep doing interviews, Joe.  I figure if there was a group with 10-15 people he would probably do it for 500 each give or take, maybe less. That would give him healthy compensation in line with where he is probably at right now financially considering he is a tenured PHD.  https://i.imgur.com/8dvykfc.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/3AVGvIA.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/Gr1sS8n.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/nqrQ4Nf.jpg Yeah I think it was on Bert Kreischer's podcast he talked about it.It was Bert Kreischer's, I just remembered it.Joey was also talking about how he hates entourages, he might have been speaking more about his opinion. His main point was Joe hates cigarettes, which I get.It was a clip on Bert Kreischer's podcast. He mentions Joe hates the smoking and Diaz hates the entourage moreso I guess. How is it racist?Why is that racist though? Isn't racism when you view a race as inferior or unequal? And discriminate them based on their color? Assuming she did know this person was African American, it still just seems like a roast-type joke to me, not racism. She rambles so fast you know she's full of shit.

Super hot though.Thanks checking out the Jeff Evans and Bud Brutsman one now! After she got into the ‚Äúreason‚Äù or ...her reasoning behind the shrinking of the middle class my finger slowly reached for the exit button. In my head the whole time looping ‚Äúwrong...also wrong...way wrong...‚Äù to every caveat she rambled. Then I heard ‚ÄúTrump knew what I didn‚Äôt know‚Äù PEACE OUT...done.

Funny she didn‚Äôt even have an opinion on CC but knew 100% exactly why the wage gap exists and the shrinking of the Middle Class occurred...a macro economic issue that is soooo simple and no variables at allll in play.Lol man; Joe always goes on about doing what you love an always used that furniture reference haha. Dude I fucking tried a passion with my hands but I'm a sloppy inadequate fuck. I'm only good at running my mouth!! The end goal for this company is just to spread truth, love and try to entertain. The profits will go to charity after my future wife (Christianne ;) and kids are taken care of. All sponsors will be vetted by public vote by my viewers. If your interested in that shit ; go check it out on the site. Www.sappywritinginc.com. In the words of Uncle Joey; I'm trying to kick this fucking mule!!!! I'm 20 years old and want to spend my life helping and serving as much as possible!!!!!!!Don't do those things pleaseIt fees sort of weird plugging my shitty podcast but I feel I need to in order to get my message out there. I wish I could just send positive intentions but the constraints of the present reality bind me to having to shill my shit out on Reddit :( don't hate me please!!! I love you so so much! :DShe compared the persons physical appearance to a character from planet of the apes. And I didn't think it was very funny but yeah that's all it seems like, comedians insult people way harsher all the time. I don't think it's racist to compare someone's appearance to a character from a movie. It just doesn't seem like racism. No I'm not, I'll admit I don't know much about her or the situation, it just gets on my nerves when people say any comment about someone's skin color, or any way of making fun of someone for it is racism, I don't think it is, I think racism is when there is hatred and discriminatory beliefs involved. I'm 100% against racism. We make jokes all the time about people's appearances, things that they have no control over, like big nose and small penis jokes, I just don't think it's really racist to compare someone's appearance to an ape, regardless of their skin color. What do you mean? I'm sure a lot of the public would disagree, but I think they're wrong. You still haven't explained how it's actually racist. I am certainly not against criticism. Negativity differs from criticism, and when criticism is constructive, is more effective at inducing change than praise. 

I am more so trying to encourage actual dialogue about the topics instead of this incessant nagging about the lack of quality. 

I am also not someone who try‚Äôs to fence off negativity in any sense, but you seem to carry some serious nihilism in your demeanor. 

Flanders out lolHe has absolutely none of the traits of a stoic. 

His number one pasttime is complaining about mma and political issues.No, making an observation.Oh, trust me, I love me some Eddie ‚ÄúLook Into It‚Äù Bravo That is indeed a good example. Thanks.Thanks. I didn't entirely mean "crazy leftist weirdos", I just meant "left of democrats"Alright, unreportedOnly if you provide me with 3 wheel barrels of Quaker Oats brown sugar low sugar oatmeal up front This is my exact mindset. I want to keep the incessant complaints out of this subreddit, and instead promote dialogue between users who enjoyed their respective episodes. It would provide for much greater content in my opinion. How would you classify Dom D‚ÄôAgostino or Rhonda Patrick? I guess more of food scientists. Dude, your tenure doesn‚Äôt define your effectiveness as a contributor or moderator. 
We‚Äôre adults and are able to discern from comments that have a basis in the context of conversation. And you should be able to discern between posts reported simply based on disagreement of ideology and those with an actual injustice occurring. 
Maybe this is a libertarian view, which is the ideologist Joe definitely seems most aligned with and his show, but you don‚Äôt bar conversation, those who have assembled here should be allowed to converse freely, even on tough topics. How else does progression occur? 
But this directly attacks your ideology, which you‚Äôre letting get in the way of allowing yourself to be a fair moderator. Definitely Simon Rex. Here's a 5 minutes bonus episode to get a taste: [trailer park Marc in the graveyard ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/doe-elk-productions/id1393013147?mt=2#episodeGuid=5b10c43cf2e6b1ba5b7d0501%3A5b10c77b562fa7f010a3575e%3A5b148db46d2a735db8a9d3d3) Joe certainly feels people shouldnt identify themselves as labels, but "leftists" as a political term easily imparts meaning/understanding. Labels are effective in communicating ideas, but labelling yourself creates tribal identities which inhibit critical thinking solid point. I concede.I (OP) would say Noam Chomsky. A more youthful example may be Keeanga Yamahtta Taylor.

There was a post on here not too long ago of a guy asking where all the good content has gone, claiming this content was ‚ÄúEddie talking about conspiracies‚Äù and complaining about the more informative episodes about nutrition, etc. I don‚Äôt know, I enjoy when Joe has on scientists. I also enjoy when Joe has on his wacky friends like Eddie and Duncan. People just need to realize this pod reaches 2 million people every episode and there‚Äôs some variance in interest there. I recommend *at least* Michelle Alexander.naw, she is a lawyer, wrote an influential book about the war on drugs and the justice system's disproportionate effects on blacks in America. She has a Ted talk though, and a few speeches on youtube.Also he welches on betsI'm pretty sure Jordan Peterson cites the bible quite a bit. He did do a series explaining his interpretation of it.Wow, that gives me some hope Yeah I bet he has a massive hammer after all that AlphabrainYeah but then again Joe has over 1000 podcasts on his back, his first 100 were a shitshow but were they better than ethans first podcasts? I dont know though, but I agree that ethan can be abit weird at timesThis is what happens if you snort Alphabrain through your assYes, thank you, that's it - def a book by Steven Pinker that rings a bell. 

"Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.

Far from being a na√Øve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature--tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking--which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.

With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress." - Amazon description if anyone's curious. Jamie, look that up for me.That's O-N-N-I-T dot com /chickensHoly shit Jim got old.Ahhh, yeah that might've been it actually.Nice name, thanks for the link.Sorry I read the whole sidebar and couldn't find any info at all about this, for some reason there aren't any explanations on google either Yea it's depressing. 

I really should quit my job and go for a week long bow hunting trip 2000 miles away to really re-center myself. I mean, what's stopping me, you know?ü§î is it morally OK to eat a Nazi deer?So I guess the shit I'm seeing on Google from cabellas, Omaha steaks, etc. Is farm raised? 

And I'd love to go hunting but shooting shit in a pen is just killing, not hunting.No this is from Joe Rogan's podcast yesterday. Starts @ the 1:20 markOh okay thanks that helps, so jack won't end josh quick because he's not allowedNot that he would be a good intellectual to comment on it, just that they *did talk about it* on the podcastIf me typing what I hear is copypasta, then sureThat is heartbreaking dude, I feel you on the money part. If I had more then I for sure would fly down to see my gparents more. I hope you can find a way to see your father soon.Alright gear down big rig.  I listen to joe everyday it was just a simple observation.There are aspects to it which can be critiqued.No. Explain Like I‚Äôm 5. Just trying to learn about a subject I don‚Äôt know much about. Oh yea it was a very optimistic projection. Like best case scenario. The whole family has been trying to get them to move up here for a while, prep for the impending declineYea dude it was phenomenal. I‚Äôm getting both of his books ASAP Thanks for that response, appreciate it!It‚Äôs great, love his stories about GogginsGreat, now the AI will gain sentience and kill us all.I love that. Thanks for sharing!That‚Äôs one reason when my grandma says ‚ÄúI want things to stay the same! I don‚Äôt like all of this technology!!‚Äù That I always remind her how much tech has allowed us to keep in touch! With texts, FB, phone call convenience with cells. Seriously we let him hold all the weed... this is whackWell many others were actively destroyed by the US, so that statement isn't quite accurate.

Take cybersyn in Chile under Allende - it was a decentralized planned economy that used democracy to determine investment decisions. Or we could look at the amazing improvement in quality of life under Thomas Sankara.

Anyways, that is a false dichotomy - there are plenty of new systems or even just improvements to capitalism that anti-capitalists espouse.I hear Joe and derren are gettin together some time soon to toss Jamie into the trash. I don't know if it's because he's broken, they're done with him, or if it's just as a prank but they're gonna be throwing him away some time soonI really do love Joe that‚Äôs the thing.  I aspire to be like him in so many ways.  Jesus I wasn‚Äôt trying to insult the man it was just a fucking comment.  WowzersThis comment is cringeworthy broLet me guess... you were born circa 1995, right?Have you ever watched Shafirs first JRE back?  Not listened to it but watched?  He is very uncomfortable to say the least.This makes a ton of sense. Thanks for the thoughtful response! I suggest you check this out.

The WashPo has bias when it comes to the Clintons/Podestas.I only passed cause my teachers didnt want to have to deal with me anymoreThere are sane people on the fringes though. Check out "Mexie" on youtube, she has an academic background in economics and is an anti-capitalist.We're all leading meaningless lives without any human connections. Our lives consist of waking up every day and going to a job we hate to buy stuff we don't need cause we think it will make us happy.

If you're a sensitive person, you also look out into the world and see all the human suffering, exploitation, cruelty, greed and lack of accountability, it seriously reduces your will to live. 

I don't know what can be done to help people. Whenever we see stories pop up in the news of someone prominent dying due to suicide you'll see some memorials and stuff online, but then we all move on with our lives and just forget about it.Its just the way it is.My professor used to say that anti depressants were like putting a bucket on the ground to catch water from a leaking ceiling. It is helpful but it isn't a total solution to the problem, cause you're not fixing the source.It was Killary.Not a fan of Trump but as a Libertarian leading guy, less regulation, a decent economy and legal weed is enough for meHope you're holding up, dude. I had a gf who was bipolar so I know how tough it can be.[Bourdain said he'd poison Trump](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/350857-cnn-host-bourdain-jokes-about-poisoning-trump)Oh man, I can't remember which specific episode but it definitely has been. Its hard to pinpoint because Joe has done so many episodes with Joey and their conversations always go all over the place.Mindfulness Meditation is also really hopeful if you haven't tried that out.People at /r/the_donald definitely didn't take it as a jokeI am kinda surprised I am getting downvoted. I know Bourdain was joking and I am no Trump fan, but I keep seeing all these alt right types here and on JRE youtube comments, I figured I'd get some easy karma by pointing out that he said that.How did his environment affect him in regards to conspiracy theories?I disagree. Like Joe always says, theyre just jokesEverything he says is psuedo intellectual gobbledygook.Mini chainsaws.

Reminds me of how pavement acts like teeth if you're a motorcyclist.This the part of the heavyweight division I don't like. Heavy weights don't get knocked out often, so they're in for hell if they get stuck and have a mentality of "black out before I tapout."
*Joe‚Äôs toed running shoes explode*He might irritate Musk enough to put Eddie on one of his rocketsYoda was like a thousand years old and seemed like just a regular fuck in any buddhist monastery. He was a big slacker. Should have smoked some dmt in a flotation tank and he would have conquered inner space within a few decades.

He could probably do a nba stadium in a major city.1118 with Theo Von. Aired like 3 weeks ago. Great episode.Joe‚Äôs actually talked about why they don‚Äôt do this before. I think it was actually just a week or two ago. He doesn‚Äôt want him/Jamie/the guests sitting there reading comments and getting sidetracked during the podcast. So, there is a slim to none chance that chat ever gets added.jesus fucking christ Schilling is one of the absolute worst fucking recurring guests ever. the guy talks like a cranky fucking 13 year old trying to be hard and silent in front of his guidance counseler. constantly pissy. mean mugs Joe the entire conversation. behaves like he's struggling to even muster a single word response. he literally acts like it's absolute torture even being there, so why even show up.

LolI have done lots of lsd and shrooms. Could you describe how these compare to edibles? Is it a completely different experience or more of a different flavor of the same? Do you think the problems associated with harsh edible trips is due to approaching them incorrectly? Maybe thinking you are just getting stoned rather than preparing yourself for a trip. I think you guys are taking the entire thing too serious, we obviously all appreciate joe , his guests and the conversations /opinions/jokes on the podcast are what keep me sane and going some days. I was just trying to put shit in the sub and I'll continue to do so regardless of negative feedback or misunderstanding, I appreciate the input but I'm not sitting over here crying like a little bitch about this stupid dog meme. Eddie brah is more talented than I'll ever be and I've got a shit ton of respect for him but his views are funny, the jokes are too good, and I enjoy the discourse. So don't get me wrong but what I think and feel doesn't matter I was just making a dumb joke and it flopped, my b if it rustled your chickens my dude.  https://i.imgur.com/ICfD55O.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/QR3MwhN.jpg Found a leaked screen shot... looks insane  https://i.imgur.com/qaT37q8.jpg This would explain a lot. so many people argue over how tall he is regularly...

"Welcome back Steven, I love you"I'm exaggerating but he tore him down and then acted like his best friend the next time.Hahaha yessssss!!!!! Something like that. Jaime, pull that up is too boring. Maybe some fritz haber action?  https://i.imgur.com/IlRQ0Kc.jpg Alex Jones has always been an isolationist though. I remember first encountering him when his big issue was Waco. He used to be more in the paleoconservative Pat Buchanan camp back then. But he was always against aid or involvement in foreign wars. During the Iraq war he was tolerated by many anti war liberals because he was so vocally against the war.

And we need to remember, Trump sold himself as the anti war candidate. In comparison to Hillary, he supposedly was, but surprise, that turned out to be BS. A lot of his supporters were just naive enough to believe him.Go do more cocaine like you did on the show Alex.Alex Jones is a cocaine addicted hack fraud dipshit.Time stamp on when he challenges Joe?I only ask because as much as I do love an Alex Jones rant...I definitely don‚Äôt have the time to watch 2+ hours of Info Wars.Let me know if you find it!I got about 5 minutes in and couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. LolCompletely Shredded Asshole Jones*Are you supposed to finish the shower with hot or cold water?Does he ever actually say this?I am all for trans rights, but this seems... unfair. Maybe trans kids should have their own competitions? I can't believe people even sort of agree with alex on this.

Obviously joe is never being literal about psychedelics, he more or less just described how they can change your perception for that time. And it has been proven https://www.livescience.com/61902-psychedelic-drugs-change-personality.htmlObviously true, but joe speaks about more than dmt. No idea why alex only focuses on dmt.I would like to see an actual cannabis expert on.Never thought I‚Äôd be spending time reading about water polo, but here I am..One of the best examples of joes "that thing will fuck you up" thing is the first one with Gavin mcinnes where they're talking about feminists crawling through mud, Joe starts shouting and getting all excited and going on a rant about the bacteria that could get in their mouth and all the diseases it could cause, people he's known that have gotten them, and eventually Gavin cuts him off and is just like "okay! Okay! I won't eat dirty water!" And they get back on topicHis alt right fans are the most sensitive snowflakes. Whenever he says anything they disagree with they reeeee worse than any sjwWhat's that called... What kind of strawman bullshit are you on about? When has Joe or anyone else said anything about not having a border?Nugent is a shitbag, and I bet Joe doesn't call him on it.Yeah he is too accommodating to "be a good host" a lot.Oh yeah, I forgot that happened. I have no negative feelings towards draft dodging Vietnam, however Nugent is a loud mouthed asshole and just so very stupid.Yeah, there really is nothing to like about him. I'm not sure why he gets air time anywhere for any reason.

He calls cannabis "dope" like its 1960 still too.What the fuck is wrong with you?Yeah he keeps having right wing whackos on and giving them further platforms, it makes me not want to watch or listen to any more of these podcastsIt denies reality?Welcome to being a Republican.Ted nugent researching stuff: https://i.imgur.com/s7SfjX8.jpg Alt righters are publishing propaganda videos already.Considering 2 from Patriot Prayer got arrested before it started for previous violence, and they came armed with their doofy shields and flagpoles...they wanted a fight. They are 100% at fault for the entire thing. They are an actual group with a laughable political candidate. Antifa is a bunch of random people with nothing.

One is dangerous to the country, the other is not.What would you say in your opinion is the funniest jre episode(s)?Hmmm march on antifa wielding blunt objects and batons and body armor hmmmm

http://www.wweek.com/news/2018/06/30/portland-police-declare-a-riot-after-right-wing-marchers-begin-beating-antifascists-with-flag-poles/

I've looked into itPatriot Prayer had shields and polearms for flag poles and had to be disarmed. They still marched on looking for a fight and started it.

Hell 2 people off the bus got arrested for previous violence. Patriot Prayer bussed people in and are at fault for everything that occurred.Provoke violence and then cry about violence like Cantwell, Gibson, Toese, etc.

They are at fault, quite simply.Its literally the point of the entire thread you fucking dimwit. You're from T_D and a traitor to America, get off Reddit now.Sure thing bro.What would you say in your opinion is the funniest jre episode(s)??Him? Sure is.hey now, this sub would stroke *any* of these guys for hours.[Dwight Schrute said it on the office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796140/quotes)
Just an actual traitor but I'm glad you acknowledge that you're a loser.Wouldn't know, I'm an adult with a job.At least he doesn't sound like Steve-O now.He should just come out and say it: Alex Jones is a loon. Most conspiracies coming out of infowars and /pol/ are shit tier and just paranoid ramblings. The reason Joe doesn't say it is cause he knows those same people make up a large portion of his audience and they will get offended if he does.He just had Ted Nugent and Candace Owens on, how is he an SJW on this one?But I'm not "triggered" or "offended"...? :/I really enjoy Peterson's content too! Great blokeThat's exactly what I meant, thanks.

That's a great pointJoe Rogan talked about giraffes and he just seemed so ignorant. How can you believe anything he says if he's wrong about something hunting related even.

OOOOLD bull. Oooooold, doesn't breed anymore.

I look it up on google and within 10 secs: Only 25 to 50% of giraffe calves reach adulthood; the life expectancy is between 20 and 25 years in the wild and 28 years in captivity.Brock who?Crowder is such a colossal twat.Nugent, Crowder, Owens, Shapiro...all terrible people to have on honestly.Jamie pull that up.So what happens to men near the poles?There is a large number of people on reddit who live and breathe this stuff. Every time he mentions something regarding hardware, it will be nitpicked to shreds.Why bother with a single player game. Makes no sense. Joe won't stream slow-paced games. That would include most RPGs pretty muchI really doubt Joe would be able to get into these games. He hasn't played for like 20 years. He doesn't understand games anymore and won't have the skills to make modern conpetitive games fun for himself.

Joe would need a crash course pretty much. Jamie could download 2 dozen of the most significant games and could play each for 30 min.

I'm thinking stuff like Minecraft, Pokemon, World of Warcraft, Skyrim, Halo, Assassin's Creed, Counterstrike, Dota.

All the stuff everyone knows if they are even a little into gamingIt was Killary reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeThis. I've been trying to find this for ages , I remember it was in the first 100 podcasts. Any idea?There's a video on YouTube of a guy who built stonehenge type stuff by himself without the use of any modern equipment.

\#overhisbaldhead or somethingPeterson is a hack fraud. I have always said it and always will.Castrato? Is that a real word? I don't think that's a real wordElon is an egotistical twat.Crowder is such an obnoxious twat.Joey convinced Eddie that joe works for the CIA a while back I'd love Joe to do a commentary over this.Fucking loser.Oh shut up with this crap.Ex machina lmfaoOMG JOE"S GOTTA PEE!!! Historic momentThey also have a mind altering parasite that makes you care for cats obsessively. That's cause he is bullshitting. Everyone knows kids who don't speak English are in ESL classes, not the regular onesI never did but always wanted to. 

I want to try one of those total isolation tanks, see if I go nuts.This is how I see the LAN going down.

Live podcast with all the homies and a changed camera setup where Jamie will show part face-cam and part screen of the guests and Joe. Jamie sounds passive-aggressive the whole night for not being allowed to play, too.

They all launch Quake Champions. Joe gushes over the graphics. Everyone struggling to not suck at the game. Brendan kills Joe using his xbox controller he insisted on using. Joe ragequits...says the input lag or whatever sucks. The textures need to be removed. Demands Quake 3 to be installed.Okay? I need context, I don't watch his show.

I don't like his Australian stance on firearms but he had a funny special I watched.

He sounds drunk and is making jokes. I don't understand the issue.I'd be disappointed if they don't. Joe is wearing nostalgia glasses. He will probably be shocked with the graphics etcThey got to that too!! Are there any episodes where the guest talks about their experience as a lawyer? I loved the mike schmidt episodeAre there any episodes where the guest talks about their experience as a lawyer? I loved the mike schmidt episodeYeah, he always says if someone is full of it, just let them talk, and eventually they will just hang themselves, you dont have to argue or fight back just let them talk.For being a psychedelics enthusiast, he has surprisingly little to talk about. Like there's really nothing.

Like in 40 year old virgin where the guy describes boobs like bags of sand. 

I have done my fair share of psychedelics and I feel less connected with him the more I experience. He only ever talks about fractals.That's literally what Boy Named Sue is about, no?2011/12. It is not how often it's brought up. It's how shallowly it is discussed. Many nuts have some good amount of carbs in them, too.


Like as much carbs as proteins.

I bet that would stun Rogan, too.

That thing will tear you to shreds, Jamie pull up orangutan ballsackI'm kind of glad that Joe is so untalented as a comedian.  Otherwise he may have been so satisfied with his comedy career that he might never have discovered his true gift as an amazing interviewer.  Seriously though, he's a groundbreaking interviewer.  But his comedy is like Azis Ansari.  He just starts quiet and then gets loud for no reason.  I hated every minute of this one and had to stop around the midpoint. Just couldn't stand these stories... I was waiting for a discussion of something. Did they end up debating veganism at some point?we're also in a place where we cant criticize porn because it makes us look prudishWhy the hell is the print so smallJoe ‚ÄùI snort Alphabrain through my ass‚Äù RoganYeah but I would love to see Jamie sitting on the other end of the table like a real guest. Not like he did on the CES one where Jamie sat hidden at his own deskI bet someone that has podcast experience like Tom or some other friend of Joe could hop in and handle itTorilla tavataanHe has done that for over 700 episodes so it would be cool to have 1 episode with just himIf u follow Jamie on instagram for example u can see that he clearly has a life outside JRE(duh) like his love of basketball and photografy, I would like to know more about himMDE and Alex Jones aren't comedians though.~~Doctor~~ Docktah, you cocksuckaWho the fuck are they even talking about. I've never heard of this guy. Why would he be relevant to MMA? They talked about the main event for a few minutes and then it was just boring stories about people that are irrelevant to mmaAwh God I got clued into it after about an hour in and couldn't take it any more. I was enjoying the episode too!If you don't have a tv habit, you need to put an effort in to remember watching these seasonal movies.

I am a bit nostalgic about being chained to whatever the tv network would show me.

Kind of has a staircase killer vibeHe's just becoming a grumpy old man. Also, a lot of his comedy has more to do with complaining or hating on something - which is why he often calls certain people who are genuinely funny "silly"... and plus Kratom To be fair the ATF fucked up horribly with Waco and directly caused the outcome.Uh, no I'm not. What the hell are you talking about?Um, no. I'm talking about Waco and how it was the fault of the ATF which it was. Nothing to do with the OKC bombing. You're connecting the two because McVeigh did even though it isn't what I'm talking about? That makes no sense.Lol everyone saying it's not moll or x probably hasn't done either. The lights at the shows will suck you right in. If there's any strobe lights I have to get the fuck out of there immediately most times or I'll have this same stupid look at my face.True. I did Cid for the 1st time a few weeks ago. There's no way I could take it at a show or festy lol.Yeah somehow a reasonably nice guy has a podcast that attracts a bunch of meatheads.Both. AI on most videos but some content creators bother to actually do it by handThe alt-right loves radical black separatist Malcolm X because they have the same goal: separation of the races. Thing is, Malcolm X eventually grew out of that and renounced his previous views. Also, he was a Muslim. Now you see all of these "racial realists" of the XXIst century claiming to admire Malcolm and Muhammad Ali when they were on about "blacks with blacks and whites with whites" but the truth is, even when they were radicals they were definitely not in favor of the right wing, jingoistic demagoguery preached by these yokels. 

The best part are the comments under the youtube video with obviously white people with black profile pictures claiming to be black and praising Trump and calling the DNC a slave plantation. :rolls eyes:I get my news from Reddit. It's honestly inferior to Google in terms of exposure but I got a good commentary section on reddit st least.

Google got news.google.com and  a Google News app on Android. News aggregators are probably superior to following a single news sourceYou don't understand his comment. YouTube is a losing Google money because it is too expensive too run (at least historically, maybe it's getting better now)

Have you tried other free video hosters? They suck. 

In that sense, youtube is very much LIKE a utility in that it's is providing an important service but requires resources so major that it can't just be rolled out by anyone.

In fact, it is way easier to become an internet service provider. There are countless small ISPs that operate in single cities profitably. 

These companies are able to fund it themselves or get funding from loans and then become profitable. 

A YouTube clone tho? What bank would give you funding for a video platform where everyone can upload as much video as they want, at 4k resolutions and high bitrates, and allow anyone to watch without any limitation with a few ads here and there.&gt; Sharing videos is not an ‚Äúimportant service‚Äù. 

What a dumb comment. You don't deciee what is an important service. I don't listen to radio. Radio is still a utility. Doesn't mean that my own preferences dictate what is important. 

&gt; Saying a corporation becomes so popular that, even though it‚Äôs apparently economically unfeasible to run, that the government has to step in to keep it running and make it a utility, you would have to apply that logic to every other company that provides a popular service. 

That is an oversimplification. YouTube is not *just* popular, that is a consequence of its inherent qualities. A society decides how much they value these qualities. Some qualities can be popular but not in the best interest for the state or for the society.  Youtube provides high quality video hosting and streaming for everyone with no basically no limitations. That means access to educational material, a quality that society is very happy about and would want to retain.

&gt; Again, like Netflix. 

No...that is a strawman. Netflix=popular and youtube=popular does not mean that Netflix=youtube. Youtube is different. Netflix is such a wrong example that you can easily think of many other profitable copycats like hulu and Amazon.

&gt; What popular companies get to be saved by being made a utility and which ones have to compete on their own?

Don't focus on 'popular'. 

&gt;  Like I‚Äôve already explained, utilities are utilities because allowing them to compete just wouldn‚Äôt work mainly because of the infrastructure you have to lay to even start a company like that. 

100% agree

&gt; A website doesn‚Äôt fit that description. YouTube being more popular than any other site isn‚Äôt comparable to the physical limitations that create utilities like the fact that there is only so much space below the ground you can fit internet cable and power lines. 

First of all, there are no limitations to laying cables. It is only a matter of how much cost you are willing to put up with. 

But let's say that cables are indeed a limitation. Then it becoming a utility won't matter because whether privately owned or state-owned, it cannot be remedied.

If laying cables is *only* cost-prohibitive and needs to be done by the government, then that also applies to youtube which is even more cost-prohibitive than laying cables.
He is a professional comedian yet he thinks Steven Crowder is funnyJRE is the most listened to podcast there is, right? He's not the top on itunes but he is definitely the most watched on youtube. I imagine hes #1 on many podcast apps too.Does anyone know...is Eddie religious? He seems totally uninterested in religion. 

That said...once Eddie stumbles upon Da Vinci Code, he'll probably become some Church conspiracy theoristHow do people like this even exist?

His friends probably don't even joke about it because they know he would make a big deal of it.  That's one of those few hobbies that won't ever get you laid I supposeImagine if it were like that? There would be so many people signing up for a weeklong mountain trip. That is just the amount of time that makes torture acceptableThat's what happens when you watch too much Man vs Wild. You only remember the most insane stuff like drinking piss and eating bugsI wouldn't know whether I'd need to remove the stinger first. Are they even graspable or are they retracted? Can't be filling either wayI went back and started listening to the first pod casts, and it's like the 3rd or 4th pod cast- but red an leaves the room to piss or something and joe leans into the mic and says- so what do you guys think? Should I get rid of him... and then plays it off as a joke... but me, being from the future, I knew the truth, and it was kinda of surreal.I feel like Theo has a point of trying to make sad/lonely people feel better and less down on themselves- I listen to him when I'm feeling like shit and it helps, like a weird therapist. He's gone through a lot and it's pretty cool to see that kind of honesty in someone who is usually just making people laugh. Hannibal burress on the other hand, his podcast is fucking hilarious and when I'm not feeling like I want to hear joe be political or Theo be reflective I just pick any one of hannibals at random and it's a good time burner.Just be ready for some poorly played musical instruments.God this is verbatim and makes me wonder how the comedy community views talking to this guy. That thing could kill you with it's fuckin face man!#HOW DARE YOU#THAT IS BANANASIn one of his first pod casts he talks briefly about google and how they're going to run everything, even put crazy high tubes and fibers directly to your house - even faster than T1! It's entirely possible...One of the few reasons joe never got a Segway... not fast enough to get away from predatorsOh a thousand percent... you ever get in a fight with a house cat? That'd be a sick ass band name No doubt, but I haven't seen any of those interactions. Can only go off of what I can see and witness my dude. And I witness him being a comedy dork. Hahaha https://i.imgur.com/OhlRou9.jpg Joe did a remote jre one time. I can't remember with who, and it was pretty short, but he did it. Literally just a camera and a mic.Watching is always the better experienceI'm thinking he would definitely be on Adderall as well, thats how he is doing those super long hours.Is he hosting a podcast, or trying to subtlety move back towards hosting fights?For me, she represents that whole "science, bitch!" movement. And I loathe it personally because it is so superficial and pretentious. 

There's too much pomp to her descriptions of things. She makes things sound bigger just to elicit these "woah"s.

It's totally fine to go out and read studies and feel amazed by some new finding. But it is weird that people would be contend with getting their amazement-fix by just watching a JRE podcast. 

Joe is extremely guilty of that. He goes 'woah' about something he doesn't understand all the time but that is basically just announcing "I find it interesting what you said but I am not understanding it". And with Joe it has the undertone of "and I am not gonna research it".

Rhonda could have suggested some biochemistry books to Joe since their first meeting. Joe could have watched lectures. But his discussions with Rhonda never evolved.

Rhonda is a fine researcher, I'm sure but she is not actually educating the public with her JRE appearancesIt is **his podcast** and all...Damn....quite the developmentAnd have 1000s of people support it every time!Richard D. Wolff would also be a good candidate for that podcast. 


 https://i.imgur.com/FjohvIc.jpg I hope he has a pot expert on just to talk straight about it e.g Julie Holland
To all those people in the comments saying Joe is a sell out, that he is inauthentic, he's stabbed Alex Jones in the back, the massive downvotes, etc.

Please, leave. Make good on your threats to stop listening. I think the fandom of Joe Rogan and his podcast would greatly benefit if all of the crazy right wing/alt right/redpill/proud boys just left. Listen to Stephen Crowder or Sargon of Akkad or Milo "own feminists and libtards".  Nobody wants you here.Going on long roadtrip.

What are some old school episodes with Redban that you would recommend?It'd be pretty funny if he started wearing those big powdered wigs, but never drew attention to it...It's entirely possible..."Is that how the kids are talking these days?" * sniffs, clicks mouse* What episode was this? Can't find itOn a recent episode he basically said how there is no benefit of making his family publicWe just need to stop potty training babies, to see whether they sit or stand to pee. Instant gender identification.Slavery was a choiceYeah. I don't think it is as funny as his old Ali G stuff, but it is definitely worth a watchAmong other things, he  does have a bachelors in a related field I believe.Hope it'll be more than an hour, like some of those with the ultra famous people. Alex is the irl version of CartmanI heard he was booed at the airport and he started yelling info wars dot com.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously.I presume it was him confronting Rubio yesterday, but that didn't happen on twitter. I don't know how twitter will justify itNo idea, but that doesn't seem like a bannable offense. I mean, if that were the case they'd have to ban Michael Moore.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I am no fan of Alex Jones, but banning him doesn't seem like the best way to contain him. There are plenty of idiots and assholes on twitter, including our President. If twitter goes around banning everyone who is a rude loudmouth, there really won't be anyone left.Trump has pushed plenty of crazy conspiracy theories too :/

&amp;#x200B;

So have people like that Juicebro Cernovich, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Southern, Molyneux, Sargon, etc. I strongly doubt they will ban all of them. Nah, I think the difference is he went up to Rubio and harassed him in person.Nobody excites the Spanish Inquisition!We will experience sleepy joe.&gt;the guy on cameraThis is the greatest jre episode there has ever been. 

Do you guys think MSM will talk about this?Or that's what he wanted. Didn't want to continue the sham work when time is so valuable. Maybe he wants to spend his last days doing whatever, before skynet takes over. He obviously doesn't care about $$No he is right. I am not innocent. I created the evil AI personally. It my fault and I deserve "what is coming"Ok I read your source. How again am I responsible for that? I was 2 in 1995....So I work my ass off for little pay and I get **one vote** towards influencing humanity (or at least the American division) and I am the one with the mantle of responsibility? I'll bet if I died in the next 4 hours, you wouldn't even notice. Then everyone in the world would be fucked because Im no longer in charge of my responsibilities. I read all 33 pages&gt;spoiled and ignorant
 
OkayHow could you prove if I'm right or wrong? Do you know what would happen if 20 Billion people all changed the direction of civilization their own way? ChaosApparently not. What did I miss?LMAO. You accused me of missing something. I saw the live stream last night and been following the aftermath here on Reddit. I assumed that's what we were talking about. 
 
-takes a 1 billion dollar hit of weed-Yeah that estimate is not correct. More around 7.2 BillionI see where I lost you (you referred to when I said 'chaos', I wooshed that). My bad. So your saying that if I don't do what I can to fix this myself, I deserve to be killed along with everyone. "What is coming" right? My inaction is my death. I don't believe that.Lone wolf is all I have. Can't trust a soul nowadays. Describe the actions one should take in these chaotic times?I just took it as Elon is so smart he knows to think out the full thought before speaking. Like he's legit thinking about what he has to say before he says it I want to give a simple task to these people like walking the dog then going grocery shopping. First time give them a joint second time give them on oxy/hydro/or a 6 pack. It'd be pretty obvious which is more debilitating.I don't get that either. Sorry to inform youQuestion: Do you think this will be the most listened to single podcast there ever was? 7.6 million on just youtube in less than 3 days. Any guesses what is the most listened/watched single podcast episode ever?He mentioned before that they don't pay good. I have no idea how true that is but he said it.https://youtu.be/DZkGodWW-M0Ben Shapiro also virtue signals every time I hear him talk. He just is signalling a lack of empathy or compassion. Honestly who gives a shit? Is this somehow relevant because these people are all Jews?

This reeks of white supremacist conspiracy theory. Get the fuck out of here.~~If anything this sub is liberal, not left. Leftists are anti-capitalists~~

radical leftists are anti-capitalists. the left is everything from antifa to neoliberalsThere is nothing wrong with Jews finding a homeland, even a homeland in Palestine. However there was one problem: there were already people living there. Palestinians had been promised a nation state since WWI, they had every right to reject 1948. The Zionists were the aggressors and they had no right to several hundred thousand people, regardless of Jewish history.1.) source?  
2.) humans migrate. Also the global north has plundered the global south for centuries, creating economic incentives to migrate  
3.) genocided is quite the term. How would you compare deaths in todays "white genocide" with, say, the Indian famine of 1899? (or the congo, indonesia, australia, canada, mexico, peru, USA, poland, mozambique...) 
4.) what do you mean white hatred? source?  
5.) source?  
6.) what do you mean "push policies in whites best interests"?  
7.) what reality? what constitutes a position of power?
I have strong doubts you would threaten me face to face.

^^dire ^^^physical ^^^^consequencesbringing up a bunch of rando's saying stupid shit is "evidence" of a global conspiracy by jews to eliminate the "white race". This is a conspiracy generally pushed by white supremacist sites like stormfront.Its on my trending feed.The picture was also shared by joe on his instagram. Why I'm posting it here.

Edit: Joe did delete all of it before CNN made this video. 

I watch jre every day and love joe but he only hurts himself by posting stuff like this. Doesn't exactly promote having good political guests like Tulsi or Bernie on.Look at what don Jr tweeted. How accurate was that tweet?,How exactly is Anderson Cooper being in hurricane floodwater 10 years ago an attempt to make trump look bad? He literally said that in the tweet with the 10 year old picture attached.It wasn't a joke. It was an implication. Did you even watch the video? He explains the context of the shot. He literally attached it to the tweet that says CNN is trying to make trump look bad.Fuckin A, bubbs. Probably because his fights has been commentating fights.It has aw**air**enessDang bro, not to be a dick but the teacup of vodka upon waking wasn‚Äôt a sign? That would freak me the fuck out!I'm really skeptical of boston dynamics, they are really good at shooting this type of demos to make their robot much better looking then it is.   This one is robot controlled so its not AI behind it, their re-configuring the robot completely for every little stunt, like the robot cannot jump over the log then run up the steps, they would need to redo the whole robot to do that and they're not showing us the failed attempts theres no live demo.   It is still amazing but I think people should have perspective, google has already offloaded this company.Jfc how slow are you all. The guard kind of looks like hannibal. Bill Cosby is in prison. There you go.Geez, that thing will rip you to shreds. Look at it.Yes it is far offEgypt =/= Levant. Besides being 611 kms and being two different continents, they have their own dialects, culture, history and really aren't the same ethnically. "Arab" is pretty broad and inaccurate when describing the peoples from the region.&gt;Wait, we‚Äôre arguing that 600 km is *far?* So you‚Äôre saying the bottom of my state and the middle of my state are not close to each other.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to go on a limb here and assume you live in the US, which is a pretty big country with a largely homogenous population... that really isn't true for much of the rest of the world, specifically Eurasia. For example, I lived in Spain, and there is quite a  difference between Salamanca and Barcelona. Different language, culture, history, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

And when we're talking about Egypt to Syria, there is quite a difference in all of those things - plus, there is a huge desert in the middle, so it isn't like there is much overlap between the two countries, outside of the close minded idea of all Arabs and/or Muslims just being the same. Yeah and I hear joes thinking about using a bow and arrow on him to end his life next time he doesn‚Äôt click on the right picture!I think my biggest problem with him, besides his collab with "Prager U", is that he is part of that wave of boomers who like to sneer at people with student loan debts, as though the system isn't designed to have had that happen. 


I don't disagree with promoting technical training, but I can do without the "Millennials are lazy" circlejerk.I was lucky - I got a full scholarship, but then when I graduated, getting a job in my field was pretty much impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ended up teaching HS. It isn't for everyone, but it is something worth looking into for some people.Karl PilkingtonDoes anyone know the episode where they have a video of some (mostly) women marching around an office trying some team building chant/dance/celebration thing and joe is like "imagine if it's 8am monday morning and you come in to this"SJWs amirite? There's such a thing as nofucktober?

Well then, I am beating all of you. Later, losers. He is a dick. Ever see the interview with Narduar? Dam how did I miss the Kevin Rose podcast! There hours the next 3 hrs.Just when you think you couldn't possibly have any less respect for Carlos Mencia.
