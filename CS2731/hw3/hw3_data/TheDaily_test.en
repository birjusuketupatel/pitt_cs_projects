On June 7, Julie Hirschfeld Davis and I interviewed Stephen Miller, President Trump’s senior policy adviser, in his West Wing office about the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy at the border, which has led to heartbreaking images of children being forcibly separated from their families. Here are some key points from that interview.

1- The zero-tolerance policy grew out of a desire to end what Mr. Miller calls “crippling loopholes” that attract illegal immigrants into the United States.

From where Mr. Miller sits, illegal immigration is driven by a belief among people outside the United States that those who make it across the border will be allowed to stay indefinitely. “The success rate is the predominant factor that drives illegal migration,” he told us. By instituting a zero-tolerance policy, Mr. Miller said, the administration is sending a message that should reduce the flow of illegal immigration into the country. He conceded that the policy has not reduced the immigration numbers, but said, “It’ll take a few months of sustained effort.”

2- Anything less than zero tolerance at the border creates what Mr. Miller calls “perverse” incentives for lawbreakers.

Mr. Miller used the example of speeding laws in the United States. Imagine, he said, if the police decided that speeding laws didn’t apply to people who have a child in the back seat. “Could you imagine what the consequences of that would be? Well, one thing, a lot more child endangerment,” he said, comparing the situation to the lack of enforcement of illegal border crossings under prior administrations.

3- Continuing policies in place during the Obama administration would cause what Mr. Miller called a “vicious cycle” that would increase illegal immigration.

Mr. Miller said a “giant hemispheric shift in migration patterns” was driving people toward the United States, which he said must respond with tighter borders. He said Obama-era policies would allow the number of immigrants to “spiral upward endlessly.” Using a favorite phrase, Mr. Miller said: “So you have to turn the ship. And so again, it’s a whole-of-government approach.”

4- Zero tolerance at the border will keep out dangerous illegal immigrants who would otherwise “grievously harm innocent Americans,” Mr. Miller said.

Reading from a list of arrests in Philadelphia in May 2017, Mr. Miller recounted the crimes committed by illegal immigrants: murder, child neglect, negligent manslaughter, car theft, prostitution, racketeering, rape. “It is impossible to take moral lectures from people like the mayor of Philadelphia, who dance in jubilant celebration over ‘sanctuary cities,’ when you had innocent Americans, U.S.-born and foreign, who are victimized on a daily basis because of illegal immigration,” Mr. Miller said.

5- Trump administration officials believe Americans will support their zero-tolerance policies over what Mr. Miller calls the “nihilism” of the Democratic agenda.

Mr. Miller said he believed the issue of border security, even with the controversy over family separations, was a “90-10” issue for Mr. Trump and his Republican allies. He predicted that voters in November would reject “the Democrats’ open-borders extremism,” adding that Democrats had adopted “a point of view so radical that it can really only be described as absolute nihilism.”

The first according to Attorney General Jeff Sessions is that McCabe was fired because of his dishonesty with the investigators about a conversation he authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist. The second according to McCabe is that he was fired because of his role in the Russian investigation and the aftermath of the Comey firing and to undermine the reputation of the FBI. There's a little bit going on here so I made a timeline to help make this story a little bit clearer.

- News that Andrew McCabe intended to retire as soon as he was eligible in March, 90 days to go and be eligible to his full pension and benefits. 

- Trump tweets that he was angry about McCabe retiring with full benefits, calling it an injustice. hinting that he wanted him fired before he gets his retirement.

-McCabe was the FBI deputy director in 2016 during the crazy period when the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign, and also investigating Hilary and her private email server and the Clinton foundation. 

- There's a big internal investigation into how the FBI handled those investigations. McCabe was at the center of that investigation. 

- Trump tweeted about McCabe, questioning campaign donations to a political campaign of his wife's and speculating that McCabe had little time left in his tenure. McCabe's wife ran for a Virginia state senate seat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a political ally of the Clintons. Trump accused McCabe of bias suggesting that he helped protect Clinton from prosecution during the 2016 presidential campaign. McCabe is the perfect foil for the president, he symbolizes everything he finds irksome about the FBI. 

- McCabe in anticipation of the report of the investigation about him took a leave of absence and stayed on the sidelines waiting for his retirement this month. 

- Attorney general Jeff sessions fires McCabe after two decades as a federal employee. 

- The firing was based on the findings of the department of justice investigation. The inspector general’s report faults Mr. McCabe for his lack of candor in interviews with internal investigators, and because McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media (The Wall Street Journal) which reported in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family’s foundation.

- McCabe comes out telling a different story stating that for the last year and a half, he and his family have been targets of an unrelenting assault on their reputation and his service to the country. 

- McCabe said his firing was part of Trump’s ongoing war on the F.B.I. and Robert Mueller, the special counsel. “I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey”. He was adamant that he did not mislead the justice department and said he answered questions truthfully in the internal investigation and contacted investigators to correct the record when he believed they misunderstood him.

- McCabe's firing 26 hours before he was set to retire and the president's celebration on twitter raises doubts on whether the firing was based on wrong behavior by McCabe or whether it was a political move to punish the latter for his role in the FBI investigation against Trump.

- McCabe was deputy director and was directly overseeing the Russian investigation from it's first days. He was witnessed to some of the things that are now under investigation as to questions whether president Trump tried to obstruct justice. Comey, the previous FBI director shared conversations between him and the president to McCabe who kept detailed memos about it and also kept notes and memos about his interactions with the president. He is in a position to corroborate key information that James Comey had. His credibility goes to the credibility of Comey's accusations.

- The white house is trying to make a case that the Muller investigation should be shutdown.

I guess we'll just have to wait for the report and hope it contains enough evidence on who's wrong and right here.This was a fun listen. If you could summarize Putin's political life into a 20 min episode then this would be a great one. From his childhood growing up in the streets of Leningrad, getting inspired to become a KGB agent from a movie, joining the KGB, deterring danger of thousands of protesters, watching the country he believed in fall apart, getting into politics and going up the chain, and so on. This gets you closer to understanding the man, why and how he got where he is, what are his objectives, and how does he go about accomplishing them. Putin is not gonna be a quiet guy anytime soon, that's for sure...A young gay vegan guy helped found what became an important tool for right wing nationalists to influence voters against everything he believed in. We're yet to get to the conclusion of this story as Facebook is facing the consequences of it as I'm typing this. It's scary to think about how this massive amount of data was used and can be used to influence people in various ways.So this is a sequel to the last part of yesterday's episode. This is about Mark Zuckerberg's interview with the NYT. Zuckerberg's statement, what happened and what Facebook did to rectify it, can they really get back all the data that's out there now, and can they do anything about their business model to stop user's data from being abused. Not a lot of answers in this episode, but enough good questions that make you wonder about the future of Facebook.The study demonstrates that even when black and white kids grow up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar education levels and similar levels of accumulated wealth, There's still a high disparity in their future income. I found it interesting that black girls and white girls fare not that far away from each other, unlike their male counterparts. Various factors are cited in this episode and in the study to why this gap exists. I'm very pleased about this new series. This was quite fun and interesting. Rukmini is really brave to say the least, there's curiosity and then there's going to battle fields with ISIS. I guess the morale of the story is that if you go inside their residences, collecting intimate details, letters, memoirs about them, it's only fair for ISIS to fat shame you on twitter. Subscribe to the "Caliphate" podcast if you wanna see and hear another side of ISIS.If Comey came in expecting an easy interview plugging his book, he'd be very disappointed right now. what an interview! Over the past few days, i've watched Comey on different platforms talking to different journalists, late night hots and so on, and the main talking point was his relationship with Trump, his investigations and how he got fired etc. Micheal having followed the story for months now covering it from multiple angles and discussing it with various people in different episodes of the show, took it a different way, it was nothing but about Comey, the person and the previous director of the FBI and the relation between the too. Micheal held no punches asking over and over if Comey's ego was in control as he made decisions to take matters into his own hands many times instead of following protocol and working with the department of justice, the director refused these "accusations" completely and noted that he had a team of very smart people making these decisions with him. 

I do think that Micheal focused a little too much on those words Comey put at the beginning of his book indicating his flaws, but i can understand why he did considering the routes the man in front of him followed in making his decisions.   Comey seemed agitated throughout the interview. I definitely think the the interview probed more deeply than he expected. It's the NYT, not a fluff piece, regardless of platform. Bottom line, his ego contributed to his downfall. Definitely. You could see (or hear) how his tone started to change as the interview went on. He went from casually answering questions and telling his story to being very careful about what and how he was responding to Micheal's inquiries.Lam Wing-kee shows us that we can all be courageous as long as we're aware that other people care/notice what we're doing.

It was hard listening to them read the letters. Oh my god I can’t stand how he goes “hmm” every five seconds during interviews The way they give it to us on the podcast, you feel strongly that Gina should be fine to be appointed. But then there is the question of the message it sends to the world I don't think they tried to give her to us any other way than she gave herself to the committee. She was quite interesting. when she first started answering, my mind went it's another Betsy DeVos type. Before i realized this was a 30+ years CIA agent and her indifferent monotone voice was very much on purpose. I think she handled the hearing really well and gave the "right" answers most of the time. 

I agree with you. idk what message her appointment with all the controversial history she has will send to the world, not that the CIA is looked at as a role model on good morals around the globe.This is a good example of the rights of one  damaging the lives of many. Where I grew up the well-being of the group was more important than the rights of a singular person. You had to fit in. In the states. The rights of the individual trump that of the group. It’s why gun culture is hard to crack down on. 

The lives of the many have been impacted negatively by the rights of the few to own guns. This one was tough to follow I totally agree with you that the US is very focused on maximizing the freedom of individuals even at the expense of the well being of the group, Sometimes just ignoring the latter even when it's not in conflict with personal rights.

I think this episode shows that something is wrong. When your freedom terrorizes people that were already dealing with a horrible tragedy, then something is not quite right. just like the first group has the freedom of expression and thought, the other group has a right to live a calm peaceful life without fear or harassment.  Ya I mean. My personal views on Alex Jones aside the principle of one damaging many is on trial here. It will be interesting to see what happens, though I’m not holding my breath. 

It’s a shame that he took this approach, he fuels some really entertaining viewpoints among some of my crazier friends. I wish that he stuck to the “the government is turning frogs gay and that’s why you need my survival formula, only 59.99 a bottle”. It was funny haha that is indeed more entertaining and harmless for the most part.  I enjoy those as well. I don't think this case will influence something that important to the US, but we'll see what happens.That we will! This episode is basically a new start for the show. All the previous episodes focused on Abu Huzayfah but it's Rukmini herself on the battle ground this time. I liked the story of how ISIS came to being. How "good" they represented themselves to be, only for the veil to fall and show their real horrific face. Solid episode.I think huzayfah is in some shit Just listened to the episode. A powerful and vulnerable interview. Is it worth turning away true asylum seekers just to stop “imposters”? We’re throwing the baby out with the bath water.One of the most powerful episodes I can remember. Could help but tear up when she sang “God will make a way.” Horrifying to think what would have happened had she been sent back to Burkina Faso. I don’t understand how/why he talks to these reporters plainly about his crimes, his whereabouts and why he’s lying to CSIS.yeah, i was wondering the same. I honestly have no idea why he decided to do that. Maybe he wanted to share his story with someone but couldn't find anybody. He trusted journalists way too much with his secrets. I swear there was a top post on Reddit today about the firing at Walmart. Suddenly it's gone and I'm seeing ads for their maternity policy

Anyone else notice this?Ya I mean. He’s clearly still bitter, still religiously motivated, still on a mission to convert the world to Islam. Yet I feel he may also be a young guy who did some horrible things, is disillusioned and probably suffering from all kinds of nightmares. He’s searching but he doesn’t know what he’s looking for. 

The confusing part to me is the time frame of these interviews. I could understand if he did a “tell-all” and told way too much. But this seems to be an evolving long term relationship with these interviewers, where he is super candid. Yet the life he lives with CSIS is this attempt at normal western life where he denies his crimes. 

I’m thinking like, dude. CSIS will hear this. She’s crafty as hell in the way she speaks. 

At one point Michael Barbarra makes some statement trying to get her to commit. He opens with “I assume” 

And instead of her saying “right” or “that’s correct” 

She says “that is a correct assumption” always leaving a back door for herself Sackler brothers, that’s how it started.Simply surreal What an episode. I personally agree with Facebook on this. Although it's not a requirement by law to be equal to everybody's right of free speech, I think it's the right thing to do. You shouldn't ban anybody no matter how dumb or wrong what they're saying is. That choice should be left to the people and that's the part that needs fixing, how people consume and filter information.Agreed, especially with the last point. We need to find a way to discourage information silos.So it feels like the US foreign policy now is based in "say one thing, do whatever you want later." I do not understand how this is a defensible position. Has anyone seen any media defending Trump's conference with Putin in response to Pompeo's testimony? I would love to understand how people can see this as a defensible position. I think it’s fairly clear that Trumps words do not mean much as far as his policy &amp; governance are concerned.

His “kind words” on Russia and Putin hardly mirror his administrations treatment of the country.  We’ve been hearing for nearly two years now that Trump is week on Russia (some of the more extremists will say that Trump is a puppet of Putin). Although an incredibly quick google search will show that Trump’s administration is much harder on Russia and Putin than Obama ever was; not even close. 

In fact, I remember Obama and the media literally mocking Mitt Romney when he suggested that Russia is still one of our greatest threats. I believe Obama used the snarky “Hey Romney, the 1980’s called and want their foreign policy back” and everyone laughs. 

Now of course, they’re all singing a very different tune.

Intellectual honesty.Sorta like drawing a “red line” in the sand and then not backing it up? 

Or maybe like asking Putin’s buddy for patience, so the president can be more flexible after the election?

To call this a new method is quite short sided.As a Democrat, I found this podcast so depressing. If the democrats take the House this Fall, it will be people voting against Trump, not people voting for the Democratic Party’s lame message.The optimist in me says that Trump has awakened dems for the next few cycles. The messaging for 2020 if Trump is vetoing healthcare bills, voting rights, and increases to minimum wage could be powerful as well. Dems just need to stay as far away from the culture wars as possible. I read the article a few weeks ago of whenever it was published. It’s cool to hear this backstory.We’ll see what happens today in Ohio! Will be very interesting for both parties.Interesting indeed. The republican candidate won by less than 1 point ahead. This is a big red flag for the GOP i'm sure. They were supposed to win comfortably.Interesting times!Leibovich really got a good few interviews with the Speaker.Why are they blaming the altright for dividing the left? They're doing this to themselves. They scream and wail over meetings and pat themselves on the back for "disrupting the system" and then when they obtain some power they're shocked they're being yelled out and disrupted. This mayor made this bed for herself.                 

I'm leftist and I vote and do what I can to convince others that the GOP are a cancer on this country but the way these groups act prevent me from getting politically involved to that level. Its just a bunch of ignorant, angry people screaming at any and everyone, wildly swinging from one point of focus to another, with no real direction or ideas on how to improve things.&gt; Its just a bunch of ignorant, angry people screaming at any and everyone, wildly swinging from one point of focus to another, with no real direction or ideas on how to improve things.

I totally agree with you. This is exactly how it felt like to me as well. I think the new mayor helped foster that behavior by continuing to act like a protester and an activist instead of the person in power, and that never works. Screaming and yelling about everything doesn't help with anything. As much as it seems like she is being arrogant and not willing to step away from speakership in favor of the party, doesn't it stand to reason that the Republicans would simply create a new avatar of the Democrats to redirect their anger to?This has turned into my favorite podcast because they always bring these interesting people on. I just wish they would branch out a bit away from all the Trump stuff.I agree with you wholeheartedly. I'm sure that's what they would like as well, and Micheal has mentioned it before. I think this is such an important period in American history that they can't go without covering important Trump stories when they happen, unfortunately, that's way too often.Man, Ernie Chambers is out there.  Good episode but I wish we could have heard more from the other side.   It came off as you just letting an old nut bag ramble. Well that was eye opening and depressing. As a climate scientist it would have been so nice if we weren’t destroying the world Wow, John Sununu really fucked us over.This is some Illuminati level of influence. An organized system by the "elites" of the conservative movement plotting for decades to spread conservative judges all across the important judicial positions in the country especially the supreme court, and shaping their new (old) America. The white house refusing to release some of Kavanaugh's documents working under Bush leads me to believe they had a bigger reach than positioning conservative judges in key positions, and probably affected if not produced major U.S. policies Yeah also the comment about how in the past conservatives looked for experience and integrity not necessarily conservative ideals made me cringe because ok now conservatism above all else!!!Indeed. I'm always astonished hearing that, like when they mentioned how republicans supported abortion or environment legislation including people like Reagan, Something inconceivable today.I do not like this Adam dude. He always seems so bored to cover his stories on the podcast.

He states it’s a foregone conclusion that Kavanaugh will be confirmed. Probably true.

But he acts like he wants it done so he can be done with this story. haha I think he's just one of those people that always sound like they'd rather be anywhere else than where they are at that moment, but are good if not great people if you get to know them. I always laugh whenever he comes on cause he sounds so over it.

“I have no recollection of that.” OK, George!This was a fascinating episode. I liked learning more about “anonymous” sources vs. deep background.

Also at first I thought the interviewer was Nick Kristoff.Great episode, as usual. Putin is ruthless.This was heartbreaking. So, so sad.My god these two episodes are absolutely gut-wrentching.  I know the first ER responder was probably just doing her best, but I can’t help but be infuriated with her.

Part 2 was the absolute wrong way to start my day.

This is awful.

I hope the system improves and this never happens to anyone again.Gah dammit, I knew she was going to die when I realized in the last interview that the wife never ever speaks. So tragic to hear. 

Question: Why didn't they leave originally? Were they in a zone that wasn't supposed to flood?I listened to this on an airplane. Not a good idea. Hard to hide the fact that I was crying! I think he said that they just expected to get through it as they had always done so before. Didn’t expect things to get as bad as they did. I came here to say that this is maybe my favorite episode of The Daily. The two parts on the storm last week were very good as well. He does a really good job of handling the interviewee and guiding her through the emotional parts. I was just really struck by that. That seems to be the story of a lot of folks who chose to not evacuate -- most of them probably do get through it, but for those who do run into serious trouble. then it's too late. This was such a real, powerful episode. Sometimes Michael kind of irritates me, but episodes like this show that he really is a great interviewer. Michael is such a skilled interviewer!

And her story was very moving/compelling.I don’t disagree with you but I’m curious in what ways Michael irritates you.Anyone know the name of the marimba piece that plays around 18:40 (right after “the number of women in congress doubled”)? I tried looking on their website but the episode notes didn’t have a specific credit for it.I think the music is made specifically for the podcast, so I'm not sure you could find it anywhere unless they post it. Sorry.Makes sense. Thanks anyway!Excellent episodeFantastic episode. I already read the article but hearing it explained really shows Trump’s financial crimesThis whole episode was depressing as hell.  First, you have teenagers thinking what they do underage should have consequences throughout their entire life.  And then,  the woman in the diner denying the credibility of Fords testimony, mentioned something along the lines of  “Ask our servicemen about PTSD”.  

Yikes."It could have never happened, but the sole fact he was accused, means anyone can get away with it."             

What was she trying to say here?I think she meant that even if he did it, he was still "exonerated" quickly and voted in to the supreme court. I agree with you that it didn't sound good however.It was incredibly frustrating that they failed to mention that Democrats have 26 Senate seats up for election and Republicans only have 9. That seems like by far the biggest reason why the Democrats face an uphill climb in the senate.Ms Tavernise, please consider seeing a voice coach. Your vocal fry is so irritating to listen to, i can’t concentrate on the content of your reporting.Her voice is her voice. It's fine. You need to get over yourself.  People don't bring this shit up to male presenters. You shouldn't do it to the female presenters either. It's just rude.  Vocal fry is vocal fry"It's tactical foolishness" that judge is absolutely correct. Some democrats need to understand that you can't win if you only accept people that agree with everything you believe in, especially when these people have the same end goal as you do. They just know what it takes to win elections and before that how to be inclusive to a wider range of peopleI really really really hope they put the into and outro music back how it was.

It got me pumped for my day.

Taking out the percussion and heavy instruments literally ruins it.

Agreed on all points otherwise though.haha I felt the exact same. It's one of the biggest components of this show and it transmits such a great energy to the listener. 

I think it'll be back in tomorrow's episode. They put a different tune because Micheal wasn't there. Even those two episodes felt like a short audio documentary rather than an episode of the daily. Michael doesn't talk nearly as much and certainly doesn't share his own opinions like Sabrina did. I really enjoyed the previous two episodes, but things will get back to normal tomorrow morning.Apparently Michael gets asked a lot to say his classic “today” in that voice. Really grounds me lolI really found myself agreeing with Noam. 

Who decides who gets crucified and who gets overlooked for heinous activities?I’m with you. Despite the leading questions and interruptions, I thought he made Michael Barbaro sound foolish. Yeah I personally don't like how Michael handled this one. I think Michael asked difficult questions on purpose. I agree at times he came off as foolish, but if he hadn't, Noam wouldn't have expressed his ideas. Michael definitely sounded more aggressive than normal. Yeah it almost sounded like Michael was attacking Noam a little bit on this one. I guess to get him to answer the tough questions. I thought the call back a month later was a bit much with who I assume was Noam’s daughter crying in the background. People like Noam decide who gets crucified and who gets overlooked.  He runs one of the most famous comedy rooms in the nation. Louis has since played a bunch more clubs.  The Cellar opened the gate for that.   

His comparisons are pretty interesting. Mike Tyson's performances and come back were not lightly overlooked.  There was a lot of complaining about his appearance in the Hangover and that was years after his release from prison. Louis CK hasn't actually had any kind of sentence and barely has acknowledged that he committed those acts, only admitting to broad bad behavior.  Its been like a year.  Its crazy that we think "You don't be able to be the most famous comedian in the world until you actually address these allegations and show remorse and change and a year isn't enough" is getting crucified.     Its also really interesting of Noam to end the first conversation by saying "we can't actually talk openly about this because then I'd get shut down" while at the same time he's saying "we need public forums like twitter where people can say whatever they want so that society can choose to dislike Roseanne".  Its pretty clear that he knows his opinions are not socially acceptable so he just doesn't say it.  And its no surprise. Its fucking crazy how he quickly starts questioning the allegations that Louis admitted to.  He pretends that the questions of Louis' guilt (which are not questioned) are just as tough as questions like "how should we welcome criminals into society AFTER they've served their sentence."  Louis hasn't served any sentence. Welcoming him back does nothing to deter his behavior.  He basically just says he doesn't want the pressure.  Thats sad sack shit. That was an interesting choice for them o leave that stuff with his daughter in unedited. Honestly, it kinda irked me. I can almost see the producers of the show keeping it in as if to say something profound about Noam’s predicament. “See! He has a daughter and he lets sex offenders on stage at his club! Isn’t that fucked up!?” 

...Of course perhaps I’m looking into this small detail too much, yet I wouldn’t put it past the nyt to pull a strategy like that. I guess I just like my journalism dry and without melodrama. Yeah. I found myself getting annoyed with Michael at the beginning, but then I realized he was asking these one-sided questions to allow Noam to articulate his stance on it. Maybe Michael already knew that Noam was a borderline philosopher.I think they left that unedited to show that Noam didn't come to his decision based on the facts from one side of the argument. It was a "Hey he has a daughter and he allowed Louis back on stage" thing, but not to say that he was fucked up. It was to say he really has thought his decision through from multiple angles. If he went on and he got booed down then those other clubs would not have followed suit.  The audience decided it was ok for Louis to come back.

At some point he may try to make a movie.  He will then face another gate keeper who will decide if they will produce it or not. They will make the decision based on the market.

I know Noam said it wasn't a financial decision, and it probably wasn't in the front of his mind, but if Louis's performance was to hit him hard financially then this conversation would be different.The audience didnt make the decision for Louie to perform, it was literally thurst upon them in a way designed specifically to make sure that any audience objection could be minimized. The opinions on Louie are clearly mixed and there obviously were people there excited to see Louie. But there are people who have seen his surprise sets and have not been happy about it. What do you think they should do? Boo? Confront a performer? Confront the people cheering around them? Boycott the club?   Noam put Louis up in a position of power where its EXPECTED to be cheered. He gives Louis that platform over other comics, he cant just wash his hands of that.I think both of you are looking too deep into this. It's just the style Michael prefers. He's been asked many times on why he keeps the silent parts of the interviews in (both people not saying anything) and he mentioned that he prefers it that way. I forgot the reason he gave for this (I think it makes it more genuine?). This is why you always hear the beginning of the conversation when the guest says hello, when their phone rings or when they start talking to someone else. You'll notice these things in a lot of the episodes.I started the episode with my mind made up and Noam challenged me.  What Louis did was wrong, objectively. But I found Noam's notion of redemption and second chances to be fairly poignant. The Crux of the matter is where do we draw the line, as a society, when to let people work in their chosen field again or not.  Giving someone a platform does not make that decision.THANK GOODNESS.

Looks like you were right.

My brain did not know how to process that change.Wait, so they guy who gives the comic the stage to perform on does not make the decision about who performs kn the stage? That makes zero sense. Maybe you dont understand how many thousand comics club owners refuse to give stage time without the input of the audience. They are the principle gatekeepers and to pretend otherwise is ignorance. I'm saying the gatekeeper doesn't make the decision on whether to give the comic/other celebrity a second chance. That's the public's job. Not allowing the comic to go on is making a decision to not allow the public to watch them, which is not allowing the public to make a decision about whether to give the comic a second chance or not.  Allowing them to go on stage is to allow the public to make a decision.

Louis CK is not one of those thousands of comedians that will be denied stage time. We all know that he was going to be back on the stage at some point.  It would have been weird if he faded into obscurity.

Springing a surprise comic on people is not allowing the audience to make a decision. They arent buying tickets or voting with their dollars. They went to see comedy and Louis was sprung on them. Thats a way to rehabillitate someones image, not give the public some democratic choice of approval. And its working! Noam and all his showbiz pals help rehab Louis's image while denying all responsibility for their position and syaing the nameless audeince, who cant be held accountable, is the only judge. And you buy it and say "oh his return was inevitable" and Louis will continue to make women comics feel unsafe. And now women comics now know that even if the male comic admits that he sexually harassed women at work club owners will continue to put the harraser on stage and imply that the allegations are false so long as the dude is famous.    It would be absolutely awesome if every scumbag who asked a strange woman at work if he could go into her dressing room and jerk off in front of her while hes married with a pregnant wife   was relegated to obscurity. Forget what you "know" and have the moral spine to demand actual consequences for serial abusers.Is the only consequence for their actions is to never have them work again? Also, I don't want women to feel unsafe. But I also don't want to condemn someone forever for their past mistakes. I'm fine with felons that get out of prison getting jobs, for example.I am really happy this challenging exchange was published for people to discuss.  What Louis did was wrong, for many unforgivable.  And I think most people probably feel that he hasn't paid a sufficient enough price for his actions, which did real harm to these women and all women in comedy.

And yet, Louis is known as one of the funniest known comedians in the world today.

To those that wish Louis would go away and live in a garbage can, I can understand the notion that a rich person who has done these things shouldn't get to rebuild a platform which made him rich in the first place while doing these things, but I will also say that if there's enough of an audience who feel his comedy, along with any sort of reparations he might make carries an equal or greater weight than his offenses then he should get to be in our society again and tell funny jokes.

Now, if you tried to extend the same rule to Bill Cosby, then the rule still applies, there is no amount of reparation and funniness in the world that can outweigh his actions, so he is not welcome back.

I know people will disagree with this, and that's ok, I understand.  This will follow Louis around for the rest of his career.  He's probably never getting another TV show or HBO or Netflix special, because his actions have real cost to them, just not quite garbage can level cost./u/kitkid said something below that speaks to this. 

I don’t know if you’re a regular listener but he often has rough edits. It’s part of the feel of the podcast. Not the first time there’s someone talking in the background. Yeah this sums it up for me too. Ultimately, the audience’s demand for — or even tolerance of — Louie returning will determine the remainder of his career. 

But some people have a major problem with Noam allowing Louie to perform at all, and allowing these audiences even the option to approve of or reject of Louie’s return. 

And I think that’s ultimately what Noam’s rejecting, that there should be a barrier to how information enters the discourse. He’s rightfully arguing that it’s a dangerous concept. There shouldn’t be limits in a free society on what’s presented to the public. It should be up to the public, through all of us — through our discourse and, yes, through our purchasing power — whether or not Louie CK or Mein Kampf or Sgt Peppers has any place in our society.

It’s also important to remember that if more people approve of Louie’s return than disapprove, he’ll have some kind of career. My sense of it, through conversations I’ve had in the real world, and not just on the internetz, is that people DO approve, to varying degrees.

You dont want women to feel unsafe, but you arent willing to  ask their employers to take the slightest steps in protecting them from workplace predators like Louis CK. Like do you think Louis CK has been punished enough? What was that punishment? How has he shown remorse for specific actions? How has he demonstrated that hes chnaged? I dont see any him doing any of that shit. So no, i dont think this specific person we're talking about should get this kind of passThis is an honest question, because I'm seeing a lot of "He hasn't done enough" in regards to Louis earning the public's forgiveness.  What would you personally like to see him do to earn that trust back? What would be acceptable redemption? Feel free to be as specific as you like.The audience didn't walk out though, or boycot the club, or stop returning, or make it vocally clear that they never wanted to hear him again. They applauded him! He may have been thrust on the audience, but if they all got and booed, you think he would have let him back on? This guy is bearing the brunt of the anger, when it should be directed at a society ok with Louis coming back I love podcasts where they interview normal people who aren't pundits or experts or otherwise movers and shakers in their industry. I imagine Noam is a regular bar owner, a citizen, and normal guy who has this opportunity to have a New York Times interview. He's articulate, makes reasonable points, doesn't sugarcoat himself for Michael, and I found myself agreeing with him quite a lot. 1. Acknowledge what he did wrong specifically as to the public allegations and apologize. Hes been purposefully vague about what actions hes committed which is what allows people like this club owner to act like he may be innocent of some of the worst allegations. 
2.  Show actual remorse in any way beyond regretting that its impacted him negatively. The letter he put out was gross and not an actual apology.
3. Take responsibility for the damage hes caused by offering substantial financial restitution to the people he victimized.  Shoot, in one instance they had to almost cancel an entire show because of him (or more accurately, they threatened to cancel the whole show because the actress complained,  so she kept quiet so the show could continue and the workers would stay hired).
4. Take any kind of action that demonstrates hes changed. Some thoughts:  Work with charities that help prevent sexual assault, share his experience with how he went wro g so that others may avoid the same path, go to therapy and put that therapy into practice in his everyday life. Take an actual break to work on yourself not a quick little time out while the news cycle changes. Start a set with anything but complaining about how much money he lost because the news finally printed stuff about how he preyed on female comics.
   Michael Vick seems like a good example of someone who has committed a heinous crime and now regrets his actions and has become a changed human being. You're free to look at some of the many many actions hes taken.1. We dont know how many people were uncomfortable or cheered. We know some people have in fact walked out of his sets.  
2. I dont know what youre experience is, but overall i find that most people avoid confrontation, even booing a comic who very suddenly was brought up on stage. 
3. We dont even know how many people there even knew about the allegations or the extent of them. We like to pretend that everyone knows everything that happens in the news, but thats just not the case, especially with how fast news moves these days.    
Louie performs surprise sets specifically so that the audience will be surprised in a space that theyre conditioned to respond positively. These are spaces where audience participation is not respected or expected. Especially immediate booing. If you heckled him there youd get thrown out of the club you paid a 20 dollar cover to get into. Weird to demand that reaction from an audience.Name one consequence for Louie that hasn't been "People aren't paying him money anymore". The dude stopped publicly performing NOT EVEN A YEAR AGO.  He publicly lied and denied the allegations for well over 10 years. This isn't some "you did this, so you have to take a time out for this long" kind of deal.  Its so bizarre when people demand some arbitrary finite consequence to be immediately proclaimed.  Do you understand how wild that is?  Multiple women come forward saying "we were victimized by this man over the course of years and years and it was an industry wide secret" and all people ask is "when can Louie perform again".  You want to know how long? I say until he shows remorse and actually apologizes and demonstrates change. I'm in agreement that Louis CK is an asshole.  Regarding Noam, I think he is fine to allow Louis to come onto his stage.  Especially because this is his clubs schtick - where huge comics try new material out.  

Edit: u/kevie3drinks and u/growlerpower said it well in their contribution to the discussion.  I feel like Noam is rejecting the idea that he should be a barrier to the discourse.  I agree with Noam.You're speaking about these audiences like they are children being forced into watching something truly horrific. Can we agree that these are rooms full of **adults** who can make decisions for themselves? This hand-holdy view that adults need to be shielded from every minor discomfort has gotten so ridiculous and quite frankly condescending. It is common knowledge that comedy shows, specifically comedy cellar, are known to have comedians drop in unannounced. Chris Rock is not THRUST upon the audience, Chris Rock pops in to run some jokes. If you don't care for a comedian who has popped in unannounced and don't feel comfortable supporting their career, you can excuse yourself and move on with your life. It's as simple as that. If you feel that you cannot handle the risk of someone you find dislike popping in, you don't have to go at all.  The freedom of choice is an amazing thing. Ok fine, continue to patronize and blindly defend all the sexual harrasers you wish. A summary for those who haven't listened: in this episode, a New York Times Reporter can't understand why a comedy club owner would ever allow a blacklisted Pariah comedian to work again when it might hurt people's feelings.

Listener be warned, you may experience excessive eye-rolling during this episode.

There are layers of irony here. Let's not forget that the New York Times and the comedy club owner are both using Louis CK’s fame and notoriety to sell their products, newspapers and beer respectively.  

Since when did liberalism become about shutting down free speech?   Of course we sympathize with the victims, but there is a hierarchy of social values, and speech wins over feelings every time.  I’m appalled we can't expect a journalist to advocate for speech, and this entire episode does not reflect well on Michael or the Times. How exactly does one demonstrate changing into a *not* sexual predator?  Who decides if his remorse is genuine?

Seems problematic.  Noam came off as extremely intelligent. He put into words, through near rediculous testing, a cogent reason for operating on a non-political platform. It was refreshing to hear him tolerate the somewhat deplorable tactics Micahel was using to push the issue.Do you suffer cognitive dissonance this regularly?The comedy cellar (along with the comedy store in LA) is one of the world's premier comedy clubs. He's definitely not a normal guyControversial comment, But I dont think Michael was going for some kind of agenda -- I think he just wanted a coherent and concrete answer that could be wrapped up nicely as a statement and Noam couldn't/wouldn't give it.

Michael just sounded frustrated that they can't boil Noam's opinion down to one sentence.You make good points. I think fundamentally I'll just say, it seems a lot of people are cool with him being back, and to the extent you think him being back is a problem, the issue should be with the people at large who are ok with this stuff. Like Noam, the guy who gives him a stage and publically questions the allegations? Yeah, i do have a problem with all of them, and I have the most problem with the people who give him a space to perform. Its absurd to think hes a neutral displayer of talent because that is fundamentally not true, not how the comedy field works and not how the Cellar specifically works. Hes basically relying on people not understanding the industry to pretend that hes a neutral presenter of talent.    But whatever.  No one here has identified a single real consequence Louie has faced beyond losing his income for less than a year. And yet everyone is fine with him performing. Me yelling at them about what shitheels there are does nothing. I know where Reddit in general stands on women. Its just hysterical that anyone would buy that "i just put people up on stage! And whose to say what happened, But I just people up on stage" routine. Another example of how terrible of an interviewer Michael is. Hey, GetYourFaceAdjusted, just a quick heads-up:  
**publically** is actually spelled **publicly**. You can remember it by **ends with –cly**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word".

You're useless.

Have a nice day!I think you're right to upset at him, he is a gatekeeper and he doesn't want to accept that responsibility. I also think though, you can't deny that if audience said, hey fuck this, don't bring this guy back ever again he wouldn't. The example he gave of Cosby and how the audience wouldn't have been cool with it I think applies here. My point is just that imo, the bigger problem is not the gatekeepers, but the public that's ok with this. In the same way, not to get off on a tangent, I think the bigger problem is not Trump, but the people who are cool with all the shit he's doing. &gt; Listener be warned, you may experience excessive eye-rolling during this episode.

Blesss. I enjoyed the episode but found myself cringing so hard. idk, it sounded like Michael wanted to paint Noam into a corner. Noam's opinion was boiled down quite distinctly, he just wanted him on record saying. Especially with the call back a month later. Agreed not normal. I think OP is looking for, "not polished."What was up with the reporter acting like a carbon tax being the most effective way to reduce CO2 emissions was a new novel idea that economists and scientists had never given serious consideration to before? I felt like I was being gaslighted. I learned about this in detail in like 2007 in college and where they were experimenting with it and how externalities were calculated etc etc. and it wasn’t taught to me as a brand new idea then either.&gt;	along with any sort of reparations he might make carries an equal or greater weight than his offenses then he should get to be in our society again and tell funny jokes.

Great, but what kinds of reparations has Louis made that we should welcome him back? How much better off would those female comedians be if he used his platform to raise them up instead of jerking off in front of them?Fair point, I don't know what it should be, but whatever it is, he hasn't done it yet.Did anyone catch how they connected the Voter Registration Act’s tendency to pick up typos and inconsistencies with targeting Democrats or black voters? I caught them saying it had been shown to selectively disenfranchise those populations but couldn’t see the reasoning. Democrats and black people more likely to make typos? Is there a study or something they mentioned I missed? I think it's fair to say that minorities in general have more "unusual" names and hence have their names be written wrongly. Things like having a dash in your name, or double letters can cause you problems when trying to register. It’s pretty easy for people, men and women, to do with idiots like you around.I have to say I really enjoyed this conversation. Weber was very honest, precise, intelligent and thorough with his answers. He showed us that republicans know exactly what they're doing whenever they bring an issue or a non issue into question and how it's intended to push democrats into a corner and put them exactly where republicans want them to be. I liked that he was a little remorseful for playing a role in polarizing the country.Agreed, I enjoyed this episode quite a bit and it gave me a lot to think about.  I'll be more cognizant of wedge issues going forward. If I'm in a discussion with someone about an issue and they bring up the extreme wedge issue I'll try to bring it back to the broader issue.Indeed. That's one of the lessons we should learn from this. I think even democrat politicians know that by now, you can see that in the way they're campaigning for the mid terms by focusing on the main issues and not being swayed by wedge issues like the caravan, the transgender issue and so on.Thinking about one of the last points Vin made, do these issues need to be or should be discussed in the public forum?

First, of course they should and I don't think anyone is saying "shhh, don't talk about how trans people have rights too." Second, they way Republicans talk about these issues is typically not in a manner that leads to civil discussion.  These issues are almost exclusively talked about like Democrats are agents of pure evil.

In the case of abortion, it is an unfortunate fact that we need to deal with, not ignore and hurt those who need it most.  Making it a wedge issue stifles, not encourages, public debate.

One more point on trans people, how is this a wedge issue? It's all just human rights.... Ugh&gt;they way Republicans talk about these issues is typically not in a manner that leads to civil discussion. These issues are almost exclusively talked about like Democrats are agents of pure evil.

Because that's their whole purpose for talking about these issues. They're not interested in a discussion, they already have their minds set. They're playing a political game that allows them to turn their beliefs into reality.I don't think that they are "turning their beliefs into reality" as much as they are turning reality into beliefs. Trans people are a reality, what they are doing is turning that into a belief that somehow that is upending their way of life. If Michael did not ask these questions everyone would have called him out on that. I thought it was a excellent listen and they both made interesting points. well what I meant by that is that they turn their vision into reality by doing whatever it takes moral or immoral to make it true. 

They just put two judges on the supreme court, they're suppressing votes for a large part of the population, they're working on banning abortion and turning back transgender rights as you mentioned, they passed tax cuts and took away people's healthcare. So what I'm saying is that they're making THEIR reality, or way of life as you put it, into reality for everyone else no matter how oppressive or wrong they are. They're as disconnected as you can be from actual reality of course, on some issues at least. Curious about everyone's thoughts about the social restrictions we put on free speech. I feel like we've moved towards a world of right and wrong opinions, which is probably a good step, but we have also closed the doors to people who have other opinions, which also closes the doors to showing people why something is right or wrong. I wholeheartedly agree with you. [I said as much on the facebook episode](https://old.reddit.com/r/Thedaily/comments/90jmp1/facebooks_plan_to_police_the_truth/e2qwgxk/) a few month ago. I think everyone should have the right to share their opinions no matter how stupid those might be. Enclosing people is what makes them explode eventually. As long as it doesn't put anyone's well being at risk, I'm all for it.
