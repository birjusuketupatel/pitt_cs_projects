By now, you probably know what a speedrun is already.
It's where players commit to beating a game as fast as possible.
On the surface, it's a bit silly —
people sitting down with one game, playing it over and over,
dedicating immense time and effort to learning its ins and outs,
and learning skills that probably aren't all that helpful anywhere else. And, yet,
*somehow*, the experience of taking part in or even watching someone try to speedrun a game is exhilarating and amazing and just fun.
And speedruns of some games frequently get millions of views.
This clearly matters to a lot of people.
So there's probably a reason why. And I was having trouble scratching out the reasons why,
so I arrived at the obvious solution of writing a YouTube video about it.
Speedrunning is really fun to watch and stories about speedrunning are consistently fascinating
and I really want to talk about why.
And no one's managed to stop me so far.
It's generally accepted that the "Souls" series is pretty difficult.
And they ARE, at least for beginners,
because the games are generally not great at teaching you how to really grasp playing them.
I've heard there's already a video out there somewhere that drones on and on for way too long trying to explain this,
so we'll ignore that here.
This difficulty is the prime reason why speedruns of games in the series are so entertaining to watch.
Owing to the games' inaccessibility and the time investment required to "get good", as it were,
watching someone blast through them is just plain fun.
What's interesting in a more in-depth way about speedruns, though, is seeing how they develop over time.
And Dark Souls is a perfect example of why.
The earliest speedrun on record at Speedruns.com—a fantastic resource,
by the way—for Dark Souls is by Japanese runner "Twilight".
In 2011, a lot less was known about how Dark Souls really ticked,
and there was yet to be much of a community to help pick away at all the possible fastest approaches to the game.
So Twilight's run consists largely of combining general tricks that were widely known early on for making the game easier or faster.
For example, in Dark Souls there are multiple different starting classes with their own stats, starting items, and abilities.
While some *do* have unique advantages, the Pyromancer starts with the ability to throw fireballs,
something none of the others can access for quite a while.
So it's usually the one recommended to new players, because, if they're having trouble fighting, they can *throw fire on people*, I mean, come on.
So Twilight picks them. It's not really a surprise.
It's kind of the obvious choice if you were to think about how to speedrun this game if you played it a few times.
The next big choice is the starting gift players can choose something extra to start the game with from a list at character creation
normally in Dark Souls early on to continue deeper into the game players have to go through a fairly tough area fight a
Difficult boss to get a key to another difficult area then fight another boss there to progress through to another difficult area called blight town
which leads down to another boss which is guarding a bell you need to ring to progress the game, but for
reasons the developers made one of the starting items players can choose from a key that unlocks a gate in the starting area which skips
Past two of those bosses right into the lower part of blight town
So it's pretty clear what item a speedruner would want to start with here.
It's just the most obviously fast and helpful choice
I mean look at the other ones:
Binoculars?
A rubbish ring?
A ....more rubbish ring?
Pendant.
Trinket: no effect.
Black fire bombs? What a garbage option. Why would anyone ever pick that?
I don't know. I guess they're pretty good
I mean they're
more deadly than STD bomb
what?
Another initially obvious trick for speedrunning involves this drake that  shows up early on and hangs out up here.
Getting a decent weapon in this game usually takes some time
But once you get to this big scary boy,
One recommended way for new players to get to an advantage so they don't have too hard a time starting out
is to sit in a safe place and spam arrows at its tail until it breaks off giving you this sword.
The Drake sword deals a ridiculous amount of damage for the place in the game where you can get it
it drops off in its usefulness quite quickly but for early players is just a fantastic weapon to pick up.
But instead of wasting time and arrows, of which they had neither,
Twilight simply dodged behind it when it jumped down and cut its tail off and then ran to the next area.
This is one of the most cathartic things you can see in a speedrun, you know,
You spend a bunch of time dying to its fire or getting kicked to death
and then you see someone else just steal its tail and
run away with it and proceed to beat people to death with it for the rest of the game.
It's great.
A lot of Twilight's early run consists of playing the game the way one normally would,
but just doing more running and ignoring enemies.
Early runs like this play the game basically as normal but very quickly and precisely,
Doing the most obviously easy and fast moves.
Twilight burns all the remaining bosses with their hot hot hands and grabs enough humanity that they can feed it to the daughter of chaos
And open a shortcut past all the major fire based bosses
Which obviously would take a long time to fight when all your weapons are fire.
Have you ever tried actually fighting fire with fire?
I'm on a watch list now.
After a lot of running past things and killing bosses
They gather the four Lord Souls required to open the big door to the remnants of great-uncle Gwynn's mega weekend barbecue and kill him
So someone can finally call the fire department and they do it in an hour and 26 minutes in in game time
This is an ungodly fast speed to finish Dark Souls
but there was a lot of improvement to make
what I think is interesting about the early runs through the game is that they weren't just improving on execution of the same route or
Finding slightly more improved paths, but the nature of the entire route from the very start was still up for debate
Nothing was set in stone
even what type of character you chose to play as and it wasn't clear what the fastest way would really be and that's a really
fun experimental period in the development of a speedrun
This is where Dark Souls runs excel in the spectatorship aspect in lots of other games
You don't have as much choice or freedom and where to go or what sort of character to play or what weapon to use there
Are so many other paths or decisions that could have been made in a Souls game that the next run threatens to be
completely different and well
It was the next World Record was set three months later and has gone on to be the longest standing world record lasting
13 months it was set by another Japanese runner care tap
I hope I'm pronouncing that properly care and then there's any engage took care tear it that all right
What's really fun about this run? Was it diverged from twilight's path?
Immediately not only do they start the game with a different class right out of the gate
But once they make it to filing shrine and you assume their own is going to be similar looking but with slight
Improvements they get up and immediately head in the opposite direction
Oh, wow goes to parts of the game Twilight never even sees in their run firstly
They go to the valley of Drake's dodge between the drakes and grab the red tear stone ring
Which boosts the players damage output by roughly sixty-six percent when they're below twenty percent health by playing more riskily cata becomes much more dangerous
This is the kind of improvement
I love seeing in speedruns learning to abuse a
risk/reward mechanic to just get the rewards by simply playing really well in a speedrun a risk reward item can very frequently become a
hopper of war then they run into
Darkroot base in an encounter the Black Knight there now Black Knights are tough enemies in the early game
They don't take much damage. Even when you reap a star backstab them
You can see this is gonna take quite always push them off. The cliff is rewarded with the Black Knight halberd
You only get this weapon for killing the knight like 20% of the time and these Knights don't respawn
This halberd forms the basis of care to strategy
So if they don't get the halberd here, they would have to start the run again. There are
definitely countless runs on the cutting room floor that ended here just because
You can slightly increase the chance of a dropping if you have more humanity on you, but it's still like a crapshoot now
There's a reason the last thing you fight before the final boss is a black knight with a halberd
Quinn knew what was up this weapon
Absolutely
Mashes most enemies and bosses then
They just keep going and run all the way around to the dark route Basin entrance to the undead parish
Skipping several areas completely after beating the gargoyles with a regular old axe. They use the souls
they've gained to level up enough to equip the halberd which they can now just about wield if they
Two-handed cata had precisely figured out the most efficient way to get the souls
They needed to use this weapon as early as possible
This means they're able to utterly destroy the fire bosses that Twilight had to skip completely because of their weapons
it's literally faster for character to run through all this and kill all these bosses than it is to gather the
Materials required to just skip them over all care to saved 15 entire minutes over Twilight while killing more bosses
Most of the current record holders and Dark Souls use this basic strategy now
But they've saved even more time by discovering new holes in the game to exploit life by
Messing with the camera system enough to go out of bounds and enter sen's fortress early
They've improved the strategy so much that they don't even use the master key anymore instead. They use black fire bombs to
Work fire bombs off say your page
Option why would anyone ever pick?
Someone should just fucking come and stop me before I make it so they stop me talking and axe
This just goes to show how much a run can develop the once really obvious main choices of Pyromancer
Master key and Drake sword have all in turn been
superseded the creation and development of new runs through games is really really fun to watch but in a way that's
hard to describe it's a kind of
Logistical fun. Is that a kind of fun? That doesn't sound like a kind of fun?
It's it reminds me of the feeling I got
when I had my GPS out and it told me to take a route through a park that I knew really well and I was
Like now I can go through that faster, and I had walked a different route and I got through it faster
I just felt amazing. It's a bit like
The feeling I got when I decided I was gonna do my taxes eight months early. Have you ever done your taxes early?
Speedrunning is for you. Welcome friend. I
Have a script for this bit but I forgot all the words part 2 categorization and arbitrary
No one I showed the script suggested better titles. So I'm just gonna have to go with these ones now
I have to admit I've so far deliberately not mentioned something about the dark souls run
The progression I described is actually only one of several different categories of run through the game one known as any percent
No wrong warp
Like I said before most of the normal runners spent killing all the major bosses to get the Lord Souls to unlock the big door
which is why it was kind of a big deal when players figured out a way to
Teleport right here on the other side of the door without having to open it the games
DLC added an arena where players could fight each other online
swag to tomorrow after beating
Artorias who incidentally was my favorite boss fight in the series until Blood Bones DLC came out you gain access to the battle of Stoicism
Gazebo which presumably sounds better in Japanese when they joined the arena
through the gazebo
players receive a purple cowards crystal which they can use to quit a fight and teleport back to the entrance it does this by telling
the game to move you to a certain map and position the map being the main dlc area and the position being the entrance to
The arena now there are other items in the game which work similarly like the homeward Bonio or the darksign
They tell the game to take you to the map where you last rested at a bonfire and the position of that bonfire
So let's say you last rested at the bonfire in front of the big door barring specific circumstances using one of these two items
We'll take you back here. Now. You can't normally use the purple cowards crystal outside of the arena
It's grayed out trying to use it makes your character have a panic attack and think about all the times
They said you too when a waiter told them to enjoy their food
But there's a glitch that allows players to use items even when they're not intended to by trying to use it
switching to an item
they can use like the estus flask while holding down the use button still running off an edge while toggling weapons and
pressing the use button again on an exact frame causing the player to drink the item along with the flask which
Uses it even if you're not supposed to be able to what a handy item
You can visit the gazebo whenever you like
But here's the thing
Using the crystal in the main game has a fancy long
Animation where you can't do anything as the game fades to a loading screen
But when you use it this way you can still walk around and use items before it fades
So what if we used another item that teleports us while this other effect was going off?
Well to put it simply the game gets confused
It tries to load you to the map of the last used bonfire
Which in our case is the bonfire before the big door, which we cleverly napped at before coming here
But the position of the arena entrance the arena entrance the game is looking for doesn't exist in this map though
So instead it takes you to the pre-programmed
Default position in the level and it turns out that the default position for this area is inside the kiln of the first flame
so now all
Players need to do to beat the game is gain access to this bonfire and the dlc battle arenas
And then they can warp directly to the last area
Oh and also they have to perform an absurdly precise set of inputs with barely even a frame of lenience seriously
It's really hard getting this footage alone
Took me like 25 minutes
But if you can execute this consistently which speedrunners are really good at learning to do this method saves a lot of time
however
It was decided by the community to be so different from the other runs since you have to both
The DLC and abuse a pretty major glitch that all runs prior to the discovery of this glitch and after the discovery
But which don't use it should be split off into their own separate category at this point the dark souls
'speedrun community has split the game into at least 14 different
categories ranging from extra difficult challenges such as killing all the bosses or completing the entire game without leveling up to
Absurdist challenges like completing the game after collecting one of every ring item in the game the Lord of the Rings
Run of the clever name this kind of separation of a run into distinct categories also happened in blood-borne
when the game was initially released a glitch in some of the architecture for the game was discovered resulting in the player being able to
leap off at an angle from a coffin and get on to a raised section of wall then do an attack at another part of
A wall to clip through skipping a whole bunch of the game
for example
the fight with gas Gwaltney and leading to the creation of a root which
Supplemented by other tricks would eventually only take about 20 minutes, which is utterly absurd
however
blood-borne was pretty heavily patched after release making lots of changes and fixes including that error in the architecture and
Also incidentally much better load times. This makes this run impossible to do on a properly patched version of the game
It also means the version of the game you would play today on an online ps4 would be unable to do the fastest speedruns
Which puts you in a pretty major disadvantage the solution was for new categories to be created
So runners could run the original version of the game if they wanted but runners could also compete using the current patch the current fastest
Patch to run of the game is slower by 8 minutes
Although incidentally because of the massive fixes to load times despite the in game timer telling you it's almost 8 minutes slower
It's a minute faster to watch in real time
Blood-borne was messed up when it came out wasn't it Blood Bones a really interesting game to run as well in general for a lot
of reasons one of them being the beasts blood pellet which adds a meter filled by dealing certain types of damage and the higher the
Meter the more damage the player both deals and receives
It's a bit risk/reward in normal play, but it's a godsend for speedrunners and in some ways
It makes the game easier for speedrunners by specifically
Rewarding fast play the diverging anypercent categories in these games raises interesting questions about the Hobby
In games with multiple categories, which one is the real speedrun?
Why are some glitch and tricks permitted and others not shouldn't the goal be to create the fastest singular run and agree on one?
standard set of rules for what the
Speedrun should be and how does one decide when something is allowed and when something should be a separate category or band?
well, it depends on both the game and its community a game that's impacted by these questions in a big way is mirrors edge mirror's
Edge is a game
Very close to my heart to the point that I've speedrun it before as well if I'd bothered to submit the run to speed runs
calm I'd
Officially be in
200 first place. The thing about Mirror's Edge is it's a game about moving very quickly
The player character is very mobile has a diverse set of moves across
Services and for picking up speed and different ways of jumping on to off of and across things
There are also a lot of little ways the mechanics can be manipulated to go even faster
this makes it an ideal speed game this runner just executed a trick so
Quickly at the beginning that you probably didn't even see it right as they load it in
They turned to the side and did a side hop which immediately gets them up to top speed
This is one of my favorite tricks right here
Normally this pole like you have to slowly do a balancing act as you walk across it
Okay kid
All right
Runners have reached the point where they leap
Onto it in a straight line and don't fall off and then turn into another jump off of it
So they never have to do it
It's incredible playing Mirror's Edge as fast as you can and then going online and checking out a speedrun is a really fun experience
There are so many nuances and specifics to the game's level designs and movement mechanics
That is just a joy to see how much extra speed can be teased out
But the game's parkour focus and aesthetic also poses a question for runners. What does it mean to speedrun Mirror's Edge?
There's a variety of interesting glitch is available to exploit if you want to beat nerves edge as fast as possible
But some of them significantly impact the way the game is played and what the experience of watching it is like take for example
The out-of-bounds glitch or ooh
plenty of games like you get above the level and use this to get to places meant to be reached through slower or harder means
This can be used very egregiously to bypass large chunks of several levels
And this is technically much much faster than playing the game the normal way
but
it also
Runs counter to the sort of principles that make Mirror's Edge the game you'd want to see speed run in the first place
Doesn't it it's a game all about motion
Finesse clever use of controls and timing to skirt along the edge of the proverbial mirror not to clip through it and then just win
part of the fun of speedrunning is watching a game being played very
Skillfully and very quickly and some tricks rub up against what some people would define as skillfully playing the game
so Mirror's Edge has multiple categories for the main run through the game including any percent and
Glitchless in any percent you can be treated to a faster run of the game using a lot of technical trickery to run across surfaces
in weird and impossible ways
Accelerate far faster than was probably ever intended abuse a bizarre mistake in the wall run kick
Programming that allows you to jump on one frame right afterwards like faith had a double jump or something
slide into parts of the world
You were never meant to see have an LSD trip
nightmare as every frame of faiths movement is suspended before her eyes and climbed through moving elevators to shoot up into
Darkness, this run is really interesting and showcases some amazing tricks and moves, but it's also maybe not the sort of stuff
It's fun to see specifically in a speedrun of this type of
This is obviously highly subjective of course, but the community seems to agree with me. So I win in around 2013
They introduced the glitchless category which specifically prohibits using major glitches that alter the flow of the game in this way glitchless' runs
Don't go out of bounds
don't abuse the weird extra jump you can get from kicking off a wall and
Prohibit a few other specific tricks that some people might deem against the spirit of Mirror's Edge
Glitchless has never and will never be faster than any percent
but to me
At least it's even more entertaining to watch runners in this category are navigating through more of the intended world of Mirror's Edge
Which for someone who played and really liked the game is a way more interesting
Challenge all kinds of segments that are completely avoided by fairly easy tricks in any percent have to actually be played and routed properly
In glitchless, let's compare just one jump across both categories
Here's the entrance to the RP a building in the second level
This jump is one of the first properly tough jumps in the game
It's a long distance, but also involves downward traversal
You have to approach it at speed and jump really late
But also roll when you land or you get hurt either
Rolling or taking damage is really slow
A runner doesn't really want to do either of those things in the current glitchless world record the runner rec
Executes an incredibly skillful maneuver to take full advantage of this rail here
So they land on the rail instead of the regular ground which prevents them having to roll or take damage
But they also turned in midair and executed a side jump to immediately get back to top speed when they landed
This is really really cool. It's really difficult to do I can't do it
Here's the same part in the current anypercent world record by filler tracks
Tracks abuses the wall kick jump to effectively fly over this challenging gap
Landing safely on some of the game's trademark white plant furniture stuff
Extrapolating tricks like this across a full game run makes for two very different and uniquely interesting paths through the game to watch earlier
I asked the question of which category should be considered the real speedrun of the game
But I don't think there's an objective answer at least for most games even in Blood Bones case using bugs that were patched out later
This is a version of blood-borne that was released and it beats the game as fast as possible'
and a Mirror's Edge may be clipping through walls should be seen as just a
the strategy is not doing so but everyone gets to decide for themselves how to figure out what a speedrun needs to be and
Usually there's gonna be enough people who feel that way that it's gonna end up as a speedrun
Category and the Mirror's Edge community has come up with quite a lot of categories over the years
I've only talked about one of the extra ones so far
There's also any percent in bounds
Which specifically avoids out-of-bounds glitches if you think going Oh busy and they're okay with the more advanced wall kick jump tricks and stuff
There's much more healthy competition when there are multiple agreed sets of rules to choose from I imagine if there had only been one
Ruling for how to speed run mirrors edge it would be a lot less
Satisfying for a lot of runners and wouldn't have seen quite as many runners come and go over the years
One runner eventually got a job at dice and worked on the sequel which apparently some people even played
So that's nice speed running is a completely arbitrary
Challenge one that most developers never even think to account for so it's totally fine to have multiple ways of categorizing runs
Different kinds of challenge and so on because some types of run are more interesting than others and non are really any more valid
Because they're all ultimately just silly things some people do for the sake of fun and competition
I think it's cool that even what it means to play a game quickly can be up for discussion
Sometimes my favorite type of Mirror's Edge run is the 69 Stars category, which is very nice
It's the category for running through all the games optional time trials in one sitting and getting all the stars
It really embodies the things I enjoy the most about the glitch less speedrun. It's just great performances utilizing mechanics
Mostly intended by the games developers run us do awesome stuff
Like ignore the game's inbuilt run ups for big jumps and instead make a really precise movement over them to jump
Manually at the edge and make it further and faster. It's awesome
The current number one record is by 40 vote iam voix TM
Not sure who got in just a teeny smidge over 21 minutes due to a couple of minor mistakes you're kidding, right?
Someone is going to beat 21 minutes in this category, and I can't wait
It's gonna be awesome
And because Mirror's Edge seems to inspire utter obsession in its fans myself included speedrun.com also has a category
extension leaderboard for even more weirder and specific runs
speedrun.com
me meme
It's pretty great
There's a true glitchless category here for weirdo purists like me who just want to see the actual game played near perfectly
There's categories that often only even have one or two submitters where like runs where one runner uses the mouse into another uses the keyboard
Or where two runners each use half of one controller. Honestly, this is just getting silly now
What about a New Game+?
Category where play his chapters select to the last segment and beat it in 13 seconds and people are genuinely down to counting
milliseconds to figure out who was actually the fastest
What about our Bo?
Reverse boss order where runners chapter select - each boss in the game in reverse order and time beating each of them
What about reverse our Bo where they do our Bo backwards? Why would you do it like that? That's just gossip
Why is it called that how about 80% times 25 where one runner has decided to run the game?
25 times in a row which took over 17 hours
And which they openly declare know what will ever beat what the fuck your sites that's right now. Yes. I
Told you I'm not even paying attention anymore. Why would you do this heck again?
Was your 60 millisecond lead and you gain plus not enough anymore. Did you need something stronger? What are you doing to yourself?
This is also where the segmented speedrun lips with various runners including the aforementioned Hecky can vote
I'm vote vote tart filler tracks and wreck all contributing small segments to produce an absolutely incredible
run
It's a fabulous
expression of a community's commitment to beating a game as fast as possible' and their years of developing skills and learning more and more about
How the game works I love it link in the description. Just give it a look. It's it's just great
there's a
tremendous sense of community to speedrunning people share information and discoveries
Discuss theories together and all the tricks used in runs are by their nature
Immediately available for further analysis and use in other runs
I remember like way back in the day like in 2014 like I was in a Skype call with some other house the best runners
We were watching table do some runs and we've never seen that sped up before and it just like yeah it blew our minds
We're like, okay
I'm never gonna go for that and now it's just like humming plays so that just goes to show like how far this game has
Come yeah
Speedrunning is an almost inherently collectivist activity in this sense while there is competition to be the best and take or hold the record
Almost no record holder has completely earned that position all on their own the best runs
Oh adept to the discoveries and ideas contributed by previous runners. The best run is often representative of many people's contributions
Alongside the runners own skill, of course in a sense speedruns are always a group effort
It's really not surprising that awesome charity events, like gdq have emerged from this space
it's just a grand a scaled version of what speedrunning had kind of always been you can't copyright a technique or strategy for beating a
video game quickly
There are no patents in speedrunning
Proving that you got a time or even getting the fastest time isn't just an achievement or personal victory. It's also
automatically a
Contribution to the greater community effort and that's radical calm radical
But speedrunning isn't always about socialism. Sometimes it's about beating video games very quickly part 3 in depth investigation
Actually, no. I've thought of a better title for this one
Donkey Kong 64 is a game by rail where for the Nintendo 64 you need to know that part
It's very much
The embodiment of the stereotypes about rares games for the time period large levels full of hundreds of different specific items
You have to collect to unlock more things to collect for instance
Each level has 500 bananas
But what makes it particularly troublesome is that some items are specifically for one of the five characters you play
To collect enough stuff to progress you'd have to traverse the same environments over and over with every character and the levels were often
Really big at the time it made the game feel big in like a cool sprawling
Adventure that lasted a long time and had a lot of chances to see how each character can progress through the same
Environment using their own skills and abilities. That's because I was seven years old
Now it just feels like time consuming busy work
Lots of this was completely unnecessary
from a design standpoint - you could design a game with
Collectibles only one character could reach in the first place instead of most of the time just having them hanging out there faded out
reminding you you're gonna have to come back here again with another character and running back to that barrel that changes characters because you need
to pick something else up is awful running back to previously completed levels because you finally have the
Characters you needed to pick up those bananas you'd already walked past eight times is a more painful
tragedy than Titus Andronicus
I would cut off my hand and send it to Emperor saturninus
If it meant I could have just picked up banana four hours ago with Daddy Kong instead of Yankel Kong
I can feel my cells
dividing as my precious existence rushes toward its finite end with nothing in the world to beguile my sorrow
but the sweet siren song of
banana
Donkey Kong 64 is an existential crisis in the form of a video game cartridge
I'm actually more aware of the futility of my existence after trying to go back and play this
Now I could sit you down and explain the progression of the Donkey Kong 64
anypercent run to you like it was the back of my hand, but firstly
There's already a video by summoning salt out there doing just that and that fit is bed
I think I could do so you should just go check that one out and secondly well to be honest. I've
I've seen a lot of speedruns at this point, and I'm kind of used to it, you know
Oh, yeah, Donkey Kong 64 a game. I be in 72 hours as a kid being beaten by professional in 30 minutes. Yeah. Sure
that's impressive to
a clown
At the circus I need something stronger. I've built up a tolerance to this stuff
We need to go deeper and darker
We need to talk about the players who will settle for nothing more than total conquest and no I'm not talking about
Donkey Kong Country to Diddy's conquest you get it's a pun
No, I'm talking about the Donkey Kong 64
100% speed run
Yeah
Well, technically it's the 101 percent speed run because rail where were pretty good at ironically recognizing that they put way too many collectibles in
their goddamn game to achieve 101 percent
completion players must collect the Nintendo coin the rare where coin all eight keys or ten battle crowns all 20 fairies all
201 golden bananas and all 40 banana medals each of which is awarded for collecting
75 OVA Kong's bananas in a level for a total of
3000 bananas
Hey, but, sometimes they come in little bunches of 5
Thanks Donkey Kong the rules list for this run on speedrun.com actually includes the stipulation but to submit runs for this category
You must hate yourself runners in this category endure such supreme
Torments that one of them fucking streamed themselves breaking their cartridge to make sure it was over. This is my DK car
Fun fact did you know that the PAL version of the Donkey Kong 64 cartridge was grey but the US retail version was banana yellow
You learn something new every day. This run is challenging in far more ways than the traditional run in that run
Your objective is fairly simple find the fastest way to the end
Whatever that way may be abusing cutscene glitches level skips moon jumps etc
Effectively ending up with runs where you do as little as possible
This runs core is having to actually do
Everything the game asks of you planning the most efficient route possible through all of it
And then somehow actually doing it all precisely and quickly
but with hundreds of golden bananas collect and some of these can be very challenging and
Llamas executing on all of this in succession introduces a new kind of test for these runners
resilience
paradoxically as with the beasts blood pellet when quicker
Strategies are found often that makes the game easier to beat because the length of time you have to focus on execution
Has gotten shorter
You only have to pull off 30 minutes of good stuff to beat the anypercent run in 30 minutes if something takes around five hours
to beat that's five hours of time to make mistakes in five hours to get tired or
Lose focus or slip from your intended most efficient path. These runs are essentially torture and
They're amazing
There's a three-year-old run by German Runner 360 Chris M that took 19 hours and 53 minutes
The best part of this run is it has face cam you can watch in real
Time as the Sun sets and Rises and he gets ever closer to making it to the end
He no sells it to like by the end. He still doesn't seem that tired. It's kind of awesome
despite there being plenty of runs that are way way more optimized the better runs push the 5 and a half hours mark
There's something very special about runs like this one where they probably know they're planned route is going to take them a full day
But they sit down and do it. I kind of love runs like this just for the sheer dedication
Regardless of how efficient they are
Phoebe boys at PB by 4 hours and 6 minutes pretty solid weight
His last attempt took nearly 25. Holy shit
The various runs of this game have led players to look very closely at almost every aspect
Even going so far as using hacking software to analyze the code in detail looking for anything that can be exploited to make runs faster
Dk64 has been investigated in a level of detail greater than the developers could have ever
Intended or expected and that's led to new discoveries for improving runs, but also to something really cool
Enter iso taj. Iso Taj is a runner with a really respectable time in the any persona category
It's also the longest standing run in the top ten by far
in fact
it was the world record for six months back in 20 Dean isotope has made a lot of contributions to the community including
spending a lot of time digging around inside the game's code finding new glitches and holes in world geometry and so on anything that could
Be exploited to get better runs isotons has found a lot of cool stuff in the game
Including this image of a railway employees face hidden inside the games files, which looks like it's been edited in a Game Boy camera
But they've also found stuff like this
out-of-bounds collectibles
It's common for developers to leave items and objects in places players can't get to in the game proper and not worry about removing them
Like this coin hidden in a wall in Mario 64 that someone actually figured out how to get and since these items exist
Well outside the intended scope of the game runs don't usually consider them collectibles as part of a run. They're more cool oddities
That shouldn't really be considered as game objects to be collected
But what if an item was absolutely collectable without any glitches?
But no one had found it before one day when messing around in the game's code looking for flags for collectable objects
isit arch found a banana coin that hadn't been
accounted for in the level fungi forest banana coins and dk64 are used to buy items and upgrades and because this is Donkey Kong 64
There are six different kinds of banana coin
There's one color for each character, but also a multicolored one
Which is usually hard to find and gives five coins to every character as soon as it's collected
there's only 15 of them in the game one in each level except angry Aztec which has two and
seven in the hub world of DK Isles
This new coin wasn't any of the ones that had been collected before but unlike the other items
This one wasn't out of bounds. It was hidden in a place
no, one had ever thought to check hidden in the tall grass in the level right about he no 8 sorry right about
here
And there it is as far as I can tell this coin isn't mentioned
anywhere on the internet prior to its discovery by I so turned in the games code and it's not in any strategy guide from the
Time period I can get my hands on
It's not really known whether the developers put this coin here intentionally or forgot to remove it or why they thought to give so little
Indication it was there it's easy to see why it was missed for so long
Now a cool kicker to this story would be that it
invalidated all the 101 percent runs or it turned out that there are now technically a hundred and two percent runs or something but banana
Coins aren't counted for percentages on the game's menu screen and the total amount of coins
You can get isn't even listed in the game anywhere the 101 percent run doesn't even include all of the bananas
because the game only counts banana medals towards completion so they don't even get all the
Bananas in the runs where you get a hundred one percent completion, which is a bit of a disappointment
Really? You should get them all next time to amuse me
Here's the sgdq run in 2017 soon after the coin was discovered when they've just stopped to get it for kicks
That rainbow coin has been hidden basically since the game came out so over
16 years, right?
It's not technically a major discovery and it changes nothing about how the game is run in the main catagories outside of what are essentially
ultra
masochistic jokes that people only really do just to be one of the two people who ever did it at all but it's still a
Really really cool discovery something was hidden
Just out of plain sight even to the people who would make a point of collecting everything in the game
for 17 years
What's fun about the banana coin is that it's kind of an abstract example of how awesome speedrunning communities are for
Deconstructing and examining games, like people are so dedicated to coming to an understanding of a game
This is Cthulhu.
It's a film that came out in 2008. Not many people appear to have seen it.
As a teenager, I was obsessed with the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft.
Lovecraft was a pioneer in pulp horror fiction, immediately gripping with his cavalcade of creative monsters, epic scope, terrible fates,
and a unique philosophy about the terror of the existence of gods greater than the human consciousness could allow.
The man's work was inspirational and moving to me. It made me think. It made me dream. It made me want to be a writer.
Also, seeing cool new words like "theosophists", or "non-euclidean",
or sentences like “the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion” made me feel smart.
I liked thinking I was smart.
I was a big fan of the role-playing game, too.
I just really liked the way that it dealt with the mythos, and had you interact with it.
And the way it modeled sanity was really good, too. And—
Hang on, can we— can someone find out who did this, and why?
I've been confused by this for like a decade now.
As my interest grew and I ran out of stories by, inspired by, or about Lovecraft to read,
I started playing or watching any game or film even remotely based on his work.
I'd seen Re-Animator and its sequels, and From Beyond,
and I was even about to watch Hellraiser when I found an interview with Clive Barker
where he said he didn't like Lovecraft's writing very much,
and decided not to watch the film out of some misguided sense of spite.
That was how I did things back then...
apparently.
I'd heard that Guillermo del Toro was going to adapt At the Mountains of Madness, one of the best of Lovecraft's stories,
and I couldn't wait for that.
It turned out I shouldn't have waited, because it didn't happen;
it was in development hell for a very long time, and then it was never greenlit.
Then, as I was scraping the bottom of the barrel and watching fan films on YouTube,
I eventually found out about Cthulhu.
It was named after Lovecraft's most famous creation, and it had been made so recently
that it might have been able to take advantage of the kinds of effects and production techniques possible in modern filmmaking,
that something of truly epic scale might actually have been possible.
Cthulhu is not that film.
Cthulhu isn't in the film. It isn't even based on the short story The Call of Cthulhu.
It's actually a loose— very loose— interpretation of The Shadow Over Innsmouth.
In that story, the narrator investigates a New England fishing town where the people are strange and unwelcoming to outsiders.
He eventually discovers that the people of the town worship a godlike fish creature named Dagon and its monstrous children,
and have begun breeding with those creatures.
And their descendants eventually transform into monsters themselves,
to take to the water and live forever beneath the sea with Dagon.
After barely escaping with his life,
the narrator realizes that his family tree comes from Innsmouth, and he is slowly becoming one of them too...
and he's starting to like it, and relish the chance to worship Dagon for all time.
It's a really good story, and it's an excellent example of early 20th century American horror,
with the narrator's final change serving as a genuinely uncomfortable and fascinating twist.
It's really a true classic.
This film is about a gay college professor called Russell,
who learns that his mother has passed away and returns to his hometown for her funeral.
Russell's father is the leader of a strange religious cult,
and also deeply homophobic, along with many of the rest of the townspeople.
Russell realizes the cult has designs on him of some kind, and something strange is going on.
He reconnects with an old lover from his past and tries to learn the truth, as the people become increasingly hostile towards his search.
In lieu of looking at the tangible specifics of the horror, the beliefs of the cult, or portraying the monsters from the original story,
the film focuses on Russell's own emotional state; his experiences, and dreams, and relation to the people he encounters
as he tries to understand what is happening.
When monsters do briefly appear, there's not really much to see.
The story isn't really concerned with them.
When I first saw this film, I decided that I hated it more than any other film.
It had taken something I cared about and enjoyed, and removed the things I thought made it interesting and valuable.
It made an existential horror about godlike creatures that care not for human affairs
into a story where the god in question never turns up, or does anything, or is even really talked about in it.
And even the name's technically the wrong name of the god.
Oh, and if you put the disk in a PC,
the label doesn't even spell Cthulhu properly!
It's such an easy word to spell!
The whole film felt like a betrayal.
The camera sometimes sits very still,
trapping you with Russell in situations neither of you want to be in,
for conversations he doesn't want to be having, with people he doesn't want to see.
"So, how's the, uh, how's the church?"
"How's the gay life treating you, Russell?"
"It's my life."
"Is it satisfying? Are you fulfilled?"
"What do you want to know? You want to know what we do?
Just, please, stay— stay out of this."
I didn't want any of this. I wanted something big, something epic,
something focusing on the horror of the big monsters, the sheer scope of the cosmos beyond our reach,
and the nihilistic implications of being unimportant in the face of seemingly all-powerful things
that can decide our fate on a whim.
For so much of it, it was such an uncomfortable and personal and low-key horror,
a human horror I wasn't really prepared for and was sure I didn't want.
But as I got older and lived a decade of new experiences,
to put it simply, I grew up.
I just sort of realized one day that I was capable of being romantically attracted to men as well as women.
I realized I was different from how I'd even thought of myself.
I'd just sort of naturally seen myself as straight, and even if I didn't think I thought of it this way,
on some primal level, I'd thought of being straight as being "normal."
I didn't know why I thought like that.
It's probably a mix of not really thinking too hard about these things at the time,
combined with the vague notions and expectations our society tends to have towards people's sexuality.
But one day I looked in the mirror, and saw myself as not who I thought I was.
I saw myself as an outsider from me, from the identity I'd assumed for myself,
and then I had a few difficult conversations with troublesome people about those feelings.
I'd always experienced homophobia.
I was an effeminate boy growing up,
but I hadn't really cared, because at the time I'd not really accepted it as an insult,
or seen anything wrong with being called gay by losers in high school
who had just as much growing up to do as I did.
But, when I actually was one of those people and knew it,
all of a sudden, it was a real judgment of who I actually was.
To them, I'd actually become lesser.
Being told I was going to die of AIDS, and that my feelings were unnatural, and so on,
and having to deal with being actually expected to
try to convince people that I wasn't inferior to them,
suddenly made me think about that Cthulhu film I'd seen a few years before.
It was like it knew what I was going through.
It knew how it felt to sit in a room you just can't leave, and have a piece of your personhood interrogated.
It knew how it felt to be seen as an outsider,
and it knew how it felt to connect with someone who understands and accepts you.
Somehow, it knew me and how I'd felt, before I'd ever had a chance to.
Some of the scenes from this film just kept coming back up in my mind.
It hadn't been what I'd thought I'd wanted,
but what it *was* struck a chord with me anyway, on a level I didn't know was there.
It just took a while for me to hear the chiming.
It turns out that some of the greatest horrors, biggest sources of sadness in our lives,
don't come from scope or big questions, but from the tiniest things.
If you've ever lost a loved one and had to be involved with the arrangements of their funeral,
or if you've ever had to be around someone you've made an effort to cut out of your life because of something abusive they'd done to you,
or even something as simple as being reminded, gently,
that you're in a place where everyone regards you with suspicion, that you're an outsider to them—
You'll already know that the idea of a powerful cosmic monster out there somewhere beneath the sea
can actually be the least of a person's problems.
The film was, in retrospect, a meaningful and valuable work that paid respect to the source material's themes and emotions
in ways I hadn't grasped as a cynical kid who thought he knew he was straight, and thought he knew what made Lovecraft good.
And I just wasn't ready to appreciate the value of that kind of story at the time.
Here's a review from back in 2009 on the film's Amazon page by someone called Giles. Giles writes:
[READING REVIEW]
"I can't stress how bad this film is on every level. As for H.P. Lovecraft,
he must be spinning in his grave, 'cos this is definitely the worst film adaptation yet.
It is vaguely based on Shadow Over Innsmouth,
but the story— what there is of it— is so badly constructed
that you could easily miss the very few similarities."
Now, here's the thing about Giles from 2009.
*I* was Giles in 2009.
No, I'm fairly certain I didn't write this exact Amazon review, but I felt the same way as this person at around the same time.
It didn't make sense to the teenage me, whose main frame of reference on the world was the horror stories he'd read.
But then I grew up, and it started making a lot more sense without me even having to go back and see the film again.
This film and its delayed effect on me
got me thinking about what works about Lovecraft stories, what doesn't,
and what the best way might be to navigate these qualities in creating an adaptation.
And along the way, with a lot of encouragement, and if it's not too awkward,
we'll maybe talk about the fact that a writer who basically founded a sub-genre of fiction,
has been hugely influential, and made so many people want to become writers, including myself...
was really, massively racist.
♪♪
Anyway, let's start at the beginning, shall we?
Why do humans create and tell each other stories?
Yeah, I'm sure we can settle that real quick. We've only been asking that question for millennia.
I can solve that! I've got a plaque for surpassing over 100,000 YouTube subscribers.
Firstly, we should acknowledge that fiction isn't simply the opposite of truth.
It is, in some sense, a reflection *of* truth.
Let's look at horror stories. When a ghost story speaks of a place being "haunted" by the past,
it speaks to us about the ways that really does happen, the ways the world controls and decides things for us, and how the legacy,
the result of other people's decisions, are still here with us, even after the people who made them are gone.
The ghosts of the past really do haunt the present they built.
Vampires, similarly, tend to be impactful because they reflect some true aspect of the society that was writing about them at the time.
There's a reason Dracula was a count.
Vampires are aristocratic, upper-class beings
that live by parasitically consuming the essence of the poor workers
and exploiting people using their influence; either their literal riches, or their other, less tangible powers.
And in doing this, they literalise a very real but much more vague social antagonism.
The aristocracies, monarchies, and other rich and powerful figures over history rarely actually drink people's blood for sustenance—
although the way the current economy is going, who knows—
But the rich really are vampires, in a sense.
They really do profit and thrive from the work and sacrifice of those beneath them.
It's not unimaginable that consciousness of this kind of antagonism makes its way into folklore
as creatures that are only slightly more exaggerated forms of the actual power relationships between rich and poor people, or boss and worker.
Bram Stoker? More like...
"Gramsci" Stoker.
Uhhh...
Doesn't really work, does it?
Um, is there a better Marxist thinker who would work here as a pun?
Let me know in the comments, so I can feel like an idiot for missing it.
When you're reading Dracula,
you're not just reading a creative horror about a scary monster.
You're reading a story that most people, on some level, understand.
It's relevant to the world people live in, where a non-magical version of Dracula's immense influence
and theft of livelihood from ordinary people really does happen.
Notably, even Karl Marx repeatedly used vampirism as a way of describing the nature of capitalism in Das Kapital.
Look, my point here isn't that vampire stories are all secretly about how capitalism is bad or something.
That would be ridiculous.
And so many of them were written before the actual, proper invention of capitalism as we know it today.
My point is that...
it was a way of talking about issues that functioned so well,
that when the time came to actually talk about things like capitalism,
the guy who started talking about it used vampires as a way of talking about it,
which usually means that the stories were onto something that was kind of like, real, something that was there.
It's also notable that Fifty Shades of Grey, originally a fanfiction based on Twilight,
kinda does this too.
It takes out all the major supernatural aspects of Twilight,
and of course, the simplest way of bringing the dynamics
between a magical, immortal vampire and a young, innocent teenage girl into the real world
is to reimagine the vampire as a billionaire with immense influence and a very particular sexual taste.
Look, the rich are vampires, basically. I think I've made this point.
The slasher film also embodies this as well.
The killer in slasher stories is an urban, modern creature which expresses modern urban fears—
the fear of what's happening in the neighborhood behind everyone's closed doors,
where they could be getting up to just about anything;
the fear of the effects of modern living on people growing up in it.
Fellow YouTuber Nyx Fears did a really cool video going into the deeper aspects of this in Halloween,
which you can check out linked in the description. It's good, and long, and fun, and please go watch it.
The slasher films are silly and gross,
gory, and often just kind of bad,
but they got popular because they're dealing with something that's real and actually happening.
Okay, that's not actually happening...
in— in real life. Um...
But that's from, like, part eight of a franchise,
and you don't get seven sequels without at least originally having some
resonating cultural...
[EXASPERATED SIGH]
He punches his head into a bin!
You get a perspective shot of it!
It's like you— like, you're looking out of his head as it flies off!
The idea that fiction is not the opposite of facts,
but actually can be more truthful than facts on their own,
is key to what makes storytelling so important.
Art is all lies, all perceptions, always subjective,
always up for further interpretation, and always slanted by the perspectives of its creators,
but art is lies in service to truth.
Bringing all of this back, what of Lovecraft?
What makes his work in particular continue to be remembered alongside Dracula or Halloween,
and act as direct inspiration for yet more creative works?
What truth is hidden within his fiction?
Well, it might be the existential horror.
His works come together to relate a thoroughly nihilistic universe, wholly uncaring about our existence.
And there may well be a truth to that,
but it isn't whether or not human existence actually matters that's central to his work.
It's not quite the idea of that stuff actually being true,
but rather, the direct feeling of being unimportant in the grand scheme of things.
Lovecraft's writing and tropes function, in this regard, a lot like one of the writers who in turn inspired him—
Edgar Allan Poe.
Poe doesn't exactly make people feel good. Rather, he makes them feel sad in a productive way.
It can make people who are prone to those feelings feel less alone,
because they know others have them too.
The Call of Cthulhu doesn't begin by telling you how scary a big monster could be,
or giving you a description of what its tentacles would look like.
It opens with a profound fear of the future, and of what discoveries might lie there.
[READING ONSCREEN QUOTE]
So what mattered wasn't how creative or imaginative his stories got,
but how they related to people's own feelings of unimportance then and now in the actual world.
There's the old joke that a paranoid person, if they were ever to discover the room that the government spied on them from with all the notes on their lives—
they wouldn't actually be any more afraid because of this. They'd feel validated.
They weren't paranoid, they were right.
And through that lens, Lovecraft has a way of feeling completely assured that the world really is out to get you,
and maybe God doesn't care, or hates you, or wants you dead.
You can use special effects to design something scarier than the man himself could ever have imagined,
but that alone isn't actually the thing that's scary about the story.
What's scary is the way these smaller aspects build to create a sense that humans are tiny and powerless creatures,
that the greatest height we can aspire to is a deep and intimate understanding of just how little we understand.
Lovecraft rarely reused his creations between stories, and that's because the creatures he came up with didn't really matter.
They were interchangeable, and the ideas they existed to communicate, with their scope and alienness, was what mattered.
Unfortunately, however, this is where things get a bit hairy and complicated.
One of Lovecraft's most famous quotes goes:
[READING ONSCREEN QUOTE]
And you know what this guy didn't know much about?
People of other races.
Look, we've managed to brush past it, but we do have to talk about Lovecraft's racism,
sexism, anti-Semitism, and the homophobia.
It's happening now.
So, for the folks out there who don't think you can criticize an author's beliefs just because it was a different time
and it happened a hundred years ago,
thanks for watching. Don't forget to like and subscribe. I'll see you next time.
I promise I'll review a game and make some jokes or something in the next one.
Are they gone?
Okay, they're gone.
Right, so it's pop culturally quite well known that Lovecraft was a bit xenophobic,
and I do remember reading some pretty bad stuff.

WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEA—
[SOUND BLACKS OUT]
In his biography of H.P. Lovecraft, fittingly entitled "Against the World, Against Life", Michel Houellebecq writes:
[READING ONSCREEN QUOTE]
[TAPE PAUSING NOISE]
Houellebecq kinda sucks, honestly, and idolizes some of Lovecraft's worst qualities in his biography,
but this quote is helpful in illustrating the specifics of Lovecraft's worldview,
so I'm gonna use it. A stopped clock is right twice a day, I suppose.
[TAPE UNPAUSING NOISE]
Lovecraft seemingly hated society itself,
but he had a deeper and specific dislike for black and Jewish people, along with immigrants.
It's so prevalent in his writing
that even citing multiple examples would kind of diminish how overwhelming and constant it is.
I can't even bring myself to say the name of Lovecraft's cat,
because it's a racial slur.
And despite this obviously completely full schedule
of racism and general hatred for humanity itself,
he also managed to find time to be a raging homophobe.
He claimed not to have even known homosexuality existed until he was in his 30s,
but then he goes on to immediately compare it to being a pederast.
You know, growing up, I always would immediately try to find ways to write off or handwave away the racism.
Y'know, I would say, "well, it was a product of his time."
I never really just sat down & gave myself the opportunity to just say,
God, what a piece of shit.
I mean, honestly, like...
his work meant something to me in a really, like, profound way that no other work has ever really done,
but I fucking think the guy's terrible.
As a side note, Lovecraft's views apparently softened a little bit over time.
In a letter he wrote a month before his death,
he claimed he understood the blindness and defiant ignorance of reactionaries, because he used to be one.
"I know how smugly ignorant I was," he wrote.
He supposedly became a socialist in the last year of his life and supported the New Deal,
and he was married to a Jewish woman for a while,
but it's debatable whether he really developed all that much, and the racism in his work is still unavoidably there.
And this leads us to a very weird and difficult question:
Why are there queer Lovecraft fans?
Why do I exist?
And why do so many people like me exist?
Why is this space a place for a lot of queer and marginalized people in the first place?
Why does his work resonate so well with people who the man himself
would have hated even more than he hated everyone else?
Now... I don't think I'm qualified to answer this question.
I don't actually think anyone really is.
There's probably a lot of different reasons, but...
from what I can gather,
it seems like the answer lies in the specifics of how Lovecraft saw the world, in the place that his approach actually came from.
When Lovecraft was three years old, his father had a breakdown and was committed to a mental hospital.
He died there five years later.
His mother also frequently suffered from similar problems, and later died in the same hospital.
Lovecraft suffered from periods of severe anxiety and depression.
He had to drop out of high school, and often isolated himself for long periods at a time.
He saw himself as a temporary visitor to a strange and unwelcoming world.
This is present even in one of Lovecraft's earliest stories, The Outsider.
The narrator escapes from being trapped within a decaying castle,
but his search for human contact is frustrated when the people he finds run away in horror.
He turns, and sees a detestable and ghoulish creature has entered the room.
To his shock, he realizes he's looking into a mirror.
All of his best works draw into close focus not some generic fear of outsiders,
but the anxieties and fears that come with being an outsider,
of being in a world that doesn't really understand you, and perhaps, of not being fully able to understand yourself.
So, there is a fairly decent reason here why someone might be drawn to these works, even if the author was deeply problematic.
And this appears to have been true to some degree at the time, in a strange way.
Lovecraft was pretty open about the problems he had with homosexuality.
However, several of his closest friends were gay,
including the poets Hart Crane and Samuel Loveman,
and Robert Hayward Barlow, who he worked closely with on numerous stories,
and who Lovecraft made the executor of his literary estate in the event of his death.
It's partially due to Barlow that so much of Lovecraft's writing has been preserved over the years,
given how he wasn't all that popular at the time.
The deeply bigoted belief in a link between homosexuality and pedophilia
is invoked, this time on purpose, in the film as well.
There's a scene in Cthulhu where Russell is arrested on manufactured charges of being a pedophile.
- "You're under arrest for murder, rape of a minor..."
- "Oh, come on... Wait, you ca—"
The event is positioned as an extension of his mistreatment by the rest of the town.
We're seeing the kind of alienation the original stories had to invent a foreign cult to get across,
but translated into actual things people do experience.
"Oh yeah, you like this?! Faggot goes off to jail?!"
The easiness and convenience with which having a different sexual preference is equated with criminality
is something that real people deal with, even today.
For some people, the intellectualized, existential problems Lovecraft had originally written to explore
cease to be theoretical and start to communicate familiar experiences,
the same way Edgar Allan Poe's writing can be to someone who's lost a loved one,
or the way Halloween explores the suburban fear of one's neighbors,
or Dracula puts words to a deeper understanding of the antagonism between different classes in our social hierarchy.
For those who've been treated like this in the name of a religion,
or simply by their surrounding society because of its horrific expectations,
have they not come the closest a person can in the real world
to the central Lovecraftian experience?
Have they not, in a sense, glimpsed the face of an uncaring universe?
VOICE OF GUILLERMO DEL TORO:
"He was a guy that definitely did not get laid much, you know?
And— and a guy that was...
an alien amongst us."
Del Toro still hasn't gotten to make the Mountains of Madness adaptation he wanted to make and I wanted to see,
but what's weird is, as I've grown older and become more interested in stories that are more compelling than Lovecraft's original works,
it seems that Del Toro has as well.
In a recent interview about The Shape of Water, he said:
[READING ONSCREEN QUOTE]
The Shape of Water doesn't have any elements
that would be regarded as traditionally Lovecraftian by purists like Giles or the teenager I used to be,
but its story gets at what I think makes Lovecraft actually work in the first place—
human stories about our alienation from each other and our lonelinesses,
our victimization by forces beyond our control that see us as outside the norm,
and how we can at least partially rectify this by
learning to see the beauty in something previously seen as alien.
In a sense, it's a story about the people of Innsmouth who happily chose to join with the deep ones,
quite literally embracing otherness,
raising children who literally learned to love to be different.
Now, the film's perspectives & plot & texture
make it not really invite much of a comparison with Lovecraft in a straightforward viewing,
but maybe that's proof of how good it is.
The Shape of Water has so successfully excavated all the garbage away from its spiritual predecessor that,
despite depicting something that directly happened in a story Del Toro has definitely read,
the comparison still feels strange, wrong almost.
This film captures the beautiful, human, mesmerizing center of Lovecraft's writing.
It's the kind of story he could, or perhaps should, have been writing all along.
For me, there's something personally wonderful about finally really coming to an understanding of a film
that touched me in ways I didn't realize and that never really got much recognition,
right as a film that understands this just as well gets released and actually gets major recognition, and even wins an Oscar.
[GUILLERMO DEL TORO SPEAKING ONSCREEN QUOTE]
[APPLAUSE]
While it's easy, and correct, to be dubious about the value of winning an Oscar,
I do think the success of a film like this is a really hopeful sign for the future of how people see that which is alien to them.
There's a philosopher named Julia Kristeva, whose work was pretty formative for me.
I discovered her through her being quoted in a series of critical essays on Lovecraft,
one by Gina Wisker, entitled "Spawn of the Pit".
The quote went:
[READING ONSCREEN QUOTE]
Why be alien to each other, when we are all alien to ourselves?
So, what have we learned about how to adapt Lovecraft?
Well, I think there's a point here about how we have to decide what really makes his work good in the first place,
what the core truths in his work are that ought to survive into a future they inspire.
An adaptation— to me, at least— only needs fidelity to what really matters about the text,
and neglecting to bring across other aspects, like the finer points of its philosophy,
or its particular linguistic flourishes, or certain characters, or even its racism or homophobia,
isn't a failure to be fully faithful to the original work.
It's demonstrating a successful understanding of why those stories were worth reading about in the first place, in spite of those flaws.
In focusing on a person's experiences and treatment for their sexuality,
or on a relationship with someone seen by others as an alien outsider,
these works explore the originals and their feelings of otherness better than Lovecraft did.
You don't have to go find a copy of this 10 year old obscure film if you don't want to.
It's not perfect by any means, and lots of the criticism the film's received is valid.
Even the director's commentary opens by admitting they aren't fully happy with the film.
VOICE OF "CTHULHU" DIRECTOR DANIEL GILDARK:
"There are 85 locations in this movie. Ridiculous."
It's certainly nowhere near as good as the best film ever—
Gremlins 2—
but it meant something to me and was very important to me in a formative period of my life,
and sometimes that's kind of more important than the writing or execution.
As I look out into the internet and find many other queer fans of Lovecraft's work,
and writers in some form inspired by these feelings themselves,
the wealth of literature exploring this side of his writing,
and films taking up radically humanizing perspectives even towards that which might literally be considered monstrous,
I can't help but feel that there's a side of Lovecraft's work the man himself died unable to fully comprehend.
And in a way, that's fitting, isn't it?
But there's one other great story inspired at least partially by elements of Lovecraft,
and I'm going to talk about it soon on my channel.
Join me in the future, when I reveal spectacularly why I filmed segments for this video at night in the woods.
Oh, I just kind of gave it away then, didn't I?
♪♪
Hey, thanks for watching, everybody. This one was quite hard to make, for reasons that are probably obvious.
I'm supported by all these lovely people over on Patreon.
Backers get videos a few days early, and also get to make suggestions on changes before the other version goes out,
and they get some bonus extra videos every now and then.
I still need to finish one about the making of the CTRL-ALT-DEL video,
but there's just so much footage to cut together; I'm basically making a little documentary about making this silly YouTube video.
Oh, and since I don't do readings of the credits outside of longer videos,
I'm trying a new thing where I stream myself to $10 backers doing editing, and take live suggestions and show off my, sort of, process.
Last night I did a three hour stream of me making changes to this video,
so thanks to Mallow, who was in the chat and gave me the idea of pointing out that Houellebecq sucks.
I wasn't sure if I should do it,
so it was nice getting the input that I probably ought to.
And thanks to everyone else, who singled out other changes and fixes to mistakes I can now pretend were never made at all.
I'd also like to say a special thank you
to the over 100 people who reached out to me when I asked on Twitter for LGBT fans of Lovecraft to get in touch a few months ago.
Your notes and contributions were really great, and helped me think a lot about this topic, and helped me...
ascertain that it wasn't all just me, that I wasn't imagining all of this, that other people felt this way.
You were all really helpful and lovely, and this video wouldn't exist without your kindness and support.
I hope everyone had a happy Pride Month, not that you have to stop being proud now, y'know?
By all means, please continue.
I'm going to, uh, go back into my hole
and feel sorry for myself for another 11 months,
but, uh... you do whatever makes you feel good.

Today on Serious Lore Analysis, we're covering a creative work
that I heavily implied might have been coming next in the last few videos!
And that's right, today we're covering...
the CTRL+ALT+DEL webcomic & animated series.
In retrospect, I think I might have made it too obvious.
For those of you too young to remember the early days of the world,
before we had the internet and hadn't yet achieved the dream of having to argue with Holocaust deniers all day,
humans would amuse themselves by painting stuff on the walls of their caves, or later, drawing it onto paper or canvas.
These scribbles became known as
[PAINFULLY ELONGATED]
"aaaaaaaaaarrrrrrt."
Eventually, however, humans evolved past this bullshit
and realized you could divide up your space into smaller sub-spaces, called
"pah-nells",
and then use that to create several sequential images
which, when read in order, could tell a story.
This "sequence art" later became known as "comics",
for reasons we forgot because it doesn't matter.
Fast forward to the late 90s and early 2000s, where we played video games and things were finally good.
Then, people who enjoyed video games gained access to the internet.
But because they didn't yet have the bandwidth to play most games online
or watch puppy compilations all day and argue in the comments about 9/11,
people instead would amuse themselves online by using "webcomics",
also known as digital versions of comics that you find on the web.
And since the bar for publishing onto the internet was as low as being able to afford server hosting,
or even lower if you used a free website,
people were finally free to create comics for as small or niche an audience as they liked
without any need for mass market appeal, or the production costs of ink and paper and printing,
or, um... quality.
Enter the gaming webcomic, a form of webcomic centering around jokes about games and gaming culture.
The most popular of these was Penny Arcade, a comic still going to this day,
rife with hilarious and well thought out humour.
"Don't stake me bro"? Ha ha ha, hilarious!
It's just like the thing! With the guy!
The bedrock of this type of comic tends to feature several characters, often representative of the authors,
sitting on a couch making hilarious jokes about video games that are out right now,
or inside the fiction of a video game, interacting with it to hilarious consequences.
These two forms were the bedrock of many early gaming webcomics from the late 90s to the early 2000s,
and there were many successful comics using this format,
like Penny Arcade, PvP, Little Gamers, Bob and George, 8-Bit Theater, and others.
All tremendous pieces of art with a lot to say about games and how bad it is that our games are being usurped by money men,
and how funny it would be if you died... in a way a lot bi— uh, like— it's just like in the game!
But for every one of these comics,
there were dozens of poor imitators out to replicate their popularity and profit by reusing the same tropes.
An explosion in the gaming webcomic had begun, and it would continue for over a decade.
Enter Tim Buckley with his own webcomic, CTRL+ALT+DEL, often referred to as CAD.
CAD isn't like the other webcomics. It's not art. It doesn't have value or meaning.
It's trash, and it doesn't say anything at all.
It's full of worthless jokes where the punchline is violence.
It's not like Penny Arcade.
CAD is the "story" of Ethan,
a character who looks suspiciously like how Buckley draws himself.
Ethan and his roommate Lucas talk about video games, and occasionally are inside the games,
where something bad happens to them or people they don't like.
Wow, that's original.
Let's compare and contrast this with a good comic, shall we?
In this 2002 page from Penny Arcade, the author insert characters burn a voodoo doll, hurting George Romero.
Oh my God, look how much better these guys are. This is great!
Meanwhile, look over here at CAD in the slow lane for idiots.
Using violence as a punchline?
What a stupid thing to put in a comic!
Over time, CAD stopped even trying to tell jokes, and it started spending more and more time
exploring the personal lives and development of its characters.
The main characters Ethan & Lucas went on dates, moved apartments, made and lost friends, and started long-term relationships.
Ethan quickly meets and begins dating Lilah, a girl who plays video games,
which, as we all know, is like finding a unicorn.
And, like all girls who do play games, it's her only character trait.
The two inexplicably fall in love, even though Ethan has nothing to offer anyone and is basically unlikable.
It's pretty clear from reading this that Buckley doesn't know how human relationships work.
You could almost point out that this... almost says something
about how people who play video games a lot view human relationships, but...
N-No, no, no, no, it's bad, and it doesn't mean anything.
Tim Buckley's just really bad at making comics.
Oh, also, despite being basically unable to do anything but play video games,
Ethan eventually builds a sentient AI robot who becomes the fourth main character.
Zeke exists to occasionally joke about how humans are made of meat and bad, and he's better than them.
It's clearly inspired by characters like HK-47 from KOTOR or Bender from Futurama, but there's no actual jokes here.
It's what I like to call a joke by association. It's not really a joke,
it's just a vague gesture in the direction of a joke that you might remember from somewhere else.
Somewhere else...
I'm s— I'm somewhere— somewhere else...? I...
(static)
(panting)
Why are you doing this?
Don't do this to yourself.
Don't become one of them.
One of what?
(breathes heavily)
(groans)
The worst thing about this comic is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.
No, wait. Actually, the worst thing is CAD Premium.
For a few years, you could pay a monthly fee to get access to episodes of the CAD animated series,
which the comic inexplicably had.
It ran for two seasons, and some episodes ran up to 6 minutes.
If you thought a story featuring cartoon violence, a futuristic killer robot, video game opinions on a couch,
and awkward boring serious relationship drama had trouble finding its identity in comic form,
just wait until it comes in a box set containing barely two hours of animation made in about a week
that you paid thirty-five entire dollars of your actual human money for!
Three episodes of the 12-episode first season are dedicated entirely to an extended Star Wars reference.
They reenact an entire Star Wars film in each five-minute episode,
compressing it down so much you'd barely even realize that's what they're doing
unless you listen to the director's commentary track,
which this show has, for some reason!
The villain, instead of Darth Vader, is Jack Thompson,
a lawyer who tried to sue game developers for making their players violent.
The Death Star is a sign that makes people stop playing video games...?
"It's time to test the power of this fully operational anti-gamer billboard."
Speaking of Jack Thompson, Thompson appeared to have struck a nerve with Buckley.
One page of the comic is straight-up an open letter to Jack,
a four panel long mini-novel spoken directly by Buckley himself from within the comic.
What's amazing about it is how it manages to, while claiming gamers are peaceful even though they've played a lot of violent games,
end with the threatening phrase, "don't fuck with us."
Which, by the way, is also a line from that scene in Fight Club
where they threaten to cut off a guy's testicles if he defies them.
"Do not fuck with us."
Imagine writing something like that and thinking, "Yeah!
That proves that gamers are peaceful and intelligent, and can be reasoned with!"
It almost says something about gamers when people sit down and write things like—
(static)
Where's that fucking noise coming from?! Where's—
[EERIE DISTORTION]
[DISTORTION GROWS LOUDER]
Don't you think you might be reading a little too much into it?
About what a bad comic that sucks might "say"?
Stick to thinking about real art.
Ugh, this is just like that Sonic thing, isn't it?
What... the Sonic thing?
You're overthinking a blue hedgehog, man. Why can't you be objective?
Why can't you talk about the level design and mechanics instead?
You could be talking about how Mario 1-1 teaches you how to play it.
But it's not just a hedgehog, is it? I mean, it's animals, fighting a developed machine empire.
Like, there's— There's very, very obvious themes going on here, a discussion of ecology versus technology—
OMINOUS FIGURE: If you want to talk about how great nature is and how bad technology is,
why don't you go live in the woods?
You wouldn't do that, though, would you? You wouldn't have your precious lattes to drink
while you complain on your iPhone about capitalism.
I don't drink lattes! What the fuck are you talking about?
By now, you've probably noticed a fairly strong contradiction in the comic
between the crass, random non-canon of the many parts intended purely for no-strings-attached comedy,
the serious parts where Buckley himself definitely doesn't personally threaten someone,
and the actual serious lives of the main characters who have problems that don't go away.
The comic keeps reverberating back and forth, going to further and further extremes.
Sometimes you'd get a story where Lucas goes on a date with a woman who turns out to be fat,
so he awkwardly pretends to be interested for, er, "hilarious" "comedy",
and then they go back to her place, and it turns out she was only pretending to be fat as a test,
and they start a relationship that lasts for five years of the comic.
Then you'd get a chef character saying nonsense for a joke,
and then something random happens,
or maybe you'd get the Players,
four characters whose whole deal is they murder each other in different ways over & over.
Then it turns out Ethan's girlfriend is pregnant.
Then they joke about "what if the guns in the new Gears of War game
were guns with trains instead of chainsaws?"
You snap back and forth so quickly, you get whiplash of the mind.
The tension between the comic's supposed reality and meaningless comic fantasy world eventually snapped when,
during a scene at Ethan's job where he's making a joke about consumers being stupid and not knowing as much about games as him,
he gets a phone call.
Lilah, the comedy video game girlfriend character, is in the hospital...
because she's had a miscarriage.
This culminates in perhaps the most well known page of a comic in history.
[MUSIC DRAMATICALLY SWELLS]
When asked by a noted art scholar the appropriate distance from which to stand when viewing his magnum opus,
plainly entitled "Loss",
Tim Buckley famously responded,
"What? Fuck you,"
and banned me from his forum.
The release of "Loss" profoundly shook the edifice of its audience.
People were equal parts shocked, horrified, surprised,
offended, and completely mystified.
The semi-serious but still mostly jokey plot parts of the story are utterly shattered, giving way to a harsh and cold reality
where characters who, in other contexts, have committed or received tremendous acts of violence
are suddenly capable of a genuine moment of horrific suffering.
A comic famous for using too many words to say nothing at all about a video game on a stationary couch
takes four panels and zero words to show a horrifying discovery and a trip through an entire hospital.
A gaming webcomic— a comedy gaming webcomic—
has an arc in it about the characters having to deal with the miscarriage of their child!
This comic struck a nerve on the internet.
Over nine years later, people are still making fun of it.
This comic has been parodied and referenced in memes an uncountable amount of times.
Entire web pages have been dedicated to tracking them all, and failed to contain them.
In the next two comics, the characters struggle to even react to what has happened.
[READING FROM COMIC]
"It's breaking my heart to watch her hurt like this."
The next comic is a joke about how there aren't enough dragons in Dungeons and Dragons anymore.
The next comic is a single panel of the four Players about to murder each other.
For the next little while, the comic switched between dumb video game jokes
and Buckley trying desperately to restore the comfortable, consequence-free tone
he had developed over the five years of the comic.
It takes at least eight pages
before Ethan can go back to making goggles out of pineapples.
By late November, the characters have fully patched up their problems and they get married,
and we get tearful speeches about how important these characters are to each other.
FEMALE VOICE, MELODRAMATIC:
"Life dropped an epic husband,
the rarest of its loot table,
and I was lucky enough to win the need roll."
[WEDDING BELLS, APPLAUSE]
Then, for about four years, the comic was basically standalone silly jokes
interspersed with bits where there were mini-comics set in a universe like Star Wars for some reason.
One could say that, with the advent of "Loss", a lesson had been learned:
don't put one of the most emotionally traumatizing events a human can experience
in your...
comedy gaming webcomic!
Then, in September 2012,
Ethan tried to build a time machine,
and a future version of Ethan comes through it and kidnaps him into the future.
The next two months of comics were an extended storyline in which it turns out that Ethan's actions destroy most of humanity,
as the robot he builds eventually goes insane & murders everyone he loves, and takes over the world.
But in the process, the time machine is damaged and threatens to destroy all of time.
So Ethan has to sacrifice himself to turn the machine off,
killing him and saving the future,
as his inner monologue makes a tearful goodbye to a character no one really cares about
because she's basically just written to be a love interest for the author stand-in.
Ethan, our main character, dies.
He dies in the most convoluted fashion possible, and no one ever learns what happened.
Now that's how you end a...
Except it didn't end. It's still been going for five more years,
but with just the self-contained sketches and the characters from the old version in a rebooted form.
The comic somehow continues to limp on.
It literally killed its main character, and then it just sort of started again.
So, that...
that was CAD!
CAD was mean-spirited, hateful and angry.
CAD was a... a judgmental, tone-deaf, self-righteous screed of a webcomic, and...
Wait.

[THEME MUSIC STUTTERING]
Tommy Wiseau's infamous film The Room asks some really interesting questions about how we look at art.
No, seriously! Come on! STAY WITH ME HERE...!!
In terms of pure filmmaking skill, of course, it's awful.
The script is a nightmare, it's poorly edited,
with random shots of San Francisco just kinda slammed in there,
it has such below average shot composition and mise en scène that I actually feel bad for even saying those words,
and the ADR is terrible, too.
"Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?"
"Oh, hi, Johnny. I didn't know it was you."
- "Here you go."
- "That's me."
- "How much is it?"
- "It'll be $18."
- "Here you go, keep the change. Hi, doggy."
- "You're my favorite customer."
"Thanks a lot. Bye!"
It has a reputation for being a hilariously bad film everyone can laugh at for being bad...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is a bad movie!
[LAUGHTER]
...made even more interesting by the incredibly weird performance of Wiseau.
"I'm fed up with this world!"
But I think, under the proper lens, the film has a little more to say to its audience
than "look at me, I'm so bad."
Tommy Wiseau didn't write a film about a perfect guy
who gets cheated on by his girlfriend and basically has his life ruined for no reason,
and he didn't choose to play that perfect guy for no reason either.
And here, taking a particular critical look,
I think a valuable message can be learned from the film.
The film has often been criticized in terms of its base components, like writing or acting.
Lisa, for example, behaves completely irrationally or perhaps with deliberate malice towards Johnny...
"I have him wrapped around my little finger."
- "Well, you should be happy, then."
- "But I don't love him."
...suddenly falling out of love with him and cheating on him,
and then spreading lies about him for seemingly no reason.
"You're lying, I never hit you!"
- "You are tearing me apart, Lisa!"
- "Why are you so hysterical?"
I contend here that Wiseau based the play script that would later become the film on an actual life experience,
an actual breakup that really happened at some point in his life.
"I treat you like a princess, and you stab me in the back.
I love you, and I did anything for you to just please you,
and now you betray me! How could you love him?!"
[SCREAMS]
I'm not saying the events happened exactly as Tommy writes them;
in fact, they definitely didn't.
Obviously, Tommy didn't kill himself,
and obviously, women don't grow distant from the people they're in a relationship with for no reason.
"Women change their minds all the time."
The Room is a fictionalized, exaggerated representation
of what Tommy *thinks* happened in this real relationship,
being completely, perhaps even incoherently, honest about why he thinks it fell apart.
And it's clear that he thinks it fell apart because his girlfriend started acting weird and crazy and trying to hurt him.
What's important here is to understand that, to Tommy, this is genuinely how he views this woman.
This character is, to him, an honest expression of that person.
But there has to have been a real Lisa once,
and her perspective— her side of the story— isn't told.
We don't get to see the things Tommy did that led her to move on from him or cheat on him,
and we only have Tommy's word that he wasn't abusive and was a really good guy.
And maybe the fact he genuinely thought to depict this woman as a monster trying to ruin his life
says something about how he understands other people and their feelings.
The Room, precisely with its unrealistic, biased inaccuracy,
accurately depicts why breakups actually happen;
people don't fully understand how the other person feels and begin to think of them as malicious figures,
because that's the only way we can make sense of people when we don't fully understand them.
I've talked to plenty of guys about breakups, and very often you get the same old story just like this one,
where their partner turned out to be a crazy bitch who just wanted to hurt them.
But if you're ever lucky enough to hear the other side of a story like that,
they're often just frustrated with people who can so easily view them like that if they have a few arguments.
Wiseau tried to make a film about his breakup,
but it turned out to be a film about his inability to understand why it happened.
No... No... No...
The Room is a filmed version of the real, heavily distorted perspective on breakups that many heterosexual men often have.
And in many ways, when you look at the film this way,
it serves as a call to action to learn to see past the Lisas we think we see,
and understand that relationships tend to fall apart for a reason, and we can learn to do better by seeing people for who they are.
For all its actual flaws, and even because of some of its clearly deeply flawed misogynistic writing,
The Room ends up being an actually valuable demonstration of the distorted ways people perceive relationships,
and how this eventually destroys them,
better than any film made by, say, I dunno,
any man actually working in Hollywood right now,
especially the ones currently cashing in on the popularity of The Room.

[FADES OUT]
As you might be aware,
EA recently closed Visceral Games,
the studio working on a Star Wars game that had been in the works for a long time,
being worked on by, among many others,
the director and writer of most of the Uncharted games,
but also one of the best written game series ever— Legacy of Kain—
and pivoting the entire game away from what was being made.
This update posted on EA's website by Patrick Söderlund, vice president of EA, cites
"fundamental shifts in the marketplace."
Single-player linear experiences simply aren't profitable enough,
at least compared to certain other recent kinds of experience that emphasize time investment
and incentivize further transactions made over the course of a single product, rather than a simple one-off purchase.
This is one of many management decisions that exists in a marketplace driven by the forces inherent to a capitalist society.
The decision is, sadly, the result of the overall company goal to continue to grow and satisfy investors,
and this practice trumps creative freedom or what games players might actually want to see.
Penny Arcade covered this story by featuring one of the two main characters, a stand-in for the author,
directly, personally calling Patrick Söderlund an incoherent, art destroying monster.
[READING FROM COMIC]
"Literally the only thing I know about you is that you destroy things."
"Jobs, art, I mean, where should I even start?"
"What you did is bad for games, bad for gamers, and trying to frame it as anything but cowardice is offensive."
Penny Arcade is consistently cited as far better than CAD,
because CAD's just a bunch of nonsensical rants, and it keeps just using violence as a punch—
No, wait, this is Penny Arcade's violence! How did this get in here? This is obviously hilarious!
Oh my God, he was killed by a gun!
[FORCED LAUGHTER]
Here's to another two decades of comedy gold
and insightful commentary
ON THE FUTURE OF GAMING.
Penny Arcade got so popular and influential on the back of this stuff
that its convention, PAX, is one of the biggest industry events of the year,
with even major companies showing off games there.
CAD also had a convention of its own for a couple of years, labeled Digital Overload.
And, I hesitate to admit,
things don't get popular enough to have an entire convention
without being at least partially accurate reflections of their audience.
"CTRL+ALT+DEL kicks ass."
"I think it's awesome, I've been reading it for a while,
and it incorporates a lot of the best things in life, as well as being hilarious."
"Tim Buckley is a genius. Period."
I hope the problem here is clear.
Even the most intelligent, well-paid, popular,
and, uh, verbose
writers gaming culture has to offer seem unaware that these decisions are not made in a vacuum,
that games are threatened not by a secretive anti-art coward,
but by an environment that systematically crushes most of the people who work on them
in order to make its owners and shareholders vastly rich,
and which has no interest in anything's intrinsic value.
Gaming culture is largely unable to conceive of this level of socio-economic criticism,
of analysis of systemic problems and wider issues with society beyond one person's individual failings,
and therefore cannot accurately fathom exactly what is damaging the things they love.
Instead, they have to fantasize about their very own Lisa hiding somewhere in EA,
trying to kill art like some kind of fucking Disney villain!
- [EVIL LAUGHTER]
- *This* is why people hate CAD so much.
Not because it's bad, no. Bad things come and go all day, every day.
CAD is such a source of focus and aggression,
with millions and millions of words written about how awful it and its creator is,
because it's an embarrassment.
It makes everyone else near it look bad,
because as bad as it is, it managed to be honest.
So people have to try as hard as they can to project these things away from them,
try to shift the blame onto Buckley himself and away from the fact they share a lot of the same perspectives.
Think again about that Jack Thompson comic.
No one just ends up in a position where they'll write something like this all on their own.
Jack Thompson, wrong and dishonest as he was,
received thousands of death threats and messages full of harassment for years
from people just like Tim, or people who had been influenced by this comic.
No, CAD is merely a particularly silly and vulgar expression of a broader set of bad ideas
that continue to go largely unexamined by the people who hold them.
Tim Buckley's disjointed personal philosophy and lack of skill didn't come from nowhere.
We don't get to pretend he's just some random guy.
Blaming one man for the flaws of a broken economic system is making the same mistake
as blaming Tim Buckley for accurately presenting the culture in which he exists.
We just have to learn to accept that there might be a lesson in things we hate about us,
that even if it's bad and we don't like it,
we have more in common with it than we want to admit, and can even learn something from it.
CAD turned out to be reflective of the cultural reality that produced it,
and people are only angry at it this much because they don't like what they saw in the mirror.
(OMINOUS MUSIC)
When we look at ridiculous behavior within our sphere,
instead of trying to project it out of ourselves,
and say it's just some random idiot somewhere doing something dumb,
maybe we should accept that CAD, Penny Arcade, Visceral Games and even EA's business decisions
are aspects of a wider culture that can be reflective of our own feelings and beliefs and values,
even if we don't like what comes out of them.
And maybe if we learn to criticize ourselves and change our own behavior,
we can start to change the wider culture.

[HBOMB] Hey, how's it going?
Let's talk about what it's like
eating tons of soy
for two months.
[dramatic music]
First, I should probably
give you some background
on what I normally eat.
Um, basically whatever.
Like, whatever I feel
like eating at the time
or when I'm hungry.
So I'm not the most unhealthy
of people.
I tend to fluctuate between 11
and 12 stone,
which is, like, 160
to 180 pounds.
I think I've got that right.
Might be 150 to 170.
I don't know.
We don't do pounds here.
So sometimes I'll eat, like,
really healthily
for a couple days
and sometimes I'll eat, like,
a full, like,
bag of Doritos for a meal,
and sometimes
I'll eat one really,
really big meal a day
and nothing else.
So, uh, my metabolism
is apparently really good
'cause it's compensated
pretty well for the fact
that I'm not very good
at this whole food thing.
[jazz piano music]
♪ ♪
Back when I was an IT engineer,
I tried to get really healthy
for a while.
I basically ate nothing
but fruits
and a couple
of specific vegetables,
uh, like, uh, peppers,
kidney beans,
and just--lentils and spinach,
and that was about it.
That was just all I ate for--
for, like,
every meal of the day,
and I got super healthy
for a while.
I lost tons of weight,
I felt really good,
and then I went out for fish
and chips with some friends,
like, once,
and as soon as I got home,
I immediately had to have a nap
for, like, two hours,
and I realized that what
I was doing was I was being so,
like, rigid in exactly what
I was eating that I was training
my body to be unprepared
for anything remotely fatty
or sugary
and it just messed with me,
so I kinda started
eating normally afterwards
and sort of lived in fear
of going on any kinds
of diet of any kind afterwards,
and apart from whatever amounts
of soy that you get
in normal people food,
uh, I haven't intentionally
eaten anything soy-based
for most of my life.
Uh, I've never really eaten
anything vegany or tofuy before.
When I was about 22,
I went in to get a blood test
because I was really worried
about testosterone stuff
at the time
and my results came back really
high for both T and DHT,
and, uh, that's actually why,
you--you know,
I'm gonna go bald in the next,
uh, 12 to 15 minutes,
because, uh, that's what having
high testosterone can do
although it's disputable, uh,
but I like to think that's why.
I love bringing this up.
You know,
compared to me,
like, 78%
of the human male population
are low-T betas,
and yet I look like this.
It's almost as if endocrinology
is a little bit more complicated
than what Davis Aurini
and his science advisor
looked up on the Internet
in five minutes.
Speaking of Davis,
he actually left a comment
on the last video that I want
to read out now.
Imagine being
almost 40 years old--
like, that close
to the halfway point
of the cosmic human miracle
that is your life--
the one that you get--
and spending it arguing
in the comments
of YouTube videos
on the Internet.
I wanna feel sorry for Davis,
but it's just too funny.
Actually, hold on one sec.
I'm gonna check it's not,
like, a parody account
or something.
[rustling and clicking]
Yeah, it's real.
[chuckles]
The fact I had to check to see
that that was just a parody
of Davis probably says quite
a lot.
You know, when I came up
with that character
that was sort of making fun
of people like him
but especially him, eh,
a couple years ago,
and he's running around
with a sword,
I thought,
"That's a bit much.
They're not that silly."
But, no,
as of two months ago,
I checked Davis' channel
and there he is looking like
a slightly microwaved Cypher
from "The Matrix" reviewing
a sword that he bought online
for, like, $500.
[intense music]
Oh, yeah, I bet I look
so badass right now.
[chuckles]
Do you want some cantaloupe?
I--I cut up a lot
of melons making this video.
[laughing]
Hi, Davis, by the way.
I know you're gonna watch this
so, uh, maybe leave
a better complaint
in the comments this time.
[chuckles]
That said,
the testosterone results
I got were years ago now.
I was maybe thinking of getting,
like, a before and after test,
uh, when I was doing
this experiment,
but doctors are really,
really busy now,
especially thanks
to the policies
that people like Paul voted for,
and I didn't wanna waste more
of their time
to get extra research done
on a YouTube video.
That felt kinda disrespectful
of their time.
So for the Soy Boy Diet,
I basically took everything
that was meat,
eggs, or dairy and replaced it
with some kind of,
uh, soy-based equivalent.
So I had a lot
of Soysages,
a lot of soygers--
that's not a real thing.
[Paul McCartney slowly playing]
♪ Hope for the future ♪
[HBOMB] And tons of soy milk.
I don't actually drink
that much milk normally.
I think milk's rubbish,
but in coffee, I have milk,
so I replaced that
with soy milk.
It tasted really nice,
by the way.
That was the first thing
I noticed.
Soy milk has a really, like,
nice taste to it.
I avoided all
the vegetarian foods
that are made
of stuff like corn.
Uh, corn food is, like, uh,
some kind of fungus
and also egg albumin, uh,
that's been cultivated
a certain way.
Apparently it tastes good
but it sounds awful
and there's no soy in it,
to my knowledge,
so I--I ignored all of that.
I also obviously just ate,
you know,
regular tofu that I'd bought
and cooked different ways.
The initial barrier to tofu,
by the way, is taste.
Tofu in its nascent state
is tasteless,
smells a little bit weird,
and wet.
You have to drain it
or press it
to get all of the water out.
You have to put in
a lot more effort
just to get an actual taste
out of it.
However, people usually use that
as a way of comparing it
to meat and showing
that it's less good,
but actually after doing
some looking
into this over the course
of this stuff,
I've realized that that's not
quite a fair comparison.
Like, all the meat that you buy
in a store has been flavored
or processed in some way
to give it a sense of taste.
You can't just cut
a bacon-sized slice off
a pig and fry it.
That will probably
not taste that great.
Anything that's been processed
or cured,
that's what you're tasting
in the meat when you eat it.
You're not actually just,
you know--
there isn't a nascent good taste
to animals,
it turns out.
We have to make
it taste all right.
With the Soysages,
the first thing I noticed
was that they
were incredibly similar
to regular sausages because
the actual meat wasn't
the thing you were tasting
in sausages.
You were--you were actually
tasting all of the--
the fun herbs and stuff
that had been mixed in with it.
Uh, and that stuff
tastes nice even when
there's no actual meat involved,
it turns out,
so I had a pretty okay time
on this.
Uh, something I got
really into eating right away
was I would just cut up
some tofu
and microwave it with these,
um, chili kidney beans
that you can buy
at the Co-op,
and I would just eat that
for a meal
and it was really quick to make,
and also it was really,
really filling.
Um, so I had a good time
with that.
I wouldn't cook that
for someone else, though.
That's, you know--
that'd be rubbish, but, uh,
I got into eating tons
of that right away because
it was so quick and simple
and it satisfied
the tofu requirements
for this diet.
I mostly stuck
to it pretty fine.
Uh, I had a couple
of times where
I broke it on purpose because
I was eating with, like,
family for Christmas
or New Years,
and I couldn't be bothered to,
like, bring a soy chicken
to Christmas dinner.
[MAN] Yeah. Yeah.
[squeaks]
[clattering]
[HBOMB] Actually I think
the most disturbing thing
about my family
was how when I told them about
this thing they were like,
"Yeah, that's--that's something
he would do."
Like, my family have come
to expect this sort
of thing from me and...
[upbeat music]
It's a little bit worrying,
to be honest.
My initial starting weight
was 13 stone and one pound
but that was while I
was carrying a Canon C100
with a 24-105 millimeter lens,
which is actually pretty hefty,
but I really wanted to do
the shot where I
was looking at the scale
while I was weighing myself.
This is my mother's bathroom,
by the way.
I don't own a scale.
What am I,
a functioning adult?
To get my actual weight,
I decided to just weigh
my camera
again on the same scale.
Oh.
Which didn't work because
it's not heavy enough.
So I weighed it on
a kitchen scale.
All right.
2,543 grams.
That's 5.6 pounds.
183 take away 5.6
is 177.4 pounds,
which is a lot for me, actually.
After doing the diet
for two months--
I'm not gonna give you
all that rigmarole again--
I weighed 11 stone
and two pounds,
so 156 pounds.
So eating a bunch
of soy made me lose 23 pounds
without having to do anything.
That's a pretty
significant difference
for just a slight change
in what I was eating.
Imagine what a difference
it would have made
if I'd bothered to exercise.
In all the really
compromising photos I took over
the course of this diet,
I didn't notice
any marked change
in my actual shape.
I didn't become more effeminate
in any way that was measurable,
and I didn't grow breasts
any larger than
the ones that I already have.
I also didn't get
significantly fitter
or have that much more energy
than I normally had, either,
so it turns out that soy beans
aren't magical.
Basically I proved exactly
what everyone expected
this would prove
in the most boring
and straightforward
way possible.
It turns out that soy beans
are just a kind of bean
that you can eat
and it doesn't make that much
of a difference.
Great.
Hooray.
This is why I didn't
bring this up much
in the main
"Measured Response" video,
by the way,
because it made no difference.
It was, like, nothing really
worth bringing up,
so I thought I'd save it
for this little thing.
At the very least I didn't
become weirdly airbrushed
or turn red like Alex Jones'
supplements seem
to do for him.
Watch out for that,
by the way, Paul.
I think by far
the most substantive change
I've noticed
is an increased prevalence
in what Reddit likes to call
the "ghost poop,"
which is you go to the bathroom
and then when you wipe,
you discover you didn't
really have to
because it came out
in one solid,
contiguous,
beautiful piece.
I wouldn't call that
a ghost poop,
by the way, Reddit.
Um, I would call that when you,
uh, take a shit
and you don't need to flush
because it went down
the drain all on its own.
[beeps]
I don't think tofu is that much
healthier than meat.
I mean, obviously
processed meats
have been linked to an increase
in cancer risk,
but with the kind of meat
you can get at a butcher,
I don't think there's
a huge difference health-wise.
That said, soy milk
is way better than regular milk.
Regular milk is garbage.
Don't even get me start--
I--I got myself started.
Milk is, like,
just absolutely rubbish.
Humans have been
lactose intolerant
for most of our history.
Like, the ability to drink milk
is something
we only really developed, like,
7,500 years ago,
and even then,
tons of humans are still
lactose intolerant.
It's ridiculous,
and then it still had shit in it
that would be, like,
poisonous to drink.
Like, it made people
really sick anyway
until Louis Pasteur came along
and invented pasteurization.
I wonder where
he got that name from?
And then it was finally
mostly safe
for some humans to drink milk.
The fact that we still
drank milk prior
to the 1860s where
we hadn't developed a way
of making it not poisonous
speaks volumes as to both
the rubbishness of milk
and to why humans
are just rubbish.
Soy milk,
on the other hand,
is low in fat,
high in protein and vitamins,
contains zero cholesterol, uh,
it tastes great in my coffee,
which is all I drink milk
for anyway
because milk is weird,
oh, and it's not full
of estrogen.
Oh, by the way,
did I mention that regular milk
is full of estrogen?
Not, you know, fakey-fake
planto-phytoestrogen.
Mammal estrogen.
The kind that effects mammals.
You know that cows make milk
for baby calves, right?
How's that for hormonal havoc,
Kayla?
[scoffs]
I don't know why I'm getting
so annoyed about this.
I think the main thing
this taught me
was to bother to think
about what I'm eating.
Having to actually measure
what's in food
and look at labels has caused me
to think more about what I'm
actually eating,
which I really wasn't before.
I've never counted calories.
I've never thought about fiber,
carbohydrates,
fat, protein,
anything like that before,
and the modicum of research
I had to do
for making these videos
has caused me to go,
"Well, if I actually thought
about this just a little bit,
I could vastly improve, like,
the actual state of my body."
So there has kinda been
a positive effect for this,
but it's nothing to do with
the food itself.
It's all just been the lessons
I've learned over
the course of trying it.
So I wouldn't really recommend
the soy diet to anyone.
You know,
there's no spectacular effects,
but I would recommend looking
into what you eat
and how to improve it.
I'm actually really obsessed
with responses
to the "Super Size Me"
documentary.
Like, Morgan Spurlock, uh,
made a couple of, like,
quite important
methodological mistakes,
so tons of shills
for the fast food industry
or, like, weird paleo
diet people have come out
with these semi-legitimate
criticisms in order
to push their own
personal agenda.
I think it's hilarious.
There's this "great" documentary
called "Fat Head,"
which I've seen more
than most actual films
that basically, uh,
takes a couple
of the legitimate problems
with "Super Size Me"
and turns them into,
like, just--
"And here's why you should eat
fucking steak every day!"
That topic is actually on
the big board
of weird niche subjects that
I'd love to make
a video about at some point,
so, uh, mention in the comments
if you'd like me
to do something like that.
That's actually something
that I've noticed
with YouTube skepticism
for a while now.
No one's bothered to mine
the area of health
and diet science yet,
which is bizarre because
it's such a fantastic thing
to delve into.
You know, like, uh,
"nutritionist" is not
a legally-protected term, right?
So you have Kayla Danielses
everywhere
and they're, like, saying stuff
that's really easy
to make fun of and debunk.
We've got all kinds
of stuff like that
and yet we're so busy
talking about, you know,
moon landing conspiracy theories
or feminists
when there's this whole thing
that we could be doing.
I think that's great.
I'm also going to look into
a book by Tim Ferriss called
"The 4-Hour Body"
which I've heard is actually
fairly similar
to the kind of diet I adopted
a couple years ago
when I got pretty healthy
and then had a weird experience
with some fatty foods.
Uh, apparently his diet, uh,
suggests some kind
of cheat day where you eat
a ton of calories
and fat and stuff
to sort of reset your metabolism
every now and then.
I'd love to have a version
of the stuff I ate then
that actually works properly
and lets me occasionally eat
fatty things
without having
to have a nap afterwards.
I think I might start going
to the gym more after this.
Like, I joked earlier,
"Imagine what it would
have been like if I
had bothered to exercise,"
and I actually quite liked
imagining that.
So, you know,
I'll give that a shot.
Anyway, thanks for watching
this quick update
on all the weird stuff I've
been putting into my mouth.
Normally at the end
of my videos,
I used to do readings
of the credits,
but then unfortunately,
too many lovely people decided
to help fund me making
weird stuff like this
so the credits started
being super long.
It's actually starting
to affect the length
and pacing of my videos
to a degree that I think
is not good
for the videos themselves
so I'm gonna change it over.
Uh, this and one more time
I'm going to do readings
of the credits just so everyone
who wants to be in them
has a chance to
and I can correct
if I get the names wrong
this time,
and in future I'm gonna
have different rewards
for backers at that level,
so I'm gonna do streams
of me editing the videos
and some other stuff like that.
If there's other stuff
you think I should do
for backers like that, uh,
please let me know.
But in the meantime,
as thanks for allowing me
to afford to spend the time,
effort, and money doing
ridiculous stuff like this,
I'd really like

Hey there.
You might have noticed that I like to keep track of all the latest, bizarre insults that internet weirdos like to come up with.
You know, cultural Marxist, beta, cuck, virtue signaller— all the greats.
One of the latest additions to that list is the term...
which is used to decry everyone who's not like them as uh,
degenerate, feminized, weak losers who are also, for some reason, also leftists because of soy.
[GARGLES SOY MILK TO TUNE OF "THE INTERNATIONALE"]
[DING]
And for once, I hesitate to admit... they've scored a slam-dunk.
They're onto us!
They know that *beans* are the reason why leftists think what they believe.
It can't be because of all the evidence.
No, they-- they've got us.
And you can't prove otherwise, because that's just the objective truth!
At least, that's what they think.
Here's a comment from one of my latest videos.
So, let's dispute the facts!
♪♪
The theory that soy is bad for you stems from a certain superstition in the bodybuilding community.
Here's the YouTube channel of Elliott Hulse, a professional bodybuilder with 1.7 million subscribers.
Well, this guy knows what he's talking about.
I wonder what he thinks about soy?
"Soy Protein Makes You Weak & Womanly".
[Hulse:] Almost every bit of soy in the United States or in the west...
[mumbled] you know,
...is going to be genetically modified.
Now, I'm not saying pro or con for genetically modified foods, but it's fucking weird.
Alright?
It just. it sounds like freakish and Frankenstein-ish to me.
I don't know the end result,
 you know, it might be the greatest thing that's ever happened to humankind. I don't fucking know.
I don't think it's a good idea, I don't like it, but I can't tell you the truth, you gotta figure out yourself.
That's a great idea Eliott. I'd have never thought of that. Thanks a lot.
So,
[Grabbing the patented [Citation Needed] button]
where's your evidence that soy feminizes people?
I would offer you to pick up a book called The Whole Soy Truth by Kaayla Daniel(s)
[Hbomb] Uh, It's actually called The Whole Soy Story, Elliott
But let's not get hung up on that.
This book is authored by "professional" nutritional iconoclast Dr. Kaayla T. Daniel, "The Naughty Nutritionist".
"Telling the truth that's too hot to handle!"
I believe that's code for
She used to call herself "The Naughty Survivalist"?
But she eventually changed her name and wardrobe after realizing her target audience were having trouble finding her
in that camo jacket amongst all the dense foliage in her beige living room.
She outlines some of her main claims about soy in her video entitled "Moobs, Man Boobs and Other Environmental Estrogens"
[DANIEL:] "All of those soybeans contain...
phytoestrogens; that's plant estrogens, and they are a form of estrogenizing influence on the body.
They create hormonal havoc, they create endocrine disruption."
[Hbomb] Soy contains
which are obviously feminizing, because they're the plant version of estrogen.
Resulting in lower testosterone along with stuff like man boobs or being turned into a weak-willed feminist who definitely doesn't even lift.
Now, Dr. Daniel's description doesn't list any sources for this?
and the rational skeptic thing to do in this context would obviously be to just assume that means there aren't any without checking.
*Sigh* So alas, it seems that I'm not a true skeptic yet,
I'm just a mere mortal.
Because I went and checked anyway, and I did find some studies.
But *Sigh*
How do I... put this in a way, that makes it not sound rude?
The studies didn't say anything like what this...
Lying... Liar,
lied about.
For example, while trying to find Studies on the effects of soy intake on estrogen and testosterone levels
I found a paper which assessed all English language studies there had been as of 2008, in which men consumed soy in their testosterone was tested,
which at the time was 32.
- check out the link in the description -
the paper pretty definitively suggests that soy foods, and, the Phytoestrogens in them thereof...
do not alter the testosterone concentration in men.
Bear in mind, this wasn't just *one* study,
this was a meta-analysis of the results of *all* 32 other studies there had been at the time.
Now does that mean we can therefore conclude that soy has no effect on testosterone levels?
Not quite...
You see in science it's rarely productive to be that conclusive about something.
instead, we'll say that the evidence quite... reliably suggests, that that's the case.
But what about soy's effects on other things that men like to worry about a lot, like uh, sperm count?
Well, another paper from 2010, examining the nine clinical studies into the effects of isoflavone exposure on estrogen levels, found no evidence that it affects those levels *at all.*
Which suggests there's no link.
Now, at this point in my research I was wondering:
when taking them doesn't seem to affect the levels of estrogen or testosterone in your blood?
Well, it's because in terms of chemical structure, They're very similar. Here's a handy picture
I found on Wikipedia comparing the makeup of isoflavones and Coomer stands to estradiol, the major estrogen hormone.
Their construction is very similar-
but the actual chemical components are very different. This means they *do* bind with estrogen receptors,
but the effects are very different, because, to put it scientifically; they're made of different stuff!
This means that they don't really have comparable effects.
But who cares about that?! Kaayla Daniel is fighting back with rigorously researched-- um,
Anecdotes... Like this one!
Scientists first linked phytoestrogens with lowered sperm count and other reproductive problems in the 1940s, when they diagnosed clover disease in sheep.
Dr. Daniel is so strapped for... *actual,* compelling evidence,
That she's down to Studies from the 40s, looking at the effects of a different plant,
on... sheep.
Now, I never really paid *that* much attention in biology class, I'm really sorry Mrs. Baldwin,
but I'm *pretty* sure I distantly remember, that humans are... *monogastric,*
mammals. Which means that we have one stomach that digests *everything* we eat.
Whereas, some animals, for example...
Sheep,
are ruminants. Which means they have a four chambered stomach that digests things multiple times,
snd they also regurgitate foods that they can chew it again, and swallow it again.
It's a little bit disgusting, but, that's just how some animals digest things.
This is why sheep can eat grass, but humans can't.
Well, you- you *can,*
no one's stopping you, there's no laws,
[GROWLS]
Just try and stop me, Brussels!
AAAAAAAAHM—
[SPITTING]
*Grass contains silica, which can seriously mess up your teeth, like, permanently,*
**DO NOT EVEN DO THIS FOR A JOKE**
So, given the quite large
dietary digestive and metabolic differences between humans and sheep,
I think it's fair to say that *maybe,* a study about...
how male sheep
digested red clover, and the effect *that* had on them, might not be *fully* relevant to the effects of soy isoflavones on humans.
So, to sum up, some plants make a hormone that *looks* like estrogen in composition,
but doesn't have the same effect because it's actually a very different chemical.
However, some people who don't know that, and can't be bothered to check,
saw the word "estrogen," and leapt to conclusions that it must be feminizing the same way estrogen is.
The way science classifies and names chemicals,
has effectively *tricked*
a bunch of people who don't know better into making wild assumptions when the data shows otherwise.
Which, sucks,
but you've got to name things somehow.
you know it's important that you...
have a standardized system of classification,
and, the one they picked happens to...
[trying not to laugh] Cause massive problems for bodybuilders.
I bet...
...didn't see THAT coming!
- My apologies to the descendants of Antoine Lavoisier -
I'm reminded almost immediately of the equally faux scientific alpha
[impersonating] BETA
beliefs popular among the manosphere, pickup artists, and others,
originally based on a study of wolves, that was later found through future research *by its own author,*
to not even be accurate *to* wolves.
These same kinds of folks have happily combined these two
half-baked concepts, hence the use of terms like,
"low-T beta,"
And the insistence that
[mockingly] "soy must have something to do with it, because that's what they all eat, apparently!"
"And I think I saw a word with estrogen in it, somewhere."
"I rest my case."
"on the edge of a cliff."
"U-u-uh Oh no! The case has fallen off!"
"Awh, no, it's on fire!!"
Soy and it's supposed affects was eventually picked up by the closest thing the far right has to journalism, Rebel Media, and then later Infowars.
Incidentally, Infowars sells diet supplements containing soy on their website.
Probably should've...
checked the label there, shouldn't you, Paul?
[PJW:] "I take Brain Force."
which brings us to Infowars editor,
soy hater,
and soy salesman;
Paul Joseph Watson's video on the topic.
Which we're going to look at in more detail now because,
I think it'll be quite useful to do so.
And also funny!
The video begins with a spiel about the BuzzFeed Try Guys.
[PJW:] "You've probably seen the BuzzFeed Try Guys video,
where they measure their testosterone, and it's literally *half* or less the normal level for a man.
Their testosterone is *so* low, it's *below* the average for an 85 to 100 year old man."
[Hbomb] This claim, and in fact this exact table, has appeared all over
the rogue's gallery of right-wing and Manosphere websites.
infowars has it, of course,
but there's also Return of Kings,
Dailywire,
AltRight.com,
Reddit,
Return of Kings again?
[Roosh V:] "So it's like a gang! You guys are writing the same thing!"
[Hbomb] Gosh they're really proud of this one. And its founder Roosh V's internet forum.
These articles and Paul's video are full of speculation that this
testosterone level is completely unhealthy and terrible and bad for you,
but...
Is it?
I'm not really sure I see the validity and looking at one number
and saying,
"Aha! These guys are dangerously unhealthy!"
"Because of a graph I googled of averages."
Human biology is rarely so simple.
Trying to stick as close as you can to a number you found on the net,
can be incredibly damaging.
in 2010 on a forum for discussing supplements, a guy had a test and found he had a level of 212,
again- the exact same level as Ned, supposedly-
But then half a month later it went up to 364, suggesting these numbers are a temporary fluctuation
that's fairly normal in a 25 year old male.
Despite this, anonymous people on the internet,
started telling him he had the testosterone of a *70* year old,
and others recommending a dosing cycle
of *steroids!*
All of this,
because of a cargo cult approach
to a number
on a graph.
This is illustrative of some quite deep hang-ups and anxieties
in male centric circles towards a single hormone of many,
that they've been told constitutes manliness.
This isn't just a silly belief that some people were wrong about,
this is an actively damaging approach,
I-- *Sincerely* hope that
this guy didn't start taking steroids
because his hormone levels, briefly, on...
*one test*
fluctuated below a level that he found on Google.
Personal anecdote: When I was 21 I was really worried about this sort of thing.
I went in for a blood test, and the doctor told me that I had above-average testosterone
for someone my age. Which was,
really, really cool! But,
THEN the doctor said, "you know a lot of people your age come in worrying about this stuff,
and, it's really quite silly."
"If you're healthy, and you're not experiencing any major problems,
and your blood panel comes up fine for
no other major disorders, then chances are, whatever testosterone level you have,
is fine for you, and
actively chasing a number that you found on the Internet,
can be really, really damaging."
"If you take steroids, it can mess up your body's internal
hormone production and actually *reduce* the level of testosterone that your body *makes,*
and,
really,
all you're doing,
is...
Enriching the supplement industry.
Just out of interest right now
Let's take a show of hands as to which is more likely to be true:
That all four of these guys has an unhealthily low testosterone level even for someone several times their age,
And the literal Doctor who they visit regularly for videos like this, Dr. Jesse Mills, a urologist
specializing in male reproductive medicine, and surgery, *and* director of the men's clinic at UCLA,
hasn't noticed anything from these tests, or that any of them know that they need to do something about their
dangerously low testosterone,
despite it literally being the thing that he specializes in
That... right wing idiots on web forums who googled the number in five seconds,
don't know everything there is to know about the science of endocrinology.
That's the study of hormones, by the way. What a lovely word.
The meat, or should I say, the plant protein of Paul's video is situated
entirely around the claim that soy is bad for you because it contains phytoestrogens.
In other words, the thing we've already debunked in this video, but,
for a laugh, let's look at how he does it specifically.
[PJW:] "Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens,
organic compounds that mimic the *female* hormone estrogen, in the human body.
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count."
[pause click]
[Hbomb] Paul here is word-for-word quoting an article in Scientific American- Well, actually
It's a very short post on the... "blog" section of the Scientific American website, and, by word-for-word...
I mean,
[PJW READING THE BLOG PO - I MEAN ARTICLE]
[Hbomb] This bit is, uh, how do I put this... not there.
Paul made that bit up.
The article actually said:
[READS:] "and, in **animal** studies,
has been shown to reduce testosterone levels."
Here, we're seeing the right-wing reactionaries approach to scientific process drawn into close focus.
When reading a piece of information he is quoting as a source of truth in his video,
and finding that it's... just a little bit *too* nuanced,
he alters and re-words it to suit his own agenda.
I see here we're back at the Kayla Daniel(s) School of Science, where sheep and humans apparently have the same digestive system.
I'm fairly certain that the blog post here is referring to the studies on sheep we mentioned earlier.
I don't know for *certain* though, because the blog doesn't cite a source for this claim,
because it's a rubbish one-paragraph blog, that only an *idiot* would source as definitive proof of anything.
You might be thinking, "Oh, but the word testosterone is highlighted. Maybe if I click it, It'll link to the study showing it."
It links to another article about testosterone. In fact it links to an article from *after* this one was written.
Someone... went back and added the link to explain what testosterone is...
four years later?
Who's in charge of the blog section of Scientific American?
You might even think,
"Ooh, what about that link to the human reproduction PDF?"
Let's open that real quick.
It appears to be an OxfordJournals.org press release, ABOUT,
Some kind of journal,
but,
i-it's a blank PDF now,
so... [chuckles]
I mean, they-they're trying to cite sources, but--
So, Paul's proof that phytoestrogen reduces testosterone is...
Some tests on SHEEP from the FOURTIES,
that he hasn't even read because the blogpost he's using as a source doesn't even link to it,
and...
being ignorant of the fact
That there's been 32 studies of the effects of phytoestrogens on humans that found no connection whatsoever.
Now, just as an aside I think it's important to point out that animal studies aren't inherently useless.
Animals *can* be good pointers for the effects of a substance on humans, and,
we can also perform tests on animals that it would be unethical to do on humans.
However, when there are examples of human data,
barring extenuating circumstances, the human data is probably more accurate.
The 40s' sheep study - or other studies on animals for that matter - should not be given as much consideration
if they contradict the research we've done on humans.
This article was published on July the 23rd, 2008,
and we know - because I cleverly set this up by telling you earlier - that as of July the 1st, 2008
there were 32 studies into the effects of soy on human testosterone levels.
This article brings up animal studies specifically because that's all they've got backing up their hypothesis that tofu lowers sperm count,
apart from the study they're about to reference, which we're going to get to in a second once we see how Paul sums it up.
[PJW:] "Men who eat half a serving of soy a day have 34 million fewer sperm per millimetre than those who don't."
Wait, what was that?
"Sperm per millimetre."
"SPERM PER MILLIMETRE."
"MILLIMETRE."
Okay... bef--before we even get... to the study, before we *even* get to the—
the word is "milliliter."
Milliliter is a measurement of liquid, and a **millimeter** is a measurement of length.
I don't even know how you got this wrong! The word. is. *literally.* in front—
PAUL!
YOU'RE A FUCKING JOURNALIST!
It's such a simple thing to get right, and he CAN'T EVEN—
Now, far be it from *me* to take Paul or the one-paragraph blog post he cites entitled...
at their word,
but I'm gonna go ahead and actually check the sources they cite.
Check out the link in the description, sperm fans!
The scientists got some men to provide a semen sample and answer a questionnaire about what foods they consumed,
Including foods that contain soy.
They then sorted the samples into four groups:
No soy intake, and then varying tiers of soy intake, and looked to see if there was a correlation with the results of the sperm sample.
The mean average sperm concentration in millions per milliliter was 106 for the group with no soy food servings,
while the average for the group that had over 0.3 servings per day was 72.
Which, does kind of show a correlation, doesn't it?
However,
you might notice a couple of weird things here.
Firstly, the group that has between 0.01 and 0.07 servings per day had an average of 92.
But the group with between 0.08 and 0.29 
 - which is quite a bit more - had 104.
More than the previous group, only slightly less than having none, and way more than having over 0.3.
What's going on there?
Something weird's going on with these men's sperm counts.
On top of that, looking at the results section of the paper,
the majority of men (72%) were defined as overweight or obese whether or not they ate *any* soy,
and, 10% had below 20 million sperm per milliliter,
which is less than the low bar for sperm the World Health Organization used to, up until the late 90s, consider a healthy sperm count.
Why is this?
Well, here's the part where I pull the chair out from under you.
It's because the men invited to the test were the male partners of subfertile couples.
Couples who for one reason or another, have been trying to produce a child but haven't been able to,
who had gone to the Massachusetts General Hospital for evaluation.
*All* the men in the study, whether or not they consumed soy, had already been having troubles achieving pregnancy.
That's how they *found* them.
[metal rubbing against chain]
[GRUNTS]
By the way, uh
the study's *name,*
mentions that it's men at an infertility clinic, right?
and
Neither Paul's video, nor the blog post he cites even mention that! And it's in its name!
This is not a straightforward test of an average population.
On top of that, how many men were actually tested, in this study?
Four thousand??
A thousand?
Five hundred?
Well, it was actually 99 men.
That's... really not big enough for the results of this study to be easily applicable to any human population.
If you're going to count studies with a questionably low sample size,
then, you might as well look at the study by Song Airtel in 2006,
which studied only *48* men, with a control group of 10, and found that plant phytoestrogen intake
was correlated with HIGHER sperm count, *and,* higher sperm DNA integrity.
But, 48 men - or even 99 men - isn't really enough for the results of either to suggest much of anything.
I hope it goes without saying, that a study of 99 men, who are already having fertility problems,
is not enough to come to a sweeping generalization about the effects of soy on sperm count -
- or testosterone for that matter.
And in case it doesn't go without saying,
The study concludes by saying it,
and I quote,
[SAW RUBBING AGAINST CONCRETE]
[GRUNTS, STRUGGLING]
[PANTS] Here we go...
[READS THE CONCLUDING SENTENCES]
THIS IS PAUL'S SOURCE!
This is the thing he uses to prove the things he believes!
and even *it* says,
fucking -
"***Don't*** come to a bullshit conclusion! We don't know enough about it!"
[SIGHS]
And yet...
It seems like Paul's audience,
lapped this up anyway.
Like milk, from the udders of the world's most disgusting kind of metaphorical cow,
the--
the LIE COW!
Here's another interesting thing I noticed:
Despite his attempt to demonstrate that soy lowers testosterone and sperm count, the BuzzFeed Try Guys,
Incidentally, did a video where they have their sperm tested.
All four Try Guys have a sperm concentration well over the normal count of 15 million sperm per milliliter, established by the World Health Organization,
with Keith having an, um... *atrociously* high count per milliliter despite having well below what Paul claims as normal testosterone.
And Ned, who had the lowest testosterone by far, had a total sperm count of
248.6 million, over 10 million sperm more than Eugene who had the highest testosterone of the group by far.
This is anecdotal evidence but that's really not much of a correlation between testosterone and sperm count, is it?
Unless of course, Paul means to tell me that Keith has well below
the average testosterone levels of an 85 to 100 year old man
While--...
Blasting! Sperm! Like he's Zeus, from Mount Olympus!
There's also a bit where he attempts to tie the
increased production of soy in the West, with the general reduction in testosterone around the same time.
[PJW:] "Obviously it's not the only factor but consider this,
in 1992 soy food sales in the US stood at 300 million a year.
They now stand at over. FOUR. BILLION.  dollars a year.
This has coincided with a substantial drop in men's testosterone levels in the US since the 80s."
[Hbomb] Hey, Paul? Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul... I'll give you this— I'll give you this one for free;
Google the word:
"coincidence."
Seriously, this is the best he has to offer
The only other major things he cites
are the guy I already showed you, and the nutritionist whose book's name that guy got wrong.
It's kind of ironic isn't it?
That Paul and his audience is [sic] blindly following Kayla Daniels on this,
given that the main source for her claims, is a story about a bunch of
FUCKING...
...SHEEP!
He even - and this is really interesting -
Cites as proof that men get man boobs because of soy, the *same* video
*I* found while I was doing research into this.
You know, the one that cites no credible evidence whatsoever?
[sarcastically] Weird that he'd make *that* his source for his claims!
What's even weirder though;
Is that since Paul's video came out,
the description of the video has been edited to read:
"NOTE: Paul Joseph Watson used an excerpt from this video in his popular video, 'The Truth About Soy Boys,'
Illegally without the permission of Dr. Kaayla Daniel. She finds his perspective offensive."
This is Paul Joseph Watson's bulletproof source:
a nutritionist with little to no scientific basis for their claims,
whose video Paul took without even bothering to ask,
to make his *personal,* ridiculous, right-wing view of the issue seem more credible.
A view the person he's claiming as a source-
*openly* says she finds offensive.
I hope Paul gets a fucking medal of how idiotic he's managed to be in this video,
it's almost mind-boggling how backwards he's managed to get scientific reality.
- [DISTANT GUNSHOTS]
- [PANTING]
[Exhausted] In conclusion, it may well be the case that soy is feminizing, and makes you really unfit,
and it isn't just caused by Paul's sedentary lifestyle or my love of Twizzlers.
But if it is the case that soy makes you into a-- y'know-- a no-testosterone, no-sperm baby-man,
then, the time to believe that...
is when there is evidence.
In the words of David Hume—
and this makes me smarter, because, you know, I can regurgitate a quote—
"The wise man,
proportions his belief...
to the evidence."
[SIGHS]
Which brings me to the real question here.
You know, it's not just that some people are wrong about the science of isoflavones or whatever.
The real question is,
why do Right Wing idiots keep sharing obvious lies in order to perpetuate the things they want to believe?
Why isn't the truth enough?
The book, "When Prophecy Fails," relates the findings of social psychologists
who studied a doomsday cult that believed the apocalypse was coming.
When the date of the end of the world came and went,
many of the cult remained committed to its beliefs anyway;
decided that the world had simply been spared, or the end had merely been delayed.
The psychologists found that when a group of people is utterly committed to an idea,
even if undeniable proof it is not true is presented to them,
they can find a way to remain steadfast in their initial, false beliefs.
The term, "cognitive dissonance," was invented by Leon Festinger,
the book's main author and lead psychologist, a year later.
The small, close-knit, definitely not cult-like corners of the Internet,
are *sure* they already know the truth about how the world works,
and appear to be hoping to piece together a justification for their beliefs
by aggregating enough buzzwords that it somehow proves they're right.
[PJW] "The only men who seriously watch BuzzFeed
are tofu-eating, male feminist, virtue signalling, beta orbiter..."
[Hbomb] They're virtue signalers,
they're cultural Marxists,
they're betas.
They must have low testosterone. They must be cucks.
They must have had too much of a bean,
that's been a staple in the diet of Asian countries for thousands of years.
[mockingly] "I don't need to talk about evidence for my beliefs, because everyone who isn't like me is all of these bad things."
"And that's why I'm right."
It's important to recognize that this isn't an external claim,
people don't wallpaper this all over their Facebook and Twitter feeds because they think it'll convince someone else to believe it.
That's not the point. It's an *internal* claim.
They're repeatedly talking to themselves,
because *they* want to believe it.
It's a mental diversion from the actual truth,
which is that other people have different ideas than them, because the evidence sometimes suggests their beliefs are wrong.
Without spreading ideas like that soy causes leftism,
these folks would have to come to terms with the possibility that people might have good reasons to think differently from them,
and admitting that would be too much.
That would mean maybe they're not correct.
Maybe their understanding of the world is incomplete.
It can be scary to truly consider you might not know something, and can be wrong.
This explains the prevalence of people like Paul, who help distract people from their fears of being wrong
by acting as figures of authority who can tell them, "No. Trust me.
I know what I'm talking about, and you're right already.
You don't need to do any more thinking. Everyone who's different from you
is a gender communist." [laughs]
If you happen to be a fan of Paul who managed to stick around to the end,
*thanks* for hearing me out all the way.
There's already undoubtably tons of comments about stopping partway through
because they can't stand the sound of my voice, or because I'm clearly a leftist shill soy boy.
You've outsmarted all of those people by actually listening to what someone else has to say,
and really having to think about the evidence.
It might be comfortable having a YouTuber affirming your ideas,
but the truth can't hurt you. In fact, it can set you free.
Having a greater understanding of the world can only ever be a good thing,
and being able to change your conclusions when presented with new evidence
is a far more important skill than happening to be right first time about something.
I've been wrong about plenty of things in one video. I claimed Tigers were from Africa
They actually only live in India in the wild and I foolishly half-remembered an anecdote that their common ancestor with lions and leopards
originated in Africa. *Everyone* is wrong some of the time, and that's okay
There'll always be people like Paul, who wants you to believe they can do your thinking for you
But maybe they're not right about that either.
You don't have to think I'm right, I *could* be wrong!
I could have come to the complete wrong conclusion about what this evidence suggests, but you can find it
It's out there, and it informs your perspective of everything, you know?
maybe some conservatives eat soy and that's fine. In fact, that is the case, I've looked it up!
And...
Y-you know...
Isn't it all nice?

Ron Grainer's "Doctor Who"]
♪ ♪
[alarm buzzing]
No!
If you've seen
my "Sherlock" video--
which, um, I think a couple
of you might have done--
you'll already know
that Moffat's relationship
with "Doctor Who" is lifelong.
He was a fan
of the original series
and he wrote the Children
in Need charity spoof
of "Doctor Who" which
was actually
the first appearance
of the Doctor on television
for quite some time.
It ended,
perhaps fittingly,
with the Doctor regenerating
into a woman.
Now, when I saw this years ago,
I thought,
"Wow, wouldn't that be nice?"
But I realize in retrospect
after reading
some recent comments
by Moffat that this
to him was meant as a joke.
[DOCTOR] And of course
my Sonic Screwdriver.
[buzzing]
Oh, look.
It's got three settings.
[EMMA] Doctor, stop that!
[HBOMB] Like, ha, ha,
the Doctor keeps dying
in silly little ways
and regenerating.
What's the next comical thing he
can regenerate into?
Oh, a woman!
[laughing sarcastically]
Oh, imagine!
A woman Doctor.
That's a laugh riot.
Back before Moffat
was showrunner,
when all he'd done was work
on several
critically-praised comedies
and the best episodes
of the show so far
and that one other really,
really bad show which
we pretended didn't happen.
You know,
we did him a favor.
It was easy to interpret having
the Doctor regenerate
into Joanna Lumley
as this cool,
progressive thing.
Like, "Hey, why not have
a female incarnation?"
But Moffat's actual intent
is made much more clear
by closer inspection
and of course
by his more recent statements.
"This isn't a show exclusively
for progressive liberals.
"This is also for people
who voted Brexit.
"That's not me politically
at all-
but we have to keep everyone
on board."
I haven't actually met
a Scottish person before.
Okay, firstly,
credit to Steven for recognizing
the mysterious correlation
between people who voted Brexit
and people who would have
a problem with a female Doctor,
but secondly,
isn't it telling that
he views casting a woman
as a move
for progressive liberals?
Like, is that really
the only reason anyone
would ever think to cast
a woman in this role?
Moffat's approach rears its head
in the special itself
with the first Doctor's--
shall we say--
ironic sexist comments.
[FIRST DOCTOR] Older gentlemen,
like women,
can be put to use.
[12TH DOCTOR] You can't--y--
you can't say things like that.
[HBOMB] Look how silly
this old man is being.
Hey, remember casual misogyny?
Hilarious!
Look how far we
and the Doctor have come.
But writing like that loses
its appeal when it's written
by the man who had several
great opportunities
to actually cast a woman
as this character
and didn't because he
was worried about upsetting
the kind of people
who actually think like that.
That's not to say I don't
think Capaldi was a good choice
for the Doctor.
Like almost all the actors
this show gets nowadays,
he does a great job
with the material he's given,
and season eight
was almost all right,
but even the episodes
of the show written
by other writers are affected
by Moffat's poor plans
as showrunner
for the overall direction
of the wider story.
While most of the good episodes
like "Mummy on
the Orient Express"
or "Flatline" get to be
their own thing,
there's still a lot
of mucking about
with this overarching story
about deciding whether
or not the Doctor's secretly
a bad guy who kills people
and it's bad,
and Missy--
a mysterious figure
who keeps meeting up with people
who died during each episode--
saw a fairly decent chunk
of each writer's episode
get stolen to serve Moffat's
inevitable nonsense
season finale.
Moffat's plans weaken
the individual episodes
not just by literally leeching
away precious script pages
they could have used to tell
the story at hand,
but it also means
the individual writers
can't really do anything with
the Doctor or his companion
for that season, Clara,
because that would risk messing
up whatever big
character moments Moffat
had planned
for the end of the season.
The characters couldn't really
develop their relationships
with each other
or change as people.
At best, sometimes Clara
realizes the Doctor's not always
the best guy and then changes
her mind in the next episode
and goes to hang out
with him again.
Capaldi and Smith's Doctors
didn't get to develop
or grow the way Eccleston
and Tennant's did.
You couldn't really have
an episode
quite like "Dalek"
or "The Empty Child"
in a show led this way,
and that's especially sad
because Moffat wrote one
of those episodes.
Moffat's approach
as a showrunner
inadvertently prevents
these kinds of episodes
and great moments that define
a series from happening,
and that just really sucks.
The third Capaldi series
was basically a soft reboot.
The first episode
was even called "The Pilot."
The Doctor gets reintroduced
in a new context
as a prestigious professor.
Hey, Steve,
wouldn't it been great
if we--we--you'd written a bunch
of episodes
that show him reaching
this point in his life?
[stammers and exhales]
[slaps hands on thighs]
I mean, like, literally, like,
a whole season of television
could have been written
about how
the Doctor ends up where he is
and the place he's at
at the start of this season,
and they just don't.
It just starts here.
That's a whole good season
of storytelling
you could have had,
gone.
Bill was in this season,
and I think she starts out
as a really interesting
companion,
but then the series kind of
is sort of generic
the whole way through,
so she doesn't really get
to be as interesting as I think
she could have been.
It's clear that Moffat still
has no idea how to pace
a full season of television.
Long story short,
at the end of that season,
Bill dies sort of,
and the Doctor saves the day
but is critically injured
in the process
and he starts to regenerate.
He wanders out into the
south pole
and meets the first Doctor which
is where our Christmas
special picks up.
I will now attempt to recount
in full the plot
of the 2017 "Doctor Who"
Christmas special.
[inhales sharply]
The story begins
with that meeting again.
Then for some reason,
time stops.
Then a first World War soldier
played by Mark Gatiss--
because why not--
is about to die,
but then time stops
for him as well
and then he gets pulled into
the North Pole
at the same time
as the two Doctors.
An entity reveals itself
and abducts the TARDIS
and demands they hand over
the soldier
and then manifests a new version
of Bill who the Doctor
thought had died.
The Doctor doesn't want
to hand the soldier over
without getting more information
so instead
of asking what's happening,
they all, uh, run away
and pretend to let
the TARDIS get stolen
and then they all run off
to the other Doctor's TARDIS
to go to a planet
we haven't seen before where
the Doctor claims we'll find
the biggest database
in the world.
The Doctor assumes
this glass lady thing, uh,
is based on a real person
and just needs
a really big database
to look them up for some reason.
The database shoots
at the Doctor
but gives up when it realizes
he's already dying
for some reason.
It turns out to be the Dalek
from that one episode
two seasons ago
when they all went into a Dalek
and made it want
to kill other Daleks by accident
while trying to turn it good.
He's just sort of hanging
out here shooting Daleks
whenever they turn up
to shoot him.
So it turns out that Daleks
are all hooked up into some
special, um, mega mainframe
that's the biggest database
in the world.
The Doctor tries to convince it
to tell him who
the glass lady is.
Meanwhile, the manifestation
of Bill keeps turning into
the glass lady, uh,
and sort of messing
with the soldier and the Doctor
but not actually doing anything
with them.
They just--she just sort of
turns into glass
when they're not looking
and then nothing happens.
Um, it doesn't actually
do anything.
Anyway, the Dalek looks up
the lady's face
and it turns out that she's
the creator
of a future humanity's
time traveling super computer
designed to--get this--
abduct everyone who ever dies
from time
and scan their memories
at the moment of their deaths
and then put them back, uh,
to build a big database
of all of their memories.
The Doctor realizes there
was no threat, uh, this episode,
and there were no stakes,
uh, gives up,
and, uh, the soldier
hands himself over.
[HBOMB] We're 14 minutes into
the episode, Steven!
They go back to where he
was supposed to die
but then he doesn't because
the Doctor delayed
the death by a few hours
and it turns out that
it's that one time all
the fighting stopped
at Christmas.
Oh, hey, they actually
worked Christmas into it
and semi-justified having
this random guy be the guy
who gets abducted.
Oh, also,
he's an ancestor
of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart
for some reason.
[ARCHIBALD] Captain Archibald
Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart.
[HBOMB] That's a thing
that Moffat keeps doing
and I'm really not sure why.
The entity which it turns out
is called "Testimony"
brings out Nardole as well
so, uh, he can say bye to them
and then also Clara
who he forgot because
of time bullshit
in the last season,
but Testimony gives him
his memories back using magic,
and then both Doctors give up
and decide to regenerate
out of spite.
Capaldi gives a speech
to his next self saying
that they should
b--be nice to people.
The scene would probably be
a real tear-jerker
if it was attached
to an episode of television
with any stakes or plot.
And then he finally goes out
the way we all wish we would--
by exploding violently
into light and fire
while transforming
into Jodie Whittaker.
[inhales]
[exhales sharply]
I have a few small questions.
Why didn't the entity
just explain itself
and make it clear it didn't have
any ulterior motives
the way it happily did once
the Doctor asked a Dalek
to Google it for him?
Why did it threaten him at all
considering that it has
the memories of everyone
who ever died so it knows all
about him
and knows that he's
a peaceful guy
who doesn't need
to be threatened?
Why did the Doctor decide
the only solution
was to go find that one Dalek
from two seasons ago
and didn't get mentioned again?
How does he know
where it ended up?
Uh, why--if the Dalek
hates Daleks
and wants to kill Daleks
and can clearly see down
to the ground level
and make fairly accurate shots--
has it not killed all
the deshelled
and still alive Daleks
squirming around on the surface
where it can definitely
see them?
I mean, the catchphrase
is, "exterminate,"
not, "I'm gonna break off
your outer casing
"and then just sort of chill out
and wait for someone
"to come here and have
a half-baked horror scene
"where one of them squirms
on Mark Gatiss' face
for five seconds."
Why has the Dalek since
also decided it wants
to kill the Doctor?
Why does it give up when
it sees that he's already dying?
And even if for some reason
it's decided that the best thing
to do is leave the dying
to die without killing them,
why does it actually
believe he's dying,
even though it definitely knows
Time Lords regenerate
because, A, Daleks know
how Time Lords work--
that's, like, one of their,
like, main things--
and, B, Daleks apparently have
a mega hive mind super database
bigger than the one
the Time Lords have.
Next question.
Why did the Daleks have
a comprehensive mega hive mind
super database
bigger than the Time Lords have,
who--by the way--
are the lords of all of time?
And who plugged all these
bloody wires in?
It--it doesn't even have arms!
It's just a plunger
and a whisk!
[stammers]
How did it--
Why a World War One soldier?
Why didn't the Bill Potts entity
just explain itself right away
and clear everything up instead
of insisting she was real?
Why undo the Doctor forgetting
Clara in the last five minutes
of the last run
of the last episode
of this incarnation
even being around?
Why did Testimony pretend they
got away for a while
and unfreeze time even though
they happily froze it again
partway through the scene
with the Dalek?
Why bring back this Dalek for,
like, a two-minute conversation
that doesn't actually progress
its story or relationship
with the Doctor at all
and imparts five seconds
of exposition and yet spend half
the episode farting around
on the planet getting to it?
Why were there
no stakes whatsoever?
And most importantly,
what exactly was Steven Moffat
actually trying to do?
Um, I think I figured out
the answer
to that question,
at least.
Remember "The End of Time,"
the last special
with Russell T. Davies in charge
and the last one
with David Tennant
as the Doctor
where he saves the day
and makes a heroic sacrifice
and then starts to regenerate?
Remember how
the regeneration started
and there was still, like,
20 minutes of the Doctor
going around saying bye
to everyone,
even old companions
who we hadn't seen
for quite a while like Rose
and Martha,
and we even find out
what they've been up to
in the interim like that Martha
and Mickey got married,
and all the memorable
alien creatures we met get
to say goodbye and/or be hit
by a hammer by him
one last time?
I love that stuff.
It was the end of both
the lead actor's
and showrunner's tenure on
the series
so they gave a proper send-off
to all the characters
from that era of the show--
some recurring,
others small
but memorable enough
that it was great we got
to see them one last time.
They even bring back Alonso.
Alonso, the guy
from a Christmas special
three years ago
who we didn't see again
comes back to feature
in David Tennant's victory lap
and that's just great.
It got a little bit silly having
the dying Doctor say bye
to everyone before
his heroic sacrifice
actually kicked in,
but it was kind of nice
to remember
how good the story had been
overall until that point.
It's a nice changing
of the guard moment
since the old recurring cast
mostly goes away after
this point along
with the lead actor
and the producers
and lead writer went, too,
so it's kind of cool that
this era of "Doctor Who" got
to say goodbye to itself
in this big way.
It's clear that Moffat sort of
wanted to do that for himself.
Remember that with this
episode's invention of Testimony
Moffat could have written in
a meeting
with almost any character
he wanted ever
because Testimony's literally
a database of every human
who has ever died.
Moffat could bring anyone back
to say bye to them,
but then he discovered that
he hadn't created any characters
worth going back to and finding
and reminding us about.
This is a serious question.
Who else from Moffat's episodes
for the last five years
does anyone actually remember?
Oh, yeah, I really missed
the sinister puddle,
or all eight flavors
of the new Dalek
gumdrop brigade.
Just kidding.
Everyone quietly tried
to forget that redesign
and even Moffat said
they were a mistake.
All the memorable Moffat-written
characters I'd ever want
to see again happened before
he was running it.
So Moffat's opportunity
to say bye to all
of his beloved characters
amounts to Clara,
Nardole, Bill, the first Doctor,
and, what, this Dalek?
Can't even say bye
to Emily Pond either
because Karen Gillan's too busy
on "Jumanji"
or "Guardians of the Galaxy"
or "Untitled Avengers Film."
Now, I really did want
to answer the question
of why Moffat would decide
to have this Dalek
and this planet
in his last episode.
Well, luckily I've tuned
my brain into the dunce
who thinks
he's smart wavelength,
so I know what Moffat
was trying here.
The planet he goes to here
is called Villengard
by the Doctor in a seemingly
throw-away line.
[12TH DOCTOR] The weapon
fortress of Villengard.
[HBOMB] That's actually
a place referred to
in a similar throw-away
line previously
in a part Moffat wrote
for season one back in 2005.
[NINTH DOCTOR] Sonic blaster,
51st century.
Weapon factories of Villengard.
[HBOMB] In fact, I used that
scene in the "Sherlock" video
as an example
of Moffat's good writing.
It was a reference
to something cool
the Doctor did that we never got
to see,
and in retrospect,
is a huge red flag
as to his major problems
as a showrunner,
but it's a kind of line
that works in a show run
like this season was,
where the Doctor actually
does stuff
and interacts with the story.
So it's like Moffat's coming
full circle by having
the Doctor go
in the last episode
he's gonna write
to a place mentioned
in the first episode he wrote.
This is clever
but in a very particular kind
of way.
All it does is make
the few people
who will even get the reference
feel clever
and I remember
a time when "Doctor Who"
had loftier goals than that.
It's not a problem in itself
that he did it or anything.
It's just indicative
of the structural flaws
in his work that he put in
the effort of making references
like this
to his own previous stories
but not enough to write
a story that was good
and worked on its own,
which I think is a flaw.
Moffat is so sort on old
familiar faces
from his run to say goodbye to
that it brings back that Dalek
they ran around inside of
for an episode
and had that scene I used
in the "Sherlock" video
as an example
of really poor writing.
in the middle of wilcher lies a ring of
large standing stones each weighing
around 25 tons it is believed the
monument was assembled between 4 or
5,000 years ago archaeological evidence
suggests it may have been a burial site
or perhaps a place of healing where the
injured were taken some also theorized
it may have had a religious or
astronomical importance we call this
place Stonehenge we also call it a
monument but we don't even know if its
creators would think such a thing
the culture that produced it left no
written records and even how it was
built is still up for debate in 11:36 in
his book the history of the kings of
Britain
Geoffrey of Monmouth and early British
historiography claimed the wizard Merlin
built Stonehenge here's an illustration
from the mid 14th century based on that
theory for roughly 500 years building
something like Stonehenge seemed so
difficult that it was commonly accepted
that a wizard did it apparently he did
it with his bare hands - thanks Geoffrey
it's a mysterious place because it
provides us with questions and no real
answers what was the intent of its
creators what did they think of it and
what became of them what would a Briton
built by these people look like the so
called monument points away to a version
of the world that never came to be
instead it's one of the soul creations
of a culture whose ideas and intent of
simply vanished
will we ever really know who built
Stonehenge or what it was for probably
not
besides just hunter rocks
anyway today we're going to talk about
dragon's lair
[Music]
[Music]
March 1983 the arcade game entitled
mappy has just been released you play as
a police mouse who has to take back
stolen goods from a gang of cats by
bouncing around in a weird voice with
random objects in it you can't really
tell those pinky purpley things are cats
and also one would question the ability
of a police captain who sent a mouse
with no backup to confiscate stolen
goods from an army of cats but it's fine
enough On June 14th mario brothers hit
arcades this was the first appearance of
Mario's brother Luigi oh boy I'm so
happy to meet Mario but with different
colours together up to two players can
jump around in a hellish void knocking
pixelated facts similes of turtles
around I mean both of these games are
fun to play but visually speaking
they're pretty poor appropriations of
the thing that players told they're
doing I'm telling you all this so you
can maybe imagine the impact when on
June 19th that year just five days after
Mario Brothers told you this massive
colors was a man called Luigi this
happened dragon's lair
you controlled the actions of a daring
adventurer finding his way through the
castle of a dog wizard hey look it's an
actual person who is trying to not die
in an actual dungeon looking place and
look how much animation there look at
the actual capital a animation and if we
look closely enough we can even maybe
see a game in here somewhere
the mechanics of the game are very
simplistic you watch the pretty
impressively animated character make his
way through a room and then press one of
four directions or the attack button
when it's appropriate to do one of those
things and if you do the wrong thing you
lose a life and get to watch a death
animation and to store all the data for
those animations the arcade game used a
revolutionary content distribution
system for the time called a laser disc
ow pleaser discs have been in use since
the late 70s but the idea of using one
of these as a way of storing more
picture and sound information than a
normal arcade game could use hadn't been
implemented in many games at this point
this game was designed by Don Bluth
former Disney animator and Rick Dyer
forget about this guy you'll never hear
from him again let's just talk about Don
Bluth some more he just made the secret
of NIMH one of the best looking animated
films ever and was about to go on to
make rock-a-doodle thumbelina at
in Central Park the pebble and the
penguin Titan AE and also some good
films I never saw any of the good ones
growing up so Bluth and his small team
used their animation chops to create an
actually nice-looking game with dynamism
and charm the game looked amazing and
everyone knew it even though it was more
expensive to play than other games they
had huge lines at arcades and the
Machine sold amazingly with arcade
producers partially thanking it for
getting them through a financially
difficult time in history and I do mean
difficult outside of arcades what would
later be called the great video game
crash of 1983 was happening the revenues
of home game sales dropped almost 97%
but dragon's lair and its appealing
gimmick had somewhat insulated arcades
from these troubles this article from
1984 says laserdisc games may be the
wave of the future and drums up hype for
Bluths next game Space Ace
[Music]
Space Ace was similarly great looking
though it was effectively the same game
as its predecessor only with a different
theme and new animations it's just as
fun to watch but by the time of its
release later in 1984 however that
wasn't really enough
the lack of gameplay in these games had
come back to haunt them in the market
there wasn't much replay value once you
knew how to beat it that was it
this puttin up a ceiling on how much a
person could go back and enjoy something
when other games have many levels and
increasing difficulty players had grown
tired of the style and arcade owners
weren't into buying expensive game units
with temperamental discs inside them the
players could memorize and never play
again what they want is variety we
constantly get paired at one type of
food or one type of movie or one type of
game and so as you progress if you want
to go on to a new thing laserdisc games
had proven to be more the splash of the
future than the wave and the tide had
gone out I think I might have gone a
little bit overboard with the water
metaphors so what if you wanted more of
this type of game or wanted to see what
directions the genre explored as time
went on there have been a couple of
revivals over the years like brain-dead
13 which is probably straight up with
the best example of this weird sub-genre
of playable animation and there's also
more weird Cashion's from the original
boom to go back and find like a time
ghoul or ninja Hayate or super Don
Quixote or ashes our run Miller if your
timing is off poor Don will die a
hideous death Oh cliffhanger which was
actually made out of recut footage from
loop on the third films including castle
of Cagliostro so we technically got an
arcade game featuring animation by Hayao
Miyazaki that's kind of mind-blowing
[Music]
it was clearly rushed incredibly quickly
to make it to market
so the dub is so atrocious that you can
actually make out the original Japanese
voices from the film's underneath
dragons lairs namesake earned it a good
deal of notoriety and nostalgia even as
its format and imitators failed the game
had several sequels and has been
repackaged many times onto almost every
imaginable console there was an
IndieGoGo campaign to fund a piece
designed to help fund a Dragon's Lair
movie in other words to take even what
game there was out of their game there's
also a couple of different ports that
are actually new games including a
famously ridiculously difficult NES
version of which I've never even been in
the first screen there's a rubbish
snares version of Space Ace but neither
actually captures the thing that made
these games cool and unique at the time
so there wouldn't be all that
interesting even if they were fun so if
you're interested in tracking this genre
of fully animated adventure game there
isn't that much to track but what if I
told you there was an even more true
successor to Dragon's Lair than the
hasty sequels or the Cashion's
what if I told you there was a secret
forgotten third game in the saga of
dragon's lair and Space Ace
ooh saga and makes it sound important
but first a question everyone seems to
take for granted
who made dragon's lair when people think
of dragon's lair they think of Don Bluth
it's easy to see why let's look at one
of the posters magic on presents of Don
Bluth Studios production design and
animation Don Bluth produced by Don
Bluth directed by Don Bluth copyright
Don Bluth posters don't have to be
arranged this way this is a purposeful
choice it creates the impression that
like a modern-day Merlin Don Bluth
assembled Dragon's Lair with his own two
hands Geoffrey of Monmouth never left us
he just became a marketing consultant
the Creator is Don Bluth who once
directed several Disney features in the
mid-1970s last year Bluth found his own
audience with
animated feature the secret of NIMH you
see people tend to remember history in
terms of winners secret of NIMH had been
wildly successful the previous year Don
Bluth was swiftly becoming a household
name and his legend about leaving Disney
and piling everything he had into NIMH
even mortgaging his house to complete it
and making it all back and more was
compelling history likes people who
gamble and win and history tends to only
remember whose name was on the poster
history has a knack of not remembering
the hundreds of talented people who
worked on secret of NIMH or the other
animators behind Dragon's Lair or the
programmers who made the system work at
all or the man who actually made the
game the idea of turning cartoons into
video games was developed at brick tire
industry
we're in the entertainment business
remember Rick Dyer despite the game
actually being conceived and programmed
by RDI video systems and RDR being short
for Rick Dyer industry's history appears
to have conspired to make sure people
forget Dyer and that the game was his
idea and that he'd had this idea for a
long time it's the forerunner of
Dragon's Lair
it was developed way back in 1979 this
was dyers first computerized interactive
game Dyer had spent his youth making
fantasy games using text and pictures
drawn onto cash-register paper
programmed to scroll to the right point
as he made choices when attempts to sell
a digitized game along these lines
failed he decided that more animation
would create a better connection with
the viewer and started work on dragon's
lair later he hired Don Bluth studio to
do the animation itself but despite his
success Dyer was aware of the flaws with
dragon's lair and Space Ace firstly he'd
wanted people to be able to play them at
home but arcades had become a necessity
given the expense of the technology
required to play them secondly they were
short and had limited scope in terms of
story or genuine decision-making Dyer
had gotten into making games as a kid
because he liked to make big adventures
with grand stories he wasn't happy with
dragon's lair or Space Ace he wanted to
make something bigger I think right now
the arcade industry is playing catch-up
to us
I know what what's coming after our the
introduction of our home system
what I'm going to do is to create a
world that is so real and that you will
will have a hard time telling what's
real and what isn't in late 1984 dyers
company began work on what he hoped
would blow the lid off of home gaming
again after its collapse he was about to
announce a new games console
[Music]
the halcyon was an incredibly ambitious
system the name designed to deliberately
invoke the name of Hal 9000 from 2001 a
Space Odyssey and no that's not me being
weird and reading too much into it this
time they really meant to invite that
comparison if you remember the movie
2001 a Space Odyssey there was a
computer in that movie called Hal why
you would make your console invoke the
name of an AI that goes mad and kills
most of its crew I don't know I think he
might have fallen asleep halfway through
the film for the time it was ambitious
the same way dragon's lair had been you
could speak to Hal the name of the AI in
the halcyon and it could talk back to
you and even remember your name what do
you want
sounds so mad at him 8 just go
[Music]
maybe he's what a computer should have
been all along something that that
anybody can use because anybody can talk
clearly Rick die has never been to
Liverpool ha ha ha obviously this is
basic hey I by modern standards but the
idea of a home media device you could
talk to in 1984 before the 8-bit
Nintendo Entertainment System was even
out in America or Europe was kind of
amazing
[Music]
he is dire demonstrating how on a 1985
edition of the show computer chronicles
Stewart nice again Stewart cafe and I
probably ought to do work yes and to
launch with it daya and his team were
working on a new game it was called
tears quest the game that comes with
this is Thayer's quest this is a story
about greed about unbridled ambition and
power lust and the disaster resulting
from those faults taya's Quest was gonna
be more than just a video file with
button prompts taya's Quest was going to
be an adventure what we're creating is
going to allow you to be anything that
you ever wanted to be and experience it
you're gonna you're gonna be there you
will live and die by your decisions a
game way you choose why your character
goes on a journey across a world of five
kingdoms interacting with an all-new
fantasy story unlike standard video
games that demand quick reflexes the new
project places a premium on thinking you
talk to the computer and it will talk
back an adventure featuring animation
instead of just text or the days
primitive graphics utilizing laserdisc
technology once more but on a scale even
more grand than the game spiritual
predecessors and doing it all in the
players own home we're estimating that
you'll be able to play the game 20 hours
a week for 6 months before you will have
explored the entire world the price tag
of this home laserdisc player slash
games console slash talking AI computer
twenty five hundred US dollars that's
nearly six thousand dollars in 2017
money which means that in the UK it
would cost at least four hundred pounds
laserdisc players were crazy expensive
at the time but even that was pretty
steep but hey you could play an animated
adventure quest by talking to a computer
there has never been speech recognition
of the high caliber that this has well
no really let's go to the forest
clearing one what one speak don't say
steadily
still work one two yeah okay I mean you
see this was the 80s people had an idea
of what the future was going to look
like without really knowing it or
thinking about its practicalities the
future is always different from how
people of the present think the future
will be the halcyon was ultimately a
poor facsimile of one man's best guess
as to what the future would look like
and it turned out not to be a very good
guess still I really wanted to know what
this device was actually like to use and
what taya's quest played like so I
decided to take a look on eBay and see
if one popped up that was a year and a
half ago so far I've seen one go up for
$600 plus some hefty import fees based
on rumblings on other forums one tends
to appear on eBay perhaps even the same
one every year or so while flyers
advertising the halcyon were circulated
in some stores even took pre-orders and
some salesmen were given copies to
demonstrate to potential customers it's
actually up for debate whether the
halcyon was ever officially released
it's possible that this shot contains
every existing Halcyon as far as I can
tell no museums have a halcyon in their
corridors except possibly the video game
History Museum in Frisco Texas if I ever
end up in Texas for some reason like I
don't know my plane crashes I'll head
there and see if they've got it
so the halcyon was a failure it didn't
sell very well in fact it arguably
didn't actually make it to the stores in
a way people could buy and the company
went bankrupt pretty soon after but
that's not the end of tears quest when
the company started to go under they
started selling conversion kits for
Dragon's Lair arcade cabinets it's hard
to tell how well those sold either but
laser disks Marquis instruction manuals
and EEPROM chips from the game are
floating around on eBay so there's
probably at least a few I've heard tell
of the arcade version appearing at
conventions and some other gaming events
still pretty rare though and the laser
discs alone cost hundreds nevermind if
you'd be able to get together the
technology to actually play them wait
what
this taya's quest on cd-rom from Canada
for only nineteen point nine four
Canadian US dollars I mean I had to
didn't I I had to I needed to know and
here we are is in the shot okay great
yeah decades and entire consoles later
on a disc far smaller than it was ever
designed for this disc was printed in
2005 over twenty years after it was
originally made and that means it's
another 12 years old on top of that the
latest system requirements that it
recommends what operating system you can
use is Windows XP can't remember those
days when that was the fastest operating
system this just got even smells of
Windows XP like a very old new car smell
and just the beginning of dust it's
beautiful it's like a time capsule
thanks Canada hey going to this digital
leisure put this out
you might remember them as the people
who did at some PlayStation Home like
casino games that are pretty popular and
then when PlayStation Home clothes I
think they're moving them to steam and
then before wait before that they did
the releases of Dragon's Lair and the
sequel to that and SpaceX didn't they so
it makes sense that they would do this
did they also do Mad Dog McCree and
space pirates space pirates is like a
game only I seem to remember whenever I
bring it up I hope I'm not imagining
that game anyway let's close the loop on
all this and actually give this game a
look shall we
[Music]
in a traditional Fantasyland the bad
wizard man-thing saucer ball has killed
almost all of the elder kings and is
going to take over the world
the last in the elder kings line is the
player character taya Alcon read his
wizard mentor Druce wants him to gather
the five artifacts that form an amulet
called the hand made by another wizard
named quote in order to beat source of
all but the one who will come remains I
am ready
but before Druce will send him on his
quest he gives him a final test that
rhymed that was weird
[Music]
hello I'm not legendary game designer
law and Lanning so I don't know why
you're wasting your time here but hey
while I've got you I recently passed a
hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube
comm and after three months and one
official complaint to YouTube management
my plaque finally arrived to confirm it
anyway it seems to be customary for
youtubers to do some sort of Q&A video
and they hit the certain amount of
subscribers and I love answering
questions I love discussing stuff so I
really felt like I should do one of
those I put out a thing months ago
asking people to provide questions that
they thought would be good for this sort
of thing and I also held back a couple
of questions that I got in curious cat I
thought we were worth answering on video
so we're gonna do that now how old are
you okay I actually um made like little
bits of notes next to some of the
questions that I thought oh I might
forget this one I'm actually recording
it and for some reason in brackets I put
it's 25 here I'm not really sure why I
did that
I must have very low expectations of
myself anyway yeah I'm 25 I've kind of
looked like I was 14 for most of my life
my hairline has always been this far
receded so you can't make fun of it
because I'm comfortable with this I
fully expect to go bald with him the
next three to six months I can't wait to
be honest you know I've never really
cared about my appearance as you can
tell from just the way I dress and look
you can't let yourself care about your
appearance when you look like me it
would destroy me so I've always kind of
just messed with my hair I've always
kind of grown in out super long for no
reason and then shaved it all off just
to see what would happen
usually it's logged rubbish but I've
never really cared one time I dyed my
hair like really really yellowy blonde
for a video that I ended up deciding
wasn't worth making and the time for it
has passed I was a music video starring
me as Miley innopolis it's probably the
most extravagant thing I've ever done
and I dyed my hair for her and it
wouldn't you know it had to grow house
it was like eight months of all for hair
for a piece that I decided to not make
so if you're wondering why my hair was
awful for a long stretch of last year
around this year that was why I actually
made it with two other friends one of
them was the musician who composed a
bunch of it and they were one sort of
helped out on set when we were shooting
it and that guy also had a camcorder and
was filming the whole process including
me dyeing my hair so there's like a good
there's a good to our rubbish
documentary about the the hijinks that
we got up to attempting to make this
thing that I ended up never finishing it
looks may be actually edit that together
for patrons there'll be a fun thing to
do let me know anyway I'm done hijacking
that question to ramble about my hair
now so let's move on what's your
favorite piece of fan fiction of any
kind ever you are specified of any kind
which means I get to take wild leaps so
nice one they're my personal favorite
fan fiction ever is a film that came out
in 2014 called the guest the guest is
really really good by the way you should
watch it it's really good
dan Stephens amazing in it British
people represent that film is very
clearly Chris Evans era Captain America
fan fiction it is very deliberately a
guy on the run from a shield style
organization trying to be a good person
live his own life in a world that he
didn't no longer pursuit him the serial
numbers have been filed off but there is
a very clear shield type organization I
mean it might not actually be at all
there might not have been anyone's plan
whatsoever and I've just read into the
film it wouldn't be the first time but
for me it's just a really good film and
it has enough little things in there
that it qualifies as this kind of
rumination on the kind of super soldier
that Captain America is in the more
recent films and I think that's kind
got him interesting it's also just a
really good film I am now however going
to give my favorite fan fiction that's
an actual fan fiction so that you know I
actually answered the question properly
as for my favorite piece of actual fan
fiction you have to go with my immortal
it's really funny it's definitely a
parody of other fan fictions and the
fights that happen when people
collaborate on them it's definitely a
parody i if you don't agree that's a lie
it's not true I'll see you in hell it's
it's good and it's funny this next one's
a long one great could you recommend
some good social sciences literature for
beginners or other literature that has
influenced you the most I'd love to be
as articulate and good at critical
thinking as you that won't be too hard
many of my acquaintances are
right-leaning and pretty racist sexist
homophobic etc still I feel like I could
easily give them a better perspective if
I only had enough knowledge and good
argumentative skills people have asked
me for reading lists quite often this is
kind of a question that I held back as
emblematic a lot of questions I get if I
were to come up with like a list it
would just be just a lot of books from a
variety of different categories because
quite often something really simple that
isn't really about any particular issue
informs your perspective a lot even
though it's not even covering it so
rather than like just give you a list of
all the books I happen to have read or
pretend that I'm educated enough to know
how to construct a reading list for
someone else I'm just going to give some
general broad strokes sort of
recommendations for how to educate
yourself and then give some actual
recommendations so I think I would first
recommend looking at the basic ideas
that underlie any particular social
science so like psychology sociology the
other humanities you know the rest
whatever you want to call them they
exist for a reason to study a specific
thing and they usually have some kind of
specific goal in mind
so like psychology is the study of human
behavior but also has the kind of goal
of making people more healthy I once
read this little tiny book from years
and years and years ago somebody old
called a psychoanalysis for normal
people and it opened with a statement
that said words to the effect of the
purpose of psycho now
is to make you ready for anything
something like that that to me was was
this sort of I had you know this is why
we do this it's not just our we're
checking to see what would happen if you
lock people up in a fake prison it's
we're trying to learn how we behave in
different contexts so that we can better
understand the context we can create
that enhance human behavior you know can
we educate ourselves out of certain
behaviors that we exhibit
I basically recommend you go to the
source look up the reasoning behind why
a field of study exists like why do
people do psychiatry or psychology or
sociology or any of the other humanities
why what is its purpose what is it
looking at and what are its
methodologies and why is it beneficial
to use them I think a lot of people lack
the sort of base level understanding of
what it does and why that makes the
whole thing makes sense so I don't think
it I'm not sure if I have it anywhere
but when I was in my third year of
university I was doing an English and
film degree so I had lots of free time I
actually just started buying science and
sociology books off of people who were
doing either like masters or were
finishing and were selling their books
and so I could just out of interest read
what they were like and that was kind of
a I guess a flash point for my own
understanding of these concepts was
bothering to just pick up a basic book
on it and read it in fact I'm gonna look
for now carry my carry my portal
recorder with me I keep a bunch of books
back here and I'm pretty sure I'm pretty
sure my old applied i weld applied
psychology book is here somewhere
I literally just like there was a there
was a girl who was just finishing a
master's and she was leaving and she was
selling all of the books that she bought
because they're expensive so people want
to buy them used and ah the set is too
big it's in the way of my library so
they just started selling all the books
and oh yeah I fell it it's next to my a
couple of cthulhu third edition book
what a dental Edition is Ashley
and while some like collected works of
George Orwell this is what I don't have
much of a system for this library ah so
uh this was the book that I this is the
book that I bought just just for the fun
of it one of these I have a couple
others that I've got off different
people and they're just books where
they're basically just a primer on what
the issue is the most interesting part
of the book for me as someone who wasn't
as interest in the social sciences at
the time was the preface the
introduction and the yeah like this is
this was it this is this is that this
was the eye-opening moment one point one
of the introduction what it's applied
psychology like it opens by explaining
what it is and what it's for and why you
would care and that's the most important
part of these books in my opinion is
explaining why it's valuable why you
would use it and the purpose of
approaching things from that perspective
in the first place because that's the
part that in modern discourse people
ignore the most if they oh go
immediately to the to the idea of this
this imagined intent that any
psychologist or or economists who
disagrees with them or any kind of
feminist leaning person in the
humanities clearly has this agenda when
the agenda if anything is spelled out
already and you can read it and they've
clearly ignored that to go now they want
to collectivise everything or whatever
it is that they say nowadays this isn't
you know the one book you have to read
but I would basically recommend picking
up basic primers in any of these fields
and just reading through them this was a
fantastic read I basically just skipped
through it the first time and just
whoever had bought this before me had
done their own markings so I just I just
read those bits and checked it out it's
really informative another book I would
recommend while we're doing like basic
primers that you would do in a
university level is literary theory and
anthology it's in the first book I got
from Eliza University and I'm just going
to go over to my little bookshelf that I
actually just got in so I can have more
stuff
so I have more stuff on this set what
are some good ones I'm not I'm not a
very good educator I can't be like oh
here's all the stuff that you need to
read first before gender trouble makes
sense I don't know I don't know what it
is I didn't understand it until I read
it and then I did so if there's some
magic other step that a smarter person
would tell you to read first I'm sorry I
don't know what it is
conquest of bread it's good it's good
I'm just gonna unequivocally recommend
that you read it it's good yeah I just
have have fun pedagogy depressed is
really good as well
Simone de Beauvoir as the second sex is
really good and it's big but it's worth
reading and it's lots of little chapters
and each of them has something
interesting to say and it's cool the
favorite book of the list of things I've
got right now is an Ourense the origins
of and it's really good because well not
this could actually do not buy this
version half like all like this side of
every page is grayer and harder to read
done by this version but uh I had
another version and again like I just
lost a bunch of my old books but uh this
is really really good and I think it's
that and perhaps some like jejak books
are I would actually recommend any of
his books though are the most
informative to my perspective on how I
approach a lot of issues how I think
about them and they're really good at
getting you to question how how you
approach an issue in the first place
which is the thing I want to stress you
need to go like why am why am we doing
this so like if you want to talk about
these issues as someone who doesn't
understand them then the thing that
they're probably missing first and
foremost is an understanding of why it's
important to approach things from that
perspective or from any perspective in
the first place a lot of people the way
they're currently thinking naturally
occurs to them and they wouldn't even
think to use another approach so I think
the purpose of a lot of this work is to
sort of plunge you into another
perspective and make you think from it a
lot of writing on politics is written to
be seamless to be like oh this goes down
easy
and this all makes sense and it
complements the way I already looked at
the world like all of I was about to say
all of Michael Moore's books but I don't
have a read one of them stupid white man
I think it's called is rubbish because
it's so convenient like it just it goes
down so easy you can actually learn
anything from it you just go ah yes
these people are bad whereas I think a
lot of the books that I've just
recommended I'm like oh this is a way of
looking at things that I didn't have
before and that's like more valuable
almost in a way I have a better
understanding of an appreciation for
left-leaning ideas because I've read so
much for right-wing [ __ ] in my life
every major villain in human history has
written a manifesto about why they're
doing it read that I wish I had a copy
of Mein Kampf it held up and go also
read this because it's informative and
it's it's I think it's important to get
the most accurate understanding of the
perspective that it forms it but I don't
actually have a physical copy with me
right now because the one that I
recently bought had to be returned
because the text went all the way into
the spine
it was incredibly poorly published my
encounter became public domain last year
and it now exists in hundreds if not
thousands of versions and printings that
are rubbish
also by the way if you're in high school
do not ask your high school library to
get you a copy of my camp you will go on
a list I don't know what's scarier in
Minecraft the fact that you can feel
yourself being propaganda is you can
feel yourself being almost convinced of
the thing that he's saying or the part
where you know it's just outright racist
ideology or the bit where there's a
bunch of advice in there for how to act
in modern politics that still works
that's still a hundred percent good
advice for how to be good in politics
like that's scary
in its own way I'd recommend reading it
if you can stomach that sort of thing
was it come a bit rambley and there was
a lot of books in there and they might
not even be the best books to start with
but I hope that helps
Thanks I noticed that you rarely discuss
gender sexuality diversity or other sjw
issues in your non measured response
videos eg Fallout Souls born braids the
closest thing was talking about Irene in
your Sherlock video is this an
intentional choice if so why if not do
you think there's a reason why you keep
that [ __ ] packed up or is this all in my
imagination I don't keep them divided on
purpose I do think that I try and make
everything with the same kind of
perspective in mind I don't like the
idea of there being a break in the kinds
of content I make at the same time I do
think I talked quite a lot about the
ideas and what they might mean for us as
players in games quite often like Dark
Souls 2 I think has something really
interesting to say about its world but
more importantly about our world and how
to live in it how to how do you live in
a world where you might not actually
basically have ever existed because
you'll die it'd be so completely
forgotten that it doesn't even matter
like how do you act in the world where
that can happen I think it asks really
interesting questions I don't like
turning that kind of work into a
manifesto where I go oh no this is what
this means and this is how we have to
live our lives based on Dark Souls 2
telling us you know I could do that but
I have this I guess the term is I guess
I want to avoid being preachy and I
think people are very quick to dismiss
people as preachy if they just don't
like or they have to say but I also want
to avoid being it some of the stuff that
I'm working on right now especially the
Deus Ex Human Revolution video which is
the current long project I'm working on
I always have a long project does deal
quite a lot with social topics and the
points and I guess it'll be my most SJW
game analysis just because it comes up
more because it's a game that prizes
itself so much more on story than
fallout 3 or the souls games do in fact
they pride themselves on not having as
much are you single no sorry do you
think that it's possible to be friends
with people who exhibit alt-right traits
is it possible to overlook such
negative qualities that is a cracking
question it's possible I know people who
are like oh I don't believe any of this
but I can be friends with them that's
fine but they're usually people who
don't have anything to lose from the
views of those people you know if you
want to let's you know take the most
shitty definition of alt-right you know
like they want to build a white earth no
state usually it's easy to be friends
with those people if you're white for me
personally it's not possible to be
friends with people who exhibit really
far-right beliefs either I immediately
start arguing with them and you know
there is no friendship or I sort of
consciously remember some other shitty
things they say and just think less
about wanting to hang out with them
again I have a friend who sort of
shifted further I in the last couple of
years and I just stopped talking to him
like not on purpose I didn't
deliberately blank him or anything I'm
not that sort of person but I just
thought less and less about that person
in my life and that's just kind of how
people are I think I think there are
probably people who have thought less
about hanging out with me because of my
far left beliefs you know that's just
kind of how things work isn't it did you
build your computer yourself or pay to
have one custom built the first computer
I ever had was custom built by this guy
called Jed who I really looked up to and
thought was cool so I was like after
this I'm gonna build my own and then I
bought an iMac and I used that for years
but then I realized that I liked PC
games more than I liked having a
slightly nicer version of Photoshop and
eventually I built a PC that casually
play games and it was great and I've
built my own pcs ever since what's your
advice on long distance relationships
oh [ __ ] you know like in a lot of
relationships where you see the person
every day you can get into this routine
where it just becomes normal to hang
around with that person and that's nice
but I think if you're in a relationship
